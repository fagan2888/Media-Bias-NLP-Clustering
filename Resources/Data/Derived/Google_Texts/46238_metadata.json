The six or seven varieties (one seasonal) are inspired by different global cultures, including Indian, Thai, Mexican, Italian and Israeli.\n\n\u201cVeganism and health is a global issue, not just one for the US,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make an American line; I wanted to make dishes that speak to different cultures.\u201d\n\nAnd whether it\u2019s high blood pressure, lactose intolerance, obesity, a general desire to live a little healthier or eat more responsibly, plant-based meals are playing a more prevalent role in diets worldwide. And this is likely to continue as consumers move toward a more holistic approach to health and wellness, Radzwiller noted.\n\nMaggie Radzwiller\n\n\u201cI think people are getting it,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about all the ways a plant-based diet can help you in place of pharmaceuticals. If you\u2019re overweight, try a plant-based diet, if you have high blood pressure, try a plant-based diet. This is coming to a crescendo in this country, especially with the Affordable Care Act, which is forcing people to figure out who is going to pick up the ticket. I think that\u2019s going to lead a lot of people to a plant-based diet. I\u2019m not saying they will do it universally day in and out. But I think more and more people will choose to eat meat once a week as opposed to every day.\u201d\n\nIf you season something properly, you don\u2019t need to add salt\n\nBecause Radzwiller doesn\u2019t add sodium or oil to the meals, she relies largely on the flavors of hearty, locally sourced vegetables; heady, rich spices and citrus juice to deliver flavor, umami and zing: poblano and arbol chiles in Heirloom Bean and Vegetable Chili, sweet yellow curry and tomatoes in Super Saag, and kale and Berbere spice (a blend of garlic, ginger, fenugreek and dried chilies) in the Israeli-inspired The Green Life.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is if you season something properly you don\u2019t ever have to use salt,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a lousy chef and if you don\u2019t care about health, salt can make everything taste good. It\u2019s right up there with sugar.\u201d\n\nHer first client was Whole Foods Market in the Durham region, and she\u2019s since expanded to 21 Whole Foods locations in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. This summer, she added 25 Wegman\u2019s locations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, along with all three locations of regional specialty foods chain Southern Season.\n\nTo keep up with demand, Radzwiller signed a co-packer in New York. But scaling up by volume has been surprisingly easy from a formulation standpoint, partly because she began with a clean ingredient deck instead of cutting back, as her competitors have done.\n\n\u201cI looked at all the other product lines on the market; everybody in the industry backpedals, whereas I started with a product that\u2019s vegan gluten-free with no oils and no sodium, in a BPA free jar that\u2019s ready in four minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ingenuity of doing clean food in a jar. It\u2019s the easiest thing to scale because it contains the least amount of crap possible.\u201d\n\nUntil it tastes as good in a single-serve pouch, I\u2019m not going to do it\n\nBut the family-size, microwaveable jar does limit the customer base, particularly with a $12 price point and no clear indication on front of pack that one container serves four. Still, on a per-ounce basis the product is just 37 cents compared to her chief competitor Amy\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s 60 cents an ounce, she said.\n\n\u201cMy original clients were families whose meals were suffering because they had kids and no time to feed them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe product is also great to take to work for four lunches, but I have to make that much clearer on the label, which I plan to do on my next printing this fall.\u201d\n\nUntil then, \u201cServes 4\u201d stickers have been added to the jars. Radzwiller also has plans to expand the line to include single-serve pouches, though she has yet to get the flavor and texture just right.\n\n\u201cOnce the product goes into the pouch, it has to undergo a process of going to 220 degrees and up, and that\u2019s how you end up with baby food. Until it tastes the same in single serving pouch, I\u2019m not going to do it. I won\u2019t serve substandard food.\u201d\n\nRadzwiller approaches the company\u2019s growth in much the same way. While she\u2019d eventually like to be in every Whole Foods and every Wegman\u2019s on the planet\u2014not to mention the lofty (pun intended) goal of being the standard vegan option on every transcontinental flight, she knows it will take time.\n\n\u201cWhat this is really about is being respectful of people instead of making them feel like they\u2019re a burden,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means the product has to be perfect. I get a different lead almost every day, but I only want to grow in increments that will allow me to keep the product at 100%.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chef and caterer was motivated by her special diets customers to launch a vegan, gluten-free line of globally inspired meals with no added sodium or oil to provide clean, flavorful meal solutions for everybody.", "copyright": "William Reed Business Media", "author": "FoodNavigator-USA.com", "og": {"site_name": "FoodNavigator-USA.com", "description": "A chef and caterer was motivated by her special diets customers to launch a vegan, gluten-free line of globally inspired meals with no added sodium or oil to provide clean, flavorful meal solutions for everybody.", "title": "Vegan, gluten-free meals founder: I started with clean food; others had to backpedal there", "url": "http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Maggie-s-Conscious-Vegan-Cuisine-founder-interview", "image": "http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-usa.com/manufacturers/maggie-s-conscious-vegan-cuisine-founder-interview/9191733-1-eng-GB/Maggie-s-Conscious-Vegan-Cuisine-founder-interview_medium_vga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "foodnavigator-usa.com", "description": "A chef and caterer was motivated by her special diets customers to launch a vegan, gluten-free line of globally inspired meals with no added sodium or oil to provide clean, flavorful meal solutions for everybody.", "title": "Vegan, gluten-free meals founder: I started with clean food; others had to backpedal there", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "foodnavigator://Manufacturers/Maggie-s-Conscious-Vegan-Cuisine-founder-interview", "googleplay": "foodnavigator://Manufacturers/Maggie-s-Conscious-Vegan-Cuisine-founder-interview"}, "name": {"iphone": "FoodNavigator", "googleplay": "FoodNavigator"}, "id": {"iphone": "id586197444", "googleplay": "com.wrbm.foodnavigator"}}, "site": "@FoodNavigatorUS", "image": {"src": "http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-usa.com/manufacturers/maggie-s-conscious-vegan-cuisine-founder-interview/9191733-1-eng-GB/Maggie-s-Conscious-Vegan-Cuisine-founder-interview_medium_vga.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "CEC8ACB0DB9777352167906B78F1EF96", "fb": {"admins": 100000722238608}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "keywords": "Yeast, food fibers, food science, food additives, sweeteners, starch, food ingredients, food technology, flavors, emulsifier", "verify-v1": "fs1xQK7Y5KcieOxPT0cwk0P3gSBMP+vyhOxVtLyswTk=", "news_keywords": "veganism, vegetarian, gluten-free, microwaveable meals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8ff\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis product line came about by listening more and more about what people really wanted who were willing to speak up for themselves,\u201d Maggie\u2019s Conscious Vegan Cuisine founder Maggie Radzwiller told FoodNavigator-USA.\nI think that\u2019s going to lead a lot of people to a plant-based diet.\n\u201cI looked at all the other product lines on the market; everybody in the industry backpedals, whereas I started with a product that\u2019s vegan gluten-free with no oils and no sodium, in a BPA free jar that\u2019s ready in four minutes,\u201d she said.\nThe six or seven varieties (one seasonal) are inspired by different global cultures, including Indian, Thai, Mexican, Italian and Israeli.\nAnd this is likely to continue as consumers move toward a more holistic approach to health and wellness, Radzwiller noted."}
