Over the years, I\u2019ve caught glimpses of what Orwell had in mind. But it is not until 2016 that I feel I can say his prognosis has come completely true. Thank you, Barack Obama, for that.\n\nYou have brought savoir-faire into the White House that none of your predecessors even came close to.

He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in his first year in office despite the fact that he had enlarged the war in Iraq and extended it in Afghanistan. Now he has brought total war to Syria, where at least a quarter million people have perished. He has orchestrated the subversion of Venezuela, a country that freely gave aid to many of Latin America\u2019s most impoverished people. He has encouraged neo-liberal politicians to overthrow Brazil\u2019s president, supervised a right-wing coup in Honduras, supported a neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine, helped to overthrow the government of Libya and created a failed state there, paid Kenya and Ethiopia to attack Somalia, supplied bombs to Saudi Arabia to use on Yemenis, and built up offensive US weapons on Russia\u2019s borders. In Asia, his \u201cpivot\u201d has reasserted Japan\u2019s importance\u2014a nation that has never apologized for its role in World War II (not least for its kidnapping of more than 100,000 women whom it turned into sex slaves for its military). He pressured South Korea to draw closer to Japan and threatens China with drive-by aircraft carriers and provocative fly-overs.\n\nAt home, his bailout of Wall Street and big banks ranks as one of the greatest government supports for big business in history.\n\nYet despite all this, the media bombard us with news of his treaty with Iran and enactment of \u201cObamacare.\u201d No one comments on the fact that the only \u201cunfriendly\u201d nations to escape his bombardment\u2014North Korea and Iran\u2014are precisely those which remain armed to the teeth, that Obamacare is a pale imitation of his promised quality healthcare for all.\n\nIn my lifetime, I have seen feminism turned into opposite: from a set of beliefs that promised women wouldn\u2019t rule \u2013 \u2013 couldn\u2019t rule \u2013 \u2013 with the violence and brutality of men into the notion that women should play the same combat roles as men, that women should be just as tough in the corporate boardroom and rule with more efficiency and less sentimentality in a system of worldwide immiseration and alienation.\n\nWith Barack Obama in the White House, the promise of peace that was essential to the African-American movement, of MLK\u2019s dream, which named the US the \u201cmain purveyor of violence in the world\u201d and advocated a world without war, serves to legitimate this country\u2019s wars and unending violence. Obama explicitly said he targeted a children\u2019s birthday party for a drone attack in which several were massacred. Given the example set by the man at the top, is it any wonder that American cities are once again sites for daily police shootings of children\u2014and of people murdering each other in record numbers?\n\nNonetheless, in this upside-down world, Obama is seen as a man of peace, while the Black Panthers are remembered as violent\u2014even though they explicitly called for a world without standing armies, a world in which the United States would pay reparations to the rest of the world for centuries of genocidal wars and imperialist exploitation.\n\nSo thank you, Barack Obama, for showing us all that peace is war. Only you could have used Martin Luther King\u2019s mantle to cover the actions of a war criminal.
