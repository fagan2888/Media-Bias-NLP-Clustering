Co-ops (consumer-operated and -oriented-plans), a substitute for the jettisoned public option provision in the Affordable Care Act, were supposed to foster competition and keep premiums down, especially in states like Iowa with few for-profit carriers. The failure of CoOportunity \u201cshould prompt us in the press to refocus on the question of competition in the insurance marketplace,\u201d I wrote\u2014a topic more relevant than ever in the wake of two major health insurance mergers this summer.\n\nIn the six-plus months since CoOportunity went under, I have not seen coverage of the sort I called for. It was a busy spring, to be sure, for reporters on the healthcare beat, between Medicaid expansion and King v. Burwell, the Supreme Court case that upheld Obamacare subsidies\u2014both of which affect many millions of people to the million or so co-op policyholders countrywide. Still, the question of \u201cwhat\u2019s the story\u201d in the 22 remaining co-op states merits attention and reporters could have used one of several news pegs (or even red flags) dating from January on as a way into it: the January decision by Tennessee\u2019s co-op to freeze enrollment for this year as a preventive measure to support long-term viability; a January report by the insurance rating company A.M. Best headlined, \u201cLosses Persist at Majority of Health Co-ops;\u201d a similar Standard & Poor\u2019s report in February titled, \u201cOther U.S. Health Insurance Co-Ops Could Be Going Down the Same Bumpy Road As Iowa\u2019s CoOportunity Health;\u201d the decision of the Louisiana co-op a few weeks ago to cease operations next January; and, last week\u2019s report from the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services detailing how enrollment and profitability at most co-ops was lower (in some cases, much lower) than projected for 2014\u2014Maine\u2019s co-op was the only one in the black last year. None of these various news hooks sparked more than a passing interest from the press.\n\n\n\nLast week\u2019s IG report raised serious questions about the financial viability of several co-ops, noting that most of them had not met their initial program enrollment and profitability projections at the end of last year, and 21 suffered net losses. Such losses as well as low enrollments in several carriers \u201cmight limit the ability of some co-ops to repay startup and solvency loans and to remain viable and sustainable,\u201d the IG warned. In particular, it reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had recently placed four co-ops on \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d or corrective action plans and had issued low enrollment warning notices to two co-ops. The IG did not name the six co-ops put on notice and CMS has not responded to my request for the names of those six co-ops. A CMS spokesman recently told The Daily Caller to file a Freedom of Information request for the names. Shouldn\u2019t customers of those potentially troubled co-ops\u2014and possible future customers\u2014have full disclosure before they choose next year\u2019s policies? Reporters need to get on the case.\n\nThe Associated Press reported some of the IG\u2019s findings, but its story\u2014picked up here and there around the country\u2014was basically perfunctory reporting about a government study. The AP did note, however, that as recently as this spring, the White House \u201ctouted co-ops as an accomplishment,\u201d competing effectively and attracting \u201csignificant enrollment\u201d while the IG\u2019s report \u201cpaints a very different picture.\u201d\n\nIn most of the states where the IG reported the largest net losses at the end of last year\u2014Kentucky, Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut (all of which received solvency loans)\u2014reporting on the co-ops and their potential problems has been, as far as I\u2019ve seen, nearly non-existent. In Wisconsin, for example, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel seems to have missed the two solvency loans the state\u2019s co-op got at the end of last year totaling more than $51 million. In February, though, Journal Sentinel readers learned\u2014in a piece about overall ACA sign-ups\u2014that the the co-op was pleased with its enrollment. Last week, the Journal Sentinel missed a chance to tailor for Wisconsin readers the AP story on the troubling IG report and look more closely at what was happening locally. Coverage has been similarly scant in the other states where co-ops topped the IG\u2019s table of net losses\u2014Kentucky, New York, and Connecticut, which also got solvency loans in late 2014 of $65 million, $90 million, and $48 million respectively.\n\nInterestingly, while Connecticut fell well short (20%) of its projected 2014 enrollment, New York, Wisconsin and Kentucky well-exceeded their enrollment projections\u2014New York got five times more customers than it expected\u2014but, as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff explains here, these co-ops paid out more in claims than they took in as premium revenue. Hence: net losses. What does that mean for the people\u2014 more people than anticipated in states like New York, Kentucky and Wisconsin\u2014who chose these carriers or may be thinking about buying these plans during open enrollment this fall? This is a question reporters should be seeking to answer.\n\n\n\nThe rate announcements still coming from several states in coming weeks offer an opening for reporters to revisit the co-op story. Whether the co-ops\u2019 rates are high or low compared to the rest of the pack offers some clues about their market share and perhaps even finances. State regulators last week gave New York\u2019s Health Republic co-op an average rate increase of more than 14 percent, close to what it requested and the largest increase the state granted. Is that because Health Republic really needed it? Reporters should be asking. In July, Connecticut\u2019s HealthyCT co-op dropped its requested rate increase from 14 percent on average to 3.4 perent, citing new cost control efforts. Such a large reduction was another signal to ask more questions\u2014such as, is low-enrollment threatening their future?\n\nSome important background for reporters: The mechanics of insurance solvency and pricing are tricky business, but co-ops have the unique challenge of being start-ups and having to attract enough customers to scale up their business. If they price policies too low, they\u2019re likely to attract a lot of sick people looking for cheap coverage for expensive illnesses. If they price policies too high, customers will flock to the competition. Either way it could spell trouble. While all carriers face this dilemma, it\u2019s especially hard for the co-ops which, unlike big insurers, don\u2019t have other lines of business to cover large losses if they\u2019ve priced incorrectly.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to write off the co-ops as failures. The recent dire-sounding IG report covered 2014\u2014year one for the co-ops\u2014and some may see a turn for the better in 2015. Indeed, Wayne Kaminski, a senior financial analyst at A.M Best, told me that \u201cenrollment has improved in the states with low enrollment.\u201d Reporters: find out. (I\u2019ve been in touch with one reporter in Louisiana who is on the case now down there). Readers deserve to know \u201cwhat\u2019s the story\u201d with their state\u2019s co-op option before they shop during open enrollment in November. The ticket to useful reporting boils down to talking a range of experts (not just the co-op officials), reading financial reports including the quarterly filings co-ops submit to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and, as it always does, connecting lots of dots.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 20: A few local stories on insurance co-ops are worth noting as examples: Two recent pieces by Rebecca Catalanello for Nola.com/The Times-Picayune, about a failed co-op in Louisiana, and an article earlier this month by Melissa Patrick for Kentucky Health News, about operating losses for a co-op there.\n\nLove news about local news?
