Curtis said Johnson knew his job carried risks, which is why he asked her to look after his wife and children. But he\u2019d already made it out of one war alive. So no one ever imagined he\u2019d be killed during a humanitarian aid mission.\n\nEarlier this year, Johnson had been deployed to Nepal in the wake of two deadly and destructive earthquakes. The military helped deliver disaster aid to some rural communities.\n\n\u201cWhen he went to Afghanistan, I was always glued to the TV,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cWhen he said he was going to Nepal to help, I said, \u2018That\u2019s my boy. That\u2019s Mark.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe UH-1Y helicopter Johnson was aboard went missing May 12 and was found a few days later eight miles north of Charikot, Nepal. Johnson was killed along with five others from the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron and two Nepalese soldiers who were also onboard.\n\nHelping hands\n\nThe outpouring of support and messages following Johnson\u2019s death has provided Curtis strength in her sorrow. As Johnson\u2019s casket was transported from Savannah to the memorial site in Beaufort, crowds lined the streets and saluted the fallen soldier.\n\n\u201cThat was overwhelming for us,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cThere were firetrucks and flags. It was beautiful.\u201d\n\nSupport continued to pour in through messages and well wishes. Then, recently Curtis received a call from WCIV-TV anchor Dean Stephens. He had interviewed Johnson\u2019s family following the death. He told Curtis he\u2019d been contacted by Gansrow, of Pro Performance, who had seen the story on the news and decided this was the family he wanted to honor with this year\u2019s benefit tournament and banquet.\n\nWhat Curtis didn\u2019t know was Gansrow shared something in common with her son; they both were willing to make sacrifices in the line of duty.\n\nA larger purpose\n\nFor Gansrow, the date of this year\u2019s benefit, Sept. 11, has a deep meaning. The now 45-year-old was a law enforcement officer in New York City the day the Twin Towers were hit and he was a first responder at ground zero.\n\nGansrow\u2019s first partner as a police officer and business partner at the time also was on the ground. Gansrow said he watched his partner run in and out of one of the towers getting people out to safety.\n\n\u201cThe next time he went into the building, the building collapsed,\u201d he said.\n\nGansrow lost his partner and friend that day. Years later, the terrorist attack would continue to haunt him, as he was diagnosed with cancer as a result of his work at ground zero, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I was really sick, we were having financial problems, burning through money. I had to sell my business,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in pretty bad shape.\u201d\n\nHis coworkers in the law enforcement field held a benefit in Gansrow\u2019s honor and he said it turned his life around.\n\n\u201cThat really helped my family. You kind of felt the love at a time of great need. I was pretty sick at the time, but you don\u2019t forget that feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lives changed so much for the better. I would not be here for those things not happening and I knew I was going to have to pay it forward. \u201c\n\nSo when Josh McLaughlin, a trainer at Pro Performance, suggested to Gansrow they start a benefit for Wounded Warriors, a tradition was born.\n\nHowever, Gansrow said he wanted to take it a step further. He wanted to make sure they were helping someone in their own community, either a wounded warrior or the family of a soldier that had been killed.\n\nThey started the benefit, Step Up to the Plate Charity Tournament, last year for a local Marine Corps soldier who had been injured by shrapnel. The weight of what it meant was realized during a special moment when spectators and participants lined the softball field\u2019s sidewalks carrying American flags to welcome the wounded soldier and his family.\n\n\u201cWe are walking behind the soldier and his little boy looks at his dad and said, \u2018Is my daddy a hero?\u2019 As soon as he said it, I could feel my lip quiver and I was about to be in tears,\u201d said Gansrow. \u201cHe looked at his dad and very loudly said, \u2018My daddy saved the world.\u2019 From that point forward, I said we got this right.\u201d\n\nGansrow and his crew plan to line the sidewalk during every year\u2019s tournament so \u201cthat the families that go through this horror can feel this love,\u201d he said.\n\nPromises kept\n\nCurtis said she has no words to describe what it means to her for Pro Performance to hold this benefit in her son\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cI think what they are doing is a great cause, not just for my son, but for future families,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should be supportive of our military.\u201d\n\nDespite the utter heartache caused by Johnson\u2019s death, Curtis finds some solace in knowing her son died with a purpose.\n\n\u201cI know that he was doing what he loved,\u201d she said.\n\nCurtis, who moved from Utah to Goose Creek to be nearer to her daughter-in-law, Haley Lynn Vaughters Johnson, and her two grandsons, Nate and Noah. She also feels a greater sense of purpose after her son\u2019s death. It\u2019s one bestowed upon her by her son\u2019s wishes to watch over his family, and it\u2019s a promise she intends to keep.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Community rallies behind family of fallen local Marine, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values, Charikot, Nepal,Dean Stephens,Eva Curtis ,Josh McLaughlin,Marine Corps soldier,Mark Johnson,Nepal,Pro Performance Athletics,Sept. 11 memorial,Step Up to the Plate Charity Tournament,Tim Gansrow", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Mark Johnson IV often ended his conversations with his mother through text message or email with the same request: to take care of his wife and children if anything should ever happen.", "title": "Community rallies behind family of fallen local Marine", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150905/150909640/community-rallies-behind-family-of-fallen-local-marine", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC1204/150909640/AR/0/AR-150909640.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC1204/150909640/AR/0/AR-150909640.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mark Johnson IV often ended his conversations with his mother through text message or email with the same request: to take care of his wife and children if anything should ever happen.", "title": "Community rallies behind family of fallen local Marine", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC1204/150909640/AR/0/AR-150909640.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150909640}}, "keywords": "Community rallies behind family of fallen local Marine , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values, Charikot, Nepal,Dean Stephens,Eva Curtis ,Josh McLaughlin,Marine Corps soldier,Mark Johnson,Nepal,Pro Performance Athletics,Sept. 11 memorial,Step Up to the Plate Charity Tournament,Tim Gansrow", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T16:22:00Z", "author": "Natalie Caula Hauff"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mark Johnson IV often ended his conversations with his mother through text message or email with the same request: to take care of his wife and children if anything should ever happen."}, "article_summary": "If you go What: Step Up to the Plate Charity Tournament: When: Banquet, 7 p.m. Friday; softball tournament, starting at 8 a.m. Sept. 12-13.\nThe death of the 29-year-old Marine Corps soldier, who grew up in Goose Creek, came as a shock to his family.\nTickets: Can be purchased to watch the softball tournament and to attend the banquet.\nThey started the benefit, Step Up to the Plate Charity Tournament, last year for a local Marine Corps soldier who had been injured by shrapnel.\nCurtis said Johnson knew his job carried risks, which is why he asked her to look after his wife and children."}
