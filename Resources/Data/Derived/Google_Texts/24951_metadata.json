Bernie Sanders was a fan of The Doors, the iconic rock group famous for \u201cLight My Fire\u201d and other anthems for the young and restless of the 1960s, and many who followed. John Densmore, who was drummer for The Doors from 1965-1973, is a fan of Mr. Sanders. On Wednesday, Mr. Densmore hosted a campaign fundraiser for the candidate in Los Angeles, centered around the first public screening of the independent film \u201cWindow of Opportunity,\u201d which follows the weekend high jinks of corporate fat cats and their deadly financial misdeeds, this according to advance production notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dark, suspenseful and comic, and addresses a theme that I\u2019ve been worried about for a while: corporate greed. You couldn\u2019t get more aligned with the themes of this film than Bernie Sanders\u2018 platforms,\u201d says a very articulate and engaged Mr. Densmore, who is also the film\u2019s producer. \u201cSo we\u2019ve decided to make the first public screening of the film a fundraiser for Bernie 2016, and make a statement against the corporate greed that\u2019s been tearing apart our country.\u201d\n\nAnd there you go \u2014 a cultural moment of some sort. Interesting to note that Mr. Sanders once recorded his own album of classic folk songs when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont \u2014 titled \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the fundraiser was staged at Graumann\u2019s Egyptian Theater; all proceeds go to the Sanders campaign. \u201cBernie does not endorse all opinions expressed in the film,\u201d the production team notes in a disclaimer. And for those wondering, Mr. Densmore has written a best-selling autobiography titled \u201cRiders on the Storm\u201d and \u201cwritten, acted in and made music\u201d for theater and broadcast. And there\u2019s more to come, he says.\n\nGRETA\u2019S POLL: IS TRUMP POLITICALLY CORRECT?\n\nFox News prime-time host Greta Van Susteren has an ongoing, online poll that reveals much about the persistent appeal of a certain Republican front-runner. \u201cIs Donald Trump politically correct?\u201d the survey asks.\n\nAnd the results, as of late Monday: 83 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement \u201cHe is not politically correct and I am glad he is not.\u201d Another 10 percent agreed, \u201cYou are joking, right? Of course he is not and it is bad that he is not,\u201d while 6 percent said, yes, Mr. Trump is politically correct.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cTrumpophrenic\u201d\n\n\u2014 New term coined by PJ Media founder Roger L. Simon to identify those who have conflicting feelings about Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI am a Trumpophrenic. Some of the time I really like the guy \u2014 especially when he mocks the asinine political correctness that has infected every inch of our nation from the mountaintops to the ships at sea. I\u2019m also with him in a big way when he talks about reviving America and making her great again,\u201d Mr. Simon explains.\n\nOther times, when he acts like a kindergartner throwing mud pies at classmates, I want to bang my forehead on the desk until he goes away or at least retires permanently to one of his golf clubs,\u201d he adds.\n\nLINDSEY\u2019S QUESTION\n\n\u201cHow am I losing to these people?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, pondering his competition in the Republican presidential race, to MSNBC.\n\nBREITBART GETS SIRIUS\n\nDebuting in six days: Breitbart News Daily, a morning conservative news and commentary talk show on SiriusXM. Things get underway at 6 a.m. Monday hosted by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, who already anchor a weekend version of the show on Sirius XM\u2019s Patriot Channel 125.\n\nTHE YOUTUBE FACTOR\n\nVideo clips, voter outreach, PSAs \u2014 they can have much impact when showcased on YouTube. Yes, there are emerging numbers according to ZEFR, a California-based research group that tracks the buzz of online video sources. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has an average 19 million YouTube viewers a week, while Democrats Sen. Bernie Sanders draws 14 million and Hillary Clinton 7 million.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky, though; some of those viewers were watching negative rather than positive content about the candidates. There are also some surprises.\n\n\u201cCarly Fiorina has gained momentum in views since tracking began and continues to be one of the top candidates in view growth each week. Since tracking began, Fiorina\u2019s views have grown 35 percent to 21 million viewers total,\u201d the group notes.\n\nSTILL SOUR ON OBAMACARE\n\nObamacare is still on the list of public vexations, a full five years after the health care program sprang to life, promoted with public outreach that included \u201cPajama Boy\u201d and attractive models wandering city streets clad only in their underwear, bearing signs that read \u201cGet covered.\u201d Yes, well. Here are the current numbers:\n\n\u201cOne of the central tenets of the new national health care law is that every American must have health insurance, but support for that requirement has fallen to its lowest level in Rasmussen Reports\u2019 polling to date,\u201d the pollster of the same name reports.\n\n\u201cOur latest national telephone survey finds that just 32 percent of likely U.S. voters believe the government should require every American to buy or obtain health insurance. Most voters \u2014 56 percent \u2014 continue to oppose Obamacare\u2019s insurance requirement, but this is the highest level of opposition in nearly two years.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 64 percent of Republicans say the more they hear about Ben Carson, the more they like him.\n\n\u2022 52 percent say the more they hear about Sen. Marco Rubio, the more they like him.\n\n\u2022 47 percent say the more they hear about Donald Trump, the more they like him.\n\n\u2022 47 percent say the more they hear about Carly Fiorina, the more they like her.\n\n\u2022 41 percent say the more they hear about Jeb Bush, the more they like him.\n\n\u2022 41 percent say the more they hear about Sen. Ted Cruz, the more they like him.\n\nSource: A Washington Post/ABC News poll of 1,001 U.S. adults; the sample included 423 Republicans.\n\n\u2022 Handwringing and finger-pointing to jharper@washingtontimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The chances are good that Democratic hopeful Sen.
