PLF\u2019s case is based on the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause (Article I, Section 7, Clause 1): \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nSince the Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) that the law\u2019s individual mandate is a \u201ctax\u201d and not a penalty, PLF argues, it ought to have originated in the House and not the Senate, and is therefore unconstitutional.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPLF \u2018s challenge lost at the (newly-packed) D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year, and on Friday the court denied a request for a rehearing. In response, PLF says, it is appealing directly to the U.S. Supreme Court: \u201cWe knew going in that this case would ultimately end up on the Supreme Court\u2019s doorstep, and now it\u2019s time,\u201d said PLF\u2019s Timothy Sandefeur, writing on the organization\u2019s blog.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Supreme Court will actually take up the case; the vast majority of appeals are denied certiorari, or \u201ccert,\u201d by the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nFour judges dissented from the D.C. Circuit\u2019s denial of an en banc hearing by the full court. In the dissenting opinion, Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed with PLF that Obamacare should fall under the Origination Clause, contrary to the court\u2019s holding.\n\nHowever, he also said that he believed Obamacare complied with that clause, because \u201cthe original House bill was amended and its\n\nlanguage replaced in the Senate.\u201d Then-Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) amended an unrelated House bill to move Obamacare.\n\nThe case, Sissel v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has been closely watched by Constitution buffs, but many think it is unlikely to succeed even if it does receive the four votes from Supreme Court Justices needed to grant certiorari. Obamacare has survived two other constitutional challenges, thanks to activist re-writing and interpretation by Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues.\n\nThe Roberts court has apparently determined that it will not overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic law, regardless of the reason.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare has survived at the Supreme Court, but now faces a third challenge brought by the California-based Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF).", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obamacare has survived at the Supreme Court, but now faces a third challenge brought by the California-based Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF).", "title": "Obamacare: California Group to Supreme Court--Again", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3599, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-Mladen-Antonov-AFP-Getty.jpg", "height": 2699}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/09/california-group-takes-new-obamacare-challenge-to-supreme-court/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare has survived at the Supreme Court, but now faces a third challenge brought by the California-based Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF).", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-Mladen-Antonov-AFP-Getty.jpg", "title": "Obamacare: California Group to Supreme Court--Again", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Harry Reid, house bill, John Roberts, obamacare case, origination clause, Pacific Legal Foundation, Supreme Court, tax not penalty,Big Government, Breitbart California, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-09T07:26:40-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "tax not penalty", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca37f\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare has survived two other constitutional challenges, thanks to activist re-writing and interpretation by Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues.\nIt is unclear whether the Supreme Court will actually take up the case; the vast majority of appeals are denied certiorari, or \u201ccert,\u201d by the nation\u2019s highest court.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERObamacare has survived twice at the Supreme Court, but it may now face a third challenge brought by the California-based Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF).\nIn the dissenting opinion, Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed with PLF that Obamacare should fall under the Origination Clause, contrary to the court\u2019s holding.\nThe Roberts court has apparently determined that it will not overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic law, regardless of the reason."}
