He instead took issue with the part of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that guts the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which required certain \u201cnaughty\u201d states to get permission from the Justice Department before making changes in voting laws.\n\nAlso read: Washington Post Op-Ed Writer Richard Cohen Slammed for \u2018Racist\u2019 Column (Updated)\n\n\u201cWhy? Well, because in the past, these states had been naughty, and had prevented minorities from voting with little tricks like poll taxes and literacy tests,\u201d Maher said. \u201cBut the conservatives on the court \u2014 all excited from being born yesterday \u2014 said racism had been cured, and that laws against voter suppression were unnecessary, relics of a bygone era like cassette tapes or moderate Republicans.\u201d\n\nRacism, Maher opined, is still alive and well in the U.S., yet the Roberts refuses to recognize it.\n\n\u201cJustice Roberts actually asked, with a straight face and a cocked head, \u2018Is it the government\u2019s submission that the citizens of the South are more racist than the citizens of the North?'\u201d Maher reminded his viewers. \u201cWell, for example, in the last election 66 percent of whites in Vermont voted for our black president. 10 percent of whites in Mississippi did. So maybe a tad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Greg Gilman", "description": "The outspoken \"Real Time\" host made the comparison during a takedown of the Supreme Court's Citizen's United, Voting Rights Act Rulings", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "The outspoken \"Real Time\" host made the comparison during a takedown of the Supreme Court's Citizen's United, Voting Rights Act Rulings", "title": "Bill Maher: Justice Roberts Is Like Jeremy Renner's 'Hurt Locker' Character Except He 'Always Cuts the Wrong Wire' (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:09:58+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/bill-maher-blasts-supreme-court-citizens-united-voting-rights-act-rulings-video/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The outspoken &#8220;Real Time&#8221; host made the comparison during a takedown of the Supreme Court&#8217;s Citizen&#8217;s United, Voting Rights Act Rulings", "creator": "@GregAtTheWrap", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/bill-maher-blasts-supreme-court-citizens-united-voting-rights-act-rulings-video/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Bill Maher: Justice Roberts Is Like Jeremy Renner\u2019s \u2018Hurt Locker\u2019 Character Except He \u2018Always Cuts the Wrong Wire\u2019 (Video)", "site": "@thewrap", "player": {"width": 640, "identifier": "//www.youtube.com/embed/DxVMKrnRJrc", "height": 400}, "card": "player"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-16T21:11:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Bill Maher: Justice Roberts Is Like Jeremy Renner\u2019s \u2018Hurt Locker\u2019 Character Except He \u2018Always Cuts the Wrong Wire\u2019 (Video)", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "jeremy renner", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2013-11-16T13:11:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/GregMFnGilman", "section": "TV", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:09:58+00:00", "tag": "jeremy renner"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Maher: Justice Roberts Is Like Jeremy Renner\u2019s \u2018Hurt Locker\u2019 Character Except He \u2018Always Cuts the Wrong Wire\u2019 (Video)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/bill-maher-blasts-supreme-court-citizens-united-voting-rights-act-rulings-video\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/11\\/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"182114\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-16T21:11:00Z\",\"section\":\"TV\",\"author\":\"Greg Gilman\",\"tags\":[\"jeremy renner\"]}", "sailthru.category": "videos,tv", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_Maher_Chief_Justice_John_Roberts.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "He instead took issue with the part of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that guts the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which required certain \u201cnaughty\u201d states to get permission from the Justice Department before making changes in voting laws.\n\u201cWell, for example, in the last election 66 percent of whites in Vermont voted for our black president.\n\u201cJustice Roberts actually asked, with a straight face and a cocked head, \u2018Is it the government\u2019s submission that the citizens of the South are more racist than the citizens of the North?\nAnd Maher wasn\u2019t talking about Barack Obama\u2019s broken health care insurance promise.\nWell, because in the past, these states had been naughty, and had prevented minorities from voting with little tricks like poll taxes and literacy tests,\u201d Maher said."}
