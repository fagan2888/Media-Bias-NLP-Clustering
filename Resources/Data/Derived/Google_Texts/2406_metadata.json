That\u2019s painfully clear from what critics publish almost weekly on self-styled left-wing and progressive websites. How refreshing it would be for someone to set forth the strongest case for libertarianism before attempting to eviscerate it. Is the failure to do so a sign of fear that the philosophy is potentially appealing to a great many people?\n\nThe latest cheap shot is David Masciotra\u2019s piece at Alternet, '\"You\u2019re Not The Boss of Me!' Why Libertarianism Is a Childish Sham.\" As the title indicates, the upshot of the piece is that only a child would wish not to be subject to the arbitrary will of others. Thus Masciotra has disguised a brief for authoritarianism as a plea for communitarianism.\n\nReading the article, I find it hard to believe that Masciotra consulted anything more than an essay or two by a high-school senior or perhaps a college freshman with no grasp whatsoever of the long, rich liberal tradition from which the modern libertarian philosophy is derived. In other words, our author makes no attempt to take on the strongest case for libertarianism. Instead, he does what so many of his allies do: take the easy way out, counting on his readers\u2019 confirmation bias to immunize him against skepticism. Masciotra quotes not one libertarian, though he gets in is the obligatory slam at the standard caricature of Ayn Rand\u2014\"the rebel queen of their icy kingdom, villifying [sic] empathy and solidarity\"\u2014as though she were the first and last word on libertarianism. He seems unaware that substantial libertarian critiques of Rand abound, not to mention that Rand\u2019s thought is more complex than he indicates. (And no, Mr. Masciotra, Scott Walker and Gordon Gekko are not libertarians; their views have no relevance to this political philosophy.)\n\nSo what does Masciotra have to say? Let\u2019s sample his \"critique\":\n\nLibertarians believe they are real rebels, because they\u2019ve politicized the protest of children who scream through tears, \"You\u2019re not the boss of me.\" The rejection of all rules and regulations, and the belief that everyone should have the ability to do whatever they want, is not rebellion or dissent. It is infantile na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nThis is a typical misrepresentation: libertarians reject all rules and regulations; they demand the freedom to do \"whatever they want.\" I wonder if Masciotra\u2019s failure to qualify \"rules and regulations\" with the word government is an innocent oversight. Or is he trying to sneak something by his uninitiated readers? Obviously, libertarians believe that each person\u2019s life, liberty, and justly acquired property should be respected as essentially inviolable. (Emergencies may create exceptions with respect to property.) Libertarians also advocate freedom of contract. All of that amounts to a web of rules and regulations that constrain the individual\u2019s conduct. When libertarians say the equivalent of \"You\u2019re not the boss of me,\" they are saying that no one may properly threaten or use physical force to compel them do anything they have a demonstrable right to not do or compel them not to do anything that they have a demonstrable right to do.\n\nOpposition to any conception of the public interest and common good, and the consistent rejection of any opportunity to organize communities in the interest of solidarity, is not only a vicious form of anti-politics, it is affirmation of America\u2019s most dominant and harmful dogmas.\n\nIf Masciotra had bothered to explore the multidisciplinary libertarian literature, he would have quickly learned how ridiculous this is. He seems ignorant of such luminaries in the history of (classical) liberalism as Adam Smith, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, Thomas Hodgskin, Carl Menger, Herbert Spencer, Benjamin R. Tucker, Ludwig von Mises, and F. A. Hayek\u2014not to mention contemporary left-libertarians such as Gary Chartier, Roderick Long, Kevin Carson, and Charles Johnson\u2014because to read these thinkers is to realize that for serious liberals and libertarians, community and solidarity are indispensable to human flourishing. To conflate methodological and ethical individualism (specifically, eudaimonism) with atomistic individualism is to confess an unfamiliarity with the libertarianism. (For details, see my \"Tackling Straw Men Is Easier than Critiquing Libertarianism.\")\n\nRadical libertarianism, especially its left-market-anarchist variety, is not anti-politics, broadly speaking. As Long writes in \"Market Anarchism as Constitutionalism\" (PDF):\n\nAnarchy thus represents the extension, not the negation, of constitutionalism. Instead of thinking of anarchy as a situation in which government has been squeezed down to nothingness, it might be more helpful\u2014at least for minarchists\u2014to think of anarchy as a situation in which government has been extended to include everybody. This is what Gustave de Molinari, the founder of market anarchism, meant when he wrote, in 1884: \"The future thus belongs neither to the absorption of society by the State, as the communists and collectivists suppose, nor to the suppression of the State, as the [non-market] anarchists and nihilists dream, but to the diffusion of the State within society.\" ...anarchy is the completion, not the negation, of the rule of law. Anarchy \"comes not to destroy but to fulfil the law.\"\n\nLibertarians favor an environment in which the widest variety of communities may freely be organized\u2014but they believe that only voluntary communities are legitimate communities.\n\nBack to Masciotra:\n\nThe disasters of reducing life, the governance of affairs, and the distribution of resources to such a shallow standard [viz., \"how much money will it bring in?\"] leaves wreckage where among the debris one can find human bodies.\n\nI and the libertarians I know would agree. It\u2019s another gross caricature to hold that libertarians reduce all of life to money. Certainly the libertarians influenced by the Austrian school of economics would laugh at this notion. Money is desired only because it facilitates the achievement of one\u2019s objectives in life under conditions of scarcity, objectives that are necessarily embedded in social existence. That is, money is not an end but a means. It makes mutually beneficial exchange easier that it would be, and exchange is an important and desirable form of social cooperation.\n\nMoreover, libertarians, and anyone else who appreciates how markets unimpeded by privilege work, understand that profit is a sign that producers have transformed scarce resources from a less useful form to a more useful form in the eyes of consumers. In other words, in freed markets, money returns signify and reward services rendered to others. (See my \"Bastiat on the Socialization of Wealth\" and \"Monopoly and Aggression.\") To the extent this is not true, we find corporatist privileges dispensed by the state.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Is the failure of critics to argue against actual libertarian philosophy a sign of fear that people might just agree?", "title": "Another Would-Be Critic of Libertarianism Takes on a Straw Man", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/15/another-left-wing-libertarian-straw-man", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262603025698.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262603025698.jpg", "title": "Another Would-Be Critic of Libertarianism Takes on a Straw Man", "description": "Is the failure of critics to argue against actual libertarian philosophy a sign of fear that people might just agree?", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-15T04:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/sheldon-richman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "How refreshing it would be for someone to set forth the strongest case for libertarianism before attempting to eviscerate it.\nThis is a typical misrepresentation: libertarians reject all rules and regulations; they demand the freedom to do \"whatever they want.\"\nIn other words, our author makes no attempt to take on the strongest case for libertarianism.\nI wonder if Masciotra\u2019s failure to qualify \"rules and regulations\" with the word government is an innocent oversight.\nTo conflate methodological and ethical individualism (specifically, eudaimonism) with atomistic individualism is to confess an unfamiliarity with the libertarianism."}
