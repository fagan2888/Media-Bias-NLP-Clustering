( Trevor Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nLarimer County Sheriff's Office investigators have arrested one man following a shooting Saturday afternoon just outside city limits, northeast of Loveland, that left a man dead.\n\nHowever, the shooting is not linked to three random shootings in Northern Colorado in the past weeks, including a shooting death Wednesday night in downtown Loveland, according to Lt. Andy Josey.\n\nThe shooting was reported at 5:15 p.m. in the 5600 block of Thomas Court, just south of 57th Street.\n\nPolice at the scene said there was no further threat to the public in this incident, which forced the closure of roads in and out of the neighborhood, just east of the Lago Vista Mobile Home Park.\n\nThey have not released the names or ages of the two men involved in the incident.\n\nA Larimer County Sheriff's deputy stands guard Saturday at a crime scene after a man was killed at 57th and Thomas Court.
