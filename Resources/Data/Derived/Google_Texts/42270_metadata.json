About 3,500 activists attended the meeting that was headlined by Cruz, but featured speeches by Sarah Palin and Dr. Ben Carson, as well.\n\nDuring much of Cruz\u2019s speech, he sounded like a presidential candidate tightening up his stump speech. \u201cEducation is too important to be dictated by bureaucrats in Washington,\u201d said Cruz, calling for the end of the Common Core federal education standards. \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cwe already have a \u2018common core\u2019 in this country: It's called the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nAnother unconstitutional act was also put on Cruz\u2019s kill list. \u201cThe most important regulatory reform we ought to pursue, is we need to repeal every single word of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nIn calling for repeal of the healthcare act, Cruz blasted the provisions infringing on the right of Americans to freely exercise their religion. The president\u2019s pet legislation purports to force companies to provide contraceptive services regardless of religious proscriptions against it. \u201cLet me give you a simple rule of thumb,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cIf you're litigating against nuns, you've probably done something wrong.\u201d\n\nCruz accused President Obama of abolishing something as well: the Constitution. \u201cIt seems like this president is going down the Bill of Rights, trying to violate each one, one at a time,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nEarlier this year, The New American\u2019s Thomas R. Eddlem published \u201cA Legacy of Violations of the U.S. Bill of Rights\u201d with hyperlinked examples.\n\nCruz began by enumerating the president\u2019s multi-front assault on the fundamental liberties protected by the First Amendment, including the IRS\u2019s investigation into the reading and religious habits of conservative groups and ObamaCare\u2019s attempt (albeit halted provisionally by the Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby case) to force small business owners to choose between obedience to the tenets of their faith and obedience to federal mandates.\n\nNext, Cruz criticized the president for his attempts to disarm the American people in direct violation of the Second Amendment. \u201cIn Colorado, like Texas, we define gun control as hitting what you\u2019re aiming at,\u201d Cruz quipped, to the roar of the audience.\n\nHe went on to chide the two Colorado state legislators who voted for strict gun control laws and were subsequently recalled by voters, saying those lawmakers define gun control as \u201cinvoluntary retirement.\u201d\n\nThen, calling on Americans to \u201cdefend their Fourth and Fifth Amendment right to privacy,\u201d Cruz asked audience members how many of them brought their cellphones with them to the conference. \u201cI want to ask you to leave you cellphones on. I want to make sure President Obama hears every word we say this evening,\u201d Cruz added, referring to the National Security Agency\u2019s unconstitutional monitoring of cellphone conversations as revealed in several documents leaked by Edward Snowden.\n\nThe last in Cruz\u2019s list of rights being revoked by President Obama were those guaranteed by the 10th Amendment.\n\nCruz referred to the 10th Amendment as the \u201cfundamental statement in the Bill of Rights that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states or to the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means,\u201d he added, \u201cthat as the Framers put it, the powers of the federal government are few and defined.\u201d\n\nCruz is referring to the statement made by James Madison in The Federalist, No. 45: \u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the immigration crisis, specifically that of children illegally crossing into the United States by themselves, Cruz said that we are \u201ca compassionate nation,\u201d adding, \u201cthe compassionate thing to do is to solve the problem and to reunite them [the illegally immigrating children] with their families.\u201d\n\nThen, turning to the debacle that is American foreign policy, Cruz compared the current occupant of the Oval Office to one of his predecessors, saying President Obama has made a \u201creturn to Jimmy Carter.\u201d Cruz said that in his estimation the two presidents pursued \u201cthe same feckless and na\u00efve foreign policy, making the world much, much more dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the last five years we've seen America recede from leadership in the world and into that vacuum have stepped nations like Iran and Russia and China. And the world is a whole lot more dangerous place.\u201d\n\nThen, sounding very much the presidential candidate in training, Cruz declared, \u201cIf there's one principle from time immemorial, it is that bullies and tyrants don't respect weakness or appeasement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you have the president of the United States being openly mocked by leaders of nations like Russia and Iran, it is profoundly dangerous,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nFinally, perhaps pointing to his own unpopularity among GOP leadership, Cruz warned the audience, \u201cIf you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run the other way!\u201d\n\nJoe A.
