Ezekiel Emanuel, archiect of Obamacare and brother of former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, appeared on Morning Joe to promote an article he wrote in The Atlantic where he explained why 75 is the ideal age to die.





EZEKIEL EMANUEL: One of the big American beliefs is this thing called compression of morbidity. That, you know, we're just going to be healthy, healthy, healthy, fall off the cliff, and we won't have any disability.



The reality is, that hasn't been, in the last 25 years, the way it's gone. Disabilities increase every time we live longer. Then there's Alzheimer's. At 85, between a third and half of the people have Alzheimer's. Does that sound so desirable to you to live to 100?
