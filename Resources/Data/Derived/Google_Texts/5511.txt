Who's Donald Trump turning his vitriol against today?

Donald Trump had a lot to say during his 90-minute address to a 20,000-strong crowd on Monday night in Dallas.

From immigration to Obamacare, the presidential hopeful continued with his usual, incendiary rhetoric to please prospective voters. However, there was one point in particular about illegal immigration that earned him a standing ovation.

“We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world,” said Trump, who reiterated his promise to deport all illegal immigrants once – if – he is president.

He further slammed sanctuary cities – cities that have policies designed to not prosecute illegal aliens – while citing Kate Steinle’s case from San Francisco. The woman was killed in July by an illegal Mexican immigrant.

"We have to end this sanctuary-cities crap fast," Trump added.

Apart from rallying against immigration, Trump bashed President Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act.

“We've got a president who doesn't know what the hell he's doing!” Trump proclaimed, pledging to repeal and replace Obamacare with “Donaldcare.”



This event was the longest single campaign speech of any candidate running for the presidency in 2016. You can watch the complete address in the YouTube link below:
