It is an attempt by pharmacies to get customers to come in once to get all of their prescription drugs, hailed as a time-saving and money-saving opportunity.\n\nWhile the marketing is true, pharmacists say, part of the reason it is being offered in increasing numbers is to cut business costs and remain in good standing with insurance companies.\n\nBeyond the money, the synchronization programs might make people healthier, said John Greene, Bi-Lo\u2019s pharmacy district manager for the New Orleans region. Greene led the grocery chain\u2019s pilot program in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama before it rolled out the medication synchronization to the rest of its stores, including the Augusta area.\n\nThe National Association of Boards of Pharmacy call these refill-coordination programs an important way to get patients to stick to taking multiple drugs over extended periods. The organization said a 2013 survey showed that one-third of people older than 40 who stopped taking their drugs and didn\u2019t tell their doctor did so because the prescription ran out.\n\nIf people are getting their monthly prescriptions at one time, they are more likely to get all the medications, and take them, Greene said. If people are making multiple trips to the pharmacy in a month, it is easy to put off one of those trips and interrupt the medication regimen.\n\nBarney\u2019s Pharmacy in Augusta started its medication sync program about three months ago. It has between 50 and 75 customers enrolled to get their prescriptions filled on one day, with calls going out when the order is ready, said Emily Carmichael, the clinical pharmacy director.\n\n\u201cPatients are now coming in and asking for it, so the word has gotten out,\u201d Carmichael said.\n\nPatients save time and gas money under the programs, and pharmacies save through inventory control and fewer work hours.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in once a month, we know ahead of time that you\u2019re going to get your nine prescriptions. It is a lot more likely we\u2019re going to have your drug in stock,\u201d Greene said. Work hours can be adjusted for pharmacies that appear to have busy days, he added.\n\nAt Barney\u2019s, which has a delivery service, making one trip to a customer\u2019s house saves fuel costs and driver time, said owner Barry Bryant.\n\n\u201cOur delivery drivers are making two or three trips a week to the same house because they can\u2019t get all their stuff together,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis mutually beneficial arrangement did not come from the normal way a trend begins. It was not born from an idea to gain a competitive advantage, but rather from changes to Medicare through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cCompliance and adherence rates are a national issue,\u201d said BJ Cobb, the senior manager of pharmacy professional services for Bi-Lo Winn-Dixie. \u201cIt has come to the forefront recently to measure who is taking their medication and who is not, the outcomes and how many people end up back in the doctor\u2019s office because they didn\u2019t take their medication.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare drug program has star ratings, and three of the categories are based on adherence, she said.\n\nSo the health insurance companies are ranked.\n\n\u201cHowever, insurance companies are passing the buck onto pharmacies,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cEvery pharmacy wants to have a good star rating because if we don\u2019t we could potentially lose our contracts with insurance companies. That is our incentive.\u201d\n\nIn the pharmacy world, compliance is patients with recurring prescriptions picking them up 80 percent of the time.\n\nGreene said the average person on multiple prescriptions picks refills 55 percent of the time. With medication synchronization, though, that compliance number hits 82 percent.\n\n\u201cIt would seem odd that an insurance company would be interested in people taking medications because that\u2019s more money they pay out, but not when compared to the cost of hospitalization for not taking the meds,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd though the programs have been born out of changes to Medicare Part D, it is available to all customers, Car\u00admichael said.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a pharmacy with hundreds of patients in med sync, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re working toward,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "It is an attempt by pharmacies to get customers to come in once to get all of their prescription drugs, hailed as a time-saving and money-saving opportunity.
