Ernst, a 44-year-old state senator, or Bruce Braley, a 56-year-old four-term Democratic congressman, will replace Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring after five terms. Of the five Senate contests in purple states \u2014 Iowa, Virginia, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Colorado \u2014 this is currently the closest: The Real Clear Politics average of polls shows a tie (Ernst ahead by 0.2 percentage points as of Friday).\n\nWhich should make Republicans anxious as they try to take control of the Senate and as they contemplate the 2016 presidential landscape. Although Iowa has voted Democratic in six of the last seven presidential elections, the Ernst-Braley contest should not be this close.\n\nOnly 38 percent of Iowans approve of Barack Obama\u2019s performance. Braley, a past president of an Iowa trial lawyers association, is as awkward as Ernst is ebullient when campaigning. And the Democratic Party\u2019s single idea \u2014 the trope that Republicans live to wage a \u201cwar on women\u201d \u2014 leaves Ernst bemused: \u201cI am a woman, and I have been to war and this is not war.\u201d A 5-foot-2 grandmother, she is a National Guard lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq.\n\nAlthough outspent by her chief opponent 10-to-1 in the first quarter of this year, she won a five-candidate primary with 54 percent of the vote, propelled by an ad in which she said that, having grown up castrating pigs, she would be able to cut Washington spending. She does, however, genuflect at the altar of Iowa\u2019s established religion, the Church of Ethanol, a federally mandated Iowa sacrament made from corn.\n\nThe Ernst of the primary season talked about the Harley in her driveway, the pistol in her purse and the possibility of impeaching the president. Today her less exotic persona talks about the feeble economy, the perils of Obamacare and Braley\u2019s record, including his pride in having given in the House the culminating argument for Obamacare, which he still thinks is splendid.\n\nThen there is his interesting path to his current position on the Keystone XL pipeline, which he favored before he opposed it. In 2012 he voted for construction and for removing the requirement that the president approve construction. He now opposes Keystone, which makes his position conveniently congruent with that of Tom Steyer, the billionaire who is dispersing millions of dollars to support candidates who share his opposition to Keystone. Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate super PAC has spent $2.6 million attacking Ernst. Politics is an inherently transactional business, but Braley\u2019s fretting about money in politics \u2014 he is operatically indignant about the Koch brothers \u2014 is notably selective. So far, Ernst\u2019s campaign and independent groups advocating on her behalf have spent about $2 million less on ads than Braley\u2019s campaign and supporting groups have spent.\n\nGov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who served four terms from 1983 to 1999, is now in his fifth and has a double-digit lead in his quest for a sixth, and is already the longest-serving governor in the United States since Colonial times. His coattails should help Ernst in the voting, which began Thursday. Ernst is also warmly supported by Iowa\u2019s six-term Sen. Charles Grassley, who would be chairman of the Judiciary Committee in a Republican-controlled Senate. Braley, speaking at a fundraiser to other trial lawyers in Texas, and evidently forgetting that nowadays cellphones are also video cameras, was recorded lamenting that Republican control could put Judiciary\u2019s gavel in the hands of \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school.\u201d And Braley, this year\u2019s leader in unfortunate ad libs, probably should not have shared with voters the misery he experienced last autumn when, because of the government shutdown, there were no fresh towels in the House gym.\n\nIowa is one of two states \u2014 hello, Mississippi \u2014 that have never elected a woman to a federal office or governorship. In other circumstances, might Braley consider this, too, evidence of a war on women?\n\nRead more from George F.
