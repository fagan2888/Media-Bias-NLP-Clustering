Mexico\u2019s Large Millimeter Telescope, for example, is an enormous single dish on top of an exceptionally high mountain, not to mention the biggest science project of any kind in its country. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is a billion-dollar class instrument, the world\u2019s most powerful radio telescope.\n\nThe South Pole Telescope is a special case in several ways. First, the obvious: it\u2019s at the South Pole. That makes it incredibly hard to get to even in good weather, and completely inaccessible during the austral winter. But there are less obvious distinguishing characteristics as well. For one, the South Pole Telescope was designed for the very specific task of studying the cosmic microwave background\u2014something completely different than what the astronomers of the EHT want it to do.\n\nWhich is why last December, University of Arizona-Tucson astronomer and EHT collaborator Dan Marrone flew, along with several colleagues, to the South Pole. Their job was to install the gear the South Pole Telescope would need to join the EHT in observing black holes.\n\nNormally, the South Pole Telescope\u2019s 10-meter dish funnels extremely faint radiation from the cosmic microwave background into a camera called a bolometer. \u201cThat camera effectively just measures the heat from the sky in a given direction by sensing how much the accumulated light heats each detector,\u201d Marrone explains. To do Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), the technique used by the Event Horizon Telescope, the SPT needs a different kind of camera\u2014a single-pixel instrument that records the waveform of microwaves (specifically those with a frequency of 230 GHz) hitting the telescope. With that single, highly sensitive pixel, Marrone explains, \u201cwe can actually record a \u2018movie\u2019 of the electric field that the radiation from our targets is creating on the surface of the telescope.\u201d\n\nEventually, during a full Event Horizon Telescope observing run, telescopes around the world will record such a \u201cmovie\u201d on banks of 8-terabyte hard drives, then ship them back to MIT\u2019s Haystack Observatory near Boston, where scientists will combine the data collected at all sites using a supercomputer called a correlator.\n\nBy the time Marrone left Tucson on December 1, his team had already shipped 13 crates of equipment to the Pole. When Marrone arrived on December 9, only two of those crates were waiting for him. \u201cIt turns out never to be easy to do anything at the South Pole,\u201d Marrone says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers believe its difficult-to-access telescope will allow them to see into the center of the Milky Way", "title": "Scientists are hunting for black holes on the South Pole", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Researchers believe its difficult-to-access telescope will allow them to see into the center of the Milky Way", "title": "Scientists are hunting for black holes on the South Pole", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/scientists_are_hunting_for_black_holes_on_the_south_pole_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_90296737.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers believe its difficult-to-access telescope will allow them to see into the center of the Milky Way", "title": "Scientists are hunting for black holes on the South Pole", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_90296737.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Seth Fletcher", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Astronomy, Black Hole, black holes, Milky Way, Science, South Pole, The Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Their job was to install the gear the South Pole Telescope would need to join the EHT in observing black holes.\n\u201cIt turns out never to be easy to do anything at the South Pole,\u201d Marrone says.\nNormally, the South Pole Telescope\u2019s 10-meter dish funnels extremely faint radiation from the cosmic microwave background into a camera called a bolometer.\nThe South Pole Telescope is a special case in several ways.\nFirst, the obvious: it\u2019s at the South Pole."}
