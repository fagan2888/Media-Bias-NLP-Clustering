I was working my first real job and for the first time had a little bit of money. When my wife\u2019s 10-year old Cabriolet died, I pounced.\n\nThe Jetta was a bad car, but that\u2019s not what made it a dumb purchase. What made it a dumb purchase is the fact that I don\u2019t really care about cars.\n\nAll else being equal, I\u2019d prefer a nice car to a dull one. Who wouldn\u2019t? But for how much money that Jetta cost, it gave me very little pleasure. When I think of the vacations or experiences or time/savings that $23,000 could have bought, it makes me sad.\n\n\n\nI realized the Jetta was a dumb buy within months of purchasing it. I eventually sold it, quit my job and moved to Mexico. I drove a 10-year old Jeep.\n\nAs for the best purchase I ever made, that\u2019s pretty easy. When I was 22, my wife (then girlfriend) bought airplane tickets to travel around the world, with stops in Fiji, New Zealand, Thailand and Italy. That trip set the tone for much of what\u2019s made my life great.\n\nMatt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.\n\nRead the latest Wealth Management Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000.", "title": "Why Oh Why Did I Buy a New Car?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/06/20/why-oh-why-did-i-buy-a-new-car/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Why Oh Why Did I Buy a New Car?", "description": "The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-20T13:23:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/06/20/why-oh-why-did-i-buy-a-new-car/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-3619", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000.", "title": "Why Oh Why Did I Buy a New Car?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/06/20/why-oh-why-did-i-buy-a-new-car/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-3619", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-20T13:25:56-04:00"}, "article_summary": "What is the smartest and dumbest purchase you ever made, and what lesson did you take from them?\nThe Jetta was a bad car, but that\u2019s not what made it a dumb purchase.\nWhat made it a dumb purchase is the fact that I don\u2019t really care about cars.\nMATT HOUGAN: The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000.\nI realized the Jetta was a dumb buy within months of purchasing it."}
