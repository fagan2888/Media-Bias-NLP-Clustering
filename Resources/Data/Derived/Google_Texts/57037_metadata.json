(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) September 12, 2015\n\nThe sounds of bagpipes playing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d accompanied by the mournful sound of a fire truck siren winding down filled the air as part of the 9-11 Memorial at The Vintage Fire Museum on Saturday.\n\nThe Jeffersonville museum played host to the memorial featuring a piece of debris salvaged from \u2018The Pile\u2019, as the debris of New York City\u2019s World Trade Center came to be known in the days following the collapse of the twin towers.\n\nA ceremony held at 11 a.m. opened the day\u2019s activity with the presentation of colors by the Lafayette Township Fire Department, prayer and reflection on the tragedy of the devastating terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.\n\nFirefighters from a number of local fire companies, including Jeffersonville, New Albany, and Pee Wee Valley in Kentucky, wearing black bands across their badges, stood at attention or bowed their heads in prayer during the ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt is so important that we not forget,\u201d said Dick Bowyer, a former volunteer firefighter in a speech during the memorial. He encouraged those gathered to always honor the \u201c343 firefighters who answered their last bell on 9-11.\u201d\n\nThe piece of trade center debris is owned by the New Albany Fire Department and is usually displayed in their headquarters\u2019 lobby. On Friday it featured in the city of New Albany\u2019s 9-11 remembrance before making the trip to Jeffersonville for Saturday\u2019s event.\n\nAdmission fees to the Vintage Fire Museum were waived for the day. Inside, the museum screened a compilation of video captured on 9-11, along with photos of the firefighters lost that day and newspaper and magazine stories from that day.\n\nJeffersonville fire chief Eric Hedrick said he was moved by the memorial. \u201cI think of the constant sacrifice of these firefighters\u2019 families \u2013 of the graduations, weddings that they did not get to be part of,\u201d he said. \u201cThis day was 14 years ago but we have people that are still greatly affected by it.\u201d\n\nBattalion Chief Matt Bowyer with the New Albany Fire Department served as master of ceremonies for the memorial. He, along with other New Albany firefighters travelled to New York City three weeks after the attack, staying a week at a firehouse in Brooklyn.\n\n\u201c9-11 is very important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent a couple of days working on The Pile. It was still burning.\u201d\n\nVintage Fire Museum chair Curt Peters said they plan to make the memorial an annual event. \u201cIt is important to remember what happened \u2013 to honor those who sacrificed their lives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t alive for Pearl Harbor,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, 9-11 is like a Pearl Harbor. You can never forget it and it evokes in people a patriotism of the best kind.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1F5DFJ1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Vintage Fire Museum is hosting a memorial Saturday at 11 a.m. to honor firefighters and others who lost their lives in the Twin Towers attack of Sept. 11, 2001.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The Vintage Fire Museum is hosting a memorial Saturday at 11 a.m. to honor firefighters and others who lost their lives in the Twin Towers attack of Sept. 11, 2001.", "title": "Jeffersonville Vintage Fire Museum marks 9-11", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/09/12/jeffersonville-vintage-fire-museum-marks/71952092/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Vintage Fire Museum is hosting a memorial Saturday at 11 a.m. to honor firefighters and others who lost their lives in the Twin Towers attack of Sept. 11, 2001.", "title": "Jeffersonville Vintage Fire Museum marks 9-11", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Pearl Harbor", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Places/Pearl Harbor", "title": "Jeffersonville Vintage Fire Museum marks 9-11", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fd588f0f44b12068efa2339672115e3a8a4c410/c=200-0-600-533/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/638654ae1d20bc87a2eaa76ee81d38cdcabce667/c=134-0-667-533/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68ca7fed1fb4a9555a427c22d66fa056de2620b5/c=44-0-755-533/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c938dc92fc3a3ca9191e7d52655363c522c8fd01/c=0-42-800-492&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-12T23:58:21.137000-04:00", "shorthed": "Jeffersonville Vintage Fire Museum marks 9-11", "articleid": 71952092, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91663fb702b52330025b57acd219649a8481db29/c=0-42-800-492/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/759890191a377e8eda26af666bd1e40795443d57/c=250-0-550-533/local/-/media/2015/09/12/Louisville/B9318781446Z.1_20150912205807_000_GD8BTBTUV.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "vintage fire museum, 911 memorial, 911 event, Jeffersonville,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc91b\"", "article_summary": "Members of the Jeffersonville Fire Department view the 9-11 Memorial at the Vintage Fire Museum in Jeffersonville on Saturday.\nHe, along with other New Albany firefighters travelled to New York City three weeks after the attack, staying a week at a firehouse in Brooklyn.\nOn Friday it featured in the city of New Albany\u2019s 9-11 remembrance before making the trip to Jeffersonville for Saturday\u2019s event.\nAdmission fees to the Vintage Fire Museum were waived for the day.\n(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) September 12, 2015The sounds of bagpipes playing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d accompanied by the mournful sound of a fire truck siren winding down filled the air as part of the 9-11 Memorial at The Vintage Fire Museum on Saturday."}
