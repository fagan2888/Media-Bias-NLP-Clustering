I certainly would never vote for or support a member of Congress who walked out on Israel\u2019s prime minister.\u201d\n\nDershowitz has twice endorsed Obama for president, but has also warned repeatedly that Obama could become America\u2019s version of Neville Chamberlain if he allowed Iran to become a nuclear power.\n\nObama\u2019s promise to prevent that \u201cseems to be in the process of being broken,\u201d Dershowitz notes, \u201cas reports in the media and Congress circulate that the deal on the table contains a sunset provision that would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons after a certain number of years.\n\nPhoto: file\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
