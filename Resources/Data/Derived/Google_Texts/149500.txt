Colorado State Patrol troopers are searched for man who crashed a car in Boulder County early Saturday morning and then walked away from the accident, leaving two injured women.

Jeffrey Richardson, 47, is being sought primarily because he had been suffering from an undisclosed ailment, said Trooper Nate Reid, CSP spokesman.

“We just want to make sure he is OK,” Reid said. “His family was worried about his health.”

The two women who were injured in the crash were treated for minor injuries at a hospital and released.

Richardson allegedly crashed into a guardrail at 2:04 a.m. on westbound U.S. 36 near the Flat Irons Mall, Reid said.

Although he was also injured, Richardson left the scene of the crash on foot.

Richardson’s wife called CSP later in the morning and said he had called her and said he was OK.

Troopers are investigating the cause of the accident including whether drugs or alcohol were involved, Reid said.
