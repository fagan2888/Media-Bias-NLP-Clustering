Two experienced mountaineers are trapped below the summit of Longs Peak after recent storms blanketed the 14,259-foot peak in snow and ice.

Suzanne Turell and Connie Yang – both from York, Maine – sent a mobile phone text at 7:07 a.m. Thursday reading “We need help. At top of Longs Peak. 13400 feet. Whiteout snowstorm. No injuries. Iced over risk of hypothermia.”

The pair noted their mobile battery was dying. Calls from rangers and friends have failed to reach the pair. A website has been assembled to update friends and family on their status.

Turell is the director of product design and Connie Yang is the director of engineering for the New Hampshire tent and sleeping bag company Nemo Equipment.

“They are very experienced but they didn’t have mountaineering equipment,” said Nemo spokeswoman Kate Ketschek. “We are really worried. They wouldn’t call for help if they didn’t really need it.”

Ketschek said the duo was equipped with fall hiking equipment. Thirty-degree sleeping bags and a double-wall tent. “I don’t think they were prepared for winter conditions,” Ketschek said.

Ketschek said Rocky Mountain National Park rangers sent a small search party in Thursday but they were turned back by flooded roads and closures before reaching the trailhead. A ground rescue was scheduled for early Friday but road closures remain on the eastern edge of the park. Phone and power appear to be out for the park as well. Phone calls to the park headquarters did not go through.

Turell and Yang’s text noted their precise GPS coordinates. They were hunkering down in a yellow tent near the Keyhole Notch, a rocky pass between Longs Peak and Storm Peak.

“Can’t move because of ice storm. Don’t know how long it will last. Been here for one day and trying to wait it out.”
