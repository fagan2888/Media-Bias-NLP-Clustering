A man and and five-month-old boy suffered critical injuries in a crash Sunday afternoon in north Wichita.

It happened around 3:40 p.m. on northbound I-135 near the I-235 interchange. Trooper Ryan Tauer with the Kansas Highway Patrol said the car drifted off the interstate and hit the pole of an overhead KDOT sign, nearly separating the car into two parts.

Witnesses told the patrol the car may have hydroplaned before crashing.

The baby and driver were taken to Wesley Medical Center in critical condition. Troopers identified the driver as 25-year-old Melvin Zahn and the baby as Jerry Smith.

Trooper Tauer said Smith was properly restrained.

A woman in the passenger seat, 24-year-old Joelle Smith, suffered serious injuries.

All three are from Hutchinson.
