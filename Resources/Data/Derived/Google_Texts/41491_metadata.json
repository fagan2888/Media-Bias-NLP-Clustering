[\u2026] Yale Bowl will not be turfed at any time in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe apparent reversal comes after public criticism of the reported plan from environmental groups, Yale alumni, Yale-affiliated health professionals, and former Yale football players.\n\nYale Bowl, which is a National Historic Landmark, opened 101 years ago on November 21, 1914. It is one of two remaining natural grass football fields in the Ivy League.\n\nThe stadium, which seats 61,446, is used for just ten to 12 events each year, including four to six Yale home football games. The difficulty of preserving, maintaining, and draining the grass field, which is set below sea level, limits use of the stadium.\n\nThe change to an artificial turf would have allowed for the installation of a portable, inflatable dome roof over Yale Bowl during the winter months, affording for year-round use of the stadium as a practice football field and as a venue for other events, sporting and otherwise.\n\nThe plan was criticized for preservation, environmental, health, and aesthetic reasons.\n\nLocal architect and Ivy League alumnus Duo Dickinson, in an opinion piece aired on WNHH in New Haven, said, \u201cThe distinction of turf versus grass is truly a metaphor for how we look at our lives. Do they need to be useful and honest like turf? Or do they want to be [\u2026] enriched with a provenance, registering with a history\u201d like natural grass?\n\n\u201cYale Athletics will certainly keep track of the evolution of turf fields and any relevant scientific studies about them,\u201d Conn said in an email. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict the future of that and whether it might lead at some point to Yale considering a change.\u201d\n\nYale scored first on its opening drive with a 28-yard touchdown pass on a surprising fourth-and-12 attempt. Harvard then scored 31 unanswered points over the first three quarters, putting the game out of reach for the Bulldogs.\n\nIt was the 132nd edition of the annual Yale/Harvard football contest known colloquially as The Game. Harvard has won each of the last nine years.\n\nYale finishes its football season 3-4 in the Ivy League and 6-4 overall. Yale leads the series with Harvard 65-59-8, dating back to 1875.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Sports", "description": "In what will not be the final game played on a natural grass surface at Yale Bowl, Harvard beat Yale 38 to 19, clinching a share of the Ivy League football", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/harvard-wins-game-yale-bowl-remain-natural-grass", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201511/yalebowl.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In what will not be the final game played on a natural grass surface at Yale Bowl, Harvard beat Yale 38 to 19, clinching a share of the Ivy League football", "title": "Harvard Wins \"The Game\"; Yale Bowl to Remain Natural Grass"}, "story_id": 456996228, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mcnicolpants"}, "author": "Jonathan McNicol", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Harvard Wins &quot;The Game&quot;; Yale Bowl to Remain Natural Grass"}, "nid": 50394, "datePublished": "2015-11-22", "keywords": "sports, colleges, Yale University, The Daily, New Haven Region, environment, architecture", "wordCount": 542, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In what will not be the final game played on a natural grass surface at Yale Bowl, Harvard beat Yale 38 to 19, clinching a share of the Ivy League football title on Saturday in West Haven.\nYale Bowl, which is a National Historic Landmark, opened 101 years ago on November 21, 1914.\nOr do they want to be [\u2026] enriched with a provenance, registering with a history\u201d like natural grass?\nIt is one of two remaining natural grass football fields in the Ivy League.\n[\u2026] Yale Bowl will not be turfed at any time in the near future.\u201dThe apparent reversal comes after public criticism of the reported plan from environmental groups, Yale alumni, Yale-affiliated health professionals, and former Yale football players."}
