You held out for as long as you could, but one day — against your better judgment — you clicked on a viral video. A song about chocolate rain. A man going full-psycho over double rainbows. Rebecca. Effing. Black. You didn’t feel great about it, but you just couldn’t help it.

We may never have a hard-and-fast gauge on what makes something go viral — something to do with wisdom tooth extraction meds? — but we can still, retroactively, attempt to make sense of some of it. That’s why every week we’ll be taking a look back at the things that went viral exactly five years prior.

Here’s what was buzzing around the Internet for the week of July 18, 2010:

“Alright, Congressman. That’s ridiculous,” Megyn Kelly opened a 2010 program of “America Live.”

Kelly was responding to former GOP Rep. Tom Tancredo’s op-ed published in Washington Times which argued President Obama was “a more serious threat to America than al Qaeda” and that he had “consciously and brazenly disregarded his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution.” The proposed solution: impeachment.

That op-ed, titled “The case for impeachment,” was published during a summer when “Obama Derangement Syndome” had become a full-blown epidemic in conservative media.

Here’s how Media Matters defined “ODS” at the time:

“In recent weeks, conservative media have been consumed by ‘Obama Derangement Syndrome,’ accusing President Obama of being insane, of colluding with Russian spies, of trying to create a civil war and implement one world government, among other things, while also claiming that his administration is trying to control everything under the sun, including the Internet and, inexplicably, your toilet.”
