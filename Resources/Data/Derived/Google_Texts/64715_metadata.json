Controlling them back may help fight obesity.\n\nWhen it comes to what bacteria are capable of, mind control is definitely not one of the first things that most people will think about \u2014 parasites are better known to control moods. But a new study has found that, to an extent, gut bacteria may also control our minds, influencing what we eat and how much.\n\n\u201cBacteria within the gut are manipulative,\u201d said Dr. Carlo Maley, director of the Center for Evolution and Cancer at the University of California, San Francisco, in a press release. \u201cThere is a diversity of interests represented in the microbiome, some aligned with our own dietary goals, and others not.\u201d\n\nOur gut flora, or microbiome, is comprised of trillions of bacterial cells that work together to protect our digestive tracts, from the stomach to the colon, and everything in-between. They also help us to digest food, maintain a healthy weight, and regulate blood pressure. But considering that they are fighting to stay alive on a constant basis \u2014 our guts hold a vast community of many different bacteria \u2014 it makes sense that they would need specific nutrients to flourish. So, they try to control our minds to get them.\n\nIn their new paper, Maley and his team suggest that these bacteria release signaling molecules in the gut, which are then picked up by the vagus nerve, the connecting structure between the gut and the brain. By making these connections, the bacteria can then influence the immune system, endocrine system, and nervous system, and in turn control which foods the host craves (this could help them fight off other bacteria) or induce a sense of unease until we eat foods that make them stronger.\n\n\u201cMicrobes have the capacity to manipulate behavior and mood through altering the neural signals in the vagus nerve, changing taste receptors, producing toxins to make us feel bad, and releasing chemical rewards to make us feel good,\u201d said co-author Dr. Athena Aktipis, of the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University, in the release.\n\nThese mechanisms are believed to contribute to obesity, as they push people to eat more of certain foods, even if they don\u2019t necessarily want them. One study published last year found that mice implanted with the gut bacteria of an obese twin eventually became obese, when compared to mice given gut bacteria from skinnier twins. Luckily, the gut microbiome is delicate, and within 24 hours of changing a diet, differences can be seen.\n\nThe researchers of the current study believe that changing a person\u2019s diet may offer health benefits beyond preventing obesity. \u201cTargeting the microbiome could open up possibilities for preventing a variety of disease, from obesity to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract,\u201d Aktipis said. \u201cWe are only beginning to scratch the surface of the importance of the microbiome for human health.\u201d\n\nSource: Aktipis A, Alcock J, Maley C.
