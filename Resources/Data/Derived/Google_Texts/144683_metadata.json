(Photo: File/Larry McCormack/Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Human Services\u2019 efforts to police itself over fraud and waste have been fruitless.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of taxpayer dollars intended for food and snacks for low-income children have gone to waste.\n\nLeadership failures are nothing short of incompetent, which has rightfully prompted lawmakers to demand greater oversight.\n\nDHS Commissioner Raquel Hatter and her managers must be held accountable for problems with the $80 million program to feed hungry kids \u2014 one in five children is at risk for hunger in Tennessee.\n\nTheir approach, thus far, such as denying media interviews and deflecting on the issues, is not the right one in light of all the problems.\n\nIt is unconscionable that three audits in March have revealed $11.4 million in questionable spending from the state as well as widespread management problems.\n\nState Comptroller audits show that DHS\u2019 performance has slipped, going from zero violations in 2012 to multiple violations since 2013.\n\nThey have included $4.3 million in suspicious payments to food providers in 2013 and $1.8 million in questionable payments in 2015.\n\nOne contractor used $56,000 for renovations and maintenance on her home.\n\nThat case is under criminal investigation. In all, $181,135.59 spent by Cherry Tree Food Program in Clarksville and its former executive director Patsy Simpson is under scrutiny.\n\nIn addition, $83,000 spent by another agency, Nashville Academy for Kidz, is also under question as well as an accusation that it falsified records.\n\nEven more, a federal review in February shows lax oversight from the department.\n\nSenate Bill 1472 and House Bill 1940, sponsored by Sen. Jim Tracy, R-Shelbyville and Rep. Tim Wirgau, R-Buchanan, seek to strengthen oversight by requiring greater accountability.\n\nThat includes monthly reports to leaders and key committee chairs in the General Assembly as well as the State Comptroller, developing a new monitoring process, and conducting unannounced visits of contractors to ensure compliance.\n\nIn addition, DHS would be stripped of managing its financial accounting, and that authority would go to the Department of Finance and Administration.\n\nThe legislation takes a hammer to the problems and demonstrates lack of confidence in DHS.\n\nThe Senate passed the bill on March 7 and House passed it on Thursday. Both chambers passed the measure unanimously.\n\nAn improvement to the bill would have been to make the monthly reports public records rather than confidential, as the bill currently requires.\n\nHowever, legislators should be commended for passing it, and Gov. Bill Haslam should sign it.\n\nHe may also want to consider whether Hatter is the right person to move DHS forward into compliance and responsible control.\n\nThree years of bad reports call her leadership into question.\n\nOpinion Engagement Editor David Plazas wrote this editorial on behalf of The Tennessean Editorial Board.
