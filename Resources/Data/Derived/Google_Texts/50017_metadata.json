But here\u2019s one phrase I\u2019ve already heard too often: We don\u2019t lead.\n\nAnyone in any sector that\u2019s tried to raise capital has heard that phrase \u2014 sometimes for good reasons. But it\u2019s going to be heard too often as healthcare investing continues to evolve.\n\nHealthcare needs leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore and more corporate venture capitalists won\u2019t lead, for example. Yet, in many cases, they ask an awful lot from a startup.\n\nA Shire representative told attendees in Houston that Shire invests largely to acquire, will look to acquire the technology but not the whole company, and won\u2019t lead. That\u2019s not ideal for an early-stage company, which would prefer to keep its M&A options open.\n\nCorporate investors also don\u2019t lead because of various legal, governance and regulatory responsibilities that come with leading (athenahealth, you may recall, won\u2019t take more than 49 percent of a company for that reason).\n\nOther corporates at RESI\u2019s Houston conference told me they avoid leading because it\u2019s often hard for them to properly price a company (one of the reasons startups like corporate VCs!). They also admit there can be conflicts: Can a lead investor angle a portfolio company toward their acquisition while also being responsible in governance?\n\nHowever, add their policy to the others that won\u2019t lead a round and it gets ugly. More and more angel groups say it, though sometimes with caveats. For example, Tech Coast Angels said at RESI it only leads on investments within that state (too much work and travel for due diligence outside the state). But many simply say it outright these days. Venture philanthropy is also slouching toward this approach.\n\nThese are the tradeoffs when it comes to healthcare startups seeking investment, of course. Don\u2019t like the terms? Then don\u2019t take the money. Also, there are some people who probably shouldn\u2019t lead, like most family offices.\n\nBut that simplistic thinking keeps us away from the real question: How can investors position themselves to bring the best products to market? Put the phrase \u201cWe don\u2019t lead\u201d in that context.\n\nSo who leads? Traditional venture capital.\n\nFor all the talk about alternatives to traditional healthcare investing, it looks like venture will retain the most important role. VCs may have less money than in the past, but they sure know how to lead and, as a result, they will continue to set the price for healthcare\u2019s next great breakthroughs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OK, it's a cheap shot to call them sheep.
