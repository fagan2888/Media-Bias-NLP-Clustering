Mere minutes of the film have passed before the newest actress to step into the orphan\u2019s shoes, Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, is talking about Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Depression.\n\nExcept this time that history is, well, history. The musical that once contained songs with the actual titles \u201cWe\u2019d Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover\u201d and \u201cA New Deal for Christmas\u201d has been updated for modern times. And, though its Daddy Warbucks equivalent (Jamie Foxx as Benjamin Stacks, a New York gazillionaire with aspirations \u00e0 la Michael Bloomberg) is still involved in politics, the story has left behind much of its erstwhile focus on the national political climate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about Annie is that it was started as a political cartoon and with pretty biting social and political commentary, and then it was turned into a musical, and people have forgotten that,\u201d says Will Gluck, the writer-director behind the new adaptation. \u201cThey just think about \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 the plucky kid and the dog.\u201d\n\nThe content of that original social commentary may surprise some of today\u2019s \u201cTomorrow\u201d singers. In the \u201920s, when the strip debuted, Little Orphan Annie was already \u201cissuing a steady stream of far-right propaganda.\u201d In 1935, one newspaper canceled the comic because \u201cAnnie has been made the vehicle for a studied, veiled, and alarmingly vindictive propaganda.\u201d Cartoonist Harold Gray was a staunch believer in the way Daddy Warbucks got rich, which was \u201cdoing his job and not asking for help from anyone,\u201d as he put it. \u201cGray agrees that Annie dabbles in dialectics, and he has no intention, of stopping her,\u201d TIME commented in 1962. \u201cTo Artist Gray, Daddy and Annie are salesmen of the American dream, the \u201cpioneer spirit\u201d that without assistance, even from the State Department, can cope with Castro, neutralize the H-bomb, and eliminate the income tax.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, however, when Annie went to Broadway, though TIME opined that her newspaper-comic twin was \u201cstill fight[ing] the Red Menace and bleeding-heart liberals,\u201d the character\u2019s priorities changed. In the musical version of Annie, the spunky orphan \u2014 who has already helped her war-profiteering rescuer realize that those who have less are worth taking care of \u2014 is brought along to a meeting with FDR, at which point her natural optimism helps inspire the President to institute the New Deal. The general take-away, besides the fact that the sun will come out tomorrow, is that New-Deal-style, progressive policies help everyone get the fair shake he or she deserves. Annie\u2019s can-do pluck is still important, but she\u2019s optimistic about the government\u2019s ability to help all rather than individuals helping themselves.\n\nGluck says that, while updating the story for today\u2019s audiences \u2014 Annie lives in a foster home rather than an orphanage, for example \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to lose that part of the story\u2019s background. \u201cThe one thing I wanted to keep is the socioeconomic divide of the Depression,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich sadly has even gotten bigger now and sadly is not going away.\u201d That was why he made sure to have his Annie teach viewers a little lesson about the Great Depression when, she says, things were just like they are today except without the Internet.\n\nStill, this iteration of Annie ends up bringing the political girl to a more centrist position.\n\nBy keeping things local and staying away from specific historical moments \u2014 no, new Annie does not inspire the President to believe that there really are plenty of shovel-ready stimulus projects out there \u2014 some of the specificity of Annie\u2019s political message is lost too. Stacks thinks that in New York City, if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything you want, just like old-fashioned Daddy Warbucks did. Meanwhile, Annie recognizes that folks in her neighborhood are often ignored and left behind, even when they work hard, just like her theatrical predecessor did. They each come to see the other\u2019s side a little better, but the audience doesn\u2019t come away singing a song about Obamacare.\n\nBut, Gluck says, that\u2019s a better fit for the audience anyway \u2014 though not because today\u2019s political divides are so treacherous. Adults may see Annie as a rags-to-riches story, he says, but kids don\u2019t really know what that means; the core message of Annie, about hope and optimism, works just as well now as it did in the \u201970s or \u201930s because it\u2019s a universal story. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the end of the movie is that she got to live with a rich guy,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that to her the end of the movie is that she got to find a family.\u201d\n\nBesides, he still remembers the first time he saw the original Annie, and the questions he had for his parents when it was over: Who is Herbert Hoover and who is that guy in the wheelchair? When he took his own kids to see Annie on Broadway recently, they had the same exact questions. His movie\u2019s young viewers, however, won\u2019t be left scratching their heads. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to study for this essay question,\u201d he says.\n\nRead our original review of the musical Annie, here in the TIME Vault: No Waif Need Apply", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new movie adaptation has ditched the New Deal", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The new movie adaptation has ditched the New Deal", "title": "The Political History of 'Annie'", "url": "http://time.com/3640455/annie-new-deal-politics/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/annie-dom-df-03567_rgb.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/annie-dom-df-03567_rgb.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The new movie adaptation has ditched the New Deal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Political History of 'Annie'"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "fdr, movies, new deal, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "New Deal, Annie, Jamie Foxx, Will Gluck, Quvenzhane Wallis, Tomorrow, Movie, History, Politics"}, "article_summary": "But, Gluck says, that\u2019s a better fit for the audience anyway \u2014 though not because today\u2019s political divides are so treacherous.\nStacks thinks that in New York City, if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything you want, just like old-fashioned Daddy Warbucks did.\nRead our original review of the musical Annie, here in the TIME Vault: No Waif Need Apply\n\u201cThey just think about \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 the plucky kid and the dog.\u201dThe content of that original social commentary may surprise some of today\u2019s \u201cTomorrow\u201d singers.\nThey each come to see the other\u2019s side a little better, but the audience doesn\u2019t come away singing a song about Obamacare."}
