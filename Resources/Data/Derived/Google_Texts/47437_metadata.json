Did you hear about that Christian florist who is being sued for not selling flowers to a gay couple? Next thing you know, they\u2019ll be forcing pastors to perform gay weddings. I mean, anyone who reads the Bible knows that you can\u2019t be a Christian and support homosexuality.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s a lot. But don\u2019t panic \u2014 we\u2019ve got you covered. Here are a few bits of info (including some biblical arguments) you can use to respond to your evangelical uncle\u2019s diatribe:\n\nClaims that \u201creligious liberty\u201d is under attack in America are overblown, although the refrain is likely to be repeated ad nauseam by many religious conservatives over the next few years. Many \u201creligious liberty\u201d advocates cheered the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, for instance, where judges ruled that the craft store giant could be granted religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. But despite assertions that the ruling protected all religious groups, a substantial majority of almost every major U.S. Christian group actually disagreed with Hobby Lobby\u2019s position. What\u2019s more, the decision arguably hurt people of faith overall, because it only privileged the religious views of people who own and operate corporations \u2014 and not the faiths of their employees.\n\nAs for the florist your uncle is probably referring to, she runs a store in Washington that refused to provide wedding flowers to a gay couple last year \u2014 even though they had been frequent customers at the shop. Although the florist cited her religious beliefs as justification, her business offers public services, and her actions violated established Washington state nondiscrimination policies \u2014 policies that were in place before the state embraced marriage equality. Those lawsuits \u2014 which were filed both by the couple and the state \u2014 are still ongoing.\n\nNone of this has any real impact on clergy doing explicitly religious work. Pastors already retain the right to refuse to marry anyone, and shouldn\u2019t be compelled to let people use their worship spaces so long as their church is classified as a non-profit (which almost all churches are).\n\nReligious liberty works both ways. LGBT people are religious too, and millions of Christians now openly support same-sex marriage. Several major religious groups \u2014 Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Unitarian Universalists, and many Jews, among others \u2014 now ordain LGBT people and allow their pastors to officiate same-sex unions. Meanwhile, some denominations such as the United Methodists and the Mennonites are currently embroiled in internal debates over the issue of LGBT inclusion, with faith-based advocates passionately pushing their fellow churchgoers to embrace equality. Even Southern Baptists and other evangelical groups are experiencing a growth of pro-LGBT theology within their ranks, and Pope Francis famously made headlines last year when he responded to a question about gay priests by saying, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d\n\nThis shift, which was decades in the making, has resulted in an explosion of faith-based LGBT rights advocates. When North Carolina\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage was struck down earlier this year, for example, it was through a court case brought by progressive clergy and other people of faith. In addition to blasting the ban as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, their lawyers argued that prohibiting same-sex marriage violated the religious liberty of progressive clergy, because it criminalized what they considered the religious act of marrying gay couples. The judge ended up ruling only on the Fourteenth Amendment claim, but the point remains: if America is going to respect religious liberty, it has to respect the religious liberty of progressives as well.\n\nThe idea that you can\u2019t be Christian and support same-sex marriage simply isn\u2019t true. Over the last few decades, a slew of theologians have insisted that the classic biblical arguments against homosexuality are overly simplistic, noting that they are based on a handful of disconnected passages, most of which are taken out of context or used uncritically when spouted by anti-gay Christians. The Genesis story about a group of men from Sodom threatening to rape other men, for instance, was about hospitality, not homosexuality. And it ends with the main character offering his daughters up for rape instead of his male guests \u2014 not exactly the best exemplar for sexual ethics. Meanwhile, passages from Leviticus referring homosexuality as an \u201cabomination\u201d sit alongside long-abandoned prohibitions against things such as touching the skin of a dead pig (a difficult thing for many to do during football season). And while the apostle Paul supposedly condemned sexual activity between members of the same gender, many scholars argue that the modern concept of homosexuality \u2014 namely, a committed coupling of two consensual partners \u2014 was completely unknown to Paul, and thus not directly addressed in his writings. Plus, Paul advocated for things most Christian communities dismissed centuries ago, such as his declaration that it is \u201cshameful\u201d for a woman to speak in church.\n\nDoes this mean that pro-LGBT Christians are simply throwing out the Bible to justify their position? Of course not. If anything, they\u2019re taking scripture more seriously. Most Christians, whether they take the Bible \u201cliterally\u201d or not, use the example of Christ as the chief interpreter of scripture. Jesus\u2019 actions and teachings are meant to embody a perfect Christian life, and he repeatedly insisted that his followers welcome and love the outcasts of his day \u2014 the poor, women, tax collectors, people from other religions, and even those who were the \u201csexual other,\u201d such as eunuchs. Jesus never specifically mentioned homosexuality, but he did mention loving one\u2019s neighbor and radical concepts of inclusion.\n\nUltimately, of course, there will be people who disagree with homosexuality because of religious concerns no matter what argument they hear. But religious liberty is a right that should apply to all, and must also be upheld alongside other Constitutional rights, lest it be wielded as a tool to oppress others \u2014 such as when \u201creligious liberty\u201d was used as an excuse to justify segregation and racial bigotry.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Don't worry when your conservative Christian relative goes off on a rant about homosexuality \u2014 we've got you covered.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Don't worry when your conservative Christian relative goes off on a rant about homosexuality \u2014 we've got you covered.", "title": "How To Talk To Your Evangelical Uncle About Marriage Equality", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/11/25/3596554/thanksgiving-arguments-evangelical-uncle/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tgiving-turkey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don't worry when your conservative Christian relative goes off on a rant about homosexuality \u2014 we've got you covered.", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tgiving-turkey-321x214.jpg", "title": "How To Talk To Your Evangelical Uncle About Marriage Equality", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tgiving-turkey.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tgiving-turkey.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T09:15:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1e7\"", "article_summary": "The judge ended up ruling only on the Fourteenth Amendment claim, but the point remains: if America is going to respect religious liberty, it has to respect the religious liberty of progressives as well.\nThe idea that you can\u2019t be Christian and support same-sex marriage simply isn\u2019t true.\nWhen North Carolina\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage was struck down earlier this year, for example, it was through a court case brought by progressive clergy and other people of faith.\nLGBT people are religious too, and millions of Christians now openly support same-sex marriage.\nBut religious liberty is a right that should apply to all, and must also be upheld alongside other Constitutional rights, lest it be wielded as a tool to oppress others \u2014 such as when \u201creligious liberty\u201d was used as an excuse to justify segregation and racial bigotry."}
