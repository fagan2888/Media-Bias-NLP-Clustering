Main St. in downtown Mishawaka. The company currently employs 43 people, but the new building could fit as many as 85. The entire property covers 5 acres, so there is space for additions as well.\n\nThe company has spent about $1.4 million to buy and renovate the Edison Lakes building.\n\n\u201cWe did it with the intention of staying here for a long time,\u201d Rutledge said.\n\nTruPay\u2019s business is in providing \u201chuman capital management\u201d solutions. That means it handles payroll, human resources, time and labor management, and other back-office functions that many companies want to outsource. The company\u2019s customers primarily are in the Midwest, but it processes payroll for workers in every state in the nation plus some U.S. territories.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just a local company,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cWe compete against national, multibillion-dollar companies.\u201d\n\nCompliance is a big part of TruPay\u2019s business, too. Companies turn to the firm to ensure they are meeting requirements related to the Affordable Care Act, tax laws, labor standards and other regulations.\n\n\u201cWe help manage all that, but we also do payroll,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cPayroll continues to be a core part of our business, but it\u2019s really turned into a byproduct of what we really do.\u201d\n\nTruPay is launching a cloud-based software product called Inspire HCM that will enable clients to manage employee files \u2014 from the time a person applies for a job to the time that person retires \u2014 in one database.\n\n\u201cThis new platform will really differentiate us from our competitors,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cWe anticipate significant growth over the next three to five years, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we felt we needed to make a transition to a larger building.\u201d\n\nHe said the Inspire HCM software also will enable TruPay to serve companies of any size, and scale up with them more easily as they grow.\n\nTruPay has already demonstrated consistent growth over the past five years. The company was on Inc. Magazine\u2019s list of the nation\u2019s 5,000 fastest-growing private businesses from 2010 through 2014.\n\n\u201cThe thing that has remained constant for us is exceptional client care,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cWe provide a higher level of client care, and now we\u2019re providing a higher level of technology.\u201d\n\nkallen@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6244\n\n@KevinAllenSBT", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "New building will accommodate company's growth", "title": "TruPay expands in Mishawaka", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/trupay-expands-in-mishawaka/article_587ea021-9d6e-5366-baf3-2af9b5d2af0d.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/6b/c6b0a0c3-4184-5144-8014-3968d36a8325/5598c3bee56c1.image.jpg?resize=760%2C570", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New building will accommodate company's growth", "title": "TruPay expands in Mishawaka", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/6b/c6b0a0c3-4184-5144-8014-3968d36a8325/5598c3bee56c1.image.jpg?resize=760%2C570", "creator": "@@KevinAllenSBT", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "New building will accommodate company's growth", "Published Date": "2015-07-05T05:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "keywords": "#loc,edison lakes,mishawaka,trupay,business,local,featured", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/135687849938922"}, "news_keywords": "#loc,edison lakes,mishawaka,trupay,business,local,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc525\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe thing that has remained constant for us is exceptional client care,\u201d Rutledge said.\nMISHAWAKA \u2014 TruPay, a company that\u2019s been expanding at a steady clip since its founding in 2003, now has a lot more room to grow.\n\u201cWe help manage all that, but we also do payroll,\u201d Rutledge said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just a local company,\u201d Rutledge said.\nThe company moved at the beginning of May to a new headquarters building in the Edison Lakes Corporate Park."}
