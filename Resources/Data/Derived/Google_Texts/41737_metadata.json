It would also prohibit voters from proposing initiatives for labeling genetically engineered food at the state level.\n\nThe bill, named the \u201cSafe and Accurate Food Labeling Act,\u201d was introduced by U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-KS). The bill aims to ensure that America can continue to produce an adequate amount of food to \u201cfeed the world,\u201d Pompeo reportedly told a group of agriculture journalists.\n\nPompeo added that since there exists no evidence that genetically engineered foods posed a health or safety risk to humans, GMO labels mislead consumers into thinking there may be a safety risk.\n\nSuch legislation has received strong support from the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, a group of industry organizations including the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), which has been a major opponent of GMO-labeling efforts.\n\nProponents of GMO labeling call the bill an affront to states\u2019 rights and an attack on consumers who wish to know what they\u2019re buying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Congressman Pompeo and the GMA are willing to do whatever they can to immediately prohibit states from enacting sensible legislation for consumers to have the right to know what they\u2019re buying and feeding their families,\u201d Colin O\u2019Neil, director of government affairs at the Center for Food Safety (CFS), told Food Safety News.\n\nCFS is one of the leading proponents for GMO labeling, having donated $455,000 to labeling efforts in Washington state during the 2013 elections. At the same time, GMA spent $11 million to help defeat Washington\u2019s mandatory labeling proposal.\n\nPompeo\u2019s bill would reportedly require food companies to submit new genetically modified foods to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review. The food under review would be \u201cbase products,\u201d such as vegetables or fruits, as opposed to the final food product.\n\nPompeo added that the bill would not affect companies labeling their foods as \u201cGMO-free.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neil called the bill \u201cunworkable,\u201d saying it offered no solutions to the debate over GMO labeling. He said that the bill was unprecedented in its push to preempt state law without a federal standard in place, but that the food industry should not be underestimated in its opposition to GMO labeling.\n\n\u201cThe moneyed interests pushing this bill so urgently have a sizeable war chest,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to keep consumers in the dark.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the GMA did not return calls from Food Safety News as of press time.\n\nAs labeling efforts crop up in more states ahead of the next election cycle, the industry is seen as looking for a way to cut off new labeling measures before they make it to the ballot box, where millions more are likely to be spent on advertising campaigns.\n\nMoney spent on opposition campaigns to California\u2019s GMO-labeling Proposition 37 topped $46 million, while campaigns in favor of labeling raised $9.2 million. In Washington, GMO-labeling Initiative 522 saw $22 million in opposition funding and $8.2 million in support.\n\nTwo states, Maine and Connecticut, have passed GMO-labeling laws, but the rules for both are contingent upon other states also approving labeling laws.\n\nA labeling law in Vermont could be the first passed without such contingencies. It has cleared votes in the state\u2019s House and Senate, though it faces a legal battle from the food industry. Voters may also push forward with GMO labeling in Oregon and Colorado this November.\n\nRoughly 60 to 70 percent of processed foods in grocery stores contain at least one genetically modified ingredient, according to GMA.\n\n\u00a9 Food Safety News", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Food Safety News", "description": "Efforts to label genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have sprouted across more than two dozen states, including two successful bills in Maine and Connecticut, along with measures that came up short at the ballot box in California and Washington.
