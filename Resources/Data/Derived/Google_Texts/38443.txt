The Powerball Jackpot hit $900,000,000 Saturday morning and thousands of Kansans are taking a chance to change their lives.

"I would love to win the money," said one man buying a Powerball ticket.

The jackpot is at a record high.

Convenience stores were busy with customers buying anywhere from just one ticket to spending hundreds of dollars in office pools.

One customer said she would "take care of bills, take care of the family, the important stuff first and then celebrate."

According to the Kansas Lottery website, Kansans won $278,335.00 on the January 6th drawing.
