It could be a complete transformation for medicine.\u201d\n\nMr Hunt was speaking as he opened a new laboratory that will screen the genomes of heart patients and their families for 200 genes that cause inherited heart conditions.\n\nThese often go undetected before causing sudden cardiac death.\n\nThe footballer Fabrice Muamba suffered from one such condition and collapsed during an FA Cup match.\n\nMr Hunt said the new cardiac genetics unit at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust in London, was a prime example of how genetics can help patients.\n\nIt is estimated that one in 17 people develop rare diseases in their lifetime, 80 per cent of which have a known genetic cause.\n\nMany cancers, blood disorders, and diseases such as macular degeneration and osteoporosis all have strong genetic components.\n\nHowever, often it can take considerable time to diagnose these conditions and usually only once they have started displaying symptoms.\n\nGenetic testing raises the prospect of being able to spot patients who are at risk of these diseases and even intervene before the conditions develop.\n\nMr Hunt said: \u201cIf someone has an inherited cardiac condition, currently we would need to monitor an average of five people who are genetically linked to that people and around half will have the same genetic make up.\n\n\u201cIf you can identify the right half then you can save NHS resources.\u201d\n\nIn July this year the Department of Health launched Genomics England to oversee the 100,000 Genome Project.\n\nIt has now begun taking blood samples from cancer patients and those with inherited diseases for sequencing their genomes.\n\nThe project, which will collect 100,000 genomes by 2017, aims to use this information to help assist the treatment of patients while also looking for markers in their DNA connected to their conditions.\n\nProfessor Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England, said: \"We have begun the journey to fulfilling the vision set out by the secretary of state of realising the benefits that whole genome sequencing could bring for improving NHS care for patients with serious diseases.\n\n\"We have started taking samples from patients with rare inherited diseases and will shortly begin engaging patients with common cancers and the results of our sequencing will be known during 2014.\n\n\"The potential benefits to patients of whole genome sequencing are substantial ranging from diagnosis to selection of the best therapy. \"\n\nA genome is the basic code, consisting of 3.3 billion biochemical \u201cletters\u201d, found in almost every cell of the body that controls every biological process.\n\nFaults in this code, where the letters in a gene vary from normal, can lead to disease.\n\nSince the human genome was first sequenced in 2000 after 10 years of work and \u00a31.6 billion, the speed and cost of DNA sequencing has plummeted.\n\nA whole genome can now be sequenced for around \u00a3500 in just 11 days and as technology improves this is expected to fall further.\n\nHowever, sequencing a genome is only the first step in the process and analysing the data takes longer and is a lot harder.\n\nScientists have found that many genes interact with each other, while they can also be switched on and off by the environment or lifestyle.\n\nHowever, an estimated 10,000 human diseases are known to be caused by faults in just a single gene, while many more have several genes that play a role.\n\nProfessor Sir John Burn, a clinical geneticist at Newcastle University and a member of the government\u2019s Human Genetics Strategy Group, said there was a need to ensure the safely to any DNA kept on a national database.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is an anxiety that this data could be used against you for selective insurance if we were to lose a free at point of care health service. We might need some pretty strong legal defences against that.\n\n\u201cThere is also a problem with data handling and how we interpret this.\n\n\u201cEveryone has three million genetic variant and we have virtually no idea how many of them are medically significant. There is a need for an international consortium to study this variation. We are just staring out down this path.\u201d\n\nMedical ethicists also warn that screening entire genomes will raise questions about whether patients should be told about variants where their risk of disease is uncertain.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "health", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02759/dna_2759155k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@chalkmark"}, "keywords": "Health News,Health,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;UK_News;Science;Science_News;Health;Health_News;Richard_Gray", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/health/news", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Children could have DNA tested at birth", "section-id": 4302, "GSAGenre": "healthnews", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-health-news", "GSAMLC": "news/health/healthnews", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 10501788, "WT.cg_s": "health", "description": "Jeremy Hunt wants Britain to become the first country in the world to \n  routinely test children's entire DNA at birth to identify diseases", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "health", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-08", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-health-health_news", "last-modified": "2013-12-08", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 1027, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Richard Gray", "tag": "Richard Gray", "subsection": "Health News", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 4, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10501788, "tmgads.articleid": 10501788, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Children could have DNA tested at birth \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10501788/Children-could-have-DNA-tested-at-birth.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02759/dna_2759155k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10501788\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-08T08:50:36Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"Richard Gray\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"UK News\",\"Science\",\"Science News\",\"Health\",\"Health News\",\"Richard Gray\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Jeremy Hunt wants Britain to become the first country in the world to   routinely test children's entire DNA at birth to identify diseases", "title": "Children could have DNA tested at birth", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10501788/Children-could-have-DNA-tested-at-birth.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02759/dna_2759155k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "news", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.health.news", "DCSext.author": "Richard Gray", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-12-07 20:44"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf002\"", "article_summary": "Now Mr Hunt has set out his vision for how such DNA sequencing will become available to all NHS patients to help doctors predict disease.\nHowever, sequencing and storing the genomes of all NHS patients will be controversial as many groups fear such a DNA databases could infringe privacy.\nEvery child in Britain could have their DNA decoded at birth by the NHS to predict their risk of disease, the Health Secretary has predicted.\n\"The potential benefits to patients of whole genome sequencing are substantial ranging from diagnosis to selection of the best therapy. \"\nSince the human genome was first sequenced in 2000 after 10 years of work and \u00a31.6 billion, the speed and cost of DNA sequencing has plummeted."}
