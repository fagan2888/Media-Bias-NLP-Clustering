Smith said San Marcos city staff recommended not to participate in the city limits, but allow the ESD to operate in its ETJ.\n\nAccording to Smith, one of the reasons for the creation of the ESD was based on changes in the healthcare system. With the affordable care act (ACA), Smith said many citizens are moving from commercial to marketplace insurance programs.\n\nAs a result, San Marcos Hays County EMS, which is a non-profit, has seen revenue from patients and insurance companies diminish as calls for service increase.\n\nSmith said the average commercial insurance paid to SMHCEMS fell by $85 per call from 2013 to 2014.\n\nMedicare payments also decreased, Smith said. The average amount Medicare paid to SMHCEMS fell by $87 from 2013 to 2015.\n\nIn Kyle, Smith said the SMHCEMS, which is contracted by the city for EMS service, saw an 85 percent increase in the number of people transported in Kyle.\n\nBut patient revenue in Kyle fell by 41 percent.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s going to be tougher for small EMS agencies to continue without increases in taxpayer subsidy,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSMHCEMS increased its tax subsidy in 2015 when its directors asked Kyle for double what they normally pay for EMS services.\n\nTo combat that issue, the SMHCEMS board of directors opted to create the ESD, which would levy its own sustaining tax for operations.\n\nKyle Taylor, who is part of the SMHCEMS board, said the ESD would be self-funding without revenues from taxing entities.\n\nHe added much of the Kyle area is one of the last without a fire department and EMS ESD.\n\nWimberley, North Hays County and Buda all have dedicated EMS / ESDs.\n\nSmith said the ESD would allow for more response on the Interstate 35 corridor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to allow us to address growth and make sure we minimize taxpayer subsidies as much as possible, and increase our level of care as we expand services,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith said the ESD could levy a $.0370 tax rate to begin with. He said most ESDs in the area range between four to five cents for their tax rate.\n\nKyle Mayor Todd Webster said the ESD would create \u201csecurity and availability\u201d for EMS service in Kyle. He added he thought the creation of ESD 9 is necessary.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now and plan it well, it will cost taxpayers in the long run,\u201d Webster said.\n\nTaylor said the ESD could alleviate the increasing number of \u201cStatus Zero\u201d calls, where there are no ambulances available to cover Interstate 35.\n\n\u201cThis should have been done years back when all other ESDs were created,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt will improve the quality of EMS service and response times and the number of ambulances.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "Hays Free Press News | View Hays County's best local news online", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "www.haysfreepress.com", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "HaysFreePress | Hays Free Press", "email": "news@haysfreepress.com", "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Kyle Mayor Todd Webster said the ESD would create \u201csecurity and availability\u201d for EMS service in Kyle.\nIn Kyle, Smith said the SMHCEMS, which is contracted by the city for EMS service, saw an 85 percent increase in the number of people transported in Kyle.\nBy Moses Leos IIIAs demand for emergency services grows in Hays County, city and county officials are looking to the creation of a new emergency service district (ESD) for areas not covered by an existing department.\n\u201cIt will improve the quality of EMS service and response times and the number of ambulances.\u201d\nOn March 15, the Kyle City Council approved a resolution in support of the creation of ESD 9."}
