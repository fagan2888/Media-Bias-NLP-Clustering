"It's so much more fun to watch FOX when itâ€™s someone else being blitzed & sacked! #SuperBowl," she joked, using football terminology with her 1. 1 million plus followers on Twitter.

Longtime Democrat Clinton, 66, shared the tweet several hours after President Obama gave his annual Super Sunday interview, this year to conservative Fox News host Bill O'Reilly of The O'Reilly Factor. The two went head-to-head on issues ranging from the Affordable Care Act and the IRS scandal, to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic embassy in Benghazi, Libya -- the latter which occurred when Clinton was Secretary of State at the time.

The President later called out O'Reilly and said, "These kinds of things keep on surfacing because you and your TV station will promote them."

As of the following morning, Clinton's post was re-tweeted more than 54,000 times. Her press secretary Nick Merrill told USA Today that the tweet "was good-natured, light-hearted, and self-deprecating."
