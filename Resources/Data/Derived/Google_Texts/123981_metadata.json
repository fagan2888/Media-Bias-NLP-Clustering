The letter is running in Sunday\u2019s Dallas Morning News as a full-page ad.\n\nRead the full text below.\n\nTexas Health's \"Letter to Our Community\" by The Dallas Morning News\n\nUpdated at 5:15 p.m. by Julie Fancher: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday that 14 people who had come in contact with country\u2019s first Ebola patient have been cleared.\n\nThe CDC said out of 11 people who had direct exposure to the virus, four have completed surveillance.\n\nThe first patient believed to have come in direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan completed his 21-day surveillance Friday.\n\nJenkins called this weekend \u201ccritical\u201d as those 48 people being to complete their surveillance.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t see new patients this weekend then we will see the remainder of those 48 we were tasked with following come off the list,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see Louise and three young men come off the list and we will be statistically less likely to see more cases.\u201d\n\nDuncan\u2019s fiancee, Louise Troh and three of her family members are under quarantine through Sunday, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nJenkins also addressed Saturday\u2019s DART situation at the news conference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a whole lot about that, but I know she is not a disease contact that we are monitoring,\u201d he said at the news conference at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. \u201cThe CEO of DART tells me she is the sixth person that has thrown up on a DART facility today and that is just a part of public transportation that I was unaware of, but that it does happen.\u201d\n\nDART officials said the White Rock Station reopened shortly after 5 p.m.\n\nUpdated at 3:45 p.m. In other statement, Lyons said the person being treated at White Rock Station is not a resident of the Ivy Apartments but had stayed there for a few days \u201csome time ago,\u201d retracting information DART officials previously gave.\n\nHere is a rest of the statement:\n\nWe have also confirmed she did not vomit, she spit on the platform.\n\nShe will be taken to a local hospital for additional medical evaluation or treatment as needed.\n\nOnce she has been transported the station will be cleaned and put back in service. Although she did not vomit on either the platform or the vehicle, we are removing the railcar from service out of an abundance of caution and inspect it. We already had additional rail cars in service today to support customers attending the State Fair.\n\nWe will send a final update once White Rock Station has resumed service.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said the woman told medics she had lived at the Ivy Apartment complex and had been under ordered quarantine.\n\nEvans said the woman was feeling ill, possibly from a spider bite on her hand.\n\nShe has been transported to an area hospital for evaluation.\n\nUpdated at 2:54 p.m.: DART spokesman Morgan Lyons sent the following email statement to The Dallas Morning News about the White Rock station closure:\n\nThe person being treated by Dallas Fire Rescue at White Rock Station is NOT on any Ebola watchlist. She is being treated by DFR as a person who is ill. Updated reports indicate she got off a northbound train at the station and vomited on the platform. There are no indications of any biohazards or spills on any vehicle she has used. We are inspecting the train and the platform and will clean the facility and vehicle as needed consistent with our protocol.\n\n\n\nOriginal post at 2:28 pm.: The White Rock Station is closed to bus and rail service while Dallas Fire-Rescue responds to a report of a sick passenger, according to DART officials.\n\nTrains can go through the station, but cannot stop there.\n\nIn a news release, officials said they do not know when the station will re-open.\n\nWFAA reports the individual was being monitored for possible exposure to the Ebola virus.\n\nDART officials, however, said the individual reportedly lived in the same apartment complex as Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died earlier this month after contracting Ebola.\n\nThe train used by the customer will be removed from service and cleaned, DART spokesman Morgan Lyons said in an email.\n\nMayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas County Health Director Zach Thompson said they had not heard about anyone on the Ebola watch list getting sick at the DART station.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to tone it down to where we\u2019re reporting on facts and not rumors,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough panic already.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzEwL2RhcnRzLXdoaXRlLXJvY2stc3RhdGlvbi10ZW1wb3JhcmlseS1jbG9zZWQtc2F0dXJkYXktYWZ0ZXJub29uLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Updated at 9:45 p.m.: Texas Health Resources CEO\u00a0Barclay Berden released a community letter Saturday night that admitted the hospital made mistakes in caring for Thomas Eric Duncan.
