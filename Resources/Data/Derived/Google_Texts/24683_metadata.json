He tells Insider Louisville that while large providers such as Seven Counties Services, the University of Louisville and hospitals accept all forms of insurance, most smaller outpatient psychiatric providers do not, operating on a cash-only basis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great for the patients in Louisville, because most people have mental health coverage on their health insurance \u2013 we now technically have parity in mental health \u2013 but because so many providers don\u2019t take insurance, it really creates a financial hardship for a lot of patients,\u201d says Scheuerman. \u201c$20 copays are affordable, but going every month or two weeks for $150 is just not affordable for most people\u2026 And most primary care providers don\u2019t do psychotropics anymore, just because of legal liability.\u201d\n\nScheuerman says most smaller psychiatric clinics don\u2019t accept insurance because they do not have the staff to manage insurance companies\u2019 red tape on claims, though PsychBC \u2014 with eight offices in the Cleveland area \u2014 has a large enough staff to do so. Alex D\u2019Auria, PsychBC\u2019s community relations director in Cleveland, says the Louisville clinic will accept a wide variety of private insurers, in addition to Medicaid managed care organizations CareSource and CoventryCares.\n\nSheila Schuster, executive director of the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition, tells IL there is a lack of private practice psychiatrists who take insurance in the Louisville area partly because reimbursement rates from insurance companies are so low \u2014 even though Affordable Care Act reforms beginning in 2014 expanded the ability of private providers to bill Medicaid, beyond just Seven Counties.\n\nGwen Cooper, the spokeswoman for Seven Counties \u2014 which serves over 34,000 individuals each year \u2014 adds that doctors \u201cin private practice are not only not taking Medicaid, like some anticipated, but they are not taking the really difficult cases either.\u201d\n\nDave Langdon, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, adds that this lack of private providers is especially noteworthy for the considerable number of individuals who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201c(The) ACA aims to give parity between medical health and behavioral health services, but there are few psychiatrists or psychologists who take Medicaid,\u201d says Langdon.\n\nDr. Sarah Moyer, the interim director of city\u2019s health department, is currently attempting to tackle the increase in Louisville\u2019s suicide rate, along with the Safe & Healthy Neighborhood Department\u2019s One Love Louisville initiative. While focused on early educational campaigns, advocates also have pointed to wait lists for those seeking care and overworked clinicians.\n\nAccording to the Louisville Metro Police Department, there have been 83 confirmed suicides in Louisville through the end of September, compared to 65 at this point in 2014, in which there were 76 in total. Even with the recent uptick in murders, suicides still easily outpace them in Louisville.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "New psychiatry clinic PsychBC to accept most private insurance and Medicaid, a rarity with local mental health care providers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "New psychiatry clinic PsychBC to accept most private insurance and Medicaid, a rarity with local mental health care providers.", "title": "New psychiatry clinic to accept most private insurance and Medicaid, a rarity with local mental health care providers - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 822, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-1.12.26-PM.png", "height": 619}, "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/business/new-psychiatry-clinic-accept-private-insurance-medicaid-rarity-local-mental-health-care-providers/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Business", "tag": "mental health", "published_time": "2015-10-13T14:05:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaffc\"", "article_summary": "PsychBC, a Cleveland-based mental health care provider, is opening its first Kentucky clinic in Louisville next week, touting its somewhat unique practice of accepting most forms of health insurance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great for the patients in Louisville, because most people have mental health coverage on their health insurance \u2013 we now technically have parity in mental health \u2013 but because so many providers don\u2019t take insurance, it really creates a financial hardship for a lot of patients,\u201d says Scheuerman.\nAlex D\u2019Auria, PsychBC\u2019s community relations director in Cleveland, says the Louisville clinic will accept a wide variety of private insurers, in addition to Medicaid managed care organizations CareSource and CoventryCares.\n\u201c(The) ACA aims to give parity between medical health and behavioral health services, but there are few psychiatrists or psychologists who take Medicaid,\u201d says Langdon.\nWhile focused on early educational campaigns, advocates also have pointed to wait lists for those seeking care and overworked clinicians."}
