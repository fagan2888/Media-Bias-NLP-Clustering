Having insurers handle payments is actually the norm, officials noted.\n\nStill, both insurers and exchange officials acknowledged they\u2019re anxious about a move that shifts the $560 million in premium payments WHBE handled last year to 16 separate insurers.\n\n\u201cThis was quite an undertaking,\u201d said Marchand, who noted that WHBE has been sending notices to consumers since May. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a while, but, as you can imagine, there are individuals who haven\u2019t heeded the change.\u201d\n\nWHBE officials earlier reported enrollment of 164,000, but revised it to 155,000, lower than its projected 213,000 goal for 2015.\n\nOnly about a quarter of enrollees were sending payments directly to insurers as of late August, Marchand said. That leaves three-quarters who must make the switch this week.\n\nAt Premera Blue Cross of Washington, which has enrolled about 73,000 of the state\u2019s WHBE clients through two programs, only about 21 percent are now paying the insurer directly, said Melanie Coon, a spokeswoman.\n\nConsumers can pay their October premiums through the exchange until 4:59 p.m. on Wednesday, but after that, they\u2019ll need to submit payments to their individual carriers. Instructions for payment are available on the Washington Healthplanfinder website.\n\nThe change requires effort for clients who use credit or debit cards or automatic bank withdrawals to make payments, Marchand and Coon cautioned. Premera won\u2019t accept automatic payments until the December premium, noted Coon.\n\nExchange officials and insurers said they anticipate that there will be problems with the switch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting a small number of existing customer accounts and invoices might require additional attention,\u201d Marchand said. Coon said that there might be thousands of customers who experience problems, largely because of technical issues related to the change.\n\nBut WHBE and the insurance companies have been working for months to set up joint-response teams aimed at solving clients\u2019 problems in real time, they said.\n\nThat\u2019s key, said Kreidler, who said he\u2019s concerned that some consumers will get \u201ccaught between a rock and a hard place\u201d in the change.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a disagreement between the exchange and the insurer, it will be one where the consumer will be held harmless,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep their insurance and if they have a surgery, it\u2019ll take place as scheduled. If they have cancer treatment, they\u2019ll get their treatment.\u201d\n\nThe exchange website will be offline starting at 5 p.m. Wednesday for technical updates, Marchand said.\n\nThe payment change does not apply to small businesses, which are required to use premium aggregation under terms of the health-care law, Marchand said.\n\nThe next open-enrollment period begins on Nov. 1, for health-insurance coverage starting Jan. 1, 2016. Open enrollment continues through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nMonths of work have gone into the individual- and family-market switch, but it will probably take until October, when the insurers generate their first invoices, to gauge success, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety out there right now, whether it\u2019s with the exchange or the health insurers, because everyone wants to make sure it runs as smoothly as it needs to,\u201d Kreidler said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Starting Thursday, the 155,000 people enrolled in the Washington Health Benefit Exchange must pay their insurers directly, a change aimed at simplifying a payment system previous plagued with problems.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Starting Thursday, the 155,000 people enrolled in the Washington Health Benefit Exchange must pay their insurers directly, a change aimed at simplifying a payment system previous plagued with problems.", "title": "Big switch: Health-exchange customers to pay insurers now", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/big-switch-health-exchange-customers-to-pay-insurers-now/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Starting Thursday, the 155,000 people enrolled in the Washington Health Benefit Exchange must pay their insurers directly, a change aimed at simplifying a payment system previous plagued with problems.", "creator": "@JoNel_Aleccia", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Big switch: Health-exchange customers to pay insurers now"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-09-22 14:58:08", "modified_time": "2015-09-22 16:04:05"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7b5\"", "article_summary": "Exchange officials and insurers said they anticipate that there will be problems with the switch.\nStill, both insurers and exchange officials acknowledged they\u2019re anxious about a move that shifts the $560 million in premium payments WHBE handled last year to 16 separate insurers.\nStarting Thursday, the 155,000 people enrolled in the Washington Health Benefit Exchange must pay their insurers directly, a change aimed at simplifying a payment system previous plagued with problems.\nOnly about a quarter of enrollees were sending payments directly to insurers as of late August, Marchand said.\nThe change requires effort for clients who use credit or debit cards or automatic bank withdrawals to make payments, Marchand and Coon cautioned."}
