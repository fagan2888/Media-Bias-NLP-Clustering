So I said, \u2018Look guys, Agenda 21 will wait. We can go back and revisit that \u2026 we have to do this,\u2019\u201d Bergman said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n>>> In Depth: Why Americans Should Be Concerned About the IRS and Political Bias\n\nBergman, who has been a long-time advocate for the fair tax, grew up in a \u201cKennedy Democrat family\u201d and joined the military at age 17.\n\n\u201cI became a Republican in the Army,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter leaving the military, the self-declared Midwestern \u201crenaissance man\u201d began a career in banking. But he developed an interest in politics, which eventually led him to depart the financial services industry to run political campaigns. By 2000, he had become the national operations director for Republican Alan Keyes\u2019 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI was the talking head expert that somebody brings on, and several people always said, \u2018You should be on radio,\u2019\u201d said Bergman, who later took the advice and became a nationally syndicated talk radio host after accurately predicting Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in crucial swing states during the 2012 election cycle.\n\nBergman\u2019s decision to break into the film industry came next.\n\nWith eight independent filmmakers and award-winning film producer Judd Saul on board as director, Bergman was able to pivot the small crew\u2019s focus away from Agenda 21 and toward the production of a documentary capturing the accounts of Americans affected by the IRS\u2019 targeting.\n\nAccording to Bergman, the film\u2019s budget of $310,000 meant the crew had three to four weeks to shoot the film. From late September through October, the crew traveled across the country gathering interviews and scheduling media appearances.\n\n>>> No Apologies: Lois Lerner Breaks 16-Month Silence on IRS Scandal\n\n\u201cOur crew was made up of very talented people who didn\u2019t necessarily have our political world view, but they weren\u2019t hostile to it,\u201d said Bergman. \u201cThe whole film crew lived on the bus \u2026 and the camaraderie, stories and jokes\u2014it was like being in college again.\u201d\n\nWith 40 hours worth of footage transcribed to fit a 3-inch binder, Bergman spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with a highlighter in hand, picking out soundbites and creating the film\u2019s order.\n\nAccording to Bergman, it took nine cuts and several consultations with the film\u2019s executive producer, John Sullivan, who produced Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America,\u201d to get the film to the point where it wasn\u2019t \u201cgetting any criticism.\u201d\n\nBergman\u2019s film, \u201cUnfair: Exposing the IRS,\u201d focuses on Washington\u2019s sprawling regulatory machine and portrays the IRS as \u201cthe gestapo.\u201d\n\nThe 90-minute documentary intertwines commentary by prominent politicians and pundits such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Glenn Beck, with real stories from American veterans, families and grassroots leaders who endured personal attacks and penalties because of their political affiliation.\n\n\u201cIt is an A+ movie that we spent six months making, and I\u2019m sure that we can do better. I\u2019m a perfectionist, and I can guarantee that our next movie will raise the bar,\u201d said Bergman.\n\nOver the next two years, Bergman said he plans to produce six more documentary films on \u201chard-hitting issues\u201d such as the military police state, tax reform and the environment before branching out into more standard theatrical productions.\n\n\u201cWe have a formula that works and we\u2019re not afraid,\u201d said Bergman.\n\n\u201cUnfair: Exposing the IRS\u201d has its debut Oct. 14 in theaters nationwide for a one-night-only event.
