In the wake of public outrage following the nine-hour detention of Glenn Greenwald’s partner, David Miranda, at a U.K. airport, where authorities seized his electronic devices, new documents reveal that the U.S. government regularly uses borders to warrantlessly seize and search travelers’ laptops, phones and more.

As the New York Times reported Tuesday, the documents, released Monday by the ACLU, were obtained as part of a settlement by David House, a fundraiser for the legal defense of Chelsea Manning, who sued the Department of Homeland Security after his laptop, camera, thumb drive and cellphone were seized, their data examined by the agency for seven months, when he returned from a trip to Mexico in November 2010.
