Burwell case, which challenges the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive requirement for employers, back to the lower courts.\n\nThe justices\u2019 unanimous decision, explained in a nine-page order, was based on the information that both sides submitted a week after oral arguments were heard in the case about how and if contraceptive insurance coverage could be obtained by employees through their insurance companies without directly involving religious employers who object to this coverage.\n\nThe court made clear that it is not expressing an opinion on the merits of the cases that are challenging aspects of the federal government\u2019s health legislation and it also was not ruling on the issue of a potential violation of religious freedom.\n\nBecause of the \u201cgravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties,\u201d the court stated that religious employers and the government should be \u201cafforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners\u2019 religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners\u2019 health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nThe court stressed that this approach is \u201cmore suitable\u201d than addressing the refined positions submitted by both sides and added that \u201calthough there may still be areas of disagreement between the parties on issues of implementation, the importance of those areas of potential concern is uncertain, as is the necessity of this court\u2019s involvement at this point to resolve them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a game-changer,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the group\u2019s challenging the federal contraceptive mandate.\n\nHe said the order reflects that the court has \u201caccepted the government\u2019s concession\u201d that it can provide contraceptives to women \u201cwithout using the Little Sisters.\u201d\n\nHe also was pleased the court was forbidding the government \u201cfrom fining the Little Sisters even though they are refusing to bow to the government\u2019s will. It is only a matter of time before the lower courts make this victory permanent,\u201d he said in a May 16 statement.\n\nWashington Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl had a more nuanced look at the court\u2019s order, saying he was pleased that if offered a path forward, but he also acknowledged that \u201cthis struggle will continue.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Archdiocese is one of several plaintiffs in this case.\n\nThe cardinal said the archdiocese will continue its work to \u201cserve others in education, health care, social services, and outreach to the poor and those most in need. We will continue to do that because we are resolute that it is precisely by being true to our Catholic identity in what we proclaim and in what we do that we can continue to help realize a truly good and just society.\u201d\n\nFather Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, another of the plaintiffs, said the organization\u2019s officials are \u201cstudying the implications of this development and are encouraged by it.\u201d\n\nHe said the group, in response to the court\u2019s request for more information, showed that there is \u201ca way for the government to pursue its objectives without burdening our freedom of religion. We are ready to present these new arguments in the court of appeals.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the court has sent a case back to the lower courts in light of new developments.\n\nThe opinion stressed that sending the case back to lower courts should not affect the government from making sure women covered by petitioners\u2019 health plans obtain FDA-approved contraceptives, but it also means the government \u201cmay not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice\u201d stating their objection to the coverage.\n\nOral arguments for Zubick v. Burwell were heard March 23 and the court asked for additional information March 29. The case involves the Little Sisters of the Poor, Priests for Life, the Pennsylvania dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie, and the Archdiocese of Washington and other religious groups challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most religious and other employers must cover contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacients through employer-provided health insurance.\n\nThese groups, who do not fit the narrow exemption to the contraceptive mandate given to churches, argued that providing contraceptive coverage even indirectly through a third party, as the Obama administration allows through what it calls an accommodation, still violates their religious beliefs.\n\nCategory: U.S. & World News", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court May 16 sent the Zubick v.
