They know how to get them to reach orgasm and that it\u2019s fairly straightforward. But women\u2019s sexuality is more of a scientific mystery. Researchers are still trying to determine how to boost their sex drive, which is notoriously lower than men, and why some women don\u2019t always orgasm. Among those who do orgasm though, some also ejaculate \u2014 you probably know this as squirting \u2014 and scientists and sexually active men alike have wondered at one point or another, \u201cwhat the hell is that stuff?\u201d Yeah, it turns out it\u2019s just pee.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion a group of scientists from Parly II private hospital in Le Chesnay, France, came to after performing some tests on seven women who claimed to squirt in excess. The squirting we\u2019re talking about here isn\u2019t the milky white substance that\u2019s secreted when a woman orgasms \u2014 that\u2019s believed to come from Skene glands, which are often compared to the male prostate, and secrete into the urethra \u2014 but rather a more powerful burst of liquid, which isn\u2019t so milky white. Considering many women get the urge to pee during orgasm, it would be more far-fetched to say their ejaculate was something else rather than pee.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say women aren\u2019t ejaculating when they orgasm; the researchers found in five of the seven women small amounts of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme found in men\u2019s ejaculate that\u2019s meant to liquefy semen. But when that comes out in the form of the milky white fluid, so does a little, or a lot, or urine. \u201cThis study presents convincing evidence that squirting in women is chemically similar to urine, and also contains small amounts of PSA that is present in men\u2019s and women\u2019s true ejaculate,\u201d Barry Komisaruk, a professor at Rutgers University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told New Scientist. \u201cThis study helps to reconcile the controversy over the fluids many women report being released at orgasm,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are evidently two different fluids, with two different sources.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the researchers recruited seven women who claimed they were able to squirt about a glass of water\u2019s worth of fluid. They were first asked to provide a urine sample, and then underwent an ultrasound scan to show their bladders had been emptied. The women were then asked to try to orgasm, whether through masturbation or with a partner, and they underwent another ultrasound just before they climaxed, which showed that their bladders had refilled \u2014 you can guess where this is going. The fluid from these women\u2019s orgasms was collected and tested, and the women underwent a final ultrasound, which showed their bladders were empty again. Two out of the seven women had only released urine, according to the chemical analysis.\n\nSo there you have it, albeit based on a small study. The findings give the UK government a basis for its recent decision to ban squirting, among other sexual acts, from pornography \u2014 urolagnia, or getting pleasure from urination, is considered obscene under the UK Obscene Publications Act. The findings will also confuse squirting fetishists (squirting is the seventh most popular search term on PornHub) as they realize they\u2019ve been in love with golden showers all along. But most importantly, the findings give women more insight into what\u2019s going on with their body, thus unraveling a bit more of the mystery that is women\u2019s sexuality.\n\nSource: Salama S, Boitrelle F, Gauquelin A, Malagrida L, Thiounn N, Desvaux P.
