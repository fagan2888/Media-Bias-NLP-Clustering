SANTA CLARA — There are no second firsts. Sunday’s game doesn’t count between the Broncos and San Francisco 49ers, but it will be remembered.

The 49ers pull the curtain on Levi’s Stadium, holding the first football game in their new digs. Kids, we aren’t in Candlestick Park anymore. The is place is palatial, befitting the Super Bowl 50 it will host in two years. There are, of course, logistics to iron out.

Fans are advised to arrive early, car pool or parachute into the nearby Great American amusement park. Traffic snarled, sprinkled with detours, and navigating the lot was a bit of an adventure. But once parked, between tailgaters and rowdy fans, all became normal for an NFL Sunday.

In my previous life on the baseball beat, I provided a behind the scenes looks at ballparks. That’s not possible in the NFL given the security and lack of pregame access to the locker room. But these videos should give you a bit of a taste of the new place, which figures to be louder than normal for a preseason game.
