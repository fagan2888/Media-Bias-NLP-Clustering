Italy says it cannot confront the problems on its own.\n\nThe people of this ancient island, the southernmost reach of the Italian state and best known for its beautiful beaches and balmy climate, say their role as a symbol of the greater crisis is not one they relish.\n\n\u201cFor most people, when they think about Lampedusa, they think about the refugees and, unfortunately, they think it\u2019s not such a great place for a vacation,\u201d said Damiano Sferlazzo, Lampedusa\u2019s vice mayor. \u201cThe truth is the impact of the refugees on the day-to-day life here is minimal. This is a problem of perception.\u201d\n\nPerception is mixed on Lampedusa \u2014 between those who believe it is their duty to process and nurse to health the tattered and exhausted refugees now reaching the island by the hundreds and sometimes thousands, and those who blame the arrivals for the island\u2019s economic woes.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it is that this is a small island, and island residents have a tradition of helping out people in need on the open seas,\u201d said 53-year-old Melo Gatani, who operates a small bed-and-breakfast on Lampedusa.\n\nBut Mr. Gatani\u2019s view stands in contrast to locals who shout slurs at refugees milling through town, which is a short walk from the processing center Italy has built on the site of a former military base. A few shop owners shoo away groups of young refugees who congregate along Via Roma, the town\u2019s main drag.\n\n\u201cLook, I am not heartless, and I recognize these people are in search of a better life,\u201d said one shop owner, who asked to be identified only as Antonio, \u201cbut something has to be done. They are keeping away the paying customers.\u201d\n\nItalian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti complained recently that the Libya situation was \u201cout of control,\u201d and that her country was bearing the brunt of the cost and administration burden for a threat that affects all of Europe. She said more must be done to address the problem at its source, telling reporters, \u201cThe real issue is how to prevent people from leaving.\u201d\n\nThe refugees themselves tell harrowing tales of the passages that brought them to Lampedusa. Rough seas on inadequate boats claim the lives of some making the trip. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says about 5 percent of the refugees who set out from across the Mediterranean die en route, up from 2 percent two years ago.\n\nBut even before reaching Libya, where most of the boats start out, the migrants pass through as many as five or six countries and pay as much as $5,000 in fees to those who shepherd them along \u2014 the equivalent of as much as a decade\u2019s wages in countries like Somalia, Eritrea or Mali, where many were born.\n\n\u201cMy whole family sacrificed so I could make this trip,\u201d said 18-year-old Hassan Musa, who arrived in Lampedusa in late February, seven weeks after setting out from his native Somalia. \u201cThey are already starting to save so they can send my younger brother.\u201d\n\nThe serial unrest sparked by the Arab Spring across North Africa and the Middle East \u2014 in Tunisia, Syria, Egypt and Libya, among others \u2014 has added a new element to controlling the migrant flow for Lampedusa and other countries along Europe\u2019s southern perimeter. The U.N. estimates that the illegal migrant flow in 2014 included some 42,000 Syrians fleeing that country\u2019s brutal civil war.\n\nLooking for help\n\nThe cash-strapped Italian government is looking for help to foot the bill for the rescue operations, processing on Lampedusa, Sicily, and elsewhere and other associated costs. Estimates are that between 50 percent and 80 percent of those who land on Lampedusa ultimately settle elsewhere in Europe, and so the whole European Union should help foot more of the bill, officials in Rome say.\n\nOther countries in Europe also worry that Rome, cash-strapped already because of the struggling Italian economy, cannot afford the kind of screening and intelligence work to weed out potential terrorists in the flood of migrants being processed. The immigration processing centers are short of funds, and basic identifying procedures such as fingerprinting are hit or miss.\n\n\u201cThe biggest threat now is the lone wolf scenario, where a jihadi could use the confusion to pass himself off as an asylum-seeker to launch a major incident at one of Europe\u2019s capital cities,\u201d Sebastiano Sali, a scholar in the King\u2019s College London Department of War Studies, told the British newspaper The Express.\n\nItaly is also worried about the threat of terror threats from Libya. The Italian media has speculated that Islamic State-allied militants, who recently released a grisly video showing the beheading of nearly two dozen Egyptian Coptic Christian hostages, might sneak into the country via the processing centers in Lampedusa and elsewhere.\n\nLast year, an Islamic State propaganda magazine called Dabiq ran an image of St. Peter\u2019s Square in Rome with the Syria-based jihadi group\u2019s black-and-white flag flying above it, and a headline reading \u201cThe failed crusade.\u201d In February a taped Islamic State threat called Italy, which has not suffered a large-scale terror assault since the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, \u201cthe nation signed with the blood of the cross.\u201d The same tape warned that the terrorist group was \u201csouth of Rome\u201d in Libya.\n\n\u201cThe goal may be to simply use threats to create an atmosphere of fear,\u201d said Sabrina Magris, president of the International University School of Rome and Florence, the only European institution that prepares negotiators for hostage and terror threats. \u201cBut the threats should not be underestimated.\u201d\n\nItaly appears to be taking them seriously. In February Rome shuttered its embassy in Tripoli, Libya\u2019s capital, and in early March ships from the Italian navy started patrolling the waters between the two countries.\n\nOfficially, the ships are there to safeguard Italy\u2019s commercial and strategic interests, including its energy supply. With continued instability in Russia, energy sector analysts say that Libya, a former Italian colony that has always loomed large in Rome\u2019s strategic and economic policy, has taken on an even greater importance.\n\n\u201cItaly knows it cannot confront these issues alone,\u201d said Antonelo Fiorello, an international affairs expert in the political science department at the University of Rome. \u201cThe European Union must confront the refugee problems, and it will take an international coalition to bring stability to Libya.\u201d\n\nSome help may be on the way: Bernardino Leon, the U.N.\u2019s envoy for Libya, over the weekend threw his support behind the idea of a European Union-level naval blockade of Libya to prevent weapons, oil and terrorist recruits from reaching Europe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a measure that the European Union can take right away,\u201d Mr. Leon told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera Saturday. \u201cCome out in force to guard the seas off Libya. Italy can\u2019t do it alone. It needs help.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, back on Lampedusa, residents are bracing themselves for many more arrivals. Most analysts predict that continued instability in Libya, combined with warmer weather and calmer seas that come with springtime, will likely mean that the final numbers will show a near-tripling of the number of arrivals between 2013 and 2014 \u2014 60,000 and 175,000, respectively \u2014 and that the flood of migrants will only grow larger this year.\n\n\u201cThey say more and more migrants will arrive this year,\u201d said 79-year-old Gino Maggiore, a retired fisherman. \u201cWhatever they are doing about this problem, I hope they don\u2019t forget the impact it is having on us here on Lampedusa.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This tiny speck of an island \u2014 much closer to the North African coast than to Sicily and the rest of Italy \u2014 has taken on an outsize role in the debate over illegal immigration, becoming, for many in Italy and across Europe, the face of the migrant crisis and the conduit for exporting Arab instability across the Mediterranean.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "This tiny speck of an island \u2014 much closer to the North African coast than to Sicily and the rest of Italy \u2014 has taken on an outsize role in the debate over illegal immigration, becoming, for many in Italy and across Europe, the face of the migrant crisis and the conduit for exporting Arab instability across the Mediterranean.", "title": "Lampedusa, Italy, becomes symbol of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis as refugees crowd tiny island", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/8/lampedusa-italy-becomes-symbol-of-europes-migrant-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/08/3_8_2015_italy8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/08/3_8_2015_italy8201.jpg", "description": "This tiny speck of an island \u2014 much closer to the North African coast than to Sicily and the rest of Italy \u2014 has taken on an outsize role in the debate over illegal immigration, becoming, for many in", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Lampedusa, Italy, becomes symbol of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis as r"}, "Author": "Eric J.
