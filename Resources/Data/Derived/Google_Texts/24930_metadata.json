It\u2019s been a wildly uneven season of SNL, and it\u2019s hard to say that any one episode has been a wild success (Kerry Washington\u2019s turn as host was likely the best of the season), but the high points have been incredibly high, displaying the potential that she has once it moves past its rebuilding season. Even the worst episodes (Ed Norton, John Goodman) have featured something that made the episode worthwhile (at least for those who only watch highlights the next morning).\n\nThere is clearly a lot of talent on the show, with Kate McKinnon and Taran Killam already on the verge of breaking out (and Cecily Strong isn\u2019 far behind). The biggest complaint about this season \u2014 besides the lack of a black female cast member, or the fact that we still can\u2019t name most of the new cast members \u2014 is that it\u2019s over-relied on the two most veteran cast members, Kenan Thompson and Bobby Moynihan. They\u2019ve had some success as bit players on the show, but neither should be trying to carry SNL, which is what they seem to be doing in some of this season\u2019s episode. As the best 5 videos of the year so far suggest, it\u2019s time to let Taran, Kyle Mooney, and Jay Pharaoh take the lead. (Note, too, that all five are pre-taped, which might also say something about the current cast\u2019s improvisational skills, or lack thereof.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake host this week.
