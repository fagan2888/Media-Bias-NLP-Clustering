Two motorcyclists were killed Sunday in separate crashes only 12 hours apart, according to reports from Louisville Metro Police.

Around 2:15 a.m., police responded to a motorcycle-versus-car collision in the 7100 block of South Watterson Trail. Police say a 30-year-old man driving a Honda motorcycle and driving northbound crossed over into the southbound lane of traffic and began to lay down the motorcycle.

A gray Ford Fusion traveling southbound hit the motorcycle, according to LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell. The driver of the Ford was not injured, but the motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene. He was wearing a helmet at the time of the collision.

No charges are expected in that collision.

Half a day later and about 20 miles away, another motorcyclist was pronounced dead near the intersection of Cane Run Road and Poplar View Drive.

Around 2:15 p.m., a Chrysler 300 tried to turn left onto southbound Cane Run Road, but failed to notice a motorcycle traveling north on Cane Run, Mitchell said. The motorcycle struck the car.

No one besides the motorcyclist was injured in that second accident. Mitchell said he didn't believe alcohol was a factor in the collision. He said the LMPD traffic division is still investigating.

Traffic on Cane Run Road is currently moving slowly as police work the scene. Mitchell said there are no detours at this point, though.
