But his tolerance quickly ran out.\n\n\u201cEither sit down and keep quiet or get out,\u201d he told the first young man who stood up and tried to talk over him. \u201cEither one. We\u2019re done with you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe crowd loudly booed the demonstrator, making it impossible to hear him. Eventually, police officers escorted the man out of the room.\n\nSoon enough, Kailee Whiting rose in her seat, shouting out a question about the lane closings near the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWas she supposed to take him at his word that he knew nothing about the scheme, she asked? She, too, was drowned out by waves of boos, then was walked out of the room by police officials.\n\n\u201cChris Christie never would have called on me,\u201d she said afterward.\n\nAnd so it went for much of the forum here in Burlington County, near Philadelphia.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the hecklers were college students affiliated with the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, a left-leaning organization. Members of the group said that since the bridge scandal erupted, they had tired of watching Mr. Christie hold town-hall-style meetings during the workday in Republican-leaning communities where, in their eyes, skeptics are scarce. The group\u2019s argument, in essence, is that the protesters provided a dose of balance. It promised to keep up the tactics.\n\n\u201cWe are not letting him sweep everything under the rug,\u201d said Analilia Mejia, the alliance\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe plan to use every opportunity to point out that people are tired of business as usual.\u201d\n\nA disappointed-sounding Mr. Christie said protesters had not just violated basic rules of civility but also set back democratic dialogue. \u201cWhen people just stand up and yell and scream and divide, then it shuts down debate and discussion,\u201d he told the audience here.\n\nHe assured the crowd that he was eager to hear from friends as well as foes.\n\n\u201cI call on people randomly as they raise their hand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I call on one of those people and they want to yell at me, fine, yell at me. That\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t take away from everybody else, for your own partisan, personal purposes, the ability for your question\u201d \u2014 he pointed to the audience \u2014 \u201cto be heard. That\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Christie\u2019s critics, who arrived prepared to grill him over the pace of recovery from Hurricane Sandy and his support for fracking, followed his advice, quietly sitting through the forum. Near the end of the session, a group of about eight people held up colorful signs that read \u201cDon\u2019t Frack Our Water,\u201d but they did not interrupt Mr. Christie.\n\nDespite the heckling, Mr. Christie managed to field a variety of more routine questions, about the state\u2019s commitment to treating those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the health of the state\u2019s pension system and his rationale for opposing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe frequently earned loud applause as he described plans to defend New Jersey taxpayers against what he has long described as the free-spending tendencies of the State Legislature, run by Democrats.\n\nMost members of the audience seemed both startled and embarrassed by the periodic outbursts.\n\nWilliam Brockner, a truck driver whom Mr. Christie called on, said later that he could barely restrain himself from lashing out at the protesters. \u201cI asked a state cop if I could go over there and slap them upside the head,\u201d he said in an interview. His request, he said, was denied.\n\n\u201cI am a truck driver \u2014 I know how to be rude,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you have to follow the rules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140313204252, "twitter": {"description": "Six critics of Gov.
