Imagine if a person has two or three children, you know, and they\u2019re raising them \u2013 of course they would have to go out and get another job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is still not enough to raise a family on. We\u2019re part time here. . . We only work four hours a night.\u201d\n\nSmith spoke during a video interview with The Brew as negotiations begin on behalf of 10,500 commercial office cleaners in the Baltimore-Washington area (among them 700 from Baltimore).\n\n_________________________________\n\nA Justice for Janitors rally is planned TODAY at 4 p.m. at the corner of Light and Pratt streets downtown.\n\n_________________________________\n\nWith the current contract set to expire at midnight on October 15, the focus of negotiations is getting workers more full-time hours so that they will qualify for full health-care benefits under the Affordable Care Act, according to the union bargaining on their behalf, 32BJ SEIU (Service Employees International Union).\n\nIn Baltimore, part-time cleaners earn $12.70 and full-time cleaners earn 13.20, according to Julie Karant, an organizer with 32BJ.\n\nSmith said she works 20 hours a week and does not receive full employer-paid healthcare.\n\nCurrently part-time cleaners have dental, vision, prescription deductibles and life insurance, but not full employer-paid health care, Karant said. Many cleaners work other part-time or full-time jobs to get by.\n\n\u201cThe Washington region\u2019s multi-billion dollar real estate industry can afford to allow hard-working cleaners the opportunity to earn full-time wages and affordable health care,\u201d said Jaimie Contreras, 32BJ Vice President and Capital Area Director.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that these men and women don\u2019t have to work multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nApproximately 90% of the employees represented are Latino and the other 10% are African-American, according to SEIU.\n\n\u201cA strong contract will improve many things for working families and create better opportunities for our children,\u201d said Oscar Vasquez, a Washington, D.C. cleaner.\n\nThe custodians work for companies including Red Coats, American Building Maintenance, Metropolitan Maintenance Building Services and USSI, Karant said. The companies arrange for custodians to clean about 40 buildings downtown.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baltimore Brew", "creator": "@baltimorebrew", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "https://content.baltimorebrew.com//content/uploads/2015/06/Frances-Smith-office-cleaner-SEIU.jpg", "height": 720}, "title": "Whoever cleans your office is probably not getting full-time hours or benefits | Baltimore Brew", "site": "@baltimorebrew", "type": "article", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Baltimore Brew is a daily online journal featuring independent reporting and informed commentary about greater Baltimore.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5f4\"", "article_summary": "In the world of commercial janitorial services \u2013 where it\u2019s nearly impossible to find full-time work and benefits \u2013 it takes holding down multiple jobs.\nIn Baltimore, part-time cleaners earn $12.70 and full-time cleaners earn 13.20, according to Julie Karant, an organizer with 32BJ.\nSo says Frances Smith, a Baltimore native, grandmother and part-time office cleaner who got by for 17 years as an office cleaner and even sent her grandson to Catholic school.\nCurrently part-time cleaners have dental, vision, prescription deductibles and life insurance, but not full employer-paid health care, Karant said.\nMany cleaners work other part-time or full-time jobs to get by."}
