That is who we are as Americans and it is something we\u2019ll never allow anyone to take away from us,\u201d the President added.\n\nHe concluded by calling upon God: \u201cMay God bless those we\u2019ve lost and may God continue to bless the United States of America.\u201d\n\nMultiple media outlets were in attendance including CNN, WTOP, and an ABC affiliate.
