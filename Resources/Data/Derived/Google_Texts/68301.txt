When you think of Mississippians, you think of authors, musicians, and sometimes even actors. Mississippi has long been known to be a breeding ground of talent.

"Sometimes in life, we are digging for our destiny and we get discouraged and tired and don't realize we are right there," Gospel singer Dathan Thigpen said. "If I had given up just last year, I would never have reached this point."

Thigpen took home the Sunday Best Winner in 2015, a show that is the American Idol of gospel singers. Thigpen was in Meridian last week to speak to the alumni of Jackson State University about his story and how he came to be where he is today.

"I can't be anybody else because that's been taken already," said Thigpen. "I can only be me. I think people of any age connect to people who are just true to themselves. I think that's worked with me to relate to young people or older people."

Recently Thigpen was signed by Kirk Franklin, a world renowned Gospel Singer. Thigpen says that he recently learned that Mississippi has had more Grammy nominated singers than any other state and in the country. He says that a lot of why musicians are successful in Mississippi is because of our history.

"In Mississippi, we developed in the beginning a culture of singing, our people," said Thipgen. "I think that's where that rich history started from. It moved on and grew into other things because things started to happen. You know we didn't have the things that were going on now, but you still have that rich history of music."

For Thigpen his message has always been simple. Keep digging, because no matter where you may be in life, the answers for what you are looking for could be right there.

Thigpen has also been an actor in movies that appeared on BET.
