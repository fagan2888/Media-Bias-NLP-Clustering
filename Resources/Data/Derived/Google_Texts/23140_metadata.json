I went straight from my last finals to St. Mary\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe slept on the floor of the house owned by the family who were leading the effort to set up a fishing cooperative in the town.\n\nThey had a lot to gain. Back then, the biggest salmon markets were in Europe, where salmon farming was not yet a force. King salmon was selling for $7 a pound in France.\n\nWorking with a fish processor within rules set by Food and Drug Administration, Burke was part of a crew that set up a commercial operation in the village that was one of the first to ever transport fish to market by airplane using Alaska Airlines\u2019 737s.\n\nHe spent one summer in St. Mary\u2019s.\n\n\u201cGood people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cReally interesting situation - interesting way to get involved with the fishing industry.\u201d\n\nHe left the Yukon to finish a fish sciences degree in Washington sponsored by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, his next employer in Alaska.\n\nFRED\n\nBurke got his practical introduction with Fish and Game\u2019s Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Division, but had studied parasites affecting king salmon at the University of Washington.\n\nThe research he did there led him to a job with the fish pathology department of FRED Division, which administered Alaska\u2019s network of salmon hatcheries created by the Alaska Legislature.\n\nHe would continue his education in the early 1980s, focusing on a virus affecting sockeyes.\n\n\u201cThere were no sockeye smolt hatcheries anywhere in North America,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI went to a hatchery in Prince William Sound in 1983, and they turned that into a sockeye smelt hatchery, so it was the first one.\u201d\n\nHe worked his way up the Fish and Game ladder to the commissioner\u2019s office as a chief fisheries scientist. The Pacific Salmon Treaty was signed in 1985, and Burke left the department for SSRAA five years later.\n\nRoe saved SSRAA\n\nThe success of the Ketchikan-area salmon hatchery was far from certain when Burke joined the program in 1998.\n\nSSRAA had racked up $17 million in debt from the Fisheries Enhancement Revolving Loan Fund, a state account set up to give hatcheries the capital needed to get running.\n\n\u201cI was still working for Fish and Game at that point,\u201d said Cindy Lassiter, a former fish culturist in southern Southeast and a member of SSRAA\u2019s board. \u201cIt seemed like everything was pretty unsettled, because you can only be in debt so far without having a really hard time, and they were.\u201d\n\nPaying back the debt, which was quickly growing, meant cost recovery - catching and selling terminal chum salmon returning to Neets Bay.\n\nThere was a problem: No one wanted the chum.\n\n\u201cThere was a real chance that we weren\u2019t going to exist and that we were going to go bankrupt. I mean a real chance,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pay back $19 million with fish that nobody wants to buy.\u201d\n\nSSRAA leaders struck a deal with Japanese buyers for chum roe, using a custom processor called Signature Seafood and other Ketchikan processors to supply them.\n\nThe value for roe in Japan, Burke said, and an unexpected and unprecedented return in Burke\u2019s first year, \u201cbasically saved SSRAA.\u201d\n\nThe first summer\n\nIn 1998, five times the expected number of chum salmon returned to Neets Bay.\n\nThe chum run is just beginning in early July and hits its peak at the end of the month. Shortly after the Fourth of July, Burke boarded a floatplane to check on the hatchery and landed on a bay stuffed with fish.\n\n\u201cThere literally were jumpers all the way from the inside of the bay to Clover Pass. I didn\u2019t know this wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal.\u201d\n\nNorQuest Seafoods, which has since been purchased by Trident Seafoods, was processing the chums for SSRAA along with Signature Seafoods. Burke was then dealing with NorQuest bosses Terry Gardner and John Sound.\n\n\u201cThey came that afternoon and said, \u2018Look, we promised, even legally, that we would take care of half the fish. But John, every corridor now is full of fish. We can\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Burke said.\n\nSSRAA soon opened the bay to the common property fishery, and almost 60 seiners would flow through Neets Bay.\n\n\u201cMost of them were deck loaded,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was before we would even anticipate the peak of the run.\u201d\n\nAbout 35 million pounds of chums were taken from the bay that summer, but SSRAA never got a full accounting from the five different processors that operated in Neets.\n\nIn a good year, the hatchery collects 10 million pounds from the bay.\n\n\u201cI used to wake up - I\u2019m not kidding you - wake up about midnight and go, \u2018OK, how many people are in the United States? If each person ate - Oh, we\u2019ll never get rid of these fish!\u2019\u201d Burke said.\n\nTwo years close to the \u201898 record came after Burke\u2019s first year, but chum returns would eventually level out. In the next 10 years, SSRAA had worked itself out of debt.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWith SSRAA planning to take over the coho facility in Klawock, the organization will operate seven hatcheries.\n\nThe growth puts more pressure on Neets Bay to cover most of SSRAA\u2019s $10.5 million operating costs, but the organization is planning changes to cover its bases.\n\nWith costs of construction and permitting always increasing, the \u201ckey right now\u201d is building on what you have, Burke said.\n\nBurnett Inlet is one of SSRAA\u2019s only hatchery sites with room for growth.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you do is increase the release at Burnett so you have a backup for Neets Bay egg takes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get a bad storm or something we won\u2019t make our egg take goal for a year. We\u2019re also on the red line in most years, or some years, for cost recovery there.\u201d\n\nChum production at Burnett Inlet could be increased by up to 40 million eggs, according to Burke.\n\nSSRAA is also investigating new release sites for its salmon fry in the Ketchikan area, but among the most obvious choices is near the Klawock River Hatchery: Port Assumption, which already has a permit from the state.\n\nRetirement?\n\nWhile Burke won\u2019t be working full time for SSRAA - he\u2019s moving back to Marrowstone Island in Washington state - he\u2019ll stay involved with the hatchery\u2019s research with Fish and Game into salmon fitness.\n\nBurke also plans to help with the management of Neets Bay, noting that SSRAA has grown enough that the incoming general manager, David Landis, \u201chas other things to do in the summer than just go to Neets Bay.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s comfortable with SSRAA\u2019s direction, particularly because of its higher-than-average number of long-term employees, and Lassiter agreed.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control what happens in the ocean, but I think that SSRAA personnel from the bottom to the top have really figured out the best way to do things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason that I\u2019m not so nervous is David has a really good background in all the stuff besides fisheries. SSRAA is now a pretty big business. There\u2019s a lot of money that goes through there and back into the fleets and southern Southeast as a whole.\u201d\n\nSSRAA and hatcheries in Prince William Sound are working with the state on an expansive, $16 million project to determine hatcheries\u2019 effect on wild salmon stocks.\n\nBurke, a passionate defender but initial skeptic of Alaska\u2019s hatchery program, will continue his role in that research.\n\n\u201cSome of us would contend - and this would really be controversial; people don\u2019t like to hear it - that the hatcheries, if they\u2019re run properly, actually support the wild populations that are around because they add spawners to the systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t delete the fitness of those fish, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on, particularly if you use local stocks.\u201d\n\nHis mind wasn\u2019t always made up, as back in the early days of the FRED Division, some were over-selling the potential of hatcheries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people in Prince William Sound liked me seeing their papers early in the process,\u201d Burke said, adding that even though he had his doubts, \u201cThe best way to do something is not to shoot at it from a distance. Get involved and try to make it right.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Ketchikan (Alaska) Daily News, http://www.ketchikandailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "For John Burke, a 40-year career in Alaska fisheries began on the floor of a house in St. Mary's, a small bush community on Yukon River.", "Author": "NICK BOWMAN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For John Burke, a 40-year career in Alaska fisheries began on the floor of a house in St. Mary\u2019s, a small bush community on Yukon River.", "title": "Burke leaving regional aquaculture association", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/burke-leaving-regional-aquaculture-association/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/fisheries_expert_retires.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/fisheries_expert_retires.jpeg", "title": "Burke leaving regional aquaculture association", "description": "For John Burke, a 40-year career in Alaska fisheries began on the floor of a house in St. Mary's, a small bush community on Yukon River.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "In late January, Burke will retire as the general manager of the Southern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association.\nIf each person ate - Oh, we\u2019ll never get rid of these fish!\u2019\u201d Burke said.\nRoe saved SSRAAThe success of the Ketchikan-area salmon hatchery was far from certain when Burke joined the program in 1998.\nThe Washington state native who got in on the ground floor of Alaska\u2019s salmon hatchery program took a look back at his career in fisheries.\n\u201cThe first thing you do is increase the release at Burnett so you have a backup for Neets Bay egg takes,\u201d he said."}
