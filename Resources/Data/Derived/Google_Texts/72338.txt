DEARBORN, Mich., July 3 (UPI) -- Ford Motor Company on Thursday announced the recall of more than 430,000 vehicles in North America due to a bug in a software module that, in some cases, can prevent the cars' engines from turning off.

In a news release, the automaker said the recall affects more than 432,000 2015 model Focus, C-MAX and Escape vehicles in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The company said the body control module needs an update.

"In these vehicles, it could be possible for the engine to continue to run after turning the ignition key to the 'off' position and removing the key, or after pressing the Engine Start/Stop button," Ford said in a statement on its website.

Ford detailed which models are affected, which involves certain vehicles made over the past year in Michigan and Kentucky.

"Affected vehicles include certain 2015 Focus vehicles built at Michigan Assembly Plant from June 17, 2014, through June 12, 2015; certain 2015 C-MAX vehicles built at Michigan Assembly Plant from April 22, 2014, through June 12, 2015; and certain 2015 Escape vehicles built at Louisville Assembly Plant from April 1, 2014, through June 12, 2015."

Ford will notify owners of the software update and perform them at dealerships at no cost.
