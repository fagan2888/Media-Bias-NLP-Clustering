Over the next 36 hours, we raced each other through the pages to learn the fate of Harry Potter, his Hogwarts friends, and the world of wizardry in general. In the last full chapter, the boy wizard at last defeats the evil Voldemort. An epilogue set 19 years later shows that Harry has achieved an ambiguous adult normality, with a happy marriage, a station wagon, and three children who are off to Hogwarts themselves. The series\u2019 final sentence refers to the scar Harry has carried since the murder of his parents when he was a baby: \u201cThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years,\u201d it reads. \u201cAll was well.\" Related Story Marriage Equality Without Equivocation Millions of young people drew from Deathly Hallows a message every young person longs to hear: that they can triumph over the outsize fears of adolescence, and that beyond them await full and normal lives. Let\u2019s imagine, though, that the World\u2019s Greatest Literary Critic\u2014call him Gilderoy Lockhart\u2014reviews the book in the World\u2019s Most Important Literary Journal. Lockhart notes what he considers an important grammatical fact in the next-to-last sentence: It is written only in the past perfect. It does not say, \u201cThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years, did not pain him now, and would not pain him in the future.\u201d That means, Lockhart explains, that the scar has begun to hurt at that moment\u2014and will continue to hurt forever. He points to other places in the series where Rowling has written that things \u201cdid not\u201d hurt or \u201cwould not\u201d hurt. Affirming that the scar \u201chad not pained Harry\u201d means denying that it \u201cis not\u201d painful or \u201cwill not\u201d be painful. \u201cAll was well\u201d means that all had been well up to that moment, but was not well any more and would never be well again.\n\n\u201cRowling knows how to use the simple past or the simple future tense when she chooses,\u201d Lockhart writes. \u201cShe did not use it. Using one tense excludes all other tenses.\u201d The book\u2019s \u201ccorrect\u201d message to the young is this: There is no hope. The world is a dark plain of Dursleys and Malfoys, under the eternal shadow of You-Know-Who. Suppose now that J.K. Rowling contests this reading; the choice of past perfect in context encompasses past, present, and future, she might say. Lockhart dismisses her evidence as self-interested and dishonest. Other critics argue that one sentence, taken in isolation, cannot determine the meaning of an epic series sprawling over more than 3,000 pages. These critics, too, Lockhart says, are deceitful or incompetent. His reading is the only correct one. In literary circles (where I once alas dwelt), Lockhart\u2019s review would be ascribed to spite and envy, the kind of destructive criticisms in which some critics engage to prove that they matter. But in fact it would be worse than spiteful. It would be wrong. This kind of erroneous reading is at the center of King v. Burwell, the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act. King, which will be argued in front of the Supreme Court on March 4, involves the interaction of four short sections of the 1,200-page Act. These sections are crucial to its goal of providing health insurance to millions of American families who could not afford it before. The first of these is Section 1501, the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring heads of households to obtain health insurance or pay a tax. The second is Section 1311(b)(1), which instructs states to set up \u201cAmerican Health Benefit Exchanges\u201d so that their residents can find suitable policies. The third is Section 1401, which directs the Internal Revenue Service to provide tax credits and subsidies for millions of low- and middle-income taxpayers for policies purchased on \u201can Exchange established by the State under 1311.\u201d The fourth, Section 1321, recognizes that the federal government can\u2019t order states to do anything (the Supreme Court has made that clear); thus if for any reason a state chooses not to set up an exchange (or tries to, like Oregon, and fails), the federal government is required to \u201cestablish and operate such Exchange within the State.\u201d\n\nDespite predictions of disaster by its opponents, the system has begun to work relatively well. According to a report this week by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the ACA in 2014 provided insurance for 12 million people who otherwise would be uninsured; that number will rise to 19 million by the end of 2015. Estimates of the cost of the ACA, meanwhile, are lower than initially projected, according to the CBO. But conservative lawyers have vowed to destroy Obamacare. In King, they argue that one phrase (not even a complete sentence) should doom the entire 1,200-page Act. They claim that when 1401 says \u201cestablished by the state\u201d it means\u2014can only mean\u2014one thing. Consumers whose states don\u2019t establish exchanges\u2014and who thus must get their coverage through a federal exchange set up for the state\u2014don\u2019t get their subsidies. The entire ACA system may collapse. That collapse is what the challengers hope for. If the Supreme Court accepts that reading, the loss of subsidies and credits will price coverage out of reach for middle-income consumers in 34 states. As many as 9 million people will lose their insurance; the interstate insurance market will be set in turmoil; the entire ACA system may collapse. That collapse is what the challengers hope for. Their argument is that the statute doesn\u2019t say \u201cestablished by the state or by the federal government.\u201d Does it need to? A federal exchange is \u201csuch\u201d exchange, meaning the same thing as a state exchange. Let\u2019s look at dictionaries endorsed by Justice Antonin Scalia. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csuch\u201d as meaning \u201cof this kind or that kind . . . That or those; having just been mentioned.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as, \u201c[o]f the character, degree, or extent described, referred to, or implied in what has been said.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language says simply, \u201c[o]f this kind.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary says, \u201cof the same or a similar kind.\u201d The New Oxford American Dictionary says, \u201cof the type previously mentioned.\u201d The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary says, \u201cof the kind, degree, or category previously specified or implied contextually.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In King v.
