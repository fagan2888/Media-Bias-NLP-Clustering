The left fielder has long set Monday\u2019s game as a goal for his return and seems likely to play in the series-opener, barring any unforeseen issues.\n\nWhen asked about Werth, Williams was optimistic but noncommittal.\n\nSEE ALSO: The Rundown: Nationals avoid the sweep with extra-inning win\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he wakes up [Monday]. Today he\u2019s good, so we\u2019ll make that determination in the morning.\u201d\n\nWerth, 35, had surgery to repair the AC joint in his right shoulder Jan. 9 and was limited in spring training. He played in the outfield and ran the bases but did not take an at-bat in a Grapefruit League game.\n\nWerth began the season on the 15-day disabled list and was eligible to be activated Saturday. He played in three games during a minor-league rehabilitation assignment at Single-A Potomac last week, finishing 1-for-6 with a solo home run and three walks. He started in left field twice and served as a designated hitter in his most recent appearance.\n\nShould the Nationals decide to activate Werth for Monday\u2019s game, they could start him in left field or slot him as the designated hitter to ease him back into big-league action.\n\nRendon taking light swings\n\nWilliams said third baseman Anthony Rendon is taking light swings at the team\u2019s minor-league facility in Viera, Florida, which is the next step in his return from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee.\n\nRendon recently progressed from lateral movement drills to fielding ground balls. Williams said he\u2019s started hitting balls off a tee or tossed lightly to him by a coach. He began the season on the 15-day disabled list and was eligible to return Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running, he\u2019s swinging, he\u2019s throwing, he\u2019s taking groundballs. So all of those things are good,\u201d Williams said. \u201cJust tee and flip right now, just to make sure that he gets through that part of it without any issue. But yeah, he\u2019s doing all of it, swinging and running.\u201d\n\nScherzer turns in six strong innings\n\nMax Scherzer was as good as advertised on Opening Day, and he followed up that performance with six solid innings of work Sunday against the Phillies.\n\nScherzer allowed only six hits and one earned run while striking out eight. On multiple occasions, he used his cutter, a recent addition to his pitch repertoire, to finish off at-bats.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the pitch I\u2019ve been working at,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a version of my slider. I think I have a chance to pick it up quicker than most pitches you would take, so hopefully I continue to make strides with that pitch and bring it into my game as much as I can.\u201d\n\nScherzer was unhappy with his fastball command Sunday and said he was inconsistent working out of the windup. However, he has allowed only one earned run in his first 13 2/3 innings with the Nationals.\n\nRobinson comfortable at the plate\n\nMaking just his second start of the season in left field, Clint Robinson went 3 for 5 with a double and a run in Washington\u2019s 4-3 win over the Phillies, scoring what proved to be the decisive run.\n\n\u201cI feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to go out there and keep it simple and let the ball fall where it falls.\u201d\n\nRobinson has spent most of his professional career in the minor leagues, and he had only 13 big-league at-bats and three hits entering this season. In limited playing time with the Nationals, however, he is hitting 4 for 10 and appears headed for an uptick in playing time.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep him as fresh as we possibly can with those at-bats,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe can play both outfield positions. He plays first base. So there\u2019s a lot of options for him depending on our main guys getting a day off or, like today, getting him into the lineup to boost our offense a little bit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Werth met up with the team in Washington on Sunday and traveled to Boston, while third baseman Anthony Rendon is now taking light swings as his rehabilitation process continues.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Werth met up with the team in Washington on Sunday and traveled to Boston, while third baseman Anthony Rendon is now taking light swings as his rehabilitation process continues.", "title": "Jayson Werth rejoins Nationals, likely to play Monday against the Red Sox", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/12/jayson-werth-rejoins-nationals-likely-play-monday-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/AP533580653650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/AP533580653650.jpg", "description": "Werth met up with the team in Washington on Sunday and traveled to Boston, while third baseman Anthony Rendon is now taking light swings as his rehabilitation process continues.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jayson Werth rejoins Nationals, likely to play Monday against the Red"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Matt Williams, Philadelphia Phillies, Jayson Werth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb60b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s running, he\u2019s swinging, he\u2019s throwing, he\u2019s taking groundballs.\nWhen asked about Werth, Williams was optimistic but noncommittal.\nManager Matt Williams said Werth would travel with the team to Boston for its three-game series against the Red Sox, which begins Monday.\nSo all of those things are good,\u201d Williams said.\nToday he\u2019s good, so we\u2019ll make that determination in the morning.\u201dWerth, 35, had surgery to repair the AC joint in his right shoulder Jan. 9 and was limited in spring training."}
