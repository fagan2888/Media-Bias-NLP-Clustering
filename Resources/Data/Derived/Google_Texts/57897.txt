YAOUNDE, Cameroon–Cameroon’s President Paul Biya signed a bill on Wednesday that will allow Niger to export its crude oil through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline.

Niger and Cameroon’s state-run National Hydrocarbons Corporation (SNH) reached an agreement last October to allow it to pump its crude oil through the 1,080 kilometer-long pipeline which will give it access to terminals on the Atlantic coast.

Niger produces 60,000 barrels of oil a day, according to its Energy Minister Foukomaya Gando. It will construct a 600 kilometer pipeline that will link its Agadem bloc to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline and could start exporting by 2016.

The landlocked African country will be joining Chinese energy giant China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPCIC) and Canada’s Griffiths Energy International in using the pipeline to transport crude oil.

About 500 million barrels of crude oil has been exported from Chad through the pipeline since it went in operation in October 2003.
