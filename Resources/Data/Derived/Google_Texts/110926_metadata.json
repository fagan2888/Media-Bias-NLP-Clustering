Flirting some and joshing a lot. Fitting in with friends who've got your back, who know your quirks and accept you anyway because you accept them.\n\nIn a way, there was nothing special about these 19 Central High students passing a few hours at West Lanes near 72nd and Dodge.\n\nBut they had trained for this. They spent the day before rehearsing what it would be like to rent shoes and buy fries, how to congratulate your teammate and not to dwell on defeat.\n\nThis outing was less about bowling and more about making human connections.\n\nWelcome to Central Mixer. It's a social skills club catering to students who have struggled to fit in. Some club members deal with impairments that are not always obvious, such as autism, a developmental disorder characterized by communication difficulties.\n\nAutism symptoms and abilities can range greatly. One 16-year-old club member, for example, did not speak for the first six years of his life. He speaks just fine now, but with an earnestness and a higher-pitched voice that endear him to friends and make him a target for bullies.\n\nThat's kind of how it is with the others. They look like your everyday teenager but have a tic or a habit that to peers can seem strange. And in the sometimes-mean years of high school, that can be terribly isolating.\n\nThe day I visited, many of the students who were meeting in a third-floor classroom at Central described being bullied. Some coped by clamming up to avoid becoming a target.\n\n\u201cI barely talked to people,\u201d said Jaylin Dixson, a junior.\n\n\u201cYou were not the only one,\u201d said David Gooch, also a junior.\n\nThey are academically able enough to hold their own in the classroom, including honors classes. Yet an outing as innocuous as a football game or bowling presents social tripwires.\n\nA pair of young teachers recognized this last year when students they worked with complained of loneliness.\n\nHere, among some 2,400 students, they had no one to eat lunch with or talk to in the hallways or hang with on a weekend.\n\nStephanie Goodrich\n\nStephanie Goodrich, a resource teacher, and Samantha Zickefoose, a speech-language therapist, decided to act. At a high school with clubs for chess, Dungeons and Dragons, Harry Potter and fishing, they launched Mixer.\n\nThey intentionally schedule monthly outings on Friday evenings, so Mixer members could have weekend plans like their peers. They hold club meetings the day before, to prepare students who might be confounded, for example, by crowded bleachers.\n\nWhen the club launched last year, seven members signed up. Now there are 30.\n\nGoodrich and Zickefoose recruited other teachers and a friendly security guard to help. They held fundraisers to keep events affordable.\n\nSamantha Zickefoose\n\nAnd they stuck to two basic rules: Pass all your classes. And stick with the other students in the club instead of palling around with teachers.\n\n\u201cTeachers with teachers, students with students,\u201d is Goodrich's mantra.\n\nStudents are there to socialize with each other.\n\nThe teachers' role is to serve as guardian angels. They head off potential conflicts, such as when the sole cook at West Lanes got bombarded with orders, and the Mixer teens wanted to check and recheck to see if their burger was ready yet.\n\nGoodrich reminded them the cook was busy and said they'd be told when their food was ready.\n\nClub members are told to treat each other the way they would like to be treated.\n\nWhen a blond 16-year-old told me some peers cruelly called him \u201cSpongeBob,\u201d a fellow club member piped up:\n\n\u201cThere IS a resemblance.\u201d\n\nGoodrich stepped in.\n\n\u201cThat hurt his feelings,\u201d she told the other boy.\n\n\u201cSorry, man,\u201d he said.\n\nI asked the teachers why there needed to be a special club to teach this kind of thing. Goodrich said social events present key learning opportunities to explore what she called \u201cthe hidden curriculum.\u201d\n\nTake football games. Before the club went to a game last fall, Goodrich taught bleacher etiquette: You have to move aside when someone wants to get by.\n\nOne time last year, a member wanted to go to a football game on his own.\n\nBut once he got to the stadium, he panicked. What would he do inside? Where would he sit?\n\nThe teenager spent the game outside the gate, alone and apart from the action.\n\nThat's where Mixer comes in.\n\n\u201cWe're really trying to prevent anxiety,\u201d Goodrich said. And to prevent misunderstanding and potential conflict.\n\nBut it's hard to teach social skills in a vacuum, Zickefoose said. What you need is the real-world practice and friends who boost your confidence.\n\nJust ask these teens why they like the club.\n\n\u201cIt's a chance for people who don't have friends to make some new friends,\u201d said Matthew Ford.\n\n\u201cYou get to make friends,\u201d said Jazmine Valverde.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I like about this is friendship,\u201d said Gooch.\n\n\u201cWe make new friends,\u201d said Ariel Alai.\n\nAt West Lanes, 19 friends lined up for shoes and snacks. They rooted for each other. They laughed at each other's jokes and took in stride each other's habits \u2014 the constant dancing-drumming-air-guitar-strumming of one friend, the constant banter of another.\n\nThey went nuts when a third friend, who has tremor and seizure disorders, nailed a strike.\n\nAndrew Reed, a math teacher, watched the fun.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important clubs at Central,\u201d he said.\n\nHow could you disagree?", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Welcome to Central Mixer.
