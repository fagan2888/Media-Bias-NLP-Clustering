Expected rates are only adjusted for patients\u2019 age, sex and recent diagnoses including the one from their hospital stay.\n\nIn 2014, the second year of the program, about 2,600 hospitals were fined a combined $428 million for excessive readmissions, the authors report.\n\nTo get a better understanding of how individual patient characteristics might influence repeat hospitalizations, the researchers examined several other variables Medicare doesn\u2019t consider in determining expected readmission rates \u2013 such as education and income levels, marital status, employment, race and ethnicity, smoking status and drinking habits.\n\nThey linked records from a nationwide health and retirement survey of Americans over 50 collected between 2000 and 2010 to data from Medicare claims from 2000 to 2012. The combined analysis assessed more than 8,000 hospital admissions.\n\nThe researchers sorted hospitals into quintiles based on readmission rates. They found that at least half of the observed difference in the probability of repeat hospitalizations between hospitals with the highest and lowest readmission rates might be accounted for by patient characteristics not currently considered by Medicare.\n\nWhen researchers only used Medicare\u2019s criteria comparing readmission rates, they found the probability of repeat hospitalization was about 15 percent at facilities with the lowest rates and about 19.5 percent at hospitals with the highest rates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When patients are hospitalized more than\u00a0once in the same month, it may have more to do with their income\u00a0or education levels than the quality of care they", "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.6", "og": {"site_name": "The Hospitalist", "description": "When patients are hospitalized more than\u00a0once in the same month, it may have more to do with their income\u00a0or education levels than the quality of care they", "title": "30-Day Readmission May Be Due to Income or Education - The Hospitalist", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.the-hospitalist.org/article/11401/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Clinical", "tag": "research"}, "verify-v1": "gZRx7x+JbOdSaxTMXnWGct8g0Iue10SvDBzRtTiiU/c=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6b1\"", "article_summary": "The researchers sorted hospitals into quintiles based on readmission rates.\nBut patients also have higher odds of returning soon after discharge if they lack a high school diploma, have limited income and assets or have health benefits from Medicaid, the U.S. health program for the poor.\nTo get a better understanding of how individual patient characteristics might influence repeat hospitalizations, the researchers examined several other variables Medicare doesn\u2019t consider in determining expected readmission rates \u2013 such as education and income levels, marital status, employment, race and ethnicity, smoking status and drinking habits.\nWhen patients are hospitalized more than once in the same month, it may have more to do with their income or education levels than the quality of care they received, a U.S. study suggests.\n\u201cPatients admitted to hospitals with higher readmission rates are sicker and more socially disadvantaged in a variety of ways than patients admitted to hospitals with lower readmission rates.\u201dUnder the current penalty system, Medicare deducts 3 percent from inpatient payments to hospitals with higher than expected readmission rates, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine."}
