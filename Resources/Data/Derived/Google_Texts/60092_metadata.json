Over the past few weeks, Hatch has explained that the Republican-controlled Senate can\u2019t move forward on any nomination to replace the late Antonin Scalia because: there\u2019s a \u201cwell-established rule\u201d that \u201clame duck presidents\u201d don\u2019t get to make nominations, people are \u201cgoing to get very, very upset\u201d if a nomination is considered, and it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cfair to both sides.\u201d Just last week he argued that Senate obstruction must proceed because protesters with \u201cprofessionally printed signs\u201d disrupted his fancy lunch meeting in Washington, DC.\n\nIn a Monday Op-Ed for The New York Times, Hatch tosses out yet another reason for delaying action on a Supreme Court nominee until after the 2016 election \u2013 let\u2019s call it the Rock-Paper-Scissor principle of judicial nominations:\n\nGiven that the American people have elected a president and a Senate majority with drastically different views on the nature of legitimate constitutional government \u2013 a split decision of sorts \u2013 it seems appropriate to let 2016 voters decide which of the two very different paths the Supreme Court should take.\n\nVoters sent Obama back to the White House in 2012 and then elected a Republican Senate majority in 2014, so 2016 will be the tie-breaker. Best two of out three! Winner gets to pick Scalia\u2019s replacement.\n\nThis is some hot garbage and also a far more expansive justification for obstructionism than we\u2019ve seen to date. First off, there\u2019s the tendentious argument that the Republicans\u2019 2014 Senate victories carry the same mandate as the two national victories Obama won. Up to this point, the Republicans\u2019 case for obstructing has generally just assumed that Obama\u2019s national mandates didn\u2019t matter, but now Hatch is trying to argue that they were actually canceled out by the 34 states that voted for senators on Election Day 2014. But even if you buy that argument, why does the product of divided government have to be a total shutdown of the nominating process? One could just as easily argue that outcome should be the selection of a \u201cconsensus nominee\u201d \u2013 the precise term Orrin Hatch once used to describe current nominee Merrick Garland before he began discovering new reasons to oppose his nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah's Orrin Hatch says the upcoming election is like a tie-breaker for deciding which way the Supreme Court goes", "title": "Rock-paper-scissor SCOTUS: Orrin Hatch has a new ludicrous justification for obstructionism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Utah's Orrin Hatch says the upcoming election is like a tie-breaker for deciding which way the Supreme Court goes", "title": "Rock-paper-scissor SCOTUS: Orrin Hatch has a new ludicrous justification for obstructionism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/28/rock_paper_scissor_scotus_orrin_hatch_has_a_new_ludicrous_justification_for_obstructionism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/supreme-court-potential-justices.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Utah's Orrin Hatch says the upcoming election is like a tie-breaker for deciding which way the Supreme Court goes", "title": "Rock-paper-scissor SCOTUS: Orrin Hatch has a new ludicrous justification for obstructionism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/supreme-court-potential-justices.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Elections 2016, Merrick Garland, New York Times, Orrin Hatch, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Republicans, Supreme Court, Supreme Court nomination", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is some hot garbage and also a far more expansive justification for obstructionism than we\u2019ve seen to date.\nTopics: Barack Obama, Elections 2016, Merrick Garland, New York Times, Orrin Hatch, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Republicans, Supreme Court, Supreme Court nomination, Elections News, Politics NewsUtah senator Orrin Hatch has emerged as the point person for defending the Senate GOP\u2019s strategy of blocking President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, and in that role he\u2019s grown adept at inventing new and increasingly exotic justifications for blanket obstructionism.\nFirst off, there\u2019s the tendentious argument that the Republicans\u2019 2014 Senate victories carry the same mandate as the two national victories Obama won.\nOne could just as easily argue that outcome should be the selection of a \u201cconsensus nominee\u201d \u2013 the precise term Orrin Hatch once used to describe current nominee Merrick Garland before he began discovering new reasons to oppose his nomination.\nVoters sent Obama back to the White House in 2012 and then elected a Republican Senate majority in 2014, so 2016 will be the tie-breaker."}
