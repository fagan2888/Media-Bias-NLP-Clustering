Related Content\n\nSuddenly, though, the RCKC has gone belly-up, abruptly severing its $1 million a year detox contract with the county and sending its treatment staff and certified chemical dependency counselors packing. Officials in the mental health community are not quite sure why\u2014or they\u2019re not saying. \u201cThey were having financial problems, but I can\u2019t say what happened. You\u2019ll have to get that from Carole Hayes,\u201d said Jim Vollendroff, director of King County\u2019s Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that they are going out of business, but I can\u2019t give you any specifics,\u201d said Michael Langer, chief of Behavioral Health and Prevention for the Department of Health and Social Services, which holds the state\u2019s $890,000 a year contract with RCKC for inpatient residential care. \u201cHave you talked to Carole?\u201d\n\nHayes is RCKC\u2019s executive director, a job she began in December 2014. She declined to return numerous phone calls last week, but we managed to track her down at the detox center, a 27-bed clinic nestled, inauspiciously, within a quiet tree-lined Rainer Valley neighborhood.\n\nResembling a small motel, complete with outdoor fountain, the white two-story building was dark and nearly empty, lending an air of dispirited abandon. A few workers were packing up boxes when Hayes appeared. She was not happy. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk right now,\u201d she said, clearly annoyed at this unannounced visit. \u201cThere are no patients here. I\u2019m trying now to connect them with other services. So I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave, politely.\u201d\n\nBut why are you closing?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d\n\nNot long after our unceremonious departure, Seattle Weekly learned from a former employee, a $19-an-hour counselor who said he was recently laid off, that the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hours Division is engaged in an ongoing investigation of The Recovery Centers.\n\nJulie Shellhorn, the lead investigator in the Department of Labors\u2019 Seattle office, confirmed last Wednesday that the treatment facility is in fact the subject of a federal probe. \u201cBut I cannot discuss it or tell you anything about this investigation,\u201d Shellhorn told the Weekly.\n\nMeanwhile, the former counselor, who asked to be identified only by his first name George and whom Shellhorn acknowledged speaking with during the course of her investigation, said he and \u201cmaybe 15 others\u201d at RCKC were contacted and interviewed by Department of Labor investigators in late July or early August of 2014.\n\n\u201cThe substance of it is unpaid wages, and that we were asked to work off the clock,\u201d said George. \u201cSome of this goes back years. I know I was working 30 hours per month off the clock.\u201d\n\nWhether the Labor probe was the tipping point that led the powers that be at RCKC to pull the plug is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cI can\u2019t say since I didn\u2019t know anything about this investigation until now,\u201d said King County mental health director Vollendroff, after we informed him of it last week.\n\nIt is not unusual for treatment facilities such as RCKC to go under. Last April, as Seattle Weekly has reported, a 41-year-old inpatient center in Madrona, the 48-bed Genesis House, closed its doors, unable to maintain costs due to the vagaries of contracts from the state Department of Social and Human Services and ever-scarce state general-fund dollars.\n\nThe Genesis House, like RCKC and other similar facilities, could not rely on Medicaid money due to a longstanding and much-criticized rule under the Affordable Care Act that limits Medicaid to facilities with 16 beds or fewer. The rule is known as the Institutions for Mental Disease exclusion, an incentive in this era of deinstitutionalization to empty psychiatric hospitals.\n\n\u201cReimbursements are low, so these places have to operate on a pretty thin margin,\u201d said Vollendroff, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the reimbursements had anything to do with them (RCKC) closing.\u201d\n\nRCKC, which, in addition to the detox center, was also operating two other outpatient clinics serving more than 400 clients, in Kent and on First Hill, charged the county $190 a day to keep a person in detox.\n\nVollendoff said the unexpected termination of the contract, which came on April 3\u2013and without the required 30 days\u2019 notice to cease operations\u2013left the county scrambling to secure a fast, interim three-month contract (at a rate similar to what RCKC was charging) with Fairfax Hospital and Cascade Behavioral Health for 20 temporary detox beds. A request for proposal for a new contract was sent out last week.\n\n\u201cI think it is weird and very troubling that no notice was given us,\u201d said King County Council member Dave Upthegrove, chair of the county\u2019s Health, Housing and Human Services Committee.\n\neconklin@seattleweekly.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the past 20 years, The Recovery Centers of King County have", "og": {"site_name": "Seattle Weekly", "description": "Over the past 20 years, The Recovery Centers of King County have admitted thousands of impoverished drunks and addicts, laboring to get these desperate people,", "title": "Critical King County Detox Center Shuts Down Without Warning.
