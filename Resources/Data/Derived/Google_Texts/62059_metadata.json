Interactive Entertainment and Rocksteady Studios, Rated Mature, reviewed on PlayStation 4, $59.99).\n\nThis fourth in the main series of \u201cBatman: Arkham\u201d video games brilliantly delivers the tone and cinematic realism of a Christopher Nolan Batman movie with a deep homage to the rich history of Bob Kane\u2019s legendary DC Comic\u2019s brooding superhero.\n\nIt took less than five minutes before I was totally consumed in the story and action thanks to a devilishly intense prologue.\n\n[Minor Spoiler Alert:] Apparently, the conclusion of the 2011 game, \u201cBatman: Arkham City,\u201d saw the mighty Clown Prince of Crime succumb to the drug that made him a Bane-fueled nightmare for his favorite enemy.\n\nThe opening moments of the game reveal the result and allows the player to control the rate of incineration of the Joker\u2019s body, cremated by James Gordon.\n\nI dare any fan of the Batman mythology to not be immediately staggered by this incredibly unusual, eye-popping event.\n\nAnd, the game only gets better.\n\nA facially deformed and insane Scarecrow along with a mysterious armored henchman name Arkham Knight has threatened to unleash a cloud of fear toxin gas over Gotham City, on Halloween no less, causing a widespread evacuation of the town leaving only the criminals behind. Our vigilante hero is called in to stop the weapon of mass destruction and restore order.\n\nNow get this Adam West fans, thanks to some tasty bonus content included with the PlayStation 4 version of the game, I had our Dark Knight arrive on the scene wearing the famous 1960s television grey costume complete with large yellow utility belt, large bat logo on his chest and that familiar blue cowl.\n\nBatman now explores the massive cityscape to find Scarecrow. The Dark Knight glides with the massive cape and grapples around the highest points of locations such as Ace Chemicals, Chinatown, the Wayne Enterprises building and Founder\u2019s Island in what is always a visually stunning experience.\n\nHe\u2019ll get help from Alfred, Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Lucius Fox and James Gordon to battle enemies such as Two-Face, Penguin, the Riddler, Man-Bat, Deathstroke and Poison Ivy.\n\nA player can even switch up to control Robin, Nightwing and Catwoman in key fights.\n\nHowever, the star of this game is, like it or not, the mighty Batmobile. The famed vehicle is controllable on demand and even remotely, with Batman not behind the wheel, to stop the bad guys.\n\nWith the acrobatics of Speed Racer\u2019s Mach 5 and the power of a tank, it dominates screen time, driven around to nearly every location with the ability to easily subdue crowds of enemies and transform from a speedy ride to heavily armed machine.\n\nThe vehicle, with help from a power winch, can even drive up the sides of building, tear down walls and tip toe (tip tire?) around rooftops to enter locations.\n\nThe Batmobile is in constant demand to clean out areas loaded with drones, robotic tanks or helicopters. Although, I\u2019m not a fan of driving games and I was pretty sloppy on the roads, I loved watching Batman jump into and catapult out of the vehicle \u2014 and unloading that 60mm cannon on mechanical menaces.\n\nHowever, where the game continues to shine is when a play controls Batman.\n\nOur masked brawler continues to display some stunning, free-flowing, hand-to-hand combat maneuvers. This time out he can even sneak up on enemies, strike fear into a small group and play out a slow-motion battle ballet where he incapacitates each.\n\nOf course, he also has access to gadgets such as smoke pellets, batarangs, batclaw, a remote hacking device and explosive gel.\n\nDeeper Wayne Enterprises technology ranges from a Detective Mode to scan areas for clues to solve crimes and scout enemy locations (a sort of infrared radar layered on the screen), and a tissue analysis tool to scan down to the bone of a victim and help solve his murder.\n\nWhile on the hunt to stop Scarecrow and Arkham Knight, a player will find bunches of side missions he can accomplish to upgrade skills within the expansive Gotham City.\n\nThe collection includes solving nearly 250 Riddler challenges, entering augmented reality simulations to hone combat skills, attacking the Scarecrow in some wild nightmare driving missions (a PS4 exclusive), protecting fire stations from an arsonist, destroying Penguin\u2019s weapons stashes and defusing explosive mines left around the city, to name a few.\n\nSuffice to report, \u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d is a cornucopia of cool for the gamer and fan ready to invest at least a couple of dozen hours in a potent, interactive Dark Knight story.\n\nAdditionally, the PS4 version of the game delivers about a 30-minute long, complementary mission pack that has a player control Joker\u2019s love, Harley Quinn, as she infiltrates the Bludhaven police station to break out Poison Ivy.\n\nThe oddly sexy, cartwheeling psychotic uses a bat, laughing gas and exploding jack-in-the-boxes to subdue officers while uses a very trippy-looking mode (like Batman\u2019s Detective Mode) to read scrawls off walls and gain clues to decipher her target\u2019s location.\n\nOverall, at the midyear point, players should feel honored by the amount of great video games available in 2015. \u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d is easily near the top of the list for its fantastic immersion into a comic book universe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A captivating Caped Crusader attempts to stop one of his archenemies from gassing Gotham City in an epic, third-person adventure.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A captivating Caped Crusader attempts to stop one of his archenemies from gassing Gotham City in an epic, third-person adventure.", "title": "Zadzooks: Batman: Arkham Knight review", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/18/zadzooks-batman-arkham-knight-review/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/arkham-knight-900.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/arkham-knight-900.jpg", "description": "A captivating Caped Crusader attempts to stop one of his archenemies from gassing Gotham City in an epic, third-person adventure.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Batman: Arkham Knight review"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Nolan Batman, Arkham Knight, Gotham City, Barbara Gordon"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd130\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d is easily near the top of the list for its fantastic immersion into a comic book universe.\nSuffice to report, \u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d is a cornucopia of cool for the gamer and fan ready to invest at least a couple of dozen hours in a potent, interactive Dark Knight story.\n[Minor Spoiler Alert:] Apparently, the conclusion of the 2011 game, \u201cBatman: Arkham City,\u201d saw the mighty Clown Prince of Crime succumb to the drug that made him a Bane-fueled nightmare for his favorite enemy.\nThis fourth in the main series of \u201cBatman: Arkham\u201d video games brilliantly delivers the tone and cinematic realism of a Christopher Nolan Batman movie with a deep homage to the rich history of Bob Kane\u2019s legendary DC Comic\u2019s brooding superhero.\nA captivating Caped Crusader attempts to stop one of his archenemies from gassing Gotham City in the epic, third-person adventure Batman: Arkham Knight (Warner Bros.
