9/24/2013-Deja Vu All Over Again

The only way I can understand the reason for the modern Republican Party/tea party to exist in Washington is because of the explanation my friend Smitty in Minnesota gave me for Michele Bachmann. I made the observation that I’ve found Minnesotans to be smart, educated, common sensical folks. How in God’s name does Michelle Bachmann represent anybody from that state?

He told me that her district is severely gerrymandered to include all the extremely conservative and desperately frightened people who will believe anything because they see their way of life slipping away.

So it’s gerrymandering behind this modern GOP lunacy. I get it. I could draw a legislative map of Connecticut that would guarantee all Republican representation in Washington. I just might do that. It might make an interesting cartoon.
