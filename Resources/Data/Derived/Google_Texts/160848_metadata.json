Salmon -Contributing Writer- | Last updated: Jan 21, 2016 - 11:11:57 AM\n\nWhat's your opinion on this article?\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivers final State of the Union speech Jan. 12. Photo: MGN Online\n\n\u2014Even before Millennial activist DeRay McKesson watched Barack Obama give the last State of the Union speech of his presidency, he was philosophical.\n\n\u201cTo be disappointed means you expected something different. I\u2019m interested to see what he does going forward,\u201d he told The Final Call in a recent interview. \u201cI anticipated that he would reflect on the triumphs and challenges of his administration and chart a path for the future. I was surprised that so little of the talk was around criminal justice, especially because they\u2019re pushing sentencing reform. He has not talked about protestors positively to show that justice matters. But every speech after, I think it will be sharper and clearer.\u201d\n\nMr. McKesson, 30, a co-founder of Campaign Zero and We the Protesters, emerged as one of the principal Millennial leaders after helping organize months of protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the murder of unarmed 18-yearold Michael Brown by a White police officer in August 2014.\n\nDeRay McKesson\n\nSince then, he and other activists and groups such as the Black Lives Matter movement have taken aim at police accountability and substantial reform of a criminal justice system that is markedly skewed against Black and Brown people and poor communities.\n\nThe Baltimore native wrote an op-ed piece that appeared on Mashable the day before Mr. Obama\u2019s seventh State of the Union where he posed a series of questions. He asked whether the young protestor who he said Mr. Obama \u201cSo candidly acknowledged in 2009 is your citizen, too \u2026 Will you speak to her reality in your final State of the Union? Will you be bold enough to remind the American people that challenging this government to live up to its commitments is at the core of the American tradition? Will you be nuanced in how you talk about gun control? Will you note that this is an issue of gun access while being clear not to inadvertently increase penalties for gun users in ways that might disproportionately impact communities of color?\u201d\n\nMr. McKesson also wondered if President Obama would feel free enough to talk about his experiences as a Black man, father and husband in the presidency, and the impact that these experiences have had on his understanding of the world and how the world has treated him.\n\nMr. McKesson also said he hoped that the president would \u201cbe courageous enough to talk about safety beyond law enforcement, to note that the safety of communities is not predicated on the presence of police and help add nuance to conversations about mass incarceration so that the American public understands the issue is not solely a matter of arrests but that it includes issues of sentencing, bail, parole, reentry and rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s anything he learned, Mr. McKesson said during the Obama years is the reality that \u201cthere is no single solution, tactic or person that will lead us to a truly just America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn protest, in traditional politics and in our personal lives, we know that single solutions are myths\u2014neither true nor productive,\u201d he stated in the oped piece. \u201cNo one protest, no one policy, no one vote, no one idea and no one president will lead us to end the ills that the work of racial and economic equity addresses. Progress\u2013if we are to have it at all\u2013will be conditioned on the diversity of our strategies and tactics, on our ability to use each opportunity to lay the groundwork for later, successive wins, and in our understanding that hope is both belief and action.\u201d\n\nAlicia Garza\n\nBlack Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, like Mr. McKesson, has been on the forefront of this new phase of the struggle for Black civil and human rights and self-determination. She sat in the gallery Jan. 12 as a guest of California Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and echoed Mr. McKesson\u2019s comments the next day.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I think was glaringly missing from the conversation last night was really the conversation around not just gun violence broadly, although that is a major issue in our country, but police violence as it relates to Black communities,\u201d she said during a roundtable discussion on the news program Democracy Now. \u201cAnd as I was sitting there last night, I couldn\u2019t help but think about Samaria Rice, and I couldn\u2019t help but think about all the mothers who have lost their children, not just to gun violence broadly, but to the very people who are supposed to protect and serve us. And so, to be quite frank, I think this message that President Obama came in with eight years ago around hope and change is a message that I think people are still looking for. How are we going to accomplish that?\n\n\u201c\u2026 But certainly I think that many people who have been involved in this movement certainly wanted to hear President Obama\u2014possibly the last Black president in our country\u2019s history\u2014really talk about what\u2019s going on in Black communities specifically, really address the question of race, racism and structural racism and structural violence, and then, certainly, to talk about what kinds of proposals are on the table to ensure that Black people can live full lives in this country like everyone else.\u201d\n\nBlackLivesMatter Los Angeles stages a die-in in Compton to stand against the assault rifles that Compton Unified School District has allowed for Compton police officers to carry on school campuses.

Who deserves what, who\u2019s a criminal and who\u2019s not, is embedded in the system. We\u2019re seeking to change a system we didn\u2019t create. It would be disingenuous for us to say that we have deep faith in the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to change business as usual in this country. We want to shift the status quo. Why is it that there are multiple forms of violence against Black people and no one is doing anything? If we believe all lives matter, we\u2019re gonna fight like hell for Black lives.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama.

That is nothing new,\u201d said Dr. DeWeever, who most recently served as executive director of the National Council of Negro Women. \u201cI think he definitely cares about Black people in general but I do think politically he plays it safe. For example, with the Affordable Care Act, nearly 17 million people have healthcare but it\u2019s not the most expansive version. Many people still can\u2019t get it. He could have been more aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had control of both houses of Congress but he put in place a Republican version devised in a Republican Think Tank, did a rubber stamp of what (Mitt) Romney had passed in his state. The Left wanted more in terms of how it was structured but he hoped that it would attract the support of those who formed an unholy alliance against him. He chose the centrist path.\u201d\n\nMs. DeWeever said she gives Obama a \u201cB\u201d grade considering the many and varied accomplishments\u2014including the Affordable Care Act; normalization of relations with Cuba; the bailout of the U.S. auto industry; executive action on the Dream Act; and the critical diplomatic breakthrough with Iran that averted nuclear war.\n\nBut as a mother of two Black boys, Ms. DeWeever said the issue of their safety, the need to reign in rogue cops and the necessity of reforming or gutting the criminal justice system is paramount on her mind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear a specific mention of issues around the clear crisis that we\u2019re facing as a nation with police brutality, fundamental accountability and the repercussions of causing deaths of Black people,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping it would be addressed during the speech, hoping he would at least touch on it. It really is a critically important issue that has led to the creation of an entire movement. Knowing it was the last one (State of the Union) and never having to run again, I thought he\u2019d do it considering that he no longer has to deal with the level of risk associated with address issues of race frontally.\u201d\n\nSam P.K. Collins. Photo:Twitter.com/SamPKCollins\n\nFor Millennial activists Sam P.K. Collins and his girlfriend Tyisha Jones, their political na\u00efvet\u00e9 has morphed into a canny, nuanced maturity.\n\n\u201cKnowing what I know now, I see it as political theatre,\u201d said Mr. Collins, 26, a Georgetown University graduate and founder and host of #AllEyesOnDC in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cI do think he\u2019s sincere in his attempt to do what he said he was going to do. He came in on a transformational tip and sold us a radical dream. It\u2019s our fault because we believed it. He\u2019s a down the middle president. He didn\u2019t even say \u2018Black Lives Matters,\u2019 he said justice matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the system is, for him to do anything else would mean his death. He\u2019s the head of government, but you still have people who are there to maintain the system, preserve the status quo. He\u2019s a cultural icon, can sing, play basketball. I will always respect him as a symbol. He has appeal but is he effective? Nah.\u201d\n\nMr. Collins said his contemporaries have been having all kinds of discussions, arguments and debates about Mr. Obama, his effectiveness and whether and how he\u2019s adequately and properly moved against pressing concerns like student debt, access to well-paying jobs, White privilege, mass incarceration and police brutality. There are masses of critics and admirers on both sides, he said.\n\nMs. Jones, 25, said it\u2019s clear as she looks back over the last seven years, with the backlash against Black and Brown people, the poor and others outside of the One Percent, the clearest and best way for African Americans to counter this pervasive and intentional racism and discrimination is for them to create, own and develop their institutions.\n\n\u201cI have distrust of their institutions. We just need our own,\u201d said Ms. Jones, lead advocate for Training and Community Engagement at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. \u201cIt makes no sense to appeal to the logic and morality of the oppressor. We live in a state of constant distrust with aggressive moves against undocumented immigrants and the murders of Black people by police. People aren\u2019t eating, they\u2019re homeless, can\u2019t find jobs, shooting each other. It\u2019s important to understand how the system works and how you\u2019re governed but there\u2019s work on the ground to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal to think you\u2019re part of a culture where a war is going on against you. There\u2019s dissonance going on. You\u2019re pressured as a Black youth to keep up with everything going on around you. But we have to be moving simultaneously to give youth power and mobilize them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "The Final Call | National NewsThe State Of The Union: President Obama's Mixed LegacyBy Barrington M.
