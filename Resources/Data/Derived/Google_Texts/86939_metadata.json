MacIver Institute for Public Policy, which noticed the voter-registration question on the Wisconsin site, told FoxNews.com on Monday. \u201cWhy are they cluttering up the site?\u201d\n\nNovak, who has unsuccessfully tried numerous times over the past week to click through the site, also argues officials should have at least posed the question after customers sign up for insurance.\n\nHowever, government officials have defended putting the question on the exchanges, citing federal law.\n\nBrian Cook, a spokesman for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in August the exchanges must include the question, under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. The law requires states to offer voter registration at government offices that provide public assistance.\n\nBrett Healy, president of the Wisconsin-based MacIver Institute, suggests that including the question could backfire on Democrats.\n\n\"The president should be careful what he wishes for,\u201d he said. \"While he counted on young people to win the presidency, many are now experiencing
