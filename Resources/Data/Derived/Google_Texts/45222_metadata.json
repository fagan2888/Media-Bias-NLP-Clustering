They've learned their lesson from last Fall and want to make a \"realistic\" demand.\n\nBut their newest potential plan increases the deficit with a fake spending offset that their Senate colleagues just rejected yesterday.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nSo far, they've considered (and rejected) repealing Obamacare's risk corridors and approving the Keystone XL pipeline. Since Democrats won't vote for anything except a clean debt ceiling increase, the Republican leadership cannot lose many votes no matter what they decide. Neither the risk corridor repeal or approval of the pipeline had enough Republican support to pass.\n\nNow, House leadership is considering undoing the changes that the budget agreement made to the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) for military pensions. Of course, doing that costs money - you didn't think that Republican debt ceiling extortion actually had something to do with the deficit, did you?\n\nSo, how are they going to offset the cost? Nothing has been settled on, but Politico's Jake Sherman and Burgess Everett report that they may use a budget gimmick known as \"pension smoothing\" to do so. Pension smoothing allows companies to underfund their pensions in the next few years, boosting their profits, and thus increasing government revenues. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shows this as reducing the deficit over the next decade. But beyond that, it increases the deficit, because those firms eventually have to make those pensions contributions, reducing their future profits and therefore government revenue as well. This chart from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget demonstrates this:\n\nIt also increases the chance that the government will need to bailout companies in the future that can't meet their pension obligations.\n\nBasically, it's a budget gimmick that doesn't save money and makes the pension system more unstable.\n\nThis is what Republicans want to use as an offset for restoring the COLA changes to military pensions.\n\nI wrote about this last week when Senate Democrats planned to use it to offset the cost of a three-month extension to unemployment benefits. Yesterday, they tried that, but Senate Republicans filibustered it. Democrats would rather add the cost of the UI extension to the deficit so if Republicans require a budgetary gimmick to make that happen, that's fine. Unfortunately, only four Republicans joined with the Democrats, so the bill fell one vote short. Republicans correctly pointed out that it's a gimmick.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the potential House debt ceiling bill should be DOA in the Senate even if every Democrat were to vote for it. If the remaining Senate Republicans think pension smoothing is a gimmick when used to offset the cost of unemployment insurance, surely it still is if it is used to offset the cost of restoring changes to military pensions.\n\nOf course, no Senate Democrat will vote for it out of principle that the debt ceiling cannot be used as an extortion device. This is all going to end in a clean debt ceiling increase anyways.\n\nBut the current (reported) House Republican strategy is still incredible: They cannot agree on a debt ceiling demand and the one they are currently considering increases the deficit. To offset the cost, they may use a budgetary gimmick that Senate Republicans just filibustered yesterday. What a mess.\n\nThis post has been updated with a new chart from CRFB after CBO released a new score for pension smoothing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Danny Vinik", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans are having a lot of trouble...", "title": "The Newest Potential GOP Debt Ceiling Demand Is The Most Absurd One Yet", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet-2014-2", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50a53edeeab8eac41a000005-506-253/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet.jpg", "creator": "DannyVinik", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Debt Ceiling, John Boehner, Republicans, Pensions, Danny Vinik", "news_keywords": "Debt Ceiling, John Boehner, Republicans, Pensions, Danny Vinik", "author": "Danny Vinik", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-07", "sailthru.title": "The Newest Potential GOP Debt Ceiling Demand Is The Most Absurd One Yet", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/50a53edeeab8eac41a000005-50-50/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet.jpg", "description": "House Republicans are having a lot of trouble...", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/50a53edeeab8eac41a000005/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-02-07", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/danny-vinik"}, "sailthru.description": "House Republicans are having a lot of trouble...", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "House Republicans are having a lot of trouble...", "title": "The Newest Potential GOP Debt Ceiling Demand Is The Most Absurd One Yet", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet-2014-2", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50a53edeeab8eac41a000005-1190-625/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "The Newest Potential GOP Debt Ceiling Demand Is The Most Absurd One Yet", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/50a53edeeab8eac41a000005/the-newest-potential-gop-debt-ceiling-demand-is-the-most-absurd-one-yet.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81fc\"", "article_summary": "Since Democrats won't vote for anything except a clean debt ceiling increase, the Republican leadership cannot lose many votes no matter what they decide.\nHouse Republicans are having a lot of trouble figuring out what to demand from President Obama in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.\nThis is all going to end in a clean debt ceiling increase anyways.\nBut the current (reported) House Republican strategy is still incredible: They cannot agree on a debt ceiling demand and the one they are currently considering increases the deficit.\nBut if that's the case, then the potential House debt ceiling bill should be DOA in the Senate even if every Democrat were to vote for it."}
