A picture is really worth 1,000 words – or more.

National Geographic’s blog “Found,” which is a collection of photographs from their archives that have never been published, or have not been seen because they were published in its magazine many years ago, shared a photo of a Native American man sending smoke signals in Montana.

Neither the man, or his tribal affiliation was identified, but the photograph was taken in June of 1909.
