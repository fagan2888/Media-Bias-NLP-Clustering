Communities leaders are expected \u201cto build outreach efforts\u201d to those who are uninsured with \u201cstrong federal, state and community collaboration can having a meaningful impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage,\u201d a White House press release states.\n\nIn his weekly address, Obama said Americans like the contentious healthcare law \u2014 which he is \u201cno longer just a law\u201d and more than the \u201cmyths and scare tactics\u201d from critics.\n\n\u201cThis is reality. This is healthcare in America, and the bottom line is, Americans like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy with their plans, and they\u2019re happy with their premiums.\u201d\n\nAccording to an aggregate of polling data from Real Clear Politics, 49.5 percent of Americans are against the healthcare law as opposed to the 42.3 percent who are in favor of the law.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of health insurance \u2014 peace of mind,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe third sign-up season for health insurance is expected to be less than stellar.
