Solomon Jr., 19, of Langston Drive on Johns Island, is accused in the shooting death of a woman in the Red Top community on Jan. 11.\n\nCarlton L. Solomon Sr., 56, of Johns Island, runs a tight ship.\n\nTo offer tips Anyone with information about the shooting can call the Sheriff\u2019s Office at 202-1700 or Crime Stoppers at 554-1111.\n\nNo drugs or alcohol are allowed in his household. For the family of scholars, he said, education always comes first.\n\nSo on Saturday, after watching his 19-year-old son, Carlton L. Solomon Jr., appear before a judge on murder and other charges, Solomon Sr. said he could only speculate about what led the teen so far astray from the path he had envisioned for him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve often said you don\u2019t know the future of a child, but you can look at the people he\u2019s around,\u201d said Solomon Sr. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on with my son. Somehow or another these people have been able to drag him away from his family structure.\u201d\n\nA judge on Saturday denied bail for the teen accused in a home invasion and shooting that killed a woman last week in the Red Top community.\n\nSolomon Jr., of Langston Drive on Johns Island, is charged with murder, kidnapping, possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and first-degree burglary.\n\nMagistrate Priscilla Baldwin presided over Solomon Jr.\u2019s bail hearing.\n\nAs a magistrate judge, Baldwin cannot set bail on murder charges. So bail was denied on that charge until a circuit judge can consider it. Baldwin set bail of $100,000 on the firearm possession charge and denied bail on the other two charges.\n\nCharleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies on Friday named Solomon Jr. as a suspect in the shooting death of Donetta Heyward, 27, of Charleston.\n\nOn Jan. 11, authorities responded to a Greenland Road home shortly after 2:30 a.m.\n\nA 25-year-old resident told Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies that three gunmen seeking money kicked in his home\u2019s back door and assaulted him and his sister, Heyward.\n\nArrest warrants for Solomon Jr. say the men were armed with a shotgun, pistol and a semi-automatic weapon.\n\nTwo of the invaders forced Heyward outside while the third struck her brother on the head, her brother told deputies.\n\nHeyward\u2019s brother heard two or three rounds fired outside.\n\nOne of those shots struck Heyward, deputies said. She died at Medical University Hospital from a single gunshot wound to her pelvis.\n\nAn older model, green, four-door Honda was seen leaving the area shortly after the gunfire, deputies said.\n\nA photo lineup was used to identify Solomon Jr. as a suspect in the shooting, a detective stated in an arrest affidavit. Two other suspects in the case have not been publicly identified.\n\nSolomon Sr. would not say whether he believed the accusations against his son. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say one thing and end up regretting it later,\u201d he said.\n\nHis son did not yet have an attorney, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can raise a child who went to church, was on the choir, who didn\u2019t need anything, wasn\u2019t hungry, not filthy, had clothes on his back and the supervision of a significant family structure, but the street can still draw them in,\u201d Solomon Sr. said. \u201cI told my son, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be careful out there.\u2019 But those influences are great. The next thing you know, you\u2019re on the opposite end of the law.\u201d\n\nThe incident remains under investigation, deputies said.\n\nReach Christina Elmore at 937-5908 or at Twitter.com/celmorePC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Judge denies bail in Greenland Road homicide, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCharleston County, \r\nCharleston County,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Carlton L.
