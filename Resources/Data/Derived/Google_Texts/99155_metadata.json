Left-wing news sources are suffering a fallout in ratings because people are waking up to these facts and don\u2019t like being manipulated.\n\nFRANK COOK\n\nWayne, Pa., Dec. 5, 2013\n\nIn his lament about bias in the news media, Mr. Godburn assumes that unbiased journalism is possible and desirable. History suggests otherwise.\n\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American journalism was highly political, often polemical and openly biased. That was the kind of journalism in which the likes of Sam Adams and Thomas Paine gloriously argued for liberty, and it was the form of journalism that was on the founders\u2019 minds when they enshrined the doctrine of a free press in the First Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnly later, beginning with Benjamin Day\u2019s Sun newspaper in 1833, did American journalists begin to develop a strong tradition of factual reporting. In part, this was the result of Day\u2019s ambition to sell his paper to every reader (\u201cIt Shines for All\u201d) and not limit his audience to members of any one political party.\n\nIn the 20th century, the major broadcast network news divisions, first in radio and then in television, reinforced this idea. They not only wanted the highest possible ratings, but were also operating as publicly traded corporations and were regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nNowadays, from within the turbulence of the digital age, we can begin to see that the years when big media companies were purveying what they described as nonpartisan, factual reporting were actually a historical period that is already fading into the past. The Internet has reinvigorated the \u201cadvocacy tradition\u201d in journalism, and it has also made possible new forms of reporting such as crowd-sourcing, reporting that enlists the audience and the like. The spirit of innovation lives.\n\nCHRISTOPHER B. DALY\n\nBoston, Dec. 4, 2013\n\nThe writer is a professor of journalism at Boston University and the author of \u201cCovering America: A Narrative History of a Nation\u2019s Journalism.\u201d\n\nMr. Godburn makes a telling point, but he doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. His assertion that liberal and conservative news outlets \u201croughly fill each other\u2019s omissions\u201d assumes that there are exactly two reasonable points of view toward any given social issue; that these viewpoints are locked in a zero-sum game whereby each one can be validated only to the degree that the opposing one is impeached; and that they happen to correspond to the platforms of our two leading political parties.\n\nBoth parties are only too eager to promote this theory themselves, since it implies that together they have a monopoly on the truth. So a responsibility of both a free press and its readers is to examine both contrary viewpoints critically and consider other viewpoints \u2014 a third, fourth or fifth perspective \u2014 that have not been embraced by either side.\n\nTHOMAS LEITCH\n\nNewark, Del., Dec. 4, 2013\n\nBalanced news media is essential in any democracy. But let\u2019s remember what brought us to the present situation \u2014 the 1987 repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which required the airing of contrasting views on public issues, and the loosening of regulations on media concentration, allowing many media outlets to fall under the control of a few corporate-owned conglomerates.\n\nBoth have created a situation in which media is not only biased and unbalanced, but overwhelmingly influenced by the opinions and wishes of its corporate masters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDOMINIC QUINTANA\n\nAstoria, Queens, Dec. 4, 2013\n\nHaving recently returned from a trip to Brussels, I found the evening news there to be refreshing and professional. One subject wasn\u2019t beaten to death 24/7 as it is here. You didn\u2019t have to flip from channel to channel to see the \u201cwhole\u201d picture, and the news was international in nature. In the United States you rarely hear about what is going on in Africa, Australia and, actually, most of the world.\n\nIt is a shame.\n\nBONNIE CHALEK\n\nRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 4, 2013\n\nI agree with Mr. Godburn that we need different perspectives. I would like to point out that Fox News is the No. 1 news source in America. Surely, that should qualify Fox as \u201cmainstream.\u201d\n\nStudies have also shown that, for many Americans, Fox News is their only source of news. Those viewers are getting a slanted perspective \u2014 not balance. Defenders of Fox News often portray it as an underdog struggling to have a voice in the crowd of \u201cmainstream\u201d outlets, but that depiction simply isn\u2019t consistent with its ratings.\n\nI commend Mr. Godburn for admitting that news outlets he identifies as left-leaning did report on the problems with Obamacare. I find that so-called left-leaning news outlets, including The New York Times, are frequently critical of Democrats and their policies.\n\nMr. Godburn would have a much more difficult time finding comparable examples of Fox News criticizing the G.O.P. \u2014 except perhaps when it criticizes moderate Republicans for not being in lock step with the rest of their party.\n\nTOBY PLEWAK\n\nEaston, Mass., Dec. 4, 2013\n\nIt may be a fool\u2019s errand to think that we can overcome media bias. The media is ultimately a collection of voices of various people, who generally stick to certain biases and opinions. The answer instead may be to encourage media outlets to be more forthcoming about their biases.\n\nIf we, as media consumers, know that a mainstream news outlet typically holds a certain viewpoint, then we can take in the news with a better understanding of what information may be missing or may be shaded one way or another. As it is, given the rather obvious political positions held by certain newspapers and television news divisions, many of us have already begun interpreting the news in this way.\n\nMATTHEW K. KERFOOT\n\nNew York, Dec. 4, 2013\n\nThe Writer Responds\n\nProfessor Perloff reinforces my point by noting that conservatives gravitate to right-leaning news sources and liberals to left-leaning ones, often without being exposed to contrary views or inconvenient facts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut then he says that going to such biased sources only exacerbates the problem, as if he thinks there are reliably unbiased sources that one can go to instead. There are not, and that is why it is necessary to mine a variety of biased ones.\n\nMr. Nelson engages in the cheap liberal tactic of Fox-bashing. If Fox\u2019s talking heads are attack dogs, they are poodles compared with the pit bulls he favors at MSNBC. Simply calling one\u2019s favored sources true journalism and the other side propaganda doesn\u2019t make it so. And if too much news causes intellectual indigestion, too little causes intellectual blinders.\n\nMr. Leitch is correct that there are more than two points of view. And examining all of them will not necessarily allow one to arrive at some desired middle ground. Just because you have one foot in hot water and the other in cold doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re comfortable.\n\nProfessor Daly\u2019s claim that I assume unbiased journalism is possible and desirable may have been a good lead-in for his journalistic history lesson, but that\u2019s not what I said. The problem is not that journalists are biased \u2014 it\u2019s that they claim they aren\u2019t.\n\nMARK R.
