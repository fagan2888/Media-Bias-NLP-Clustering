Fox New corrects an Obamacare enrollment chart Tuesday. Fox News corrects Obamacare chart

Fox News on Tuesday corrected a misleading graphic of the number of enrollees in the Affordable Care Act exchanges originally aired in a broadcast on Monday.

The original graphic had the correct number of enrollees, about 6 million as of March 27, but placed the number in a bar graph that looked to be approximately one-third the size of the slightly more than 7 million enrollee goal for March 31.

On Tuesday morning, America's Newsroom host Bill Hemmer noted the mistake and showed a corrected graphic.

"Programming note, yesterday around this time you might have seen a graphic on the Obamacare signup numbers. Here is what that graphic should have looked like: On the left it shows the six million signups reported for the administration as of March 27, compared to the target number of 7 million plus. That was our mistake, correction noted," Hemmer said.

On Tuesday afternoon the White House announced a total of 7,041,000 people had signed up for healthcare on the new exchanges, a number that does not include enrollment surges that took place in the 14 states running their own insurance marketplaces.
