Will we develop cancer? Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Even the path of obesity, a precursor to many of the leading causes of preventable death, such as heart disease and diabetes, is hard to envision. But at the same time, it\u2019s obvious: A life full of bad choices \u2014 both dietary and physical activity-wise \u2014 will result in a the development of these diseases.\n\nA new ad from the Your Nutrition Spot paints this picture for those who can\u2019t imagine it. But, going with the idea that healthy eating and exercise habits start early, it highlights the need for us to be more aware of the foods we\u2019re giving our kids. And that starts with skipping the french fries (But so many kids love them!) and going with a healthier option, even if it means having your child scream in protest. By taking charge of our kids\u2019 eating habits, we can reduce childhood obesity not only in the U.S., where 17 percent of children and adolescents are obese, but also throughout the world \u2014 the World Health Organization recently warned that as many as 75 million kids may be obese by 2025.\n\nOf course, there are many obstacles to reducing childhood obesity. For one, food insecurity is a huge issue, giving many parents limited options to attaining healthy food. Another issue, a recent study found, is that too many parents don\u2019t acknowledge that their kids are obese. Instead, they view their kids\u2019 health as excellent or very good, despite having their kids referred to an obesity clinic. Though it\u2019s a long road to reducing childhood obesity, it is possible. If you\u2019re trying to cut your child\u2019s weight, here are seven hacks to get your kid to eat his vegetables.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "powerful, obesity, ad, shows, how, obesity, related, disease, lifetime, making", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Obesity isn't a condition that just pops up like cancer or an infection.
