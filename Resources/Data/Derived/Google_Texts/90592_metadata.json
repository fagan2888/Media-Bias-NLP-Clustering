He\u2019s Catholic-educated all the way \u2014 almost.\n\nHe attended a parish elementary school in Bethesda, Md., and Jesuit-run Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C., where public service was expected of students. He then earned his undergraduate degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington, before veering off the parochial path for law school at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn 2002, while serving as mayor of Baltimore, O\u2019Malley told Gonzaga students in a commencement address that the commitment to public service instilled at the school was a driving force in his choice to pursue politics rather than a private law practice.\n\nHe\u2019s a pray-every-morning, church-every-Sunday (St. Francis of Assisi in Baltimore) believer who sent all four of his kids to Catholic schools. Democratic Party activist and author Jonathan Miller called him \u201cthe rare progressive to frame his strongly felt policy positions in the language of faith.\u201d\n\n2. He holds positions contrary to some Church teachings.\n\nO\u2019Malley is for abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research. His website boasts that he led the push to legalize same-sex marriage in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, he told The Des Moines Register in an interview that he had no problem aligning this with his religion.\n\n\u201cI found the passage of marriage equality actually squares with the most important social teachings of my faith, which is to believe in the dignity of every person and to believe in our own responsibility to advance the common good,\u201d he said.\n\n3. He doesn\u2019t think corporations should refuse contraception coverage on religious grounds.\n\nDuring the battle over whether faith-based religious institutions and businesses must heed the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an issue still wending through the courts \u2014 O\u2019Malley said Catholics need to calm down about it.\n\nIn 2012, he told Candy Crowley on CNN: \u201cThere has been a little bit too much hyperventilating over this issue.\u201d\n\n4. He credits a Jesuit priest for shaping his identity.\n\nHe told Esquire magazine one of his role models is \u201ca Jesuit priest by the name of Father Horace McKenna, who ran a mission out of the basement of Saint Aloysius Church. He gave his entire life to serving the poor, and he truly did see the face of God in every individual that he served.\u201d\n\n5. He agrees with his Church on the need for immigration reform.\n\nAs governor, O\u2019Malley brought more than 2,200 refugee children to shelter in Maryland after the 2014 crisis over unaccompanied immigrant children getting caught illegally crossing the Southwest border. He also signed a law allowing some undocumented immigrants to be eligible for in-state college tuition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch actions prompted one Maryland state senator to call O\u2019Malley \u201ca Pope Francis Democrat.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/faith/2015/06/01/5-faith-facts-about-martin-omalley-a-pope-francis-democrat/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martin-OMalley.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Martin O'Malley is loudly, proudly Catholic -- even when some doctrine-devoted Church followers hiss at his socially liberal views.", "title": "5 faith facts about Martin O\u2019Malley: \u2018A Pope Francis Democrat\u2019"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here are five faith facts about O\u2019Malley, 52, who has announced his candidacy for president.\nHe then earned his undergraduate degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington, before veering off the parochial path for law school at the University of Maryland.\nAdvertisementSuch actions prompted one Maryland state senator to call O\u2019Malley \u201ca Pope Francis Democrat.\u201d\nHe attended a parish elementary school in Bethesda, Md., and Jesuit-run Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C., where public service was expected of students.\nAs governor, O\u2019Malley brought more than 2,200 refugee children to shelter in Maryland after the 2014 crisis over unaccompanied immigrant children getting caught illegally crossing the Southwest border."}
