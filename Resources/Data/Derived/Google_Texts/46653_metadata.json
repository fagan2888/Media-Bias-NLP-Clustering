The officer, Brig. Gen. Nico Tak, called it \u201cinterference,\u201d presumably because \u201cinvasion\u201d would mean an all-out military assault. But, by any name, it is a large and unacceptable escalation of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\n\nPresident Obama was right in his news conference on Thursday to rule out military action, but new, tougher Western economic sanctions are obviously needed to make clear to President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the West views his lies and escalating aggression as a major threat.\n\nMr. Obama declined to speak of an \u201cinvasion\u201d in his relatively restrained comments, describing the latest developments only as \u201ca continuation\u201d of what Russia has been up to and of his \u201cexpectation\u201d that the allies will deepen the sanctions. His ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was more blunt in her address Thursday to the Security Council, where she described Russia\u2019s actions as \u201ca deliberate effort to support, and now fight alongside, illegal separatists in another sovereign country.\u201d That should be the reality guiding Mr. Obama when he meets with NATO allies in Wales next week.\n\nNATO suspects the Russian goal is to prevent a military defeat of the rebels and freeze the conflict in an open-ended cease-fire, with Russia left in effective control of Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland, following the template of Russia\u2019s frozen conflicts with Moldova and Georgia. But Russia\u2019s motive is not the issue here. It is Russia\u2019s violation of a cardinal principle of the international order since World War II \u2014 states do not seize territory by force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin has played his dangerous game in Ukraine with cunning and deceit since the ouster in February of the corrupt Viktor Yanukovych lost him a Ukrainian president he could manipulate. First he annexed Crimea outright. Shocking and outrageous as that was, at least no blood was shed; Mr. Putin claimed that history and a Russian population as justification for that seizure. The Western reaction was limited to modest sanctions.\n\nSince then, Mr. Putin has turned his attention to southeastern Ukraine, holding intimidating military exercises on the Ukrainian border and sending in ever more men and arms in support of secessionists in Donetsk and Luhansk, all the while falsely denying any Russian involvement other than humanitarian concern for the ethnic Russian population.\n\nAfter the rebels shot down a Malaysian jetliner with a Russian missile, and after Kiev made gains against the rebels, Russia\u2019s involvement became more overt, with reports of artillery fire across the border, armored columns crossing into Ukraine and Russian soldiers caught or killed inside Ukraine. The United States and the European Union ratcheted up the sanctions, but Mr. Putin continued to deny any involvement. He will no doubt deny the latest evidence as well, and will cynically claim some Ukrainian or Western plot.\n\nComments from European leaders on Thursday showed they recognize the danger of this moment. European Union leaders meeting on Saturday must join the United States in expanding the economic sanctions. France should seriously reconsider delivering the Mistral assault ships it has sold Russia. And when NATO leaders gather next week, they should give strong reassurances to NATO members along Russia\u2019s borders that they will be protected should Moscow turn its attentions on them.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140828211107, "twitter": {"description": "Tougher sanctions are needed to show President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the West views his escalating aggression in Ukraine as a threat.", "title": "Mr. Putin Tests the West in Ukraine", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/mr-putin-tests-the-west-in-ukraine.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003081119"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/mr-putin-tests-the-west-in-ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003081119", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/mr-putin-tests-the-west-in-ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 28, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "European Union", "keywords": "Editorials,Putin  Vladimir V,Ukraine,Russia,Obama  Barack,Power  Samantha,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Europe,European Union,Defense and Military Forces,Embargoes and Sanctions,United States International Relations,International Relations", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Ukraine,Russia,Europe", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Power, Samantha", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Tougher sanctions are needed to show President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the West views his escalating aggression in Ukraine as a threat.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Tougher sanctions are needed to show President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the West views his escalating aggression in Ukraine as a threat.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-29", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "International Relations", "published": "2014-08-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Europe", "slug": "29fri1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140829114732, "hdl_p": "Mr. Putin Tests the West in Ukraine", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/mr-putin-tests-the-west-in-ukraine.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Tougher sanctions are needed to show President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the West views his escalating aggression in Ukraine as a threat.", "title": "Mr. Putin Tests the West in Ukraine"}, "pdate": 20140828, "des": "International Relations", "articleid": 100000003081119, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Mr. Putin Tests the West in Ukraine", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9a1\"", "article_summary": "The United States and the European Union ratcheted up the sanctions, but Mr. Putin continued to deny any involvement.\nShocking and outrageous as that was, at least no blood was shed; Mr. Putin claimed that history and a Russian population as justification for that seizure.\nBut, by any name, it is a large and unacceptable escalation of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\nA senior NATO officer reported on Thursday that the alliance had monitored a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d in Russia\u2019s military \u201cinterference\u201d in Ukraine, and that well over 1,000 Russian soldiers are operating inside the southeast of the country.\nGen.
