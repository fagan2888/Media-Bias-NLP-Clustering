It's unclear whether the outages are weather related.\n\nCooper said snow flurries started falling around 2 p.m. Thursday in Centennial. Up to 2 inches of snow was expected in the mountains.\n\nBut because the storm entered the state from the south, it won't drop temperatures below zero like the previous storm, Cooper said.\n\nThe low overnight in Ca\u00f1on City was about 2 degrees as the skies cleared. The highs Thursday were expected to rise to the middle to upper 30s.\n\nSnowfall is expected to return Saturday to Fremont County. About an inch or two will fall in the afternoon, with highs in the 40s.\n\nTemperatures gradually will increase early next week with temperatures expected to break the freezing level by Monday, and by Wednesday, Fremont County could see a high of 55 degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're trying to recover. It's just a slow recovery,\" Cooper said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27242217/snowfall-greets-new-year", "modificationDate": "2015-01-01T18:10:15-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0101/20150101__02DRWEATHERw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Kirk Mitchell \n \n  The Denver Post", "description": "A snowstorm that entered Colorado from the Four Corners area dropped about an inch of new snow but didn't significantly drop temperatures.\n\n\"It's not going to be too much,\" said Frank Cooper, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27242217:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-01T18:09:03-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27242217/snowfall-greets-new-year", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0101/20150101__02DRWEATHERw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A snowstorm that entered Colorado from the Four Corners area dropped about an inch of new snow but didn't significantly drop temperatures.\n\n\"It's not going to be too much,\" said Frank Cooper, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.", "title": "Snowfall greets new year"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "A snowstorm that entered Colorado from the Four Corners area dropped about an inch of new snow but didn't significantly drop temperatures.\n\n\"It's not going to be too much,\" said Frank Cooper, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.", "title": "Snowfall greets new year", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27242217/snowfall-greets-new-year", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0101/20150101__02DRWEATHERw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-01T18:09:03-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-01-01T17:53:38-0700", "sailthru.title": "Snowfall greets new year", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Kirk MitchellThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0101/20150101__02DRWEATHERw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-01-01T18:10:24-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "Latest storm doesn't dip temperatures this time aroundAn inch or two of fresh snowfall greeted Fremont County residents on New Year's Day.\nSnowfall is expected to return Saturday to Fremont County.\nBut because the storm entered the state from the south, it won't drop temperatures below zero like the previous storm, Cooper said.\nTemperatures gradually will increase early next week with temperatures expected to break the freezing level by Monday, and by Wednesday, Fremont County could see a high of 55 degrees.\n( Carol Bawcom Gebhart/ Daily Record )Ellie Halbert, 10, enjoys skating Thursday at Winter Skate ice rink in Lafayette."}
