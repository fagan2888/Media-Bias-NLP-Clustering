The drug, Praluent, was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems from 3.3 percent for placebo patients to 1.7 percent for the treatment group. \"Events\" in this trial were defined only as death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization.\n\nRelated: The Foods You Should Never Eat in 2015\n\n\"Some of the endpoints in these trials are kind of soft, and they aren't prospective studies,\" said Dr. Anthony DeMaria, director of the cardiovascular center at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the trials. \"It's encouraging that the larger trials are likely to succeed, but we still need those trials.\"\n\nDr Marc Sabatine, lead investigator of the Repatha study, said data for both drugs \"are very consistent ... it appears that cutting LDL by 61 percent translates to a roughly 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular events.\"\n\nThe experimental drugs are antibodies, given by injection, designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins - pills, now available as low-cost generics, that block the liver's production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.\n\nBoth Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have filed for FDA approval of their drugs, based on trials showing that they lower \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.\n\nRelated: The 12 Hottest Food Trends for 2015\n\nThe FDA is slated to decide on Amgen's application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the regulatory deadline for Praluent is July 24.\n\nNumerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower levels of LDL in the blood, but investors expect widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events.\n\nBoth Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron do not expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they may", "title": "Cholesterol Drug Could Slice Heart Attack Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Cholesterol-Drug-Could-Slice-Heart-Attack-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01222013_Data_Scientists_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Cholesterol-Drug-Could-Slice-Heart-Attack-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01222013_Data_Scientists_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they may", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd906b\"", "article_summary": "Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they may reduce by half the risk of heart attack and other major cardiovascular problems compared to standard treatment alone.\nThe drug, Praluent, was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems from 3.3 percent for placebo patients to 1.7 percent for the treatment group.\n\"Events\" in this trial were defined only as death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization.\nThe experimental drugs are antibodies, given by injection, designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.\nNeurocognitive side effects were also more common in the treatment arm of an 18-month, 2,300-patient trial of a rival PCSK9 drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc."}
