But with the GOP-dominated House opposed to increasing Medicaid rolls, Senate budget leaders touted their approach as an outright rejection of expansion.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion is based upon too many uncertainties under the ACA to go down that road,\u201d Sen. Walter A. Stosch (R-Henrico), co-chairman of the Finance Committee, told a packed meeting room on Capitol Square. \u201cThus, we reject Medicaid expansion in favor of a Virginia solution \u2014 private insurance that we refer to as Marketplace Virginia.\u201d\n\nThe state would subsidize private insurance premiums, following the \u201cprivate option\u201d approach taken in states such as Arkansas. If it can get Washington\u2019s blessing, Virginia would pay for that using the $2 billion a year that the federal government has offered for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the health-care law known informally as Obamacare.\n\nThose who oppose Medicaid expansion, a top priority for Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), said the only difference is semantics.\n\n\u201cYou can put all the lipstick you want on this pig and call it by another name; it\u2019s still Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Sen. William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin).\n\nThe Senate panel approved the Marketplace Virginia plan as part of a two-year, $96 billion spending plan it adopted ahead of a midnight deadline to get its budget out of committee. The House Appropriations Committee, facing the same deadline, passed a spending plan of its own \u2014 one that did not include Medicaid expansion \u2014 by that name or any other.\n\nThe House proposal makes some overtures to hospitals, which have pushed for Medicaid expansion in part to help them cover some charity care reimbursements that they lost under the ACA. The House bill provides about $81 million to help hospitals cover inflation and an extra $6 million to free health clinics around the state.\n\nThe House and Senate panels were working from a budget plan that then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) proposed shortly before leaving office in January. Both added about $5 million to provide \u201ccost of competing\u201d funds for non-teaching staff in Northern Virginia schools. The money is used to boost the salaries offered to staff in that expensive job market. McDonnell offered the funds for teaching staff, but not other school personnel.\n\nBoth chambers\u2019 plans add money for higher education, giving raises or bonuses to state employees and funding the state employee retirement system \u2014 although the two budget plans vary on the specifics, which eventually will have to be ironed out in a conference committee.\n\nThe House and Senate plans call for tearing down the 11-story General Assembly Building on Capitol Square and having a new one in place by 2019. The plan, which also includes renovations to the Old City Hall Building next door, would cost $280 million to $300 million.\n\nEach panel voted after presentations that briefly summarized the spending plans for a large crowd of lobbyists and activists, who lined up to get thick stacks of budget documents and began poring through them for the nitty-gritty details that mattered to them.\n\nAnna Scholl, executive director of ProgressVA, objected to language deep in the House budget that would eliminate support for Planned Parenthood and prohibit state funding of abortions performed in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re not continuing their attacks on women\u2019s health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that they\u2019re trying to do it under the radar.\u201d\n\nHouse leaders, who have been trying to combat Democrats\u2019 accusations that the GOP is waging a \u201cwar on women,\u201d highlighted that they have provided about $5.5 million in extra funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services.\n\nThe House and Senate panels made note of economic uncertainties in a state with a large population of federal employees and defense contractors. But each panel offered different prescriptions for addressing the issue, with the conservative House stashing more money away as a contingency and the more moderate Senate spending in ways intended to boost the workforce.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to ensure that we have adequate cash reserves on hand as we continue to emerge from one of the weakest recoveries in memory,\u201d said Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), the appropriations committee chairman.\n\n\u201cWith this murky recovery, we remain convinced that we must invest in our citizens to grow a dynamic, competitive workforce,\u201d Stosch said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose a single individual to unemployment or underemployment. To this end, in public education, you will see investment in early childhood education, support for year-round schools and enhanced funding for programs designed to improve student success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proposal would help 400,000 buy private insurance through a program called \u201cMarketplace Virginia.\u201d", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The proposal would help 400,000 buy private insurance through a program called \u201cMarketplace Virginia.\u201d", "title": "Va.
