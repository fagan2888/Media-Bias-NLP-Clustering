But beyond the hoopla, how many shoppers will actually show up in stores on turkey day?\n\nA lot, some and not many, depending on which poll you listen to.\n\nAccording to a survey from Deal News, a little more than half of consumers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day. But only 22.3 percent of consumers surveyed by the National Retail Federation said they definitely will or may shop on the holiday.\n\nRelated: Black Friday Shopping Guide: Who\u2019s Offering Deals on Thanksgiving Day\n\nEven fewer said they would in the surveys conducted by Deloitte and the International Council of Shopping Centers. ICSC\u2019s survey found that only 12 percent of people said they would be buying holiday gifts on Thanksgiving Day, while Deloitte\u2019s survey said 14 percent plan to shop in stores. (Twenty-four percent said they would shop online on the holiday.)\n\nReaders of NewsDash, a retirement benefits trade publication, are the most reluctant to get out to the mall on Thanksgiving. Only 2.7 percent of those surveyed said they would shop that day.\n\nSurveys show that consumers are similarly fickle about stores that stay open on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of NewsDash readers were unhappy with stores that opened on Thanksgiving Day, though no figure was cited. A Conlumino survey found that barely a majority of people -- 51.2 percent -- agreed or strongly agreed that stores should not be open.\n\nRelated: The Surprising Truth Behind Those Black Friday \u2018Deals\u2019\n\nThe Deloitte survey found that 56 percent of shoppers are more loyal to stores that close on Thanksgiving Day. By contrast, market research firm Vennli found that 87 percent of shoppers said a store\u2019s Thanksgiving opening had no bearing on whether they would shop there.\n\nVennli\u2019s survey, however, also found that 27 percent of shoppers noted that their biggest holiday shopping pet peeve was stores that open on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe above surveys included responses from a combined 16,821 consumers, who were polled in September and November. It\u2019s possible, though statistically unlikely, that consumers could have participated in more than one survey. The surveys from NewsDash and Vennli provided no figures on participation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The growing trend of retailers opening on Thanksgiving Day has generated lots of headl", "title": "Who\u2019s Shopping on Thanksgiving Day?
