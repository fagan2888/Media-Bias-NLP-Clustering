Apparently, the Affordable Care Act was the subject of some mockery in Nashburg last night at the annual festival of prefabricated hicks and manufactured shit kickers.

Let's forget, shall we, that the act is working gloriously in places like Kentucky, but that places like Tennessee, which hosted the yearly gathering of artificial redneck morons, have decided to sabotage the act because Tennessee insists on electing idiots, which is why there are a lot of the problems for Jethro and Zelda Mae to make sport of on the electric teevee. Let's also forget how much an actual Medicaid expansion would help in all those Southern states where these posers sell records and that have governors who suddenly find themselves allergic to Free Money (!) Let's also forget that none of the make-believe goobers on stage last night ever are going to have to make the decision between medicine for the kids and food on the table.

Let's forget all of that and concentrate on the main issue -- which is that I think modern country music sucks gigantic bowls of monkey dick. It is, weight for age, the phoniest genre of music since Pat Boone was ripping off Little Richard. Most of what is celebrated as "country" these days is simply bad rock and roll played by people who look like they flunked the audition for a Night Ranger tribute band. I mean, Taylor Fking Swift is already a "legend," and Patsy Cline would have eaten her on toast.

You know what country music is?

This is country music.

And this.

And this.

And, most assuredly, this.

If Gram Parsons weren't dead, this would kill him.
