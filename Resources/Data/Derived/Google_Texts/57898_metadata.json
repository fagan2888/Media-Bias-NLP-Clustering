The Air Force\u2019s Blue Book Project, ghosts, zombies, little green men from Mars, chem-trails, government spying on us.\n\nOrson Welles scared the entire nation with a radio show. People were sure that Ronald Reagan would push the nuclear button and annihilate us all.\n\nYet none of the aforementioned fears come anywhere close to the fear I see for Donald Trump both on TV and in social media.\n\nThe list of celebrities ready to leave for Canada grows by the day. The fact that they all want to go to Canada rather than Mexico is very telling.\n\nDo We Fear The Person?\n\nThose fearful of a Trump presidency might have good grounds. Trump has done what no other politician in modern political history has ever done.\n\nHe has no real staff, no army of volunteers, no big dollars spent on advertising, yet he has totally vanquished 15-16 other GOP competitors with all those things.\n\nGoing into the primary and debate season most people would not have given Donald Trump a chance in a million to be the last man standing.\n\nYet, here we are, a few months later, and he would seem to be the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nWhat did he bring to the table that the other candidates lacked? Almost all of the opposition candidates spent many more dollars than Trump.\n\nBut the most obvious answer is that Trump formulated a message that resonated with GOP voters. And it was not a boring establishment message. Trump said out loud what rank and file voters were privately thinking.\n\nHe gave people permission to be politically incorrect. To defend their personal beliefs even when vilification and personal, and physical attacks would be the response from those with opposing views.\n\nUnlike other politicians \u2014 Trump walked the walk.\n\nOr, Do We Fear His Policies?\n\nTrump wants a wall on the southern border; Trump wants to end our trade imbalance with China and other trading partners.\n\nTrump wants to bring jobs back to America. Trump wants a moratorium on bringing overseas money back to the US.\n\nTrump wants a simplified tax plan. Trump want Obamacare replaced with something more workable.\n\nTrump wants a temporary ban on Middle East refugees until they can be properly vetted.\n\nTrump wants to go after ISIS and eliminate them.\n\nNot sure I see any scary proposals there that will send me screaming toward either border.\n\nSome Final Thoughts\n\nHow did the Trump cream rise to the top? I think Trump won the GOP nomination in the first week after he declared his candidacy.\n\nHe did what no other politician had ever done. When confronted for his beliefs he didn\u2019t walk anything back.\n\nHe lost his TV show, several sponsors, Univision, the Miss America Pageant, yet he stood his ground. He obviously lost millions in revenue.\n\nHe also said he was self-funding his campaign. Who has ever done that in the modern era of American Politics?\n\nWhether he funds his own campaign or not doesn\u2019t really matter. The message to voters was clear.\n\nThe perception of a politician that can\u2019t be bought by special interests also resonated clearly with voters.\n\nHe became the blue-collar millionaire candidate. The champion of the little guy. The one and only Republican politician so far that will do what he say\u2019s he will do.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion?\n\nComments below", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/kmmsam.com/files/2016/05/GettyImages-529033238.jpg", "sailthru.author": "tomegelhoff", "description": "How did the Trump cream rise to the top?
