John Kasich often speaks about mental health in his campaign for president. He has defended his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio by highlighting its benefits for mentally ill residents.\n\nHe is probably the only Republican candidate this year to ask a crowd, \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like for somebody to live with depression?\u201d\n\nThe question, posed at a rally in upstate New York recently, threw a hush over a room of 1,000 people. Kasich went on: \u201cThere are people here who know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nKasich is one who knows.\n\nHis only brother, Richard, 59, has struggled with depression disorders since college. He was occasionally hospitalized and today receives disability benefits for mental illness.\n\nThe Kasich brothers have taken vastly different paths from their hometown, McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, an industrial suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\nJohn Kasich, 63, began a political career at age 26 as the youngest person ever elected to the Ohio Senate. Rick Kasich, who once hoped to be a lawyer, suffered a breakdown at Penn State, he said, and ended up washing pots and pans at a Wendy\u2019s after leaving college.\n\nJohn Kasich served 18 years in the House of Representatives and is a two-term Ohio governor. Rick Kasich \u2014 who says he learned he had manic depression, an earlier name for bipolar disorder, after a stay in a Michigan hospital \u2014 worked for more than two decades loading mail trucks at a Pittsburgh post office.\n\nFor one of his town-hall-style events recently, the day before the Pennsylvania primary, John Kasich returned to McKees Rocks, where he has become known for dispensing hugs and speaking of bringing people \u201cout of the shadows.\u201d\n\nHis general sense of empathy on the campaign trail is part of his appeal to moderate Republicans. But people who have worked with John Kasich, including aides, political allies and mental health advocates, say it is likely to have come in part from his personal experience \u2014 and, as in millions of American families dealing with mental illness, that experience has often been difficult.\n\nThe brothers did not speak for 19 years. Though they have been reconciled for a decade, their exchanges can be testy, to hear Rick Kasich describe them.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much to do with me, and I don\u2019t have much to say about him,\u201d Rick Kasich said in his first extended interview with a reporter.\n\nHe said he had watched about five minutes of a Republican debate before the Ohio primary but has not paid close attention to his brother\u2019s campaign. He had no plans to attend the event in McKees Rocks.\n\nPeople who have worked closely with John Kasich are vaguely aware of his brother, but the governor never discusses him on the campaign trail and declined to be interviewed about him.\n\nHis campaign did send a statement on behalf of John Kasich and other relatives:\n\n\u201cWe love Rick deeply and have shared the struggles that his disease brings with it. As families with a loved one living with mental illness know, you take it one day at a time, and some days are better than others.\n\n\u201cIn the process, we have all become sensitive to and supportive of the needs of those living with this disease. Among the ways we support him is by working hard to protect his privacy, and we hope others respect that also.\u201d\n\nWith gray hair falling below his shoulders and sunglasses that he rarely removes, Rick Kasich spoke to a reporter outside a Pittsburgh coffee shop last week, dropping the butts of one Pall Mall after another into a cup of water. He had agreed to be interviewed and he talked freely about his mental illness and his relationship with the governor, as well as about his life and his decades in the area.\n\nA Pittsburgh Pirates hat sat on a table. He said he had been to just one Pirates game in his life. \u201cIt was years ago, when the Pirates were at Three Rivers Stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were teenagers smoking pot on the ramp. I said I\u2019d never go to another game again.\u201d\n\nWaving an arm to take in the neighborhood, a gentrifying district where young people in sandals carry rolled yoga mats, he said that \u201ceveryone around here\u201d liked his brother.\n\nIt was certainly a different kind of place from McKees Rocks. As John Kasich tells almost every audience, he grew up the son of a mailman in a blue-collar town where \u201cif the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work.\u201d\n\nThe brothers\u2019 family was stable, if not well off. His parents\u2019 largest assets were U.S. savings bonds. Their house was valued at $56,500 in 1987 at the time of their deaths in an automobile accident.\n\nFormer high school teachers have called young John one of their best students in decades, excelling at public speaking. Rick Kasich said he had never felt overshadowed by his brother, who was off to college the year Rick entered ninth grade.\n\nAt Penn State, Rick Kasich recalled, he took philosophy courses, developing an interest in Immanuel Kant, and he formed a lifelong love for Bob Dylan and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, artists he listens to regularly today.\n\n\u201cI felt I had a breakdown in my freshman year in the spring of 1975,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I was not going to be a lawyer anymore.\u201d\n\nAs a young man, he became a born-again Christian, and he spends early mornings taping music or evangelical preachers on the radio with a cassette player. \u201cI\u2019ve made 101 cassettes since the first of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all numbered and dated.\u201d\n\nThe two Kasichs (they also have a younger sister, Donna) resemble each other in gestures, in their oval faces and in their sometimes brusque expressiveness.\n\nBoth also wear their faith on their sleeves. Rick Kasich kept a pocket-size copy of biblical verses on the table beside him, its pages annotated with the dates he first read passages that struck him.\n\n\u201cMy brother preached to the Orthodox Jews in New York,\u201d Rick Kasich said, referring to a recent appearance at a synagogue on Long Island, which he said his brother had told him about. \u201cI am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly, though, he returned to the root of the animosity with his brother, which in his mind began with the tragic death of their parents. Pulling out of a Burger King across the Ohio River from McKees Rocks, John and Anne Kasich, both 67, were struck by a drunken driver.\n\nOn the stump, their son John mentions the accident frequently as a devastating chapter in his life that he survived through a reawakening of his Christianity.\n\nFor Rick Kasich, it was something else. His parents\u2019 will put John in control of Rick\u2019s share of their estate, which totaled about $300,000, apparently because the senior Kasichs were worried about Rick\u2019s mental stability.\n\nWhen John sold the family home, which Rick wanted to live in, he was furious. He said he had hired a lawyer to challenge the will and had succeeded in gaining his share of the estate. He and his wife, Andrea, used it to buy a two-story brick house with leaded-glass windows for $103,000, not far from Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\u201cMy brother told me, \u2018If you sue me, I won\u2019t have anything to do with you,'\u201d Rick Kasich said, in his version of events. For the next 19 years, as John Kasich rose in Congress, undertook a short-lived presidential run in 1999 and entered the private sector as a banker, they never spoke.\n\nAlthough Rick Kasich drank heavily after his parents\u2019 death, he said, he has been sober for several years.\n\nThen in 2006, the year his wife died, Rick Kasich said, a lawyer told him to call his brother.\n\n\u201cI called him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been praying for you,\"\u2019 John Kasich replied, according to his brother.\n\nOn the stump and in debates, John Kasich is the only Republican candidate who regularly invokes mental illness. Challenged at a debate about why he expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, a decision that enraged conservatives, Kasich answered: \u201cI had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons.\u201d\n\nIn upstate New York, his mention of the prevalence of depression was in response to an audience question about controlling drug costs.\n\nDrugmakers have argued that their revenue pays for the development of new medications, and Kasich told the crowd that he would not want to do anything to shut down research. \u201cThe way it\u2019s been described to me is it\u2019s like waking up every single day stuck in tar,\u201d he said of depression. \u201cAnd for these people, it\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\nRick Kasich said a drug, Abilify, was helpful in managing his current diagnosis, schizoaffective disorder, which he called a \u201cgrab bag\u201d of symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. He was quick to add that he was not schizophrenic.\n\nAs he sipped coffee, he said that he used to have panic attacks but that his current medication suppressed them. He said embracing Christianity also had a positive influence. \u201cI got saved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed to help.\u201d\n\nOne of his most recent contacts with his brother, he recalled, was on Easter. The exchange seemed to typify a relationship that is not always easy.\n\n\u201cHe called and said, \u2018He has risen,'\u201d Rick Kasich said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s brother recalled his own brusque reply.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I know that.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "G ov.
