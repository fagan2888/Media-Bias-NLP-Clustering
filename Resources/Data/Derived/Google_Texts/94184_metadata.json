The new hub would allow the organization to have complete control of its supply chain from the manufacturer to a patient\u2019s bedside.\n\n\u201cIt reduces the role of the middleman,\u201d said Chris Karam, president of Saint Joseph\u2019s Mishawaka Medical Center. He explained that Trinity Health will purchase its supplies directly from manufacturers instead of through a third-party distributor and store them at the Fort Wayne hub. The health care organization will then distribute medical and surgical supplies to its health systems, like Saint Joseph.\n\nNot only will the move cut costs, Karam said, but it will also improve the health care system\u2019s control over its inventory and ensure speedier delivery of supplies.\n\nWork on the Fort Wayne hub is expected to begin this month and be complete this fall.\n\nIt will affect the Mishawaka and Plymouth hospitals first, but will expand eventually to include Saint Joseph\u2019s other operations, including its senior living and home care services and the physician network.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to successfully reduce costs,\u201d Karam said, \u201cthen it allows us to focus more on programming for the Michiana community.\u201d\n\nTrinity Health plans to build three more satellite warehouses by 2020 in other regions of its network, which covers 21 states. However, the Fort Wayne building will remain the central hub for its distribution system. It has hired Connecticut-based XPO Logistics to manage and operate the four facilities.\n\n\u201cWhat really allows us to do this now is the scale and size of Trinity Health,\u201d Karam said. Like other health care organizations across the country, it\u2019s been consolidating and growing to better operate under changes the Affordable Care Act has brought to health care. It now has about 90 hospitals.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Friday that the new model would save Trinity Health $20 million in costs annually.\n\naculp@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6343\n\n@AliceCulpSBT", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "MISHAWAKA \u2014 Saint Joseph Health System\u2019s distribution of medical supplies is about to become a lot more efficient.", "title": "Trinity Health to build supply hub", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/trinity-health-to-build-supply-hub/article_4d2e14ad-cac3-5aa2-b1e7-7352b34a62b0.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/04/7047d32b-0eca-5808-9092-4dd88f6e4ef3/56e8ee06da525.image.jpg?resize=760%2C499", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sbtribune", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/04/7047d32b-0eca-5808-9092-4dd88f6e4ef3/56e8ee06da525.image.jpg?resize=760%2C499", "description": "MISHAWAKA \u2014 Saint Joseph Health System\u2019s distribution of medical supplies is about to become a lot more efficient.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trinity Health to build supply hub"}, "description": "MISHAWAKA \u2014 Saint Joseph Health System\u2019s distribution of medical supplies is about to become a lot more efficient.", "Published Date": "2016-03-16T06:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "keywords": "#loc,saint joseph health system,mishawaka,trinity health,affordable care act,business,top_story", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/451859304833658"}, "news_keywords": "#loc,saint joseph health system,mishawaka,trinity health,affordable care act,business,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Like other health care organizations across the country, it\u2019s been consolidating and growing to better operate under changes the Affordable Care Act has brought to health care.\nThe health care system\u2019s parent company, Trinity Health, is building a $26 million, 400,000- square-foot distribution hub for medical and surgical supplies in Fort Wayne.\n\u201cWhat really allows us to do this now is the scale and size of Trinity Health,\u201d Karam said.\nThe Washington Post reported Friday that the new model would save Trinity Health $20 million in costs annually.\nThe health care organization will then distribute medical and surgical supplies to its health systems, like Saint Joseph."}
