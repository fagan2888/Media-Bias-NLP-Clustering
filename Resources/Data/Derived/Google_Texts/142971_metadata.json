It\u2019s a comic-book show, but it\u2019s not your average comic-book show. It stars a superhero, but she\u2019s not your average superhero. And it\u2019s about good guys beating up bad guys, but not in the classic caped-crusader airborne battle. \u201cJessica Jones\u201d is instead a story of one superhero in a hostile world\u2014a single character\u2019s slice in what is otherwise a sprawling, Technicolor supernatural universe. Even in the original comics the show is based on, Jessica Jones is defined by her difference from the rest of Marvel\u2019s superheroes. She left the Avengers to be a private eye, starting her own detective agency, Alias Investigations. It helps that she can break padlocks with one hand, but her greatest asset isn\u2019t super-strength, it\u2019s her tenacity. And she doesn\u2019t have a superhero alterego; if anything, she prefers the shadows to the limelight.\n\nThis is why, if you\u2019re a newcomer to comic books, or even just not that interested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d now available on Netflix, could still be for you. Aside from the fact that a few people in the story have extraordinary abilities, there are no costumes, no aliens and no easy answers. Jessica (Krysten Ritter, in the show) doesn\u2019t run around and save the day for other people; she works cases while trying to untangle the mess that is her own life. Much like Veronica Mars, that other cult-favorite noir-ish private eye, Jessica is carrying around a central, unspoken mystery, a horrible trauma that she is barely able to live with. The story of the first season of \u201cJessica Jones\u201d is that the perpetrator of the trauma\u2014a mind-controlling psychopath named Kilgrave (David Tennant)\u2014is looking for Jessica, and has just finally found her again.\n\nThe show is not, unfortunately, perfect. Ritter is perfect, Tennant is perfect, and the bones of the story\u2014which come from the comics\u2019 creators, Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos\u2014are still completely chilling. Kilgrave made Jessica his puppet for a whole month, making her his ideal and subservient romantic partner. The word \u201crape\u201d is not used until Episode 8, but it is clear, from the start, that Jessica is a trauma survivor. She copes with alcohol and insomnia; no one gets close to her, and she doesn\u2019t get too close to anyone. The superpowers make the story bigger, broader and more tangible\u2014Kilgrave doesn\u2019t just bully people to doing what he wants, he gets into their heads and makes it so\u2014but the story is very human, just the same. \u201cJessica Jones\u201d is that rare genre story that uses the supernatural not to obfuscate, but instead to better illustrate a human story. And as a result, it\u2019s an extraordinary meditation on violence perpetuated by men against women, whether that is rape, stalking, harassment or abuse. Kilgrave dabbles in all of them, and Tennant\u2019s mad-happy performance conveys both the charisma and appeal of the abuser and his frightening, sudden ability to shift to violence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marvel's \"Jessica Jones\" isn't your average comic book adaptation\u2014it's more \"Veronica Mars\" than \"Super Girl\"", "title": "\u201cJessica Jones\u201d: Marvel\u2019s newest show makes surviving trauma a superpower", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Marvel's \"Jessica Jones\" isn't your average comic book adaptation\u2014it's more \"Veronica Mars\" than \"Super Girl\"", "title": "\u201cJessica Jones\u201d: Marvel\u2019s newest show makes surviving trauma a superpower", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/jessica_jones_marvels_newest_show_makes_surviving_trauma_a_superpower/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/jessica_jones2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marvel's \"Jessica Jones\" isn't your average comic book adaptation\u2014it's more \"Veronica Mars\" than \"Super Girl\"", "title": "\u201cJessica Jones\u201d: Marvel\u2019s newest show makes surviving trauma a superpower", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/jessica_jones2.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, david tennant, jessica jones, krysten ritter, marvel's jessica jones, Netflix, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: david tennant, jessica jones, krysten ritter, marvel's jessica jones, Netflix, TV, Entertainment News\u201cMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones,\u201d the second Marvel Studios property to be led by a female character, is best described by explaining what it is not.\nEven in the original comics the show is based on, Jessica Jones is defined by her difference from the rest of Marvel\u2019s superheroes.\n\u201cJessica Jones\u201d is that rare genre story that uses the supernatural not to obfuscate, but instead to better illustrate a human story.\nThis is why, if you\u2019re a newcomer to comic books, or even just not that interested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d now available on Netflix, could still be for you.\n\u201cJessica Jones\u201d is instead a story of one superhero in a hostile world\u2014a single character\u2019s slice in what is otherwise a sprawling, Technicolor supernatural universe."}
