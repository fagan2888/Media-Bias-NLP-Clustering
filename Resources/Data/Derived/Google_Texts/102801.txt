Having just released their fourth album "Here and Nowhere Else" in April, grungy indie rockers Cloud Nothings are riding high this festival season, hitting up Bonnaroo, then Pitchfork Festival in Chicago next month before heading to Europe, where they'll be hitting fests in Norway, the UK, Germany and France. For now, though, fresh off the plane in Manchester, frontman Dylan Baldi took a few minutes to chat about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.

"I used to not like this at all," Baldi tells Billboard of the festival circuit, a far cry from the DIY house shows that birthed the Cleveland quartet, "but then I started thinking, 'Well, not many people get a chance to even play at stuff like this,' so it's exciting, in its own way."

"We only play stuff from the most recent two records," he continued, "and luckily those records are a half hour long each, so we can just play 'em both, pretty much all the way through, every song. It's really rewarding to know that working really hard at something for a long time actually pays off. It's nice to know that that's real."

Next week, the band heads to the Phillippines, Thailand and Japan for a short splash of Asia dates before continuing their tour through the west and Midwest U.S. Check out more Bonnaroo video interviews and performances below.
