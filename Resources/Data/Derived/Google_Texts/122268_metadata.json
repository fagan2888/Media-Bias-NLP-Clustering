O\u2019Bannon, Ph.D.\n\nDespite the closing of some clinics (usually in pursuit of greater profits) and constant complaints about \u201cassaults on reproductive rights,\u201d Planned Parenthood again made hundreds of millions last year off of abortion as the country\u2019s largest \u201cabortion provider,\u201d which is today responsible for about a third of all America\u2019s abortions.\n\nPPFA\u2019s overall $1.3 billion income for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, was a record. Put in perspective, according to 2013 figures from the World Bank, a country with a gross domestic product this high would rank ahead of Greenland, Grenada, Tonga, Micronesia and several other independent countries.\n\nTo be clear the aforementioned $1.3 billion in income is not all directly from abortion, but a substantial portion of it is and a lot more is indirectly connected. (See below.)\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2013-2014 Annual Report, \u201cOur Health, Our Decisions, Our Moment\u201d (www.plannedparenthood.org/files/6714/1996/2641/2013-2014_Annual_Report_FINAL_WEB_VERSION.pdf ), clinics affiliated with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) performed 327,653 abortions in 2013. This is up slightly from 2012\u2019s 327,166, but just a bit below 2011\u2019s record 333,964.\n\nThe stability of Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion count \u2013 between 324,000 and 334,000 since 2008 \u2013 is remarkable, given that national figures for abortions have been in a nosedive since 2008; they have dropped 13% in just three years. Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to continue to prosper in a \u201cdown market\u201d is a testament to PPFA\u2019s unchallenged role as the overwhelmingly dominant provider of abortion and its powerful political connections.\n\nAbortion income: direct and indirect\n\nAt the going rate for standard surgical abortion at 10 weeks ($451 is the figure from Guttmacher for 2009), the 327,653 abortions performed by Planned Parenthood would represent at least $147.7 million. That does not account for the greater cost of chemical abortions, which are a big part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s total and are heavily promoted and widely available at its clinics.\n\nNor does the figure take into consideration that many PPFA clinics offer considerably more expensive second trimester abortions (over a hundred clinics, with more than a dozen of those offering abortions at 20 weeks or more), meaning that $147.7 million is likely an extremely conservative figure.\n\nNot often talked about is that when women come into Planned Parenthood for abortion, they are also sold pregnancy tests, contraceptives, and may be tested and treated for sexually transmitted diseases or infections. These will be counted and costed as separate \u201cservices\u201d but all may be connected to the abortion visit.\n\nFor all their talk about \u201cchoice\u201d and allowing women to make their own determinations with regard to their pregnancies, the services such women receive at PPFA clinics are decidedly one-sided. According to the annual report, the breakdown of services rendered specifically to pregnant women shows Planned Parenthood\u2019s clear institutional bias: prenatal care 5.4%, adoption 0.5%, abortion 94.1%.\n\nLooked at another way, these figures tell us nearly 19 out of every 20 pregnant women who got these services at Planned Parenthood were sold abortions. And notice that abortions outnumbered adoption referrals by a more than a 174 to one.\n\nUsing Tax Dollars, Angling For More\n\nDespite of (and sadly, in some places, perhaps because of) its clear abortion agenda, Planned Parenthood continues to receive an inordinate amount of its funding from taxpayers. We learn from the report that 41% of its revenues are from \u201cGovernment Health Services Grants & Reimbursements.\u201d\n\nThese are services or programs paid for by local, state, or federal governments. While law prevents federal dollars from paying directly for abortion (those dollars mean more private funds available for that purpose, though), many state and local governments do fund abortions, helping to keep the abortion giant running.\n\nPPFA is fully aware of the significance of its government ties, seen not only in the dollars and energy expended in recent elections (see www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/2014/11/political-money-mobilization-unable-to-buy-elections-for-planned-parenthoods-political-arm/#.VK2KJivF_mY), but in their concerted effort to promote ObamaCare, which could deliver them customers for years to come.\n\nThe annual report notes that Planned Parenthood reached \u201cmore than 1.7 million people in 18 cities across eight states\u201d with information about their eligibility for new health insurance and says it was able to help over 100,000 fill out their applications. It also noted, in the same sentence, that it had registered 15,000 people to vote.\n\nAbortion Defense and Advocacy\n\nPlanned Parenthood bills itself not only as \u201cthe nation\u2019s leading reproductive health care provider\u201d but also adds \u201cand advocate.\u201d It is clear from this latest annual report that they take that \u201cadvocate\u201d role seriously, and that the defense and promotion of abortion is a central part of that advocacy.\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion agenda was being thwarted in many statehouses across the country, the group trumpets the claim that \u201cWe won court victories protecting abortion access.\u201d They have in mind restrictions placed on chemical abortions in Arizona that enforced the protocol approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a rule in Iowa requiring physicians to be present when chemical abortions are prescribed (which is not the case with so-called \u201cweb-cam abortions\u201d where the abortionist only interacts with his patient over the internet). And appeals were pending at the time of the report.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also hailed a federal judge\u2019s decision on an Alabama law that would have required abortionists to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, a reasonable regulation designed to insure the abortionist be able to accompany his \u201cpatient\u201d to a local hospital when emergencies arise.\n\nWhat is remarkable is not that Planned Parenthood temporarily won in some courts what they could not win in the legislatures \u2013 this is, after all, the legacy of Roe v. Wade \u2013 but that they were only partially, and one hopes, temporarily successful in that regard.\n\nThe photo from one section of \u201cOur Health, Our Decisions, Our Moment\u201d features a woman wearing a \u201cStand with Texas Women\u201d T-Shirt, a state where Planned Parenthood invested enormous amounts of money and publicity. Their political star\u2014pro-abortion state Senator Wendy Davis\u2014was obliterated in her race for governor, and the courts are still listening with varying amounts of skepticism to a flurry of lawsuits filed against Texas\u2019 H.B.2. Planned Parenthood also says they\u2019re \u201cpushing back\u201d against other laws in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin where they have seen limited success.\n\nAiming for the Next Generation\n\nPlanned Parenthood touts the existence of 200 college campus groups, 182% more than they had just three years ago, and the deployment of 1,503 \u201cpeer educators\u201d \u2013 young advocates for Planned Parenthood\u2019s agenda \u2013 to reach \u201cnearly 100,000\u2033 of their peers across the country.\n\nA quote featured in this section shows where this outreach is headed. After \u201cDakota\u201d mentioned learning about Planned Parenthood when visiting the clinic with her mother and eventually getting involved in the peer educator program there, she shares, \u201cMy plan is to go to medical school and become an abortion provider. Being part of Planned Parenthood gives me the space to do this work.\u201d\n\nJust how saturated the report is with spin is made apparent in the section proudly proclaiming that \u201cWe fought abortion stigma in popular culture.\u201d The discussion here centers around the awful film \u201cObvious Child\u201d which featured the story of a woman unapologetically getting an abortion. It was supposed to be a comedy. Planned Parenthood calls it \u201cedgy, hip, funny, remarkably honest\u201d though there was little-to-no honesty about either the humanity of the \u201cobvious child\u201d or the psychological pain that follows many women after their abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood hailed the movie as a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d when it came out, but failed to highlight the integral role it played in bringing the story to screen. Now here in the annual report PPFA mentions how they \u201cworked for years with the film\u2019s writer, director, and producers to shape the story, helped them film it in a Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic health center, and oversaw its release to widespread critical and commercial success.\u201d\n\nWhile there were some of the usual media sycophants that gave \u201cObvious Child\u201d the politically correct praise that might be expected, it is a far stretch to call the film a \u201ccommercial success.\u201d According to Box Office Mojo, the domestic total gross for the film was just $3,123,963. The highest it ever ranked in any week of its release was #19. For the year, it came in #158, behind \u201cThe Lunchbox,\u201d \u201cVampire Academy,\u201d and the 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d\n\nLike much of the rest of Planned Parenthood\u2019s talk about abortion and the unborn child, there\u2019s more spin than substance to their claims.\n\nLeaner \u2026 and Meaner\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not mention how many clinics it closed or affiliates it merged in the year, but notes the \u201c25 percent increase in productivity\u201d that followed efforts to help \u201c35 affiliates strengthen their operations.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood claims to have opened 10 new \u201chealth centers,\u201d though one of the three it specifically mentions (Tacoma, WA) appears to be a relocation and another (Fayetteville, NC) seems to be a mega-clinic that opened in 2009.\n\nPPFA affiliates all over the country have been building and opening giant new megaclinics over the past ten years, massive modern new facilities that can not only process many more abortions a day, but also can meet new health codes being passed by many state legislatures.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, even as the culture around them grows increasingly uncomfortable with their signature product, Planned Parenthood is as committed to abortion as it ever was and is looking for ways to defend and expand its abortion empire.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPFAannualreportp1re-231x300.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a3f\"", "article_summary": "According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2013-2014 Annual Report, \u201cOur Health, Our Decisions, Our Moment\u201d (www.plannedparenthood.org/files/6714/1996/2641/2013-2014_Annual_Report_FINAL_WEB_VERSION.pdf ), clinics affiliated with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) performed 327,653 abortions in 2013.\nPlanned Parenthood also says they\u2019re \u201cpushing back\u201d against other laws in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin where they have seen limited success.\nPlanned Parenthood hailed the movie as a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d when it came out, but failed to highlight the integral role it played in bringing the story to screen.\nAccording to the annual report, the breakdown of services rendered specifically to pregnant women shows Planned Parenthood\u2019s clear institutional bias: prenatal care 5.4%, adoption 0.5%, abortion 94.1%.\nLooked at another way, these figures tell us nearly 19 out of every 20 pregnant women who got these services at Planned Parenthood were sold abortions."}
