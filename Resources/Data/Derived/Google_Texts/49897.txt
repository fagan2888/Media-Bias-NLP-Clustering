Watch the Republicans closely. They’re about to claim they saved Obamacare. In fact, they’ll change the name of it to McConnellcare. All this will be accomplished by 2016 and the American voting public will fall for it because we’ll believe anything and conveniently know what to forget and when to forget it. Jeb Bush will be the next president and Mike Huckabee will be veep and they’ll pledge to make McConnellcare even better. And before you know it, the American voter will forget there ever was a President Obama or Democratic Party. There will be no middle class but there will be what the Republicans will call The Righteous Right or the Magnanimous Minions who will be known for giving all their money to help the rich get richer. The poor will live on the beaches and roll cigars for the rich. Wait a minute. Am I describing Cuba?
