REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach\n\n4052346\n\nIntractably painful life-or-death medical and legal disputes will become even more gut-wrenching and perilous under Obamacare.\n\nGranted, death defies easy definition in our world of advanced medical technology and moving moral guideposts. Yet we cannot escape Hamlet\u2019s aching lament, \u201cTo be or not to be, that is the question.\u201d\n\nHere, at this most basic level of human existence, Obamacare moves us away from the liberty of individual healthcare freedom and towards heartless institutionalized decisionmaking.\n\nJahi McMath, a beautiful, shy, and friendly 13 year old awaited the emotionally and financially costly decision of judges, doctors, hospital administrators, and family of whether she will continue to be.\n\nAfter a routine tonsillectomy for sleep apnea, things went terribly wrong for Jahi. She began to bleed profusely and suffered a heart attack. Medical personnel at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland, California, shocked her heart to keep it beating, but later tests reported that she had no brain activity.\n\nThe hospital told Jahi\u2019s family that she no longer lived and they would remove her life support. Jahi\u2019s mother countered that, with the ventilator, \u201cshe lives, her heart beats, her kidneys produce urine, she is warm and soft.\u201d\n\nDoctors saw Jahi as dead. Hospital administrators saw Jahi as a drag on profitability. The hospital\u2019s spin doctors saw Jahi and sought to create their own perceived reality.\n\nOne lawyer saw Jahi and fought for her survival. One lawyer saw Jahi as a problem to solve and fought for the hospital to win legal permission to pull the plug on a corpse.\n\nOne judge read pleadings, heard arguments, and decided to give Jahi\u2019s family more time to find another facility willing to care for her. On Sunday, Jahi\u2019s family moved her from Children\u2019s to another location.\n\nObamacare makes these heart-breaking cases worse in three ways.\n\nFirst, Obamacare denies our freedom to choose health insurance that fits our lifestyle and moral guideposts. The statute substitutes a patient\u2019s wishes with that of uncaring, unconnected, and unelected administrators in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Gayle Trotter", "description": "A legal dispute over whether to pull the plug on a 13-year old underscores the state's power over mortality.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Intractably painful life-or-death medical and legal disputes will become even more gut-wrenching and perilous under Obamacare.
