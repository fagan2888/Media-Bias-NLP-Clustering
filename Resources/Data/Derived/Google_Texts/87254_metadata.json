You can tell they\u2019re nervous.\n\n\u201cLike it or not, all of us hold unconscious beliefs about various social and identity groups,\u201d says Dr. Rene Salazar, a professor from the medical school. \u201cA lot of folks come to San Francisco thinking, \u2018Oh it\u2019s such an open-minded place, there are no biases here.\u2019 That\u2019s not true. You\u2019re going to see this in every hospital. It\u2019s going to be an issue.\u201d\n\nWhat Salazar wants these students to talk about is not other people\u2019s biases. But their own. And not just the biases they know they have. But the ones they don\u2019t know \u2013- or don\u2019t believe \u2013- they have.\n\n\u201cMany times we think about bias and unconscious bias, they are incompatible with our conscious values, right?\u201d he says.\n\nBefore the class, students were asked to take an implicit association test, a series of timed computer tests that measure people\u2019s unconscious attitudes around race, gender, age, weight and other categories. Salazar asks who wants to share their results.\n\nThe students study their fingernails.\n\nSalazar lets the silence linger a few seconds before clearing his throat.\n\n\u201cWell, I can share with you my story,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he took the test for the first time, it showed that he had a preference for whites, or, a bias against African-Americans \u2014 75 percent of people who take the race test show an automatic preference for whites.\n\n\u201cI was struck,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly being in the health professions and wanting to serve diverse communities, to learn that I had these biases, it was a bit disheartening.\u201d\n\nSo he began to explore where these biases came from.\n\n\u201cI grew up in south Texas, 99 percent Mexican-American. Mostly Latino. In my high school, we had one black student,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so up until age 18, you can imagine, a lot of my ideas, a lot of my attitudes, a lot of my beliefs about folks who were black came from what? The media.\u201d\n\nDifferent from Traditional Diversity Training\n\nSalazar has the students break up into small groups to discuss their test results. There was a familiar refrain in each circle, no matter if the student was white, Asian, Latino or Middle Eastern.\n\n\u201cI was a little surprised,\u201d one student says, about her results on the gender-career test.\n\n\u201cAnd I was also surprised,\u201d another says, about her results on the age test.\n\nA woman named Amanda explains to her group that her parents made their way to the U.S. from Iran, and settled in Marin County. She took the test that measures bias against Muslims, and another on light and dark skin tone.\n\n\u201cI kind of went in thinking that these are two areas that I would probably not have a bias, and that\u2019s kind of why I chose them,\u201d she says.\n\nBut the results were not what she expected.\n\n\u201cIt was like, actually, you\u2019re biased and you don\u2019t like brown people and you don\u2019t like Muslims,\u201d she says, \u201cWhich is interesting for me because that\u2019s kind of the two things that I am.\u201d\n\nClasses like these are rare. Salazar says only about a dozen medical schools in the country are teaching students about unconscious bias.\n\nThe UCSF curriculum is based on a training designed by Howard Ross, founder of a diversity and management consulting firm, Cook Ross. He developed the new unconscious bias approach after realizing the traditional diversity training he was doing in the \u201980s and \u201990s didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cPeople who seemed to have transformative responses to those trainings, to have that kind of \u2018aha\u2019 moments, particularly people in the dominant group, whites, men, heterosexuals, often if you talk to them a month or two later, they actually felt quite wounded by the experience and sometimes even a backlash,\u201d Ross says.\n\nA study in the Harvard Business Review examined diversity training programs at more than 800 companies over 30 years. Turns out, overall, they do nothing to change people\u2019s prejudices or improve diversity. In some cases, they actually reinforce bias.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is, ultimately, we feel bad about ourselves, or bad about the person that made us feel that way,\u201d Ross says.\n\nLearning to Recognize and Manage Unconscious Bias\n\nSo rather than making people feel bad or awkward, Ross and Salazar, more than anything, want people to accept that bias is part of being human.\n\n\u201cYou know we all have them,\u201d Salazar tells his class at UCSF. \u201cIt\u2019s important to pause for a second and normalize this. And be OK with this.\u201d\n\nSalazar emphasizes that unconscious bias can\u2019t be eliminated, but it can be managed.\n\n\u201cSo how do we address our bias? What do we do?\u201d\n\nOne student says, slow down.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Salazar responds. \u201cA trick that I use is that I pause before I walk in, take 10 seconds even, 15 seconds, just to try to clear your mind and go in with that clean slate.\u201d\n\nHe tells students they can also be vigilant about bias in their work. He asks for some examples of how bias might show up in the pharmacy.\n\nOne student talks about disparities he\u2019s noticed in refilling pain medication.\n\n\u201cThere might be some racial profiling that goes on,\u201d he says, adding that in pharmacies where he\u2019s worked before, some patients are denied refills more than others. \u201cMore so that are Hispanic or African-American, versus patients who are Caucasian.\u201d\n\nOther students talk about biases toward low-income HIV patients, or patients who don\u2019t speak English. Another student says he noticed bias coming from the patients themselves. When he was in high school, he worked as a technician for an older African-American pharmacist.\n\n\u201cEvery time she would be counseling patients, the patient would look to me for confirmation,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she was like, \u2018You know what, you\u2019ve got three things going for you: You\u2019re a white male, you wear glasses, people are automatically going to think you\u2019re more intelligent than me. They\u2019re going to continue to look to you for validation of what I say.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know if these new trainings on unconscious bias actually have any effect on what goes on in the exam room. Participants fill out evaluation forms after the class, and these anecdotal self-reports are often positive. But there have been no formal studies to measure if anything in patient care has actually changed.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when that door closes? What happens in the interaction when I can\u2019t see the patient and the doctor talking?\u201d Salazar says. \u201cThat\u2019s a little hard to capture.\u201d\n\nBut UCSF is betting that it will make a difference. After several key faculty did the unconscious bias training, they began requiring all first-year medical school students to do it. The nursing school has long embraced the concept. And more recently, the pharmacy and dentistry schools have asked Salazar to train their students, too.\n\nSalazar and other leaders believe the younger generation of health care providers could help shift medicine -\u2013 by learning early how to keep their own biases in check.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not diversity training.
