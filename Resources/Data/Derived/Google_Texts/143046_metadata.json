In July, Harrison Street announced its $37.8 million purchase of the Minnesota Valley Surgery Center at 1000 140th St. W. in Burnsville.\n\nThe deals are an indicator of the continuing interest in health care real estate, a category generally considered one of the most stable and relatively low-risk sectors for long-term investment in commercial real estate.\n\nStill, the likely prospect of sweeping changes to the U.S. health care system, brought by the Affordable Care Act, has introduced a degree of uncertainty among stakeholders. Uncertainty is anathema to investors, regardless of the sector. But local health care real estate experts still expect continuing investment activity and repositioning in the Twin Cities health care market.\n\n\u201cIn the capital community, in the last few years, there has been a huge appetite for health care investments\u201d like the recent Harrison State deals, said Stephen H. Brown, executive director of Cushman & Wakefield/ NorthMarq\u2019s Healthcare Real Estate Advisory Group. He expects that to continue, with a sizeable amount of capital in search of health care facility investments.\n\nNational data show the growth of investment in health care real estate of all types, including the rapidly expanding senior-care sector, according to Todd Perman, executive managing director for Global Healthcare Services at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.\n\nThe health care real estate category has grown steadily from less than $1 billion in transactions in 2002 to an estimated $5.7 billion in 2012, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a developing category.\u201d\n\nFor some time, the Twin Cities health care market has been on the leading edge of national trends, which makes the area attractive to investors, Brown noted.\n\nBrown said investors are especially keen to acquire ambulatory care facilities that are affiliated with and owned by health care systems \u2014 more so than medical office buildings owned by private practices. The latter don\u2019t always possess the high credit ratings and low cost of capital enjoyed by health systems, Brown said.\n\nOne real estate investment trust from outside the area with significant health care holdings in Minnesota is Minot, N.D.-based Investors Real Estate Trust, which has 30 health care properties here. Chuck Greenberg, the REIT\u2019s Minneapolis-based senior vice president of commercial assets, was reluctant to speculate on the effects of health care reform for investment stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early in the game, so it will take a while to know what the impact of reform is going to be,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cBut our health care portfolio has been one of our strongest performers, and we have no reason to think that won\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Twin Cities area health care systems are continuing to invest in new, ambulatory care facilities. The shift from inpatient to outpatient care has been going on for decades, but health care reform has accelerated it. \u201cA lot of larger systems are positioning themselves for anticipated health care reform by moving anything that can be placed into an ambulatory care setting,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cTwo reasons are: the high cost of hospital space and the value placed on it, and the desire to put health care closer to patients. Some groups have done better jobs at that than others, but clearly, that is one of the things that has driven a lot of activity in the last couple of years,\u201d he said.\n\nAs reform continues to reshape health care delivery, Brown expects to see more mergers between systems and consolidations within health care systems. As time goes on, some facilities will become obsolete or no longer needed, which should lead to more acquisitions by real estate investors, Brown said.\n\nWith the drive for more cost-effective care, one way health systems have been preparing is selling health care facilities that they continue to occupy as leasing tenants. It\u2019s often a more cost-effective real estate strategy than owning. Harrison Street\u2019s Burnsville acquisition, for example, was a sale-leaseback deal.\n\nCompared with other metro areas around the country, the Twin Cities health care market \u201cis ahead of the curve in monetizing those assets,\u201d said Michael Sharpe, a principal with the Minneapolis-based Davis Group, which has been one of the state\u2019s most active health care real estate developers. \u201cHealth care systems don\u2019t like to be landlords; it\u2019s not a natural relationship.\u201d\n\nRather than owning bricks and mortar, \u201cmost health systems would rather deploy their cash closer to the patients,\u201d investing in assets used in patient care, such as medical equipment and electronic medical record systems, Sharpe said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harrison Street Real Estate Capital has established a significant local presence in recent months, investing nearly $96 million in health care real estate in the Twin Cities.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Dan Emerson", "og": {"site_name": "Finance & Commerce", "description": "Harrison Street Real Estate Capital has established a significant local presence in recent months, investing nearly $96 million in health care real estate in the Twin Cities.", "title": "Pulse still strong for health care investment", "url": "http://finance-commerce.com/2013/12/pulse-still-strong-for-health-care-investment/", "image": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2013/12/WestHealth2_cmyk.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Pulse still strong for health care investmentFinance & Commerce", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "affordable care act,allina health,cushman & wakefield northmarq,davis group,harrison street real estate capital,health care,investors real estate trust,minnesota valley surgery center,newmark grubb knight frank,reit,westhealth", "google-site-verification": "fsxlPNyjZwLPAj0KJhrcPjWL_3CXdi71oKBTOnATRU8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But local health care real estate experts still expect continuing investment activity and repositioning in the Twin Cities health care market.\nOne real estate investment trust from outside the area with significant health care holdings in Minnesota is Minot, N.D.-based Investors Real Estate Trust, which has 30 health care properties here.\nAs reform continues to reshape health care delivery, Brown expects to see more mergers between systems and consolidations within health care systems.\nThe shift from inpatient to outpatient care has been going on for decades, but health care reform has accelerated it.\nWith the drive for more cost-effective care, one way health systems have been preparing is selling health care facilities that they continue to occupy as leasing tenants."}
