By 2039, the savings would amount to $250 billion a year today, or about 1.5 percent of the economy.\n\nMany factors contributed to the change, including lower anticipated economic growth and a downward projection for interest rates over time. But another factor was a finding that the federal government might be able to sustain a low growth rate of payments to providers in line with requirements set by the health care law.\n\n\u201cEvidence suggests that hospitals and other providers may be able to achieve significant productivity gains or to restrain the growth of their costs in some other way,\u201d the C.B.O. report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the improvement, federal health care spending is still projected to grow faster than any other budget category as baby boomers retire and begin drawing from Medicare. Health care is on track to become the government\u2019s biggest expense by around 2030.\n\nOver all, the budget office still sees federal budget deficits and the government\u2019s outstanding debt growing at rates it calls unsustainable. Deficits are projected to remain at their current level of about 3 percent of G.D.P., or about $500 billion \u2014 a level that economists consider maintainable in a growing economy \u2014 through 2018 before rising to 4 percent and higher after that.\n\nBy 2039, the federal debt is expected to reach more than 100 percent of G.D.P., under current law, from about 74 percent today.\n\nBudget office officials acknowledge that any long-term forecast of government spending is tricky because of changes in the economy or federal law that cannot be anticipated.\n\nFor example, health care spending growth was in line with G.D.P. during the 1990s economic boom, when there were budget surpluses. But forecasters at the time could not have predicted the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or the depth of the most recent recession, both of which changed the course of politics and the economy.\n\nThe budget office\u2019s latest forecasts were largely unchanged from last year. On Wednesday, the office\u2019s director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, is scheduled to testify about the report to the House Budget Committee, which is led by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan has pushed to privatize federal health care programs like Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140715113810, "twitter": {"description": "The office said in an annual forecast that federal spending on major programs would amount to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2039.", "title": "Budget Office Lowers Its Estimate on Federal Spending for Health Care", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/business/budget-office-revises-estimate-of-federal-spending-on-health-care.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003001242"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/business/CBO/CBO-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/business/budget-office-revises-estimate-of-federal-spending-on-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003001242", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/business/budget-office-revises-estimate-of-federal-spending-on-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2014-07-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2014-07-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "keywords": "Federal Budget (US),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Gross Domestic Product,Congressional Budget Office,Medicare,Medicine and Health,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "description": "The office said in an annual forecast that federal spending on major programs would amount to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2039.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David S.
