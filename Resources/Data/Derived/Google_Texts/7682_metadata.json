His hapless, hollowed-out performance in Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate seemed like a call for help and a not-so-subtle signal that he wants out. He telegraphed this earlier, of course, with his whiny complaint about all the \u201creally cool things\u201d he could be doing if didn\u2019t have to put up with the indignity of running for president of the United States.\n\nAnd he telegraphed his one punch \u2014 perhaps his last \u2014 in letting the world know that he planned to smack down his former mentee, Senator Marco Rubio, for missing 34 percent of his votes in the Senate this year. Rubio was ready with a counter-jab: \u201cSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\u201d\n\nBush never recovered. Later, his people complained about not getting more questions. No, no, no. Better to pass away with a mercy killing.\n\nYou could blame political malpractice \u2014 bad aides, bad advice, bad strategy. A hundred million dollars doesn\u2019t buy what it used to. But the fish stinks from the head down, as any Sicilian grandmother will tell you. Bush owns this debacle, the third in a row. The debate broke him. And the only question remaining is whether he\u2019s deliberately managing a slow exit consisting of cringe-worthy moments, or if there\u2019s something deep in his subconscious driving him to quit. In any event, I\u2019m sure he can hear his mother\u2019s admonition rattling through his ears: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough Bushes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToo bad. For the sanity wing of the Republican Party is now down to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Rubio will get some attention and a bump in the two weeks leading up to the next debate. The scrutiny will not be helpful. He\u2019s a man too eager to crush his mentors, and looks like a little boy lost. But more than that, he has a sketchy personal financial background to go with a really sketchy tax plan. (The nonprofit Tax Foundation concluded it would give nearly twice as much gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to middle-income people.)\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, the most hated man in Congress by his colleagues, went after a perhaps even more hated target, the media. Good show. Good fun. Felt great to tell those CNBC people how shallow and inconsequential they are. And then Cruz proved himself to be, yet again, more shallow and inconsequential than anyone on the panel. The betting money is that Cruz, a vulture whose demagogy is so pitch-perfect you could have taught it at the now-defunct Trump University, will swoop in to claim easily confused primary voters as the unelectable front-runners fade. But don\u2019t actually bet on it.\n\nWith Bush neutered, stunned and stricken, it fell to the likable Kasich to inject the rarest of modern Republican commodities into this show \u2014 common sense. But he also telegraphed his moves. (Didn\u2019t these folks ever watch a boxing movie?)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve about had it with these people,\u201d said Kasich, leading up to the debate. \u201cI\u2019m done being polite and listening to their nonsense.\u201d\n\nIn the debate, he listened to only a few minutes of nonsense before attacking. He warned that \u201cwe are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.\u201d Duh. It was aimed at Carson and Trump. Neither man was touched by the blow. What Kasich has yet to realize is that their selling point is being ill-qualified to do the job.\n\nStill, Carson and Trump proceeded to prove Kasich right. Carson avoided his usual ahistorical grab bag of Nazi and slavery analogies. Score one for his keepers. But he could not begin to explain how his bizarre, biblically based tax plan would do anything less than \u201cput us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt,\u201d as Kasich charged.\n\nAnd he said it was \u201cpropaganda\u201d that he endorsed a nutritional supplement peddled by a company, Mannatech, that paid $7 million to settle deceptive marketing claims that its products could be used to cure autism and cancer. Carson appeared in promotional videos and made paid speeches for the company. PolitiFact ruled his claim of noninvolvement \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nTrump got fact-checked in real time. It took only a few seconds after he denied calling Rubio a stooge of a program backed by the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg for people to find that very statement on Trump\u2019s website. Ah, well. As he\u2019s proved, veracity is for losers.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151029180802, "twitter": {"description": "His hapless debate performance seemed like a call for help.
