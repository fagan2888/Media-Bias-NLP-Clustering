The participants' average age was about 60.\n\nAmong patients using insulin, the average amount used each year went from 171 milliliters (mL) in 2002-2004 to 206 mL in 2011-2013.\n\nThe average price of insulin increased 197 percent, from $4.34 to $12.92 per mL, during that time.\n\nAnnual spending on insulin per patient increased from $231.48 to $736.09 over the study period. By 2013, the per-patient spending on insulin was greater than the per-patient combined spending on other diabetes drugs, which was $502.57.\n\nThe price of oral diabetes drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and linagliptin, increased 34 percent between 2006 and 2013. The cost per pill of metformin actually fell by 93 percent from 2002 to 2013.\n\nThe researchers say the price of insulin is unlikely to decline because of the regulations and cost involved with bringing comparable products to the market.\n\nDr. Robert Gabbay, who was not involved with the new research, said the rising cost of insulin affects the amount of money people with diabetes pay out of pocket and also impacts how they can manage their condition.\n\n\"I can tell you from seeing patients myself that there are many who can't afford their insulin and don't take it or take less of it and they're worse off for it,\" said Gabbay, who is chief medical officer of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.\n\n\"Here is the treatment that almost one-third of people with diabetes are on and its increased in price to this degree, that's quite concerning,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/MEDICAL RESEARCH,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/NUTRITION and
