On that date, tradition holds, Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is wrested from his burrow and, if he sees his shadow, the people will have six more weeks of winter. (Punxsutawney must be a sunny place, for the official beginning of spring \u2013 March 21 or thereabouts \u2013 is always the same six or seven weeks from February 2.)\n\nFor some of us, however, Groundhog Day came last weekend, which is when most of the U. S. set its clocks ahead one hour in annual observance of \u201cDaylight Savings Time.\u201d And, just as in the Bill Murray movie of the same name, we are forced to relive what we just went through.\n\nBegun in 1916 as an effort to conserve resources, Daylight Savings Time supposedly realigns the workers\u2019 clock more closely with the longer daylight hours of the sun, which rises and sets higher in the northern hemisphere sky the closer to the summer solstice we get. This, in theory, should make workers happier and more efficient by giving them longer work daylight work hours \u2013 but does it really?\n\nFor many of us, tired from a long and dreary winter \u2013 and this past one has seemed longer and drearier than most \u2013 Daylight Savings Time throws us back on our heels. After three or four months of cold, depressing dark, we had finally reached the point at which \u2013 miracle of miracles! \u2013 our wakeup time was finally again coinciding with the sunrise. On all but the cloudiest and snowiest days we would get just a hint of brightness, and on cold and clear ones a nice, bright, sunny sky was a welcome invitation to the new day.\n\nNow we are back in the darkness for another four to six weeks, just as Punxatawney Phil predicted.\n\nHappy Goundhog Day indeed!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/03/useless-myths-daylight-savings-time-and-groundhog-day/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/groundhog-day.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Useless Myths: Daylight Savings Time and Groundhog Day"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd934b\"", "article_summary": "This, in theory, should make workers happier and more efficient by giving them longer work daylight work hours \u2013 but does it really?\nBy long-standing tradition, Groundhog Day comes every February 2.\nFor many of us, tired from a long and dreary winter \u2013 and this past one has seemed longer and drearier than most \u2013 Daylight Savings Time throws us back on our heels.\nBegun in 1916 as an effort to conserve resources, Daylight Savings Time supposedly realigns the workers\u2019 clock more closely with the longer daylight hours of the sun, which rises and sets higher in the northern hemisphere sky the closer to the summer solstice we get.\nOn that date, tradition holds, Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is wrested from his burrow and, if he sees his shadow, the people will have six more weeks of winter."}
