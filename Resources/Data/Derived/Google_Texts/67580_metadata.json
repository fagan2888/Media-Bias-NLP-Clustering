The American people watched as Rubio \u201cglitched\u201d and repeated the same talking point on loop throughout the course of the presidential debate.\n\nRubio\u2019s now-infamous talking point was his charge that President Obama \u201cknows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of his glitch, Rubio indicated that he will continue to repeat this memorized talk point.\n\nMiller explained that \u201cit doesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d for Rubio to criticize Obama\u2019s alleged effort to fundamentally transform the nation, given Rubio\u2019s essential role in pushing President Obama\u2019s open borders agenda.
