Since 2010, four have closed. Another 10, says one expert, are seriously threatened.\n\nJust last week came word that the Williamsburg Regional Hospital in Kingstree suspended operations after fall floods made more than half of the hospital unusable. Plans call for modular buildings to be in place in just a few weeks, pending state approval, but insiders say the \u201ctemporary suspension\u201d might just be nice talk that is a prelude to outright closure, especially if the cost for the modular units is excessive.\n\nRural hospitals like the one in Kingstree have been threatened for years thanks to out-migration of residents to urban and suburban areas, low tax bases to pay for costs, a large number of poor and uninsured residents, and national changes in health care that prioritize outpatient care over hospital stays.\n\nSince 2010, some 67 rural hospitals, not including Williamsburg County\u2019s, have closed in the U.S. In South Carolina, that number includes hospitals in Marlboro and Bamberg counties, as well as Southern Palmetto Hospital in Barnwell. In January, it announced closure after losing $2.5 million last year.\n\nAccording to Becker\u2019s Hospital CFO, rural hospitals in states like South Carolina are twice as likely to close if the states did not expand Medicaid programs after passage of the Affordable Care Act. When that law passed, the state was offered $11 billion over seven years to expand Medicaid programs to pay for health care for those living in poverty who were not children and who were younger than 65 but without affordable access to care. That translated to more than 200,000 residents.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a lifeline\n\nThree years ago, the S.C. Hospital Association warned state lawmakers that failure to expand Medicaid under Obamacare could hurt rural hospitals, which were already under threat mainly because of dwindling revenues and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.\n\nBy adding the poor to the rolls of those covered by health insurance, rural hospitals would get a vital lifeline of operating revenue, a steadier stream of money that would help them survive, SCHA officials said.\n\nSCHA vice president Rozalynn Goodwin today says while South Carolina has missed the initial years of federal Medicaid expansion money worth billions of dollars, there\u2019s probably $9 billion still on the table. More importantly, legislators who passively listened a couple years ago to the warnings are now actively hearing them from constituents who are fed up that they can\u2019t qualify for Obamacare because they are too poor. [The way that the law is written, there\u2019s a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d that keeps people in poverty from getting Obamacare unless a state expands Medicaid to cover them. As a result, they\u2019re still uninsured.]\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re paying more attention now,\u201d Goodwin said of state lawmakers. In part, that\u2019s because states with similar values, such as Arkansas and Kentucky, were able to expand. Since they did, they\u2019re seeing big savings in state funds. For example, without Medicaid expansion, South Carolina pays 100 percent of costs of care of thousands of inmates. But with expansion, they\u2019re generally covered under Obamacare and the state only has to meet a small match. States that have expanded Medicaid to allow those in poverty to be covered also are seeing cost savings in care for pregnant woman and those who are disabled, she said.\n\nHealth economist Lynn Bailey of Columbia added, \u201cThe Medicaid expansion money gave them [rural hospitals in other states] an operating revenue lifeline because in rural areas, they could cover their operating costs. And when you denied expansion in those areas [in South Carolina], those folks lost any hope of ever being able to generate sufficient revenues to cover their operating costs.\u201d\n\nRural hospital closures hurt rural communities\n\nRural hospitals are economic drivers of smaller areas, Bailey said. To lose them is the economic equivalent of cutting off your nose in spite of your face.\n\n\u201cThe value as an economic entity of a hospital is every bit as important as landing the new super WalMart or the automobile parts plant that\u2019s going to feed Volvo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a health care facility and when you let the hospital close \u2014 when the horse leaves the barn, the barn is going to fall down.\u201d\n\nSouthernCarolina Regional Development Alliance President and CEO Danny Black says losing a hospital, as has happened in two of his counties, is a devastating blow to a community.\n\n\u201cIt raises fear for the elderly \u2014 that they can\u2019t get to care when needed. Same for emergencies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts my job [to generate economic development] by raising concerns of existing industry, but may turn away projects looking at a community.\u201d\n\nBamberg County Council member Trent Kinard said most people in his area headed out of the county for in-patient care before closure. But when his community\u2019s 59-bed hospital in 2012 shut down, there was a major impact.\n\n\u201cIt has affected our poorer population that has to travel further and now they have to sit in a hospital by themselves because family can\u2019t come to visit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took a huge hit to employment when the hospital closed.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nState lawmakers could still vote to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars, although they\u2019ve missed out on at least $2.7 billion so far. They\u2019d also need to sway Obamacare opponent Gov. Nikki Haley to accept the funding. If legislators were to eventually take the expansion funds to cover those in poverty, the match the state would be required to pay would be capped at 10 percent, compared to 30 percent for regular Medicaid funds.\n\nWhile Goodwin says lawmakers are listening more, Kinard is more emphatic: \u201cWe must get our members of the House and Senate here in South Carolina to see the need for emergency care here in rural South Carolina. I understand that many rural areas are unable to sustain a fully operational hospital but with the closing of Bamberg \u2014 and now Barnwell \u2014 some residents will be forced to wait 30 to 45 minutes for life-saving care.\u201d\n\nBailey points a finger of blame at Republican Haley, who has staked out a political position to oppose federal Medicaid expansion as a way to oppose Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley has, like just about every other Republican governor, abandoned rural hospitals \u2014 walked away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have done some policy things at the regulatory level to ease the burden on rural hospitals. But we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome GOP governors, Goodwin pointed out, have accepted Medicaid expansion dollars. Example: Rising GOP presidential candidate John Kasich, the governor of Ohio.\n\n\u201cHe thought it was a moral imperative,\u201d Goodwin said, adding that Ohio saw numerous state tax savings by accepting federal dollars for Obamacare.\n\nBailey, who said at least 10 other rural hospitals are threatened, emphasized state officials needed to recognize that saving rural hospitals through regulatory changes and things like accepting the Medicaid expansion dollars is an economic decision as much as a health one.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to do a tax deal to get and maintain a manufacturing plant, you ought to be willing to do that for a hospital.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While Goodwin says lawmakers are listening more, Kinard is more emphatic: \u201cWe must get our members of the House and Senate here in South Carolina to see the need for emergency care here in rural South Carolina.\nImpact to communities is devastatingBy Andy Brack, editor and publisher | Looking at South Carolina\u2019s rural hospitals generally isn\u2019t a pretty picture.\nIn South Carolina, that number includes hospitals in Marlboro and Bamberg counties, as well as Southern Palmetto Hospital in Barnwell.\nSince 2010, some 67 rural hospitals, not including Williamsburg County\u2019s, have closed in the U.S.\nFor example, without Medicaid expansion, South Carolina pays 100 percent of costs of care of thousands of inmates."}
