ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Tom Brady threw for 466 yards — the second-most of his career — and three touchdowns in leading the New England Patriots to a 40-32 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

Julian Edelman scored two touchdowns, and the Patriots needed to stave off a fourth-quarter rally after building a 37-13 lead through three quarters.

New England’s Stephen Gostkowski hit a 25-yard field goal with 1:15 left. The Bills’ final drive ended on the next play from scrimmage when Tyrod Taylor’s pass tipped off the hands of Sammy Watkins and was intercepted by Logan Ryan.

The Patriots (2-0) extended their run of dominance over their AFC East rivals by beating the Bills (1-1) for the 27th time in the past 30 meetings.

Brady improved to 24-3 against Buffalo, and his passing yards were the most ever by a Bills opponent.
