In the course of teeing up a softball for Trump about race relations and small businesses, the questioner told Trump that she and her husband had established their \u201cfood entrepreneur\u201d business based on principles they had learned from Trump\u2019s \u201cteachings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Trump has counter-programmed events featuring his rivals. Most notably, he skipped a debate hosted by Fox News in Iowa last month, and held a rally, ostensibly to benefits wounded veterans, at the same time. But it\u2019s the first time that a supposedly neutral news organization has actively participated in providing what amounts to free advertising for the Trump campaign at the same time that his rivals are appearing elsewhere.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the SCOTUS Battle Could Get So Much Worse\n\nIn the end, Trump was asked a grand total of eight questions from the audience, three of which were crammed into the final four minutes of the event. And his interrogators weren\u2019t exactly budding Torquemadas.\n\nOne, identifying herself as a college student concerned about tuition costs, said, \u201cI was just wondering, since there\u2019s so much going on in the rest of the campaign, umm, I was just wondering how you are going to\u2026like\u2026what are your thoughts on Bernie\u2019s higher education plan and how he\u2019s going to reduce the cost?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, it\u2019s a very good question,\u201d Trump said, before saying that \u201cthe problem\u201d with the plan put forward by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the second-place candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination, \u201cis that everyone is going to pay 95 percent taxes.\u201d\n\nOf course, nobody in US history has paid an effective tax rate of 95 percent, and Sanders \u2013 though his proposal are, arguably, ruinously expensive \u2013 has proposed no such thing. Yet there wasn\u2019t the slightest pushback, and Scarborough guided Trump onto the much safer ground of college tuition costs which (shocker!) Trump said he would reduce.\n\nThere are many unique things about Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, but the complete co-optation of a television program on a network that is in general, strongly opposed to your candidacy is, if nothing else, a triumph.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Three things tell you all you need to know about the \u201ctown hall\u201d event that cable netw", "title": "Trump Gets a Freebie from MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/18/Trump-Gets-Freebie-MSNBC-s-Morning-Joe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07202015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/18/Trump-Gets-Freebie-MSNBC-s-Morning-Joe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07202015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Three things tell you all you need to know about the \u201ctown hall\u201d event that cable netw", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Second, the Trump town hall was moderated by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, which has become Trump\u2019s platform of choice among morning news shows.\nFirst, MSNBC decided to counter program against CNN\u2019s Town Hall, which featured Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\nThree things tell you all you need to know about the \u201ctown hall\u201d event that cable network MSNBC hosted for Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump Wednesday night.\nBut it\u2019s the first time that a supposedly neutral news organization has actively participated in providing what amounts to free advertising for the Trump campaign at the same time that his rivals are appearing elsewhere.\nYet there wasn\u2019t the slightest pushback, and Scarborough guided Trump onto the much safer ground of college tuition costs which (shocker!)"}
