The rumor mill has State Rep. Lenar Whitney (R-Houma) considering a late entry into the crowded race for the 6th Congressional District, in which eight Republicans and a convicted felon Democrat are already doing battle. If that’s so, what you’ll see below isn’t a half-bad effort at preparing the battlefield for Whitney’s entry. It goes about four minutes, and it’s an explanation by the state legislator why the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare isn’t just a bad idea but something that will hurt the most vulnerable people it’s supposed to help.

If Whitney makes a habit of releasing videos like this, she could well make a dent in the 6th District race – or if nothing else prepare the ground for a future run at higher office.
