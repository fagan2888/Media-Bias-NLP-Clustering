Just 15 soft tosses off a practice mound Friday at the Rockies\u2019 spring training facility.\n\nBut for 30-year-old Adam Ottavino it was a giant leap of faith \u2014 tangible evidence that his baseball career could be salvaged by Tommy John surgery.\n\nThe road to that step involved months of grueling, tedious and boring rehabilitation. For someone as intelligent and introspective as Ottavino, it was not going to be an easy process. He decided, early on, that he would need something to fill the void.\n\nThe idea came to Ottavino while he was flying home to Denver from Florida. It was May 8 last year, the day after Dr. James Andrews reconstructed Ottavino\u2019s aching right elbow. Ottavino had always wanted to make a documentary film, but he never thought his first subject would be himself.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Man, I really wished I had clips of the night before and the day after, and of the surgery itself,\u2019 \u201d Ottavino said. \u201cSo then I was thinking I would take my GoPro (camera) with me through the first 16 weeks of this process and see what kind of vibe I would get from that.\u201d\n\nThe result was his video \u201c16 Weeks,\u201d which premiered on The Players Tribune website last October. There is no narration and no dialogue, just single-camera shots of Ottavino\u2019s lonely rehabilitation.\n\nThere is music, of course, and that was key. Ottavino chose Miles Davis\u2019 rendition of Thelonious Monk\u2019s jazz classic \u201cRound Midnight.\u201d It\u2019s a song that Herbie Hancock once described as \u201ca map of those desolate hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a jazz-blues song,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cAt the beginning of the video, you can see how sad and lonely it is, and the music fits.\n\n\u201cThen it kind of picks up the tempo and it kind of picks up the pace, and it matches me when I get further along in my rehab. You can sense hope coming out of it.\u201d\n\nThere was more desperation than hope when Ottavino first injured his elbow. The pain actually began in the 2014 season as his fastball started reaching 98 mph.\n\n\u201cMy elbow was really aching at night, for like the second half of the season, but it didn\u2019t hurt when I threw,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cI started throwing harder and harder and harder, and I started to worry a little bit that maybe I was throwing too hard and something might happen. But I just kind of put it out of my mind.\u201d\n\nThe very early part of his 2015 season seemed joyous.\n\nThe Rockies were winning and Ottavino, who had earned the closer job, was emerging as one of the best relievers in baseball. In 10 appearances he had three saves and hadn\u2019t allowed a run, and opponents were hitting only .094 against him (3-for-32).\n\nBut dark shadows were creeping in on Ottavino\u2019s supposed dream season. April 24 against San Francisco at Coors Field, he closed out Colorado\u2019s 6-4 victory and posted his third save. But the pain that was lingering in his triceps was now in his elbow, all the time.\n\nThe next night, he once again held the Giant scoreless for an inning. But it was the last time he would pitch in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe last game I pitched, I didn\u2019t really know how I was going to do it. My elbow was really bad,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow hadn\u2019t torn, as often is the case with pitchers. Instead, it had been stretched and frayed. Nonetheless, Ottavino had to have season-ending Tommy John surgery.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cI was thinking I finally got to where I wanted to be, not only with the team, but I was pitching like I wanted to. All the lessons I had learned, I was putting them into action. It was a tough blow.\u201d\n\nBut there were blessings to come.\n\nOttavino\u2019s wife, Brette, was struggling through a difficult pregnancy. Time away from Coors Field allowed Ottavino to care for her, and for Brette to care for him. In the fall, Brette gave birth to their daughter, Bradley.\n\n\u201cIt was a weird summer,\u201d Ottavino. \u201cBrette and I helped each other. A lot of pitchers have to have Tommy John, so maybe mine happened at the best time.\u201d\n\nIn December, the Rockies and Ottavino came to an agreement on a three-year contract worth $10.4 million.\n\n\u201cIt was cool, but more than anything I was surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Rockies made me feel good. They told me they valued my work ethic and my promise.\n\n\u201cI plan to live up to that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Adam Ottavino made most of his journey back from Tommy John", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Adam Ottavino made most of his journey back from Tommy John", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/rockies-adam-ottavino-made-most-of-his-journey-back-from-tommy-john/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ottavinop1.jpg", "height": 504}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ottavinop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T19:54:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:38:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But for 30-year-old Adam Ottavino it was a giant leap of faith \u2014 tangible evidence that his baseball career could be salvaged by Tommy John surgery.\nOttavino had always wanted to make a documentary film, but he never thought his first subject would be himself.\nA lot of pitchers have to have Tommy John, so maybe mine happened at the best time.\u201dIn December, the Rockies and Ottavino came to an agreement on a three-year contract worth $10.4 million.\nThe Rockies were winning and Ottavino, who had earned the closer job, was emerging as one of the best relievers in baseball.\nYou can sense hope coming out of it.\u201dThere was more desperation than hope when Ottavino first injured his elbow."}
