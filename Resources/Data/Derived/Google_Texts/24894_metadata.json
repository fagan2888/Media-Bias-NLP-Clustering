Mike Pence says the new Healthy Indiana Plan is affordable for citizens, fiscally sound for the state and a better, consumer-driven alternative than expanding traditional Medicaid. (Photo: Danese Kenon/The Star )Buy Photo\n\nIn the past several years I have listened to much debate about wages in Indiana, including the ones about the minimum wage and the refusal to raise it. I have also heard Republicans say that if you want to make a decent wage, you need to go to school and get a skill that affords you a better paying job.\n\nSo I took their advice and returned to college to learn a skill that will get me better than minimum wages. But I am barely able to keep a roof over my head and cannot afford health insurance, so I applied for Medicaid. Now I am being told that I do not qualify because I am not working at least 20 hours a week. If I were to work 20 hours a week and then go to school full time, which is an hour drive each way from my house, I would be doing about 70 to 80 hours a week.\n\nIndiana rejected the Affordable Care Act in favor of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which is the biggest joke yet. The cheapest plan under HIP that I can get would make me choose between living expenses or health care. Sorry, but I am not going to live on the street to have health care. Medicaid is supposed to be for those who do not have the means to purchase health care and those on disability. Because I choose to go to school and better myself I get placed on a different standard than some lazy person on welfare. I think that it is time to vote all of the current politicians representing Indiana and replace them with new ones.\n\nMichael Miller\n\nHamilton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1iRX1jc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Indiana rejected the Affordable Care Act in favor of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which is the biggest joke yet.
