(Photo: Photodisc, Getty Images)\n\nJUPITER, Fla. \u2013 She didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of her days seeing doctors, the 91-year-old woman confessed to Dr. Kevin Newfield as he treated a deep wound on her arm.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, but you have to tell me what you do want,\u201d Newfield replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying. I\u2019m afraid of being 106,\u201d she told the surgeon and her daughter, who was in the room with them.\n\nThe woman\u2019s spontaneous admission in Newfield\u2019s south Florida office that January day triggered a 20-minute discussion about living wills, hospice and other end-of-life issues, Newfield said.\n\nAn orthopedic surgeon who sometimes performs amputations, Newfield is comfortable having those conversations.\n\nMany doctors are not, but a Medicare policy (Keywords: Advance care planning) that took effect in January could help change that.\n\nPhysicians can now bill Medicare $86 for an office-based, end-of-life counseling session with a patient for as long as 30 minutes. Medicare has set no rules on what doctors must discuss during those sessions. Patients can seek guidance on completing advance directives stating if or when they want life support measures such as ventilators and feeding tubes, and how to appoint a family member or friend to make medical decisions on their behalf if they cannot, for instance.\n\nDr. Gail Austin Cooney, MD, of Hospice of Palm Beach County makes round and visits Hospice patient Beverly Vivona.

Reich, for USA TODAY)\n\nThe new policy reflects Americans\u2019 growing interest in planning the last stage of their lives when they may be unable to make their wishes known.\n\nIn 2014, the Institute of Medicine, an influential panel of experts, found that the nation\u2019s health system was not adequately dealing with end-of-life care, and among its recommendations was that insurers pay providers for advanced-care planning discussions.\n\nLast September, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 89 percent of the public said that doctors should discuss end-of-life care issues with their patients, though just 17 percent of Americans--and 34 percent of people 75 and older--said that they have had such conversations. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nUnder the new Medicare policy, doctors can give end-of-life advice during a senior\u2019s annual wellness visit or in a routine office visit. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants can also get paid for having the talks.\n\n\u201cFor doctors already providing this counseling the payment is an added benefit and for doctors on the fence about talking about the issue with patients, this may be enough to inspire them to try it,\u201d said Paul Malley, president of Aging with Dignity, a national advocacy group based in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nNewfield, the Florida surgeon, is less optimistic. He said he doesn\u2019t think the money will cause him to initiate more end-of-life discussions--and that doctors who weren\u2019t doing them before now are unlikely to start. After all, said Newfield, doctors make money by keeping people alive.\n\nThe payment idea was first floated in 2009, as part of the congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act. Back then, a proposal to have Medicare pay for such discussions sparked political controversy and fueled concern that they would lead to so-called \u201cdeath panels\u201d that could influence decisions to avoid medical care. The proposal was quickly dropped.\n\nMedicare\u2019s policy now has broad support from health providers and patient groups, but neither physicians nor the American Medical Association foresee a surge in end-of-life planning among Medicare\u2019s more than 50 million enrollees. The AMA, which supports the reimbursement, estimates Medicare will pay for fewer than 50,000 counseling sessions in 2016.\n\nThe numbers may well be held back by the small reimbursement rate for half an hour of counseling, but another obstacle rests with doctors themselves. Many are not trained to offer such advice or they are uncomfortable talking about it with patients.\n\n\u201cJust The First Step,\u201d the journal Health Affairs headlined an article about Medicare\u2019s new policy in its March issue.\n\n\u201cThe perception that lack of training could be a major stumbling block to the greater implementation of advance care planning is widely shared,\u201d wrote David Tuller, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cA lot depends on how you deliver the message and how you go about it,\u201d said Dr. Jay Poonkasem, who specializes in palliative care in Clearwater, Fla.\n\n\u201cWe will see more of this counseling, but only if doctors feel more comfortable and are trained in the right way to handle talks about end-of-life and advance care planning.\u201d\n\nMedical schools such as the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco have recently begun expanding training on the subject.\n\nAt UCSF, all medical students are taught how to conduct advance care planning discussions and educational programs also exist for residents, nurses and other physicians at the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis kind of training is crucial--one of the things that gets in the way of understanding and using patient preferences is that clinicians are often uncomfortable having these challenging conversations,\u201d said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and interim chair of UCSF\u2019s Department of Medicine. \u201cThe issue of end-of-life conversations is so compelling and fraught--teaching it also allows us to teach about more general communication skills.\u201d\n\nSome doctors admit they could do better.\n\nDr. Scott Dunn, a family physician in Sandpoint, Idaho, said he regrets not having done more recently to help a 76-year-old patient avoid spending his final weeks in intensive care, connected to machines breathing for him and feeding him. That meant the patient may have needlessly suffered and cost the health system tens of thousands of extra dollars, he said.\n\n\u201cI wish I had taken the time months earlier to have that end-of-life discussion, but I did not,\u201d he said.\n\nDunn said the incentive payment will entice him to have more such discussions with patients, but they won\u2019t become routine in his practice. \u201cMedicare pays us more to do other stuff.\u201d\n\nMichael Guarino came to a different view after watching his elderly father die last year, weeks after he became unable to move or talk. Guarino decided then that the 800-physician organization of which he is executive director--the Independent Physician Association of Nassau/Suffolk Counties in New York--would include end-of-life discussions for all adult patients.\n\nTo guide those discussions, the association\u2019s physicians and nurses use a 12-page booklet called Five Wishes, which outlines how patients can designate someone to make decisions on their behalf if they become unable as well as choose what treatment they want, if any, at the end of their life.\n\nDr. John Meigs, Jr., a family doctor in Centreville, Ala. and president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said he sees value in doctors helping patients prepare for death.\n\nLast July, a stroke left a 95-year-old nursing home patient of his with difficulty speaking and swallowing. The woman\u2019s daughter questioned Meigs\u2019 decision not to give the patient a feeding tube. Meigs reassured the daughter that her mother had made clear she didn\u2019t want that in many talks with him and in her advance directives.\n\nNo heroic measures were made and the woman died a few days later.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pfTm9v", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Physicians can now bill Medicare $86 for up to 30 minutes of counseling given to patients about end-of-life planning, but many doctors may need training to have those talks.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Physicians can now bill Medicare $86 for up to 30 minutes of counseling given to patients about end-of-life planning, but many doctors may need training to have those talks.", "title": "Doctors Ponder Delicate Talks As Medicare Pays for End-Of-Life Counsel", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/12/kaiser-doctors-ponder-delicate-talks-medicare-pays-end--life-counsel/81691540/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Physicians can now bill Medicare $86 for up to 30 minutes of counseling given to patients about end-of-life planning, but many doctors may need training to have those talks.", "title": "Doctors Ponder Delicate Talks As Medicare Pays for End-Of-Life Counsel", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ebd111886f54122f920b461f038da71c32ff5bf/c=0-219-2605-2824&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/American Academy of Family Physicians", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/American Academy of Family Physicians", "title": "Doctors Ponder Delicate Talks As Medicare Pays for End-Of-Life Counsel", "author": "Phil Galewitz", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3acb218de4cb2b44cc4bb6e87ace23e1ac86ff7/c=0-0-2605-3473/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d2a1eadc99b6bc9acd0d5a1cd90f4a4f1859032/c=0-219-2605-2824/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/188bbfc2fb2164e27568cfce95642d845535b0b4/c=0-484-2605-2443/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a06f843d5201de0aafabfdc6841d3397b6d3fcb3/c=0-999-2605-2471&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-03-12T18:30:23.560000-05:00", "shorthed": "Doctors Ponder Delicate Talks As Medicare Pays for End-Of-Life Counsel", "articleid": 81691540, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cfaa14a012a5b8d30d96a7b261b5f9c705c6e35b/c=0-999-2605-2471/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7875151d1d965f4b4ee8a2ed392b664c0e5c3f8b/c=0-0-2184-3900/local/-/media/2016/03/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635934026920318873-Senior-EndofLife002.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "Under the new Medicare policy, doctors can give end-of-life advice during a senior\u2019s annual wellness visit or in a routine office visit.\nMany doctors are not, but a Medicare policy (Keywords: Advance care planning) that took effect in January could help change that.\nAt UCSF, all medical students are taught how to conduct advance care planning discussions and educational programs also exist for residents, nurses and other physicians at the hospital.\nPhysicians can now bill Medicare $86 for an office-based, end-of-life counseling session with a patient for as long as 30 minutes.\nMedicare has set no rules on what doctors must discuss during those sessions."}
