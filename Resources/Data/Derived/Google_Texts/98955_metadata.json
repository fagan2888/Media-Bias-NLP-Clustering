Chris Christie\u2019s \u201csituation\u201d than on the IRS-targeting-conservatives scandal over a 15-day span. One is left to wonder why there were no similar stories concerning Benghazi and the apparent invisibility of the U.S. president. This is the same president who has been Teflon-coated by a mainstream media focusing on the Christie controversy to take Obama off the front page and aid and abet his escape from the heated critique he is receiving from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.\n\nLike flies to honey, the liberal media is rushing to destroy Christie, whose \u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this was happening\u201d defense is identical to the standard excuses of media-darling Obama when he comments on his own administration\u2019s scandals. Most likely, Obama is taking notes so he can use some of Christie\u2019s defenses, which sound truer than Obama\u2019s hollow excuses.\n\nAnd now the White House is thumping the table, clamoring for Christie to fire more people on his staff. There\u2019s no mention, of course, of Obama\u2019s failure to fire anyone for the catastrophic bunglings and disgraces of his own regime. Think NSA, IRS scandal, Kathleen Sebelious, the Obamacare rollout, Fast & Furious, Afghanistan, Obama\u2019s struggling economy, Benghazi and the budget sequestration of 2013. The only people Obama likes to fire are experienced military officers who disagree with him. Add the other 19 Democrat scandals that were under-reported.\n\nWhatever happens with the lane closure on the New Jersey bridge, it cannot be compared to the wholesale callousness of the Internal Revenue Service toward conservatives who were merely trying to make their voices heard in elections. And lane closures are also a distant second fiddle to Obama putting American armed forces in harm\u2019s way to achieve his political ambitions in Afghanistan and Iraq. That\u2019s one of the points Gates made in his new book, and it\u2019s why the liberal media is focusing on Christie so they can whisk Gates\u2019 portrayals to the back pages.\n\nBecause Christie is a Republican and likely opponent of Hillary Clinton in the next presidential election, the mainstream media will develop multiple ways to roast him. If Christie was a Democrat, Obama and the liberal media would be heaping praise on him, rejoicing in how tough he is against political opponents, how forthright he is and how quickly he took action.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to disagree with Rush Limbaugh\u2019s conclusion on the Christie controversy that Obama has promoted a culture that shows an \u201cutter disregard\u201d for truth. Our government has cultivated a Beltway Political Class that targets people who make this country work. It ignores laws it doesn\u2019t like, fines businesses billions of dollars to fund its political agenda, creates new laws by executive order that bypass Congress and the U.S. Constitution, and feeds a ravenous beast of a government to grow tentacles that are far too powerful and widespread.\n\nBut what may be worse is a press corps that likes to preach about how \u201cbalanced\u201d its reporters are and how \u201cobjective and factual\u201d its editorialists are. Too many in the mainstream media aid and abet the elitists of the liberal political class. Such elitists freely lie to the American public, and they forget that their job is to serve the people, not be their nanny-state masters. We deserve better from our federal officials and most of the media that covers them.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The American public was subjected to more stories in one day about New Jersey Gov.
