Shaquille O’Neal doesn’t endorse many politicians — but he’s stumping for the re-election of a good buddy, Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.).

The former NBA player stars in a simple new campaign ad, released Sunday, that outlines some of the ways in which Christie has benefited the state of New Jersey — which just happens to be Shaq’s home state as well.

“I don’t endorse many politicians,” the retired NBA star says in the 30-second spot. “But Chris Christie is different. He’s working with me to bring jobs back to our cities and on a new program to help kids in tough neighborhoods get ahead.”

Earlier this month, Shaq and Christie took part in the dedication ceremony for the new Boys and Girls Club of Camden County, during which the basketball pro affirmed the Governor’s ‘coolness.’ The two men also met back in March to talk over a state gun buyback program.

“He’s a good man,” Shaq says of Christie in the end of the ad. “Excuse me, he’s a great man. Please join me in supporting Chris Christie — the Governor.”

The general election will be held on Nov. 5. Christie is facing off against Democrat Barbara Buono and six other candidates.
