Haley Veterans\u2019 Hospital is a $56 million project four years in the making.\n\nIt was planned after a scandal involving conditions at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and designed to replace Haley\u2019s interim polytrauma center, the busiest of the five in the nation. VA officials say it will capitalize on rapid technological advancements, centralize treatment for troops and veterans who have suffered multiple injuries and accommodate what officials expect will be increasing numbers of patients as people leave the service with lifelong damage.\n\nBuilt to allow the space to be filled with natural light, its 56 rooms have lift devices, areas for visitors and are laid out in \u201cneighborhoods\u201d with names such as \u201cValor\u201d and \u201cCourage.\u201d The walls are painted in muted tones \u2014 antique brick red and saffron and sage. The halls are wider than the current center, with a space in front of each room for patients to spend time in a more communal setting when up to it.\n\nAn area called Main Street has six towering freeze-dried palm trees, a coffee shop, rooms for occupational and physical therapy and a two-story therapeutic climbing wall. Just off Main Street is a virtual reality system helping patients adapt to a variety of environments.\n\nIn another building is an aquatic center with a 40,000-gallon therapy pool and a much smaller pool with a treadmill floor that goes up and down and variable-speed water flow. Outside in the courtyard, there is a basketball net on a half court, a putting green and varied surfaces to help those using wheelchairs, walkers or canes learn to navigate surfaces such as grass and dirt and brick and gravel.\n\nAt 1 p.m. today, officials will show off the new center at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. It is expected to begin handling patients in about a month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty excited.\u201d said Stephen Scott, the hospital chief of physical medicine and the rehabilitation and polytrauma program. \u201cThis is a gift from America to those who serve our country. It gives them an environment of hope, compassion and healing that they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe war in Afghanistan is winding down, and U.S. forces are not engaging at the same pace in activities that saw more than 6,700 U.S. troops killed and 51,000 wounded over 13 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nBut the tidal wave of those who have suffered injuries seen and unseen has yet to crest. Last fiscal year saw a record number of active-duty patients admitted to Haley \u2014 281 \u2014 with the trend through the first quarter of this fiscal year set to eclipse that, according to figures provided by the hospital.\n\nThe number of patients admitted to the polytrauma center, active duty and veteran, peaked in the 2012 fiscal year at 132, tapering off to 118 the following year.\n\nScott said he expects those numbers to go up as more men and women leave the service.\n\nOverall since April 2007, more than 500,000 Afghanistan and Iraq veterans entering the VA health care system have been screened for traumatic brain injury, including more than 53,000 at Haley, according to the hospital. And up to half a million of the 2.5 million who have served since 9/11 may have post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the VA.\n\nAside from being newer and more comfortable, the center will consolidate a wide array of services that now are spread out over a sprawling Haley campus, including the nation\u2019s only in-patient pain clinic.\n\n\u201cThis allows us to use advanced technology in rehabilitation,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt puts teams and patients together with the therapies in the same environment.\u201d\n\nTo help those with traumatic brain injury, PTSD, emotional stress, sleep disorders, physical pain and other problems as a result of the strains of combat, the center will move its Post-Deployment Rehabilitation and Evaluation Program into the new center, Scott said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are finding is that most of the individuals are coming back not with just one problem,\u201d said Scott, \u201cbut multiple issues.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why the scheduled end of combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of the year won\u2019t alleviate the pressure on the center, Scott said.\n\nFirst of all, there are tens of thousands of troops deployed around the world conducting dangerous training. There are commandos active around the globe. And even at bases back home, the military life is hard on the body and mind.\n\nThe injuries are not all combat-related, Scott said.\n\n\u201cYou see this pipeline of injuries from 13 years of war; statistically only 50 percent of those evacuated at the highest intensity were from combat. When the war goes down, as we have actually seen many times over the years, the noncombat injuries are still there.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe center was supposed to open early last year, but construction was delayed. Once excavation began, crews had to pump tons of cement into the ground to stabilize the soil, said hospital spokeswoman Karen Collins. There were additional delays because connecting the new center\u2019s heating and cooling system with the one now serving Haley turned out to be more complex than anticipated, Collins said.\n\nThe final price represented a $4 million increase over the original $52 million tab, Collins said.\n\n\u201cBudgets change as technology improves and construction and building materials fluctuate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe concept for a new center picked up momentum when investigators began to find problems at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., Scott said.\n\nThe scandal kicked off by a Washington Post series \u201craised awareness about the fact that we were treating these war heroes in interim facilities not designed for the care they needed to receive,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat allowed the VA to move forward building more state-of-the-art, more purposeful facilities.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes online, the new center will have 165 employees, with the same federally mandated nursing staff-patient ratio of 3- or 4-to-1, she said. That figure includes 76 new full-time equivalent positions, including nursing staff being moved over from the medical-surgical team, nutritionists, therapists and cleaning staff.\n\nThe new center, which will require congressional approval to be named, is part of a four-phase hospital improvement program that included a new 1,500-car garage and a new bed tower that is awaiting congressional budget approval, Collins said.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful to have this facility,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis is a moment in time that is just one of those good moments.\u201d\n\nhaltman@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7629\n\nTwitter: @haltman", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 12 Apr 2014 09:16:54 -0400", "Description": "Spread out over more than 170,000 square feet on two floors, the new Polytrauma and Rehabilitation Center at the James A.
