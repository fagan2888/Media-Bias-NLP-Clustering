One would hope, and I dare say expect, that members of Congress conduct themselves in a manner of utmost professionalism, especially when on the Senate floor. After all, they were elected by a great number of their constituents to represent them in the capital of the world’s most powerful nation. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.

In denouncing Republicans for their lack of a plan regarding climate change, Democrats took to the Senate floor with a sign that had Internet emoticons on them.

This reporting is from The Hill, not The Onion (emphasis mine):

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke from the Senate floor with a sign that read "#WhatsTheGOPsClimatePlan ¯\_(?)_/¯” Sen. Ed Markey also spoke from the Senate floor with a sign that included a sad-faced shruggie. The Massachusetts Democrat suggested that Republicans didn't have a plan to combat climate change, adding that "shruggie says 'I'm not happy. I'm sad.' " It's not the first time Democrats have used the internet emoticon to help them sum up their critiques of Republican policies. Earlier this year, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) used the symbol during a speech suggesting that Republicans didn't have a plan if the Supreme Court struck down subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

Democrats can disagree, debate, and slam Republicans all they want—on anything. But can we please move past the childish antics and debate serious issues like grownups? Or is that asking too much?
