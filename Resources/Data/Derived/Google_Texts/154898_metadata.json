As usual, Big Pharma, the military-industrial complex, the NRA and pro-Israel groups were among the big spenders that peddled their influence via nearly 12,000 professional lobbyists. Analysts point to a variety of reasons why lobbying has declined slightly in recent years. The most common argument is that Congress is less productive, leading companies and organizations to spend fewer resources on trying to affect legislative outcomes. Another argument is that the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which tightened public disclosure requirements, has driven some lobbying activity into loopholes where they skirt the official tally. \u201cThere were some really momentous things going on [in 2009 and 2010], including the health care bill, the stimulus and Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Russ Choma, an expert on political spending at the Center for Responsive Politics. \u201c[Legislative activity] peaked then, and that\u2019s the reason so many people were spending so much money. We\u2019ve seen nothing of that size since.\u201d He said a flurry of end-of-year legislative activity involving last-minute Wall Street\u2013friendly add-ons to the CRomnibus spending bill didn't contribute significantly to the year\u2019s totals. For the third year in a row, the single biggest spenders were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Retailers and Blue Cross/Blue Shield. As a result of intensive lobbying by business groups, Barack Obama\u2019s administration postponed for a second time the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that medium-size employers pick up the tab for their workers\u2019 coverage. The Chamber, along with Koch Industries, was also effective in blocking the SEC rule to require public companies to report political spending. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a very top echelon of groups that don\u2019t ever really change, said Choma. \u201cBut that does tend to ebb and flow, depending what\u2019s on Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nTop 10: Lobbying by corporations and associations in 2014 Organization Total U.S. Chamber of Commerce $124,080,000 National Assn. of Realtors $55,057,053 Blue Cross/Blue Shield $21,298,774 American Hospital Assn. $20,753,146 American Medical Assn. $19,650,000 National Assn. of Broadcasters $18,440,000 Google $17,520,000 National Cable and Telecommunications Assn. $17,460,000 Comcast $16,970,000 Boeing $16,800,000 Source: OpenSecrets.org\n\nTop 10: Lobbying by industries in 2014 Industry Total Pharmaceuticals/health products $227,808,563 Business associations $162,730,246 Insurance $148,868,686 Oil and gas $140,389,740 Computers/Internet $138,734,928 Electric utilities $120,929,122 TV/movies/music $114,191,296 Misc. manufacturing and distributing $97,690,350 Securities and investment $97,277,311 Real estate $94,780,579 Source: OpenSecrets.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lobbyists laid out more than $3 billion last year, with heavy spending by oil, insurance and tech", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/28/lobbying-tapered-off-in-2014-amid-congressional-gridlock.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/28/lobbying-tapered-off-in-2014-amid-congressional-gridlock/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.lobbyingCongress.1422461372108.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Lobbyists laid out more than $3 billion last year, with heavy spending by oil, insurance and tech", "title": "Lobbying tapered off in 2014 amid congressional gridlock"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/28/lobbying-tapered-off-in-2014-amid-congressional-gridlock/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.lobbyingCongress.1422461372108.jpg", "title": "Lobbying tapered off in 2014 amid congressional gridlock", "description": "K Street outlays topped $3 billion last year, with heavy spending by oil, insurance and tech industries", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Republican Party, Politics, Lobbying, Democratic Party, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc3f\"", "article_summary": "$19,650,000 National Assn.\n\u201c[Legislative activity] peaked then, and that\u2019s the reason so many people were spending so much money.\nAnother argument is that the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which tightened public disclosure requirements, has driven some lobbying activity into loopholes where they skirt the official tally.\n\u201cBut that does tend to ebb and flow, depending what\u2019s on Capitol Hill.\u201dTop 10: Lobbying by corporations and associations in 2014 Organization Total U.S. Chamber of Commerce $124,080,000 National Assn.\nAnalysts point to a variety of reasons why lobbying has declined slightly in recent years."}
