The 5.3% figure is, not coincidentally, the same figure that AFGE said federal employees are owed.\n\nSchatz\u2019s bill (S. 2699) is co-sponsored by Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).\n\nIf this process sounds familiar, it is because you have seen it before. Last year, Schatz and Connolly teamed up to introduce legislation to give federal employees a 3.8% pay raise rather than the 1.3% the White House had proposed. And the year before that, Connolly\u2019s bill was for a 3.3% raise. Ultimately, however, these bills did not pass and federal employees got raises as recommended by the president: 1% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016.\n\nWill it be different this year? The answer to that question will not come until later this year, but given the way the process has played out in the past, it\u2019s unlikely this bill will pass.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "FedSmith.com is a digital news service for current and former federal employees.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "article_summary": "Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA) introduced legislation last month in the House to give federal employees a 5.3% pay raise in 2017.\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the Senate this week by Brian Schatz (D-HI) to give federal workers a 5.3% pay raise rather than the 1.6% raise proposed by the White House.\nLast year, Schatz and Connolly teamed up to introduce legislation to give federal employees a 3.8% pay raise rather than the 1.3% the White House had proposed.\nThe 5.3% figure is, not coincidentally, the same figure that AFGE said federal employees are owed.\nUltimately, however, these bills did not pass and federal employees got raises as recommended by the president: 1% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016."}
