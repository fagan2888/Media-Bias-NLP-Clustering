He allegedly obtained her cell phone number from her patient file.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I remember is waking up Monday morning and reading through a series of text messages and call logs,\u201d Darcy White told local ABC News affiliate KERO 23. The nurse had reportedly called and texted White at least 10 times. Several of the texts included a reference to her appearance, by calling her \u201cpretty,\u201d and referring to her clothing size. The nurse had sent her a picture of himself as well.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nKERO\u2019s Bakersfield affiliate was able to reach the nurse, who said he was unable to provide an interview because he was out of town, but he admitted that he had retrieved White\u2019s personal phone number from her hospital file. He also admitted he may have taken it too far when he contacted her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a violation. It clearly is,\u201d White said. The anesthesiologist nurse is employed through a contractor and does not work for Mercy Hospital. The hospital issued the following response to KERO:\n\nPatient privacy and safety are top priorities for Dignity Health Mercy Hospitals. We are aware of the allegations and there is currently an ongoing investigation. Because the nurse is not an employee of Mercy Hospitals, we are prohibited from making any further comments in this personnel matter.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz", "article_metadata": {"description": "Male Nurse Texts, Calls Female Patient After She Goes Home", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Male Nurse Texts, Calls Female Patient After She Goes Home", "title": "Male Nurse Texts, Calls Female Patient After She Goes Home - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/apple-apps-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/02/26/male-nurse-texts-calls-female-patient-after-she-goes-home/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Male Nurse Texts, Calls Female Patient After She Goes Home", "title": "Male Nurse Texts, Calls Female Patient After She Goes Home - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/apple-apps-AP.jpg", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "anesthesia, harassment, Mercy Hospital, patient violation, reconstructive surgery,Breitbart California, Medicine, Weird News,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "reconstructive surgery", "published_time": "2015-02-26T09:53:35-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Weird News,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5994\"", "article_summary": "Because the nurse is not an employee of Mercy Hospitals, we are prohibited from making any further comments in this personnel matter.\nHe allegedly obtained her cell phone number from her patient file.\nThe nurse had reportedly called and texted White at least 10 times.\nThe anesthesiologist nurse is employed through a contractor and does not work for Mercy Hospital.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA male nurse in Bakersfield, California is believed to have crossed the line with regard to patient confidentiality when he allegedly texted and called a female patient after she underwent reconstructive surgery."}
