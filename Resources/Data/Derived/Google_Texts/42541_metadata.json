(Reuters)\n\nDENMARK, S.C. \u2014 Speaking to a predominantly African American audience in a rural town here, Hillary Clinton sharply criticized rival Sen. Bernie Sanders for disloyalty to President Obama.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the big differences in my campaign with Senator Sanders,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said. \u201cAs I pointed out last night, he called the president \u2018weak,\u2019 a \u2018disappointment.\u2019 He tried to get some attention to attract a candidate to actually run against the president when he was running for reelection.\u201d\n\nSanders, she said, \u201cdoes not support, the way that I do, building on the progress that the president has made, and that includes building on the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n[Winners and losers from the 6th Democratic presidential debate]\n\nThe lines reprise some of the most fiery portions of her debate with Sanders in Milwaukee on Thursday night. And it marks one of the first times that Clinton has directly attacked Sanders outside of the debate stage for what she characterizes as past attempts to undermine Obama.\n\nWith South Carolina\u2019s primary just weeks away, Clinton has sought to expose a rift between Obama and Sanders as part of her outreach to African American voters, who make up more than half of the state's Democratic electorate.\n\nClinton noted that Sanders sought to start over with a new health care plan despite the \"advances\" in access to health care that the Affordable Care Act has secured for African Americans. \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach, my friends,\" Clinton said.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to voters in Denmark, S.C., on Friday. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nIn the previous night\u2019s debate, Clinton deployed a new tagline characterizing Sanders's agenda as too narrow. She repeated it in South Carolina on Friday: \u201cI am not a single-issue candidate, and this is not a single-issue country.\"\n\n\"I want you to understand: I will not promise you something that I cannot deliver,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI will not do that. I will not make promises I know I cannot keep. We don\u2019t need any more of that!\u201d\n\nClinton laid out a new proposal called the \u201cBreaking Every Barrier Agenda,\u201d which she said would pledge $125 billion to economic development for underserved communities, including communities of color. She said the program would be paid for by imposing a tax on the \u201clargest and riskiest financial institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose that contributed to the Great Recession are going to contribute to bringing back the communities that were the hardest hit by the Great Recession,\u201d Clinton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The candidate aimed her message at a mostly African American audience ahead of the state's primary.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abbydphillip", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The candidate aimed her message at a mostly African American audience ahead of the state's primary.", "title": "In South Carolina, Clinton goes on the attack against Sanders for disloyalty to Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/12/in-south-carolina-clinton-goes-on-the-attack-against-sanders-for-disloyalty-to-obama/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/files/2016/02/2016-02-12T210513Z_01_JME103_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@abbydphillip"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/12/in-south-carolina-clinton-goes-on-the-attack-against-sanders-for-disloyalty-to-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "clinton, sanders, obama, south carolina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abbydphillip"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "clinton, sanders, obama, south carolina"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is one of the big differences in my campaign with Senator Sanders,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said.\nSpeaking to voters in Denmark, S.C., Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton questioned whether banking reform would prevent having \"lead in the water in Flint\" or \"deteriorating schools\" in South Carolina.\n(Reuters)DENMARK, S.C. \u2014 Speaking to a predominantly African American audience in a rural town here, Hillary Clinton sharply criticized rival Sen.
