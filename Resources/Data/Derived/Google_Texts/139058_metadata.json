Since then, they have been trying to build the site.\n\nTesting began last week in Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio, just days after federal officials gave experts in the industry a preview at a White House meeting.\n\nSmall-business owners, employees, insurers and insurance agents welcomed the website for the Small Business Health Options Program, known as the SHOP exchange, but said they had found defects that needed to be corrected.\n\nFor example, they said, some health insurance plans approved for sale on the exchange did not show up on the website. The site worked well with some web browsers, like Chrome, but not with others, like Internet Explorer and Firefox. Premiums and other charges for some plans were erroneously displayed as percentages rather than dollar amounts \u2014 350 percent rather than $350, for example. For some households, the principal subscriber was listed as a dependent, or vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdministration officials said they were working around the clock to fix the problems, and they have apologized to insurers whose plans were not loaded onto the website. They expressed confidence that the small-business exchange, like a new portal for individual consumers, would be ready for its nationwide debut on Nov. 15.\n\nRepresentative Janice Hahn of California, the senior Democrat on the health care panel of the House Small Business Committee, said she hoped the administration was right. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another bad rollout,\u201d she said, recalling the problems that plagued HealthCare.gov last fall.\n\nRhett Buttle, the director of private-sector engagement at the Department of Health and Human Services, said small businesses in the five states where testing had begun could establish SHOP exchange accounts, choose agents to handle their accounts, apply for coverage online and upload lists of their employees.\n\nMaria Contreras-Sweet, the new administrator of the United States Small Business Administration, emphasized the importance of the effort. \u201cHealth care remains a top concern for small-business owners across the country,\u201d she said. People who work for small businesses are less likely to have insurance than people at large companies, and they typically pay more for the same or similar coverage.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe SHOP program promised affordable new insurance options, but it got off to a slow start, in part because officials were preoccupied with the individual marketplace. California signed up 1.4 million people through its individual exchange, but its small-business exchange enrolled only 1,700 companies, with 11,500 employees and dependents. In Minnesota, the small-business exchange signed up 190 employers covering 1,500 people.\n\nThe range of \u201cemployee choice\u201d varies from state to state, even among states using the federal exchange. In some states, employers can select a level of coverage \u2014 bronze, silver, gold or platinum \u2014 and allow employees to choose any plan from any insurance company in that category. The different \u201cmetal levels\u201d reflect the generosity of coverage: the percentage of costs paid, on average, by a health plan.\n\nWhat employers cannot do in the federal exchange is offer employees a choice of levels.\n\n\u201cIt would be really nice if we could offer plans from different metal levels,\u201d said Joseph A. Cerino, the owner of an Ohio company that makes adhesive products. Federal officials said that would be difficult to administer and could destabilize insurance markets if large numbers of sicker people enrolled in certain plans.\n\nEmily Black Bremer, president of the Missouri Association of Health Underwriters, said she had run into difficulty using a special portal for agents and brokers with small-business clients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI tried it for myself,\u201d Ms. Bremer said. \u201cI could not get in with my user name and password. There was an authentication issue with my login that caused a glitch.\u201d\n\nNicholas A. Moriello, the president of Health Insurance Associates in Newark, Del., praised the Obama administration for soliciting the views of agents and brokers. He said he hoped the new website would work as well in practice as it did in a demonstration at the White House on Oct. 24.\n\nBut \u201cunless a company qualifies for the small-business health care tax credit,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is not really a big incentive for employers to go through the SHOP exchange, rather than buying insurance outside the exchange.\u201d\n\nThe tax credit is available to certain employers with fewer than 25 employees and average wages of less than $50,000 a year. Companies with fewer than 10 employees and wages averaging less than $25,000 will get the largest tax credits.\n\nIn the last year, small businesses have been able to buy insurance through the federal exchange using paper applications. But administration officials said they did not know how many had done so.\n\n\u201cWe are not the source of information as far as SHOP enrollment,\u201d said Mayra E. Alvarez, director of the state exchange group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cWe are working with insurers to get that information so that we can better understand the number of small businesses that enrolled in coverage through SHOP.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141101203544, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration has discovered a number of defects in the online marketplace that will offer health insurance to small-business employees, but said they would be fixed before Nov. 15.", "title": "Defects Found Before Debut of Health Insurance Site for Small Businesses", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/us/defects-found-before-debut-of-health-insurance-site-for-small-businesses.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003210400"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/us/defects-found-before-debut-of-health-insurance-site-for-small-businesses.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003210400", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/us/defects-found-before-debut-of-health-insurance-site-for-small-businesses.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Defects Found Before Debut of Health Insurance Site for Small Businesses", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 1, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Small Business,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Obama administration has discovered a number of defects in the online marketplace that will offer health insurance to small-business employees, but said they would be fixed before Nov. 15.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The Obama administration has discovered a number of defects in the online marketplace that will offer health insurance to small-business employees, but said they would be fixed before Nov. 15.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-11-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2014-11-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "02health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141105134841, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/us/defects-found-before-debut-of-health-insurance-site-for-small-businesses.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration has discovered a number of defects in the online marketplace that will offer health insurance to small-business employees, but said they would be fixed before Nov. 15.", "title": "Defects Found Before Debut of Health Insurance Site for Small Businesses"}, "pdate": 20141101, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003210400, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Defects Found Before Debut of Health Insurance Site for Small Businesses", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "In the last year, small businesses have been able to buy insurance through the federal exchange using paper applications.\nFor example, they said, some health insurance plans approved for sale on the exchange did not show up on the website.\nThey expressed confidence that the small-business exchange, like a new portal for individual consumers, would be ready for its nationwide debut on Nov. 15.\nSmall-business owners, employees, insurers and insurance agents welcomed the website for the Small Business Health Options Program, known as the SHOP exchange, but said they had found defects that needed to be corrected.\nThe range of \u201cemployee choice\u201d varies from state to state, even among states using the federal exchange."}
