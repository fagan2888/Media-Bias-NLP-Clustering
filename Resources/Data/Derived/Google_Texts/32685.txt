— Democratic U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright has another challenger.

Republican Matt Connolly, a former race car driver from Bethlehem Township, announced Tuesday that he is running for the 17th Congressional District, which includes Easton and northern sections of Northampton County.

Connolly made his announcement at an event in Pottsville, in the western segment of a district that also stretches north to Scranton. He also ran in 2014, but lost in a three-way Republican primary in 2014 to Dr. David Moylan, a 62-year-old cardiologist and Schuylkill County coroner.

As in that race, Connolly cites his concerns with the direction the country is headed — and in particular, the president's policies — as his motivation for entering the contest. He blasted Obamacare, describing the health care law as "a real disaster."

Connolly also was critical of Cartwright, noting Cartwright's support of Obamacare and arguing that his voting record on abortion and gun rights has been more liberal than his public statements on those issues.

"I think he's a huge disappointment," Connolly said of the incumbent Democrat. "Your actions, your votes, are what matters, not what you say."

Republican Northampton County Councilman Glenn Geissinger also announced a bid for the 17th Congressional seat in September.

A campaign spokesman for Cartwright, who was first elected to represent the district in 2012, welcomed Connolly to the race.

"We look forward to a spirited debate on the issues that matter most to the residents of northeastern Pennsylvania and the Lehigh Valley," Cartwright spokesman Shane Seaver said.
