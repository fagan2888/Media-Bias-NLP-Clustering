Fans of “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” won’t have to change their schedules — only their channels — when the syndicated hits move to Fox31 on Sept. 8.

“Jeopardy” will continue weeknights at 6 p.m., “Wheel” at 6:30 p.m., with a second run for “Jeopardy” at noon weekdays and 10 p.m. Saturdays on KDVR. “Wheel” will have an additional run at 11:30 p.m. Sundays.

The station has a two- to three-year commitment and plans to “pull out the stops” in terms of promotion and getting the Wheelmobile here as part of its national tour this spring.

As reported, KMGH is giving up the syndicated shows as part of a cost-cutting move by owner Scripps, instead installing a local newscast at 6 p.m. and a Scripps pop-culture newsmagazine at 6:30 p.m.

The costs of syndicated programming has risen dramatically over the years. Particularly longstanding deals with a single station, as in the case of KMGH, some decades, have resulted in exorbitant licensing fees. Word is Gannett’s KTVD was in the bidding as well as KDVR, and the deal was set at roughly $30,000 a week. (Note, during political ad season, the station will more than make up the costs in advertising. Candidates and causes in Colorado are kicking in as much as $3,000 per 30-second spot during the daytime syndicated hits.)

The addition of these syndicated shows marks a shift in direction for Fox31, which presented itself as the younger, edgier, indie alternative to the mainstream network affiliates. Now, it will have older-skewing game shows — including “Celebrity Name Game,” the Craig Ferguson show in which Tribune has part ownership, “Hot Bench,” another courtroom show, and “Judge Judy.”

The younger, edgier holdout in syndication: look for reruns of “The Simpsons” weeknights at 11 and 11:30 p.m. on Fox31.
