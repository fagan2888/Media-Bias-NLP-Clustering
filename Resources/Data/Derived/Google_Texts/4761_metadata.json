The Obama Administration has tweaked Obamacare\u2019s \u201cbirth control mandate,\u201d in order to comply with the Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College decisions that the Supreme Court handed down earlier this summer.\n\nI\u2019m talking, specifically, about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that insurance policies cover all medically approved forms of birth control as a \u201cpreventative service,\u201d which means women can get them with no co-payments or other forms of cost-sharing. The Supreme Court tossed the old requirement because, according to five conservative justices, it violated the religious freedom of organizations whose owners said birth control (or some forms of it) violates their faith. This new regulation (details here) is supposed to satisfy those concerns, but it seems unlikely to have that effect. Groups like the Family Research Council have already dismissed the new regulation as an \u201cinsulting accounting gimmick\u201d and, for all I know, the courts will agree. It\u2019s one more sign that the controversy over contraception, and who should pay for it, isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\nMaybe this is a good time to remind everybody why this requirement matters so much to those of us who support it. Many conservatives look at the price of oral contraceptives, available at places like Target or Walmart for as little as $9 a month, and wonder why anybody except the very poor would need help paying for it. But numerous studies have shown that even modest co-payments can reduce use of medications, particularly when you\u2019re talking about less affluent people who must be careful with every dollar they spend. That\u2019s the whole point of making certain drugs that prevent medical conditions cost-free. It works that way for diabetes and hypertension and, yes, it works that way for pregnancy. Besides, the most effective and, for some women, the most medically appropriate forms of birth control are intrauterine devices (IUDs). Those cost $500 or even $1000 out-of-pocket. Reducing their cost can have fairly dramatic effects on their usage, if the available research is correct.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a much bigger point here that many conservatives (and even some liberals, I suspect) miss. Late last week, lots of people were talking about a story by Sarah Kliff, of Vox, on why teen pregnancy has been declining in just the last few years. It\u2019s a great article, well worth your time, but the part that jumped out at me was the much bigger decline in teen births that occurred many decades ago\u2014in the 1960s, when the teen pregnancy rate fell by about 25 percent. What changed? The big factor, as social scientists (and friends of QED) Harold Pollack and Luke Shaefer reminded me over the weekend, was birth control. The Food and Drug Administration first approved the pill in 1960.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The latest news on Hobby Lobby and Obamacare's controversial mandate", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Conservatives want to know why it's such a big deal that Obamacare pay for contraception.
