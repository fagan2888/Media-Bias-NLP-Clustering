(The first two days were 89 and 95 miles, respectively.) The first 20 miles on Day 3 and Day 4 were identical.\n\nFrom the 20th mile at Oak Creek, cyclists followed a gradual climb paralleling the Yampa River, affording comfortable travel at miles per hour in the teens as well as scenery of both mountain ranges and rock formations.\n\nThe route then led cyclists over State Bridge and a surging Colorado River before a swift descent into the fourth of four aid stations in Wolcott. Next, a gradual climb of 10 miles through Edwards led cyclists to their destination of Avon.\n\nDay 5 of the six-day, 471-mile tour leaves Avon on Thursday for a 74-mile trip to Breckenridge over two mountain passes \u2014 Tennessee and Fremont.\n\nThe sixth and final day summits Loveland Pass and Lookout Mountain over 77 miles to finish in Golden.\n\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, @boyle or bboyle@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Avon,Ride the Rockies,Steamboat Springs", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "The Day 4 route Wednesday was familiar to those riders who opted Day 3 to take the \"false recovery ride.\"", "title": "Ride The Rockies 2014: Day 4 travels from Steamboat Spring to Avon", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/11/ride-rockies-lead-cyclists-day-4-steamboat-spring-avon/2697/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/field-rtr-4-495x369.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Day 4 route Wednesday was familiar to those riders who opted Day 3 to take the \"false recovery ride.\"", "creator": "@boyle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/11/ride-rockies-lead-cyclists-day-4-steamboat-spring-avon/2697/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/field-rtr-4-495x369.jpg", "title": "Ride The Rockies tour takes cyclists on Day 4 from Steamboat Springs to Avon", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Day 4 route Wednesday was familiar to those riders who opted Day 3 to take the \"false recovery ride.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c7c\"", "article_summary": "The Day 4 route Wednesday was familiar to those riders who opted Day 3 to take the \u201cfalse recovery ride,\u201d which was a 54-mile loop starting and ending in Steamboat Springs.\nThe first 20 miles on Day 3 and Day 4 were identical.\nDay 5 of the six-day, 471-mile tour leaves Avon on Thursday for a 74-mile trip to Breckenridge over two mountain passes \u2014 Tennessee and Fremont.\nThe sixth and final day summits Loveland Pass and Lookout Mountain over 77 miles to finish in Golden.\nNext, a gradual climb of 10 miles through Edwards led cyclists to their destination of Avon."}
