President Barack Obama made a surprise concession last night in a speech to Ashtabula County, Ohio insurance agents, calling his signature healthcare law a “terrible mistake” and even appearing to weep.The statement came during a routine stop on the President’s tour of Ashtabula County after he agreed to a short Q&A session with agents.“The ACA was a terrible mistake. I don’t know how it happened,” said Obama, who appeared to be wiping a tear from his eye as he discussed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. “The whole thing started as a running gag with Joe Biden during the 2008 election, and then it just spiraled out of control. All of a sudden the bill was being sent to the White House, and it was the first major thing I had accomplished as president—I mean, what would you have done?”Obama went on to admit his biggest regret was letting his daughter, 16-year-old Malia Obama, draft portions of the ACA as part of a homework assignment for her Advanced Placement US Government course.“I’ve got to say, it was a bit embarrassing watching the man unravel like that,” said Alvin Conrad, agency principal at Conrad Insurance Brokers in Monroe, Ohio. “Someone asked about the cut in our commissions as a result of the medical loss ratio provision, and he just plummeted. We were all looking around at each other until somebody finally handed him a tissue."At press time, Conrad added that his 14-year-old granddaughter had taught him how to use the popular app service Vine, and that he planned to create a six-second video of the weeping president to play on a loop at his retirement party next month.Insurance Business America would like to thank its team of fun-loving reporters for this April Fool’s Day Special Report.
