John Kasich, a Republican, wants to spend more than $7 billion on Obamacare expansion through Ohio\u2019s 2016-17 budget, and Republican supermajorities in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate seem disinclined to stop him.\n\nLawmakers no doubt remember what happened to several of Ohio\u2019s most vocal Medicaid expansion critics a year ago.\n\nSix House Republicans sued to stop Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion in 2013; months later, three found themselves without their party\u2019s endorsement for re-election.\n\nA fourth, former state representative Matt Lynch, opted to run for Congress when the wife of an Ohio Republican Party field director declared her candidacy for Lynch\u2019s seat.\n\nIn a phone interview with Ohio Watchdog, Lynch voiced concern about the extent of Kasich\u2019s control over major policy decisions.\n\n\u201cThe governor and the Legislature are doing President Obama\u2019s bidding by forcing Ohio taxpayers to subsidize Obamacare by Medicaid expansion,\u201d Lynch said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the budget is a product of John Kasich\u2019s philosophy; it\u2019s just being implemented by the Legislature at his insistence,\u201d he added.\n\nSince 2014, severe cost overruns have vindicated Lynch and fellow critics of Obamacare expansion. For the current fiscal year, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is 60 percent over budget.\n\nIn March, benefits for the 527,821 Ohioans enrolled under Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to able-bodied, working-age childless adults cost federal taxpayers $323 million.\n\nObamacare expansion enrollment was 42 percent higher than state estimates, revised upward in September. The monthly cost of the expansion was 84 percent higher than projected.\n\nWednesday, the House is expected to pass a budget scrapping numerous Kasich tax hikes, but nothing in the latest bill would stop Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion from consuming one-tenth of the state budget for the next two years.\n\nHouse Speaker Cliff Rosenberger \u2014 elected to his leadership position with help from Kasich\u2019s closest lobbyists \u2014 has said he supports \u201creauthorization\u201d of Medicaid expansion, with reforms to make it financially stable.\n\nObamacare promises 100 percent federal funding for Medicaid expansion through 2016, so exploding costs don\u2019t seem to have jarred state lawmakers \u2014 yet. The increased burden on taxpayers is great news from the perspective of the Ohio Hospital Association and other entitlement lobbying groups.\n\n\u201cThe expansion is working,\u201d Universal Health Care Action Network Ohio director Cathy Levine asserted in a Tuesday email, warning, \u201cThe Ohio House is going to vote to defund Medicaid Expansion tomorrow.\u201d\n\nEven the introduction of a House floor amendment to end Medicaid expansion would be noteworthy, given Kasich\u2019s marginalization of the policy\u2019s critics in public and within the Ohio Republican Party.\n\nThe governor has used his bully pulpit liberally, accusing Obamacare expansion opponents of trying to send \u201cOhio money\u201d to other states and even suggesting opponents will go to Hell.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t conceive of a half a million people all of a sudden wakin\u2019 up one day and having no health-care coverage as provided under this program,\u201d Kasich told reporters who asked about new Obamacare expansion spending during an April 9 news conference.\n\nKasich\u2019s press secretary did not respond to an Ohio Watchdog request for comment on the expansion\u2019s cost overruns.\n\nAfter orchestrating a coup in the ORP State Central Committee in 2012, Kasich\u2019s team has used the party to keep Republican lawmakers in line \u2014 even when the governor redefined the state\u2019s largest welfare program.\n\nIn 2013, Kasich won approval from the pseudo-legislative Ohio Controlling Board to spend $2.56 billion in Obamacare money on Medicaid expansion. The 18-month Controlling Board appropriation ran out four months early.\n\nThe General Assembly could defund the Obamacare expansion, change permissive Medicaid eligibility and spending rules and limit Controlling Board appropriations, but these policies would require strong majorities in caucuses with numerous Kasich loyalists.\n\nJonathan Ingram, research director for the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, expects politicians will face long-term consequences if they assent to Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich has already proven that welfare for able-bodied adults is a higher priority for his administration than services for kids with developmental disabilities, funding for children\u2019s hospitals, and coverage for pregnant women,\u201d Ingram said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nIngram asked, \u201cWho else will Kasich throw under the bus in order to protect his ObamaCare expansion?\u201d\n\nIngram said Kasich, who has defended Obamacare while visiting other states, is \u201cputting his own state\u2019s neediest patients at risk\u201d and \u201cunsuccessfully lobbying lawmakers and governors all over America to follow his lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s unilateral expansion of ObamaCare is a policy disaster and will eventually prove a political landmine,\u201d Ingram concluded. \u201cOhio\u2019s budget-busting experience should serve as a warning to lawmakers everywhere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Years of partisan maneuvering may be about to pay off for Ohio Gov.
