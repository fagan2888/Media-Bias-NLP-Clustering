All he wanted was to be a transformational figure. Instead, he\u2019ll be merely a transitional one.\n\nFor all the talk about Obama\u2019s grand ambitions to remake the country in his image, current events make it crystal clear his role is as a placeholder.\n\nBoth Obama and first lady Michelle had set out to address their lukewarm feelings toward America-as-it-is by creating an America-as-it-ought-to-be.\n\n\u201cWe are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d then-Sen. Obama said in late October 2008. Earlier that year, Michelle caused a stir by insisting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to change our traditions, our history. We\u2019re going to have to move into a different place as a nation.\u201d\n\nBut events this week will likely cement the Obama presidency as one in which the leader of the Free World was barely able to tread water, let alone usher in dramatic change.\n\nTake the announcement that we\u2019ll be sending a \u201cspecialized expeditionary targeting force\u201d to Iraq to contain ISIS.\n\nIt seems the days of even pretending we won\u2019t put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d against the Islamic State are over. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said so unequivocally on Tuesday: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot from the air, but there are, by the way, boots on the ground.\u201d\n\nYes, there are. And there will likely be a lot more.\n\nHey, if that\u2019s what Obama thinks is the right course of action, good for him for finally coming around and breaking his millionth promise. But it\u2019s worth wondering what happened to the Obama who liked to say, \u201cI was elected to end wars, not start them.\u201d\n\nOn that front, as Ed Koch might\u2019ve said, how\u2019s he doin\u2019? Not great. Sending troops back into Iraq means he was unable to make good on the one vow that was most responsible for his national political career.\n\nHe never ended the Iraq war, of course; he simply tried to end US involvement in it. And he failed.\n\nMeanwhile, the real focus of the West\u2019s new war effort is Syria, where ISIS is strongest. Syria poses the greatest threat in terms of terrorist recruiting, training and planning. Whether you consider the Syria escalation to be a new theater in an old war or a new war itself, Obama\u2019s decisions at every stage have ensured he won\u2019t oversee the end of this one.\n\nSpeaking of Obama\u2019s new wars and of ISIS \u2014 how\u2019s post-Khadafy Libya? In a word, terrible. And it\u2019s not just about Benghazi.\n\nThe resulting anarchy from the president\u2019s half-hearted regime-decapitation there left Libya as a source of weapons for other conflicts, such as the one in Mali, and as a place to incubate a range of terrorists \u2014 including ISIS.\n\n\u201cEven as foreign powers step up pressure against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, the militant group has expanded in Libya and established a new base close to Europe where it can generate oil revenue and plot terror attacks,\u201d The Wall Street Journal explained Sunday, in reference to the Mediterranean coast city of Sirte.\n\nThat\u2019s two strikes in one shot against Obama\u2019s foreign policy: one for his attempt to contain ISIS, which has now expanded to Sirte, and another for his war in Libya.\n\nThe Middle East, North Africa and even crucial parts of Central Asia are in turmoil. True, Obama might not have singlehandedly ignited the multi-continent dumpster fire that\u2019s raging. But he certainly hasn\u2019t put it out, either. That\u2019ll be someone else\u2019s job. And if these hotspots do ever cool, it won\u2019t be because of Obama.\n\nOh, and where was our commander in chief this week as the fire raged? In Paris, working to sign a climate-change deal that won\u2019t change the trajectory of the climate one bit. He wants this to be his legacy, but anything the countries agree to won\u2019t be revolutionary \u2014 or even enforceable.\n\nEven his biggest legacy item, ObamaCare, is less than meets the eye in terms of \u201ctransformation.\u201d First of all, it\u2019s sputtering toward a death spiral that virtually ensures the next president, regardless of party, will make changes \u2014 and treat the program as a work in progress, at best.\n\nAnd second, and more important, the growth in health insurance coverage in 2014 thanks to ObamaCare was mostly due to the expansion of Medicaid \u2014 an existing, and terrible, government program for the poor.\n\nSo on both foreign and domestic policy, Obama either doubled down on his predecessors\u2019 programs or mismanaged \u2014 and thus perpetuated \u2014 the status quo ante.\n\nSome transformation.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Poor President Obama.
