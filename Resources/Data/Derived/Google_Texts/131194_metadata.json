Running for a state Senate seat, a Republican says the incumbent he\u2019s trying to unseat wasn\u2019t there for voters when they needed someone to oppose a compromise Medicaid expansion.\n\nAttacks on the president\u2019s health care overhaul are nothing new for Republicans, who have made major gains in Arkansas over the past two elections by running against the law they deride as \u201cObamacare.\u201d But with the state\u2019s compromise Medicaid expansion reauthorized for another year, GOP candidates are facing friendly fire over the same issue that has boosted their political fortune in the state.\n\nAfter surviving a defunding attempt during the legislative session that wrapped up last week, the \u201cprivate option\u201d plan to use federal Medicaid funds to purchase private insurance for the poor is taking center stage in Republican primaries up and down the ballot on May 20. Conceived as an alternative to expanding Medicaid under the federal health law, the program won unanimous backing from Democrats but has sharply divided Republicans in the state Legislature.\n\nThat divide could play a factor in races for offices that have nothing to do with the private option, such as state treasurer and state auditor. Primaries for both offices pit lawmakers who supported the program that\u2019s extending health coverage to nearly 98,000 people against rivals who have been outspoken in calling for the private option\u2019s dismantling.\n\nThough he acknowledges the state treasurer\u2019s office has little to do with the private option, Saline County Clerk Dennis Milligan calls the program the \u201cdefining issue\u201d in his bid against state Rep. Duncan Baird for the GOP nomination. On his campaign website and in an interview, he criticizes Baird for supporting the program last year and its reauthorization this year.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with the leadership, the decision-making process of my opponent with respect to our party and the leadership that he demonstrated being a floor leader for Obamacare,\u201d he said, referring to Baird presenting the private option funding bill to the House\n\nBaird, who co-chairs the Joint Budget Committee, said he\u2019s instead focused on who\u2019s more qualified for running the office that handles the state investments and said voters are more interested in talking about how he\u2019ll reform the office. But Baird said he\u2019ll defend his record on opposing the president\u2019s health overhaul.\n\nBaird said Milligan\u2019s criticism of him as the \u201cfloor leader\u201d for the private option is misleading, and notes that he presents all of the budget bills in his position as the panel\u2019s co-chairman.\n\n\u201cIf you call me the floor leader for one appropriation, you\u2019d have to call me the floor leader for the balanced budget and tax cuts and public schools as well,\u201d Baird said.\n\nThe race for state auditor is similarly injecting the private option into an office whose primary duties focus on writing checks for the state, not crafting health care policy. Ken Yang cites rival state Rep. Andrea Lea\u2019s votes for the program in questioning her conservative credentials.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hard pressed to call yourself a conservative when you support Obamacare,\u201d Yang said.\n\nLea said that when campaigning she explains that she backed the measure both this year and last because of what she saw as conservative reforms attached to it. Those reforms include the establishment of a Medicaid inspector general last year and a proposal this year to bar any public funds be used to promote the private option or other parts of the health law.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just easier to say Obamacare and that seems to be something people don\u2019t like than to explain specifics about a bill,\u201d Lea said.\n\nEven lawmakers who opposed reauthorizing the private option aren\u2019t immune from criticism. Republican Sen. Missy Irvin had voted for the program last year, but announced before this year\u2019s session that she could not support continuing it another year.\n\nPhil Grace, who hopes to unseat her in the primary, said he doesn\u2019t believe that reversal is good enough.\n\n\u201cThe problem is when we really needed her, she wasn\u2019t there for us,\u201d Grace said.\n\nIrvin defended her position, saying she backed the private option measure last year only after it included changes she had pushed for such as health savings accounts that she said improved the program. She said she could no longer support the program after seeing how it was being implemented.\n\n\u201cPeople change their minds in business every single day and I felt necessary that we should press pause and let\u2019s address these problems,\u201d Irvin said.\n\nThe program is expected to play a role in several other legislative races. Rep. John Burris, one of the chief architects of the private option, is seeking a state Senate seat in northern Arkansas. Scott Flippo, one of the two rivals in that primary, has cited the private option as a top issue in the race. Republican Sen. Bruce Holland faces a re-election challenge in the primary from Rep. Terry Rice, an outspoken opponent of the compromise Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn the fight for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, Little Rock businessman Curtis Coleman is counting on the private option to help overcome a fundraising and organizational gap with former U.S. Rep. Asa Hutchinson. Coleman criticized Hutchinson for not weighing in during the session on whether the private option should continue \u2014 a criticism that Hutchinson has also faced from Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think it is going to be a significant issue and I frankly think my opponent\u2019s failure to take a definitive position is going to be a liability for him,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI think people view it as a lack of transparency and some view it as a lack of leadership.\u201d\n\nHutchinson said he believes he did the right thing by not saying whether the private option should continue, saying the Legislature didn\u2019t need his interference. Hutchinson said he\u2019ll continue to monitor the program and would push for the private option\u2019s end if it didn\u2019t meet the promises.\n\n\u201cWe know that Obamacare\u2019s not working. It\u2019s fatally flawed and the Legislature dealt with this the best they could,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cMy goal would be to continue to put reforms into place, to measure the cost and if it doesn\u2019t bring the results we expect, I\u2019ll join with others to end it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A candidate for state treasurer calls his opponent a \u201cfloor leader for Obamacare\u201d and a state auditor hopeful accuses his rival of supporting the president\u2019s health care law multiple times in the Legislature.
