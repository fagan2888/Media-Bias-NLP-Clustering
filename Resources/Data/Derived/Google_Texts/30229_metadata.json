The scammers claim the Treasury Department can disperse large sums of money in exchange for a smaller amount of money initially sent to them.\n\nThe scammers have also asked people to provide personal banking information. The phone number the scammers are calling from is a 202 area code, which is a Washington D.C. area code.\n\nThey use phrases like \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d and \u201cAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act\u201d which are government services but are not related to the TANF program. The scam is targeting lower income and elderly people.\n\nDHS wants the public to know they do not make calls asking people to sign up for the TANF program. You can apply for TANF assistance by signing up online or calling your local DHS office.\n\nDHS will never ask you for money in order to receive assistance.\n\nIf you receive a call similar to this, please hang up and do not share any personal information with the caller.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Oklahoma Department of Human Services is warning about a scam in Oklahoma and other states.
