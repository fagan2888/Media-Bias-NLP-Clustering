According to New York Magazine, some pet owners refuse to vaccinate their puppies, paving the way for a greater risk of doggie disease outbreaks like canine distemper and parvovirus, both of which are severe illnesses that can be fatal.\n\nWhen puppies are first taken to the vet, they\u2019re given a string of shots \u2014 but veterinarians are noting there\u2019s been an uptick in people refusing to get their dogs vaccinated.\n\n\"I would say, from a subjective personal point of view, that often, issues in veterinary medicine spill over from human medicine,\" Brennan McKenzie, a veterinarian blogger and former president of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association, told the magazine. \"Over the last 10 or 15 years, there has been an increase in mostly unfounded concerns about vaccine safety for people \u2014 and that, I think, has raised people\u2019s awareness and level of concern about vaccinations for their pets.\"\n\nThe problem is there is very little to no data on vaccine rates for pets \u2014 unlike the tracking of human vaccination rates, which makes it clear when they\u2019re either dropping or rising. However, even if the drop in dog vaccinations is miniscule, it can have an impact by placing pets in danger of severe diseases.\n\n\u201cThe fewer animals that are getting the vaccine, the greater the likelihood that you\u2019re going to have a firestorm if something that is that highly communicable comes along,\u201d Christopher Brockett, president of the New York State Veterinary Medical Society, told New York Magazine.\n\nBut there\u2019s another side to the story: perhaps it\u2019s not that dog owners are refusing to vaccinate, but rather that they\u2019re being told they\u2019re over-vaccinating. Plenty of vets warn against combination shots, which, unlike the one-stop-shop rabies vaccine, are a cocktail of ingredients and vaccines in one shot. Combo shots, sometimes referred to as \u201cmumbo jumbos,\u201d are considered a form of over-vaccination because they must be given annually, compared to the rabies vaccine which is good for 12 to 15 years. These combination shots unecessarily expose the dog to adverse reactions like skin diseases, autoimmune diseases, and allergies, according to Dogs Naturally Magazine.\n\nOf course, while there may be some legitimate debate on vaccinating dogs, no evidence exists that human vaccines, like the one for measles, is actually bad for you, despite the beliefs of some parents who believe it's linked to autism and other diseases.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "anti-vaxxers, vaccination, dog vaccines", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pet owners may be steering away from vaccines for their dogs, but possibly for different reasons than humans are.", "title": "Dog Owners Are Now Skipping Out On Their Pets' Vaccines, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dog-vaccines-now-being-skipped-too-anti-vaxx-trend-shifting-321336", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/dog-vaccinations.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pet owners may be steering away from vaccines for their dogs, but possibly for different reasons than humans are.", "title": "Dog Owners Are Now Skipping Out On Their Pets' Vaccines, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dog-vaccines-now-being-skipped-too-anti-vaxx-trend-shifting-321336", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/dog-vaccinations.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/dog-vaccinations.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-07T18:03:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-08T15:45:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pet owners may be steering away from vaccines for their dogs, but possibly for different reasons than humans are."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe547c\"", "article_summary": "But there\u2019s another side to the story: perhaps it\u2019s not that dog owners are refusing to vaccinate, but rather that they\u2019re being told they\u2019re over-vaccinating.\nAs anti-vaccination fears continue to spread among some people, the trend appears to be transferring over to pet owners and their dogs, too.\nThese combination shots unecessarily expose the dog to adverse reactions like skin diseases, autoimmune diseases, and allergies, according to Dogs Naturally Magazine.\nWhile some veterinarians argue that the human Anti-Vaxxer scare has caused the trend to occur among pet owners too, other veterinarians believe that over-vaccination can be harmful too.\nPlenty of vets warn against combination shots, which, unlike the one-stop-shop rabies vaccine, are a cocktail of ingredients and vaccines in one shot."}
