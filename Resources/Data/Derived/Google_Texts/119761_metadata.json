She sought help from Guatemalan police, but was told they wouldn\u2019t intervene in a domestic dispute.\n\nHer petition for asylum in the United States was originally denied, but the appeals board ruled (pdf) that battered spouses such as Cifuentes were members of a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d which could qualify for asylum if they prove they are persecuted in their home country. Members of such groups must prove that their home governments are involved in the persecution or unwilling or unable to stop it, according to the Associated Press. The Pan American Health Organization reported in 2012 that from 2008 to 2009 more than a quarter of Guatemalan women said they had suffered physical or sexual violence from a spouse or partner at some point in the relationship.\n\n\u201cWomen who have suffered violence in these cases can now rely on the legal principles established in this ruling,\u201d Karen Musalo, a professor and director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of the Law, who was an adviser to Cifuentes, told The New York Times. \u201cA judge can no longer say, \u2018I believe these horrible things happened to you but this is just a criminal act, this is not persecution.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor now, the ruling applies only to women from Guatemala and those applying for asylum will have to meet strict requirements to get it.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nU.S. to Consider Spousal Abuse In Immigration Claims (by Alicia A.
