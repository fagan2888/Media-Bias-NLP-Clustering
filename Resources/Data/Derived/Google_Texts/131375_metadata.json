But Republicans have little margin for error, and most key races remain tossups.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because many of those same polls show that voters favor Democrats on several issues, including pocketbook economic concerns and women\u2019s reproductive health issues. This has led many Republican candidates to take steps \u2014 some only in recent weeks \u2014 to project a more moderate image and try to inoculate themselves from attacks portraying them as extremists.\n\nRep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), a GOP Senate nominee who has come under fire for once sponsoring so-called personhood legislation, said he opposes a state ballot measure on the issue. (Chris Schneider/Associated Press)\n\nTo win, Republican candidates must offer \u201ccommon-sense ideas\u201d that demonstrate compassion and expand their support beyond base Republican voters, said Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), who has played a major role this year raising money for and advising the GOP\u2019s top Senate recruits.\n\nMathematically, Republicans can take control of the Senate merely by winning in red states. Still, Portman said, \u201ceven in those states, like Alaska, West Virginia, Montana, the reason our candidates are doing well is they have a broader appeal beyond just the Republican base. Independent voters are the plurality in most of these states.\u201d\n\nMany Republican strategists see this as an even more critical imperative heading into the 2016 presidential campaign as well as that year\u2019s Senate contests. Nine Republicans, including Portman, are up for reelection in 2016 in states that Obama won at least once.\n\nThis year\u2019s move to the political middle will serve as a test for 2016. If these candidates lose, the party\u2019s conservative base is likely to blame it on their straying too far from orthodoxy. If they win, it could provide some evidence that the GOP can expand its coalition by reaching to the center.\n\nIn the face of sustained attacks from Democrats on issues of reproductive health, Republican Senate challengers in Colorado, North Carolina, Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia have said they support over-the-counter \u00adaccess to birth-control pills.\n\nRep. Cory Gardner, the GOP Senate nominee in Colorado, has come under fire for sponsoring federal \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation that would define a fetus as a person. Sen. Mark Udall (D-\n\nColo.) made this a key theme of their race. In a recent interview, Udall said that Coloradans are \u201cvery much libertarians\u201d and want elected officials \u201cto butt out when it comes to personal matters.\u201d\n\nGardner said he opposes a personhood measure that will be on the state\u2019s ballot in November. \u201cI don\u2019t support personhood. I oppose personhood,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nRepublican Monica Wehby, whose Democratic opponent tried to make the case that she is too extreme for progressive Oregon, came out in support of gay marriage through a television ad. (Steve Dykes/Associated Press)\n\nBrad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, pointed out that the majority of voters agree with the positions GOP candidates have taken to support over-the-counter birth control.\n\n\u201cThese candidates are being unfairly criticized by their opponents as being anti-birth-control, which is false,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for Democrats to wage a \u2018war on women\u2019 campaign and say that Candidate X is anti-birth control when they say it should be more accessible and more affordable.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Democratic strategists argue that any debate focused on birth control or the minimum wage \u2014 as opposed to the health-care law, for instance \u2014 favors Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Republican policy agenda is not playing very well in any of these races,\u201d said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThey\u2019re running away from their national agenda in all directions.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) has tried to make the case that his GOP opponent, Monica Wehby, is too extreme for progressive Oregon. But Wehby countered earlier this month with a television ad in which she came out in support of gay marriage.\n\nAt the start of this year, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) was looking at one of the most difficult reelection fights in the country. To appeal to Hispanic voters, he signed a law providing in-state college tuition to some illegal immigrants. And Scott earned bipartisan validation by signing a law legalizing some forms of medical marijuana.\n\nPhil Cox, executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said the nature of a governor\u2019s job requires a more pragmatic approach that often differs from the national party\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cGovernors are forced to be strategic to achieve their priorities,\u201d Cox said. He added: \u201cThere is a Washington brand that is completely divorced from what is going on in the states.\u201d\n\nSocial conservative leaders cautioned that candidates who move to the middle on social issues risk alienating their conservative base.\n\n\u201cThose in the Republican Party who have stepped away [from conservative positions] thinking that\u2019s an answer to beat the Democrats are going to put themselves in some unnecessary danger in losing some people going to the polls,\u201d said Connie Mackey, president of FRC Action PAC, the Family Research Council\u2019s political arm.\n\nSome Republicans are moving to the middle on pocketbook issues as well.\n\nSenate nominees Dan Sullivan in Alaska and Tom Cotton in Arkansas support ballot initiatives in their states to increase the minimum wage, a Democratic priority that is seen as a proxy for demonstrating compassion for working- and middle-class voters. Republican Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman running for governor of Arkansas, also supports his state\u2019s ballot initiative.\n\nThis spring, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) raised the minimum wage in his state to $9.25 an hour. Meanwhile, Tom Foley, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in Connecticut, backs increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10, which Obama and Democratic congressional leaders have championed. \u201cThe minimum wage is a fairness issue,\u201d Foley said in announcing his support.\n\nNationally, most Republicans oppose the federal increase, arguing the measure would kill jobs and hurt businesses. Indeed, Sullivan and Cotton have said they oppose a federal minimum-wage increase to $10.10 an hour, although they back more modest hikes in their states.\n\nGrover Norquist, a prominent anti-tax activist, said it is tactically smart for Republican candidates to back such state ballot initiatives because it could blunt possible attacks from Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf you were trying to say this [election] is all about Obamacare and immigration and that the president\u2019s IRS has gone crazy, why would you allow someone to throw a marble and then go step on it?\u201d Norquist asked.\n\nA handful of Republican governors running for reelection this year are able to claim credit for broadening the social safety net through the Affordable Care Act. Although they opposed Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) and Snyder accepted federal money under the act to expand Medicaid coverage in their states.\n\nEven Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who faces a tough reelection fight, has said he supports Kentucky\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health-care program for low-income people.\n\nVin Weber, a former congressman and GOP insider, said Republican campaigns for the past six years have been driven by the conservative grass-roots backlash to Obama. The party\u2019s future, he said, relies on devising a positive and more inclusive agenda.\n\n\u201cThe party is more conservative than it has been in the past, but some issues are not worth fighting about, and minimum wage is one example,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIf you actually want to govern the country again, the party\u2019s got to be for more than against the guy who\u2019s no longer going to be president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some GOP candidates are embracing Democratic priorities to win over skeptical voters.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some GOP candidates are embracing Democratic priorities to win over skeptical voters.", "title": "GOP candidates in heated contests explore a move to the middle", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-heated-midterm-contests-gop-candidates-explore-a-move-to-the-middle/2014/09/21/e7f43ce2-4001-11e4-9587-5dafd96295f0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/21/National-Politics/Images/11733441_H1477152.JPG", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-heated-midterm-contests-gop-candidates-explore-a-move-to-the-middle/2014/09/21/e7f43ce2-4001-11e4-9587-5dafd96295f0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "midterms, 2014 midterms, 2014 gop agenda, republican senate candidates, republican governors, republican 2016, gop 2014, minimum wage, republicans minimum wage, personhood, republicans personhood, republicans marijuana, rick scott, rob portman, cory gardner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e7f43ce2-4001-11e4-9587-5dafd96295f0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "midterms, 2014 midterms, 2014 gop agenda, republican senate candidates, republican governors, republican 2016, gop 2014, minimum wage, republicans minimum wage, personhood, republicans personhood, republicans marijuana, rick scott, rob portman, cory gardner"}, "article_summary": "(Chris Schneider/Associated Press)To win, Republican candidates must offer \u201ccommon-sense ideas\u201d that demonstrate compassion and expand their support beyond base Republican voters, said Sen.\nRep.
