Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBy Lisa Gillespie\n\nAs consumers increasingly are being asked to pay a larger share of their health bills, a coalition of insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and provider and consumer advocacy groups launched Thursday a new push for greater transparency regarding the actual costs of services.\n\nThe group includes AARP, Novo Nordisk, the National Consumers League, the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, the National Council for Behavioral Health and Aetna.\n\nHealth care transparency, long a buzz word, means all consumers \u2014 whether they are covered by Medicare, work-based insurance or without coverage at all \u2014 have access to information enabling them to estimate accurately the cost of health services, and compare physician quality rankings and outcomes.\n\nThe initiative, \u201cClear Choices,\u201d will add to private and government efforts already underway to get more such information to patients, including Medicare\u2019s Physician Compare, and the Health Care Cost Institute\u2019s \u2018Guroo,\u2019 which culls data from private insurers to provide average prices regionally.\n\nThe group\u2019s first priority is advancing the Medicare doctor payment legislation pending in the Senate because it includes a provision requiring Medicare to release for broader use a substantial amount of data on claims at the provider level.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have data, but it\u2019s a random sample across entire nation. So you can\u2019t use it to do what Clear Choices and other organizations want to do \u2014 to analyze the cost and quality of individual providers within the Medicare program,\u201d said Francois de Brantes, executive director of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, a nonprofit group that studies and promotes payment reform. It is not affiliated with the initiative.\n\n\n\nAnother priority is to push states and the federal government to enforce the part of the health care law that requires exchange plans to give consumers very specific information about provider networks and covered drugs.\n\n\u201cInsurance company rates are negotiated, so each patient would be subject to a different rate,\u201d said Caroline Steinberg, vice president of trends analysis at the American Hospital Association, which is not involved in the campaign. That negotiated rate means a consumer will likely pay less money for an in-network doctor or hospital. But they need a way to find out that information.\n\nSome states already have moved in this direction.\n\nFor example, Connect for Health Colorado, Colorado\u2019s state exchange, provides a tool for shoppers to compare insurers based on what drugs are covered, and what providers are in network.\n\nThe coalition\u2019s most lofty goal is to change the health system so that patients can know upfront the cost of a medical procedure. This is a complicated proposition because so many components \u2013 among them facility-use fees, physician charges, deductibles and co-payments \u2013 are factored into the bill a patient eventually receives.\n\nWanda Filer, a physician based in York, Penn., says even health care providers are often confused by pricing.\n\n\n\n\u201cPhysicians don\u2019t even know where to refer people and they don\u2019t know what to tell them,\u201d said Filer, who is on the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians, which is part of the coalition.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of Clear Choices have framed the campaign as being simple \u2013 if a consumer can get a sticker price for a television, so should they for health care. But others say this is much harder than it might appear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking what the price [will be] for the repair of a leaky roof before the roofer has figured out the cause of the leak,\u201d said Mark Pauly, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for the insurer to tell you what you will end up paying until you have precise information on what services you will be using\u2014which patients (and, for that matter, doctors) do not always know in advance.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s other objectives include:\n\n\u2013 Improving quality measures for doctors and hospitals so that patients will be armed with more comparative information.\n\n\u2013 Requiring hospitals to be clearer regarding what may or may not be included in their cost estimates for care.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Pulse", "title": "Coalition Hopes to Amp Up Push for Health Care Transparency", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The initiative, \u201cClear Choices,\u201d will add to efforts already underway to provide health care cost information to patients.", "title": "Coalition Hopes to Amp Up Push for Health Care Transparency", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/10/coalition-hopes-to-amp-up-push-for-health-care-transparency", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a1/8b/b08f4b7346cbb93980cf8f533f65/150410-healthcare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Coalition Hopes to Amp Up Push for Health Care Transparency", "description": "The initiative, \u201cClear Choices,\u201d will add to efforts already underway to provide health care cost information to patients.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "April 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "health insurance,health care,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,Kaiser,Pulse", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The initiative, \u201cClear Choices,\u201d will add to efforts already underway to provide health care cost information to patients."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9cc\"", "article_summary": "Wanda Filer, a physician based in York, Penn., says even health care providers are often confused by pricing.\nRepresentatives of Clear Choices have framed the campaign as being simple \u2013 if a consumer can get a sticker price for a television, so should they for health care.\nAdvocate groups want consumers to be able to see the cost of health services and compare physicians.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking what the price [will be] for the repair of a leaky roof before the roofer has figured out the cause of the leak,\u201d said Mark Pauly, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\u2013 Requiring hospitals to be clearer regarding what may or may not be included in their cost estimates for care."}
