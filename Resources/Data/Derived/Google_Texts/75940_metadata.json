Thus a meeting of the two presidents on the relatively neutral ground of the United Nations General Assembly is the right thing to do. It thus seemed puerile for the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, to portray Mr. Putin as a beggar \u201cdesperate\u201d for a meeting and to belittle his personal appearance. That is not the way to prepare for a critical meeting.\n\nStill, it is easy to sympathize with Mr. Obama. Mr. Putin has openly defied international law and Western sanctions by his annexation of Ukraine and support of rebels in eastern Ukraine. His backing of Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad is one reason the Syrian civil war has dragged on so long and has created so appalling a humanitarian crisis. He routinely blames the United States for his troubles. For these and other reasons it is not easy for Mr. Obama to acknowledge that he needs Mr. Putin\u2019s cooperation.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nThe hard truth, however, is that neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Putin is on particularly solid ground. The American effort to train moderate Syrians who could roll back both the Islamic State and the Assad forces has been a dismal failure; indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that ISIS cannot be confronted effectively without a political settlement in Syria between Mr. Assad\u2019s regime and the opposition, which may mean keeping Mr. Putin\u2019s client temporarily in power.\n\nThe Russian president has his own problems. His economy has been battered by dropping oil prices and Western sanctions and he is smarting from Western ostracism over Ukraine. Syria gives him a chance to push Ukraine into the background and mount the global stage as an indispensable player. This, of course, is the role Mr. Earnest was seeking to deny him by depicting him as a thuggish supplicant.\n\nMr. Putin may indeed be looking only for a spotlight. But the surest way to find out is for Mr. Obama to sit down with him and see whether there is anything Russia and America can do together in Syria. There is nothing demeaning in that.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150927132012, "twitter": {"description": "Despite deep animosities, the two leaders could help each other, especially on Syria.", "title": "An Obama-Putin Meeting Makes Sense", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/an-obama-putin-meeting-makes-sense.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003941010"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/an-obama-putin-meeting-makes-sense.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003941010", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/an-obama-putin-meeting-makes-sense.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Obama-Putin Meeting Makes Sense", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 27, 2015", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Putin  Vladimir V,Assad  Bashar al-,Syria,United States Politics and Government", "news_keywords": "Syria", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Assad, Bashar al-", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Despite deep animosities, the two leaders could help each other, especially on Syria.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Despite deep animosities, the two leaders could help each other, especially on Syria.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2015-09-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Syria", "slug": "28iht-edobamaputin28", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150928021101, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/an-obama-putin-meeting-makes-sense.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Despite deep animosities, the two leaders could help each other, especially on Syria.", "title": "An Obama-Putin Meeting Makes Sense"}, "pdate": 20150927, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003941010, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "An Obama-Putin Meeting Makes Sense", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "The hard truth, however, is that neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Putin is on particularly solid ground.\nFor these and other reasons it is not easy for Mr. Obama to acknowledge that he needs Mr. Putin\u2019s cooperation.\nIt thus seemed puerile for the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, to portray Mr. Putin as a beggar \u201cdesperate\u201d for a meeting and to belittle his personal appearance.\nStill, it is easy to sympathize with Mr. Obama.\nMr. Putin has openly defied international law and Western sanctions by his annexation of Ukraine and support of rebels in eastern Ukraine."}
