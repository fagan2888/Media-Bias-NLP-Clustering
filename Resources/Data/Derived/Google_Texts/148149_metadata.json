They said they are looking for a white man in his 40s, who was dressed completely in black and may have been carrying a black duffel bag.\n\nThey also said they wanted to speak with a \u201cperson of interest,\u201d Kenneth \u201cTex\u201d Lankford, 47, who has a connection to one of the homes. They did not specify the connection.\n\nLankford has an extensive criminal record in three states and was out on a $1,000 bond on an assortment of charges, including drug possession with intent to distribute and possession of a weapon by a previous offender. He was also charged Oct. 17 with owning a dangerous dog that caused injury or death.\n\nHe also owned a home on Shoup Road in Black Forest that was destroyed in this summer\u2019s wildfire. Records indicate he lived there with Terry Thoke Trout.\n\n\u201cWe are not identifying him as a suspect,\u201d said Sgt. Joe Roybal, spokesman for the El Paso County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe names of the slaying victims have not been released.\n\nSheriff\u2019s investigators warn that if anyone sees the suspect, they are not to approach the man because he is considered armed and dangerous.\n\nThe license plate of the 2002 red Honda Odyssey is 048-GJB, Roybal said.\n\n\u201cWe are processing two different crime scenes,\u201d Roybal said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if the two incidents are related or not.\u201d\n\nAt about 8:30 a.m., a 911 call came from 11725 Timberlane Court in Black Forest, with the homeowner reporting he had been shot in the face by an intruder.\n\nAccording to records, the home is owned by Thomas and Carol Fowler.\n\nA neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said both the Fowlers were shot and the wife was dead. The neighbor said the intruder had stolen another neighbor\u2019s van and fled the scene. No motive has been determined, Roybal said.\n\nThe other scene was at 6685 Burrows Road, about 5 miles east of the Timberlane residence.\n\nNeighbors on Burrows Road told reporters from KMGH News that a man named Ken lived at that residence with his wife or girlfriend and had moved there after the Black Forest fire. They told the TV station said he occasionally sleeps in a tent on the property.\n\nLankford first went to jail when he was 19, and has been in and out of jail ever since, said his uncle, Norce Lankford, 62, of Longview, Texas. The younger Lankford was arrested for numerous charges, including selling drugs, burglary, theft, forgery, assault and aggravated assault.\n\n\u201cHe cannot come here, absolutely,\u201d Norce Lankford said by phone Saturday evening. \u201cI\u2019m from Texas. If he pulls a gun out here, I\u2019m going to have fun.\u201d\n\nStill, his uncle said, Kenneth Lankford has one of the biggest hearts and will do anything for people. He added that his nephew has been running a pawn shop in Colorado Springs. \u201cWhen he got on drugs he had a very hot temper,\u201d Norce Lankford said. \u201cHe\u2019s from Texas. When you want to get after it, we do it.\u201d\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two people killed, one seriously injured at two Black Forest homes", "title": "Two people killed, one seriously injured at two Black Forest homes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/09/two-people-killed-one-seriously-injured-at-two-black-forest-homes-2/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__BN20131110_B4_BNCD09INVASIONp1.jpg", "height": 374}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__BN20131110_B4_BNCD09INVASIONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T21:00:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:28:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He also owned a home on Shoup Road in Black Forest that was destroyed in this summer\u2019s wildfire.\nA chaotic scene unfolded in Black Forest on Saturday morning as authorities investigated two separate deadly shootings at homes in the community north of Colorado Springs that are likely to be connected.\nNeighbors on Burrows Road told reporters from KMGH News that a man named Ken lived at that residence with his wife or girlfriend and had moved there after the Black Forest fire.\nThey said they are looking for a white man in his 40s, who was dressed completely in black and may have been carrying a black duffel bag.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know if the two incidents are related or not.\u201dAt about 8:30 a.m., a 911 call came from 11725 Timberlane Court in Black Forest, with the homeowner reporting he had been shot in the face by an intruder."}
