The fact is, to put it simply: Trump will fight. Not only will he fight, he\u2019ll fight dirty. And the thing is, we have to have someone who will fight in the mud, because that\u2019s where our opponents [Democrats] are.\u201d\n\nSean went on to argue that Republicans won\u2019t fight, as evidenced by the fact that they didn\u2019t repeal Obamacare. He went on to say this:\n\nWe\u2019re sick and tired of fighting with people who won\u2019t fight, and when it comes to down to Cruz, you know, my instincts with Cruz is that, yeah, he\u2019s a nice guy. And don\u2019t get me wrong, if he magically wins this nomination, of course I\u2019ll support him. But the problem is, I suspect he won\u2019t fight.\n\nThree days ago there was an article in Breitbart where he\u2019s being interviewed and he said, \u201cYou know, if I\u2019m elected, \u201che said something to that effect of, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna get personal. This is gonna be about issues.\u201d Okay, great. You just handed them the election, \u2019cause you know what they\u2019re gonna do? They\u2019re gonna make it personal against you and you\u2019re gonna be like the new George Bush just sitting up there like Jeb. You won\u2019t fight. You\u2019ll just sit there and take it and we\u2019re gonna lose again. And the thing is, Trump, you know what? I disagree with probably 80% of the stuff that he believes in, or he purports to. But the thing is, I think we\u2019re facing an existential crisis. It comes down to immigration, illegal immigration and Obamacare.\n\nSet aside the fact that Sean is simply wrong when it comes to defunding the Affordable Care Act. (Shutting down the federal government can defund discretionary programs but not entitlement programs, which is what Obamacare is.) Or that Trump has praised a single-payer health care system, including this year, and in 2012 was criticizing Mitt Romney for being too harsh toward illegal immigrants. Set aside, too, the silly assertion that Ted Cruz is too nice and \u201cwon\u2019t fight.\u201d (The main rap against Cruz is that he is deeply disliked in part because he will fight on behalf of hopeless and unpopular causes in order to further his own ambition.)\n\nWhat I want to focus on is the fact that Sean is willing to support Trump despite disagreeing with him on 80 percent of the issues because of how Trump practices politics. Because he is cruel and vulgar and mean-spirited. Because he will fight dirty.\n\nThe following day Rush praised Sean, saying, \u201cIf Trump\u2019s the nominee and if he does unload on Hillary Clinton as he\u2019s promising to do, let me just tell you something: You do not know how many gazillion Americans are going to be delirious and orgasmic with delight and support.\u201d He added, \u201cIf Trump hits her and criticizes her like the Clintons haven\u2019t been, you\u2019re gonna have people on that basis alone vote for [Trump], in my opinion, \u2019cause I don\u2019t think people understand how pent up the frustration and the opposition to the Clintons at what they have seemingly gotten away with all of these years.\u201d\n\nSo there, in a nutshell, is the case for Trump by those who are supportive or at least sympathetic to him. He\u2019ll fight dirty, and in doing so he\u2019ll win over a \u201cgazillion\u201d Americans.\n\nThe latter proposition is dubious, given that Mr. Trump\u2019s negatives \u2013 and the intensity of his negatives \u2014 are unprecedented. Despite facing a very weak opponent in Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump is positioning himself to be crushed. But it\u2019s the celebration of Trump\u2019s style of politics that ought to most worry us. The very thing that ought to disqualify Trump is what commends him to many.\n\nBefore Democrats pat themselves on the back for being paradigms of civility and decency, let\u2019s recall that the Clintons have shown they are well practiced in the politics of personal destruction, whether it means savaging and threatening women Bill Clinton has had affairs with or those, like Ken Starr, who were appointed to investigate him. Trump is at least as skilled at this game, which means the 2016 presidential election, assuming both Clinton and Trump are the nominees, may well be the ugliest and most vicious election many of us will have ever seen.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy or quick way out of this. It will require some large number of Americans to re-think how we are to engage in politics in this era of rage and polarization. Toward that end John Inazu, an associate professor of law and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, has written Confident Pluralism: Surviving and Thriving through Deep Difference.\n\nProfessor Inazu\u2019s book explores, in an honest and realistic way, how we can live together peaceably despite our deep differences. He concedes we lack agreement about the purpose of our country, the nature of the common good, and the meaning of human flourishing. But this is hardly the first time. (To take just one example, America in 1860 was far more riven than it is today.)\n\nWhat is needed is to reclaim what Inazu calls three \u201ccivic aspirations\u201d \u2013 tolerance, humility and patience. The goal here isn\u2019t to pretend our deep differences don\u2019t exist; rather, it\u2019s to approach politics in ways that takes into account our constitutional commitments (including allowing individuals to form and gather in groups of their choosing) and civic practices. It is to give people space to live their lives and think about things in different ways. It means accepting our disagreements without degrading and imbruting those with whom we disagree. It obligates us, in other words, to understand what pluralism requires of others and of us. (The requirements we place on others is the easy part; the requirements we place on ourselves is the more challenging part.)\n\nThis all may sound hopelessly high-minded to you, eliciting a dismissive roll of the eyes. It\u2019s so unfashionable, so unrealistic, so out of touch. It\u2019s chic to be cynical. Except for this: Disagreeing with others, even passionately disagreeing with others, without rhetorically vaporizing them is actually part of what it means to live as citizens in a republic. (Once upon a time this was part of civics education.) The choice is co-existence with some degree of mutual respect \u2014 or the politics of resentment and disaffection, the politics of hate and de-humanization.\n\nRight now, it appears an awful lot of people are embracing the politics of hate and de-humanization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Journal of Significant Thought and Opinion", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Commentary Magazine", "description": "If you want an insight into the mindset of a good number of Donald Trump supporters, you simply need to listen to them.
