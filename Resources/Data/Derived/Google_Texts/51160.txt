It was a year for "twerking," "selfies," and "cronuts" in Internet searching, right up there with Hollywood, pop and reality stars.



Web users also were interested in subjects ranging from the "Zombie Apocalypse" to the troubled rollout of Obamacare, according to an annual review by Yahoo released Tuesday.



For Americans, Miley Cyrus was the top search query on Yahoo inspired by the pop star's go at the butt-shaking dance called twerking.



Yahoo's 2013 year in review released Tuesday said Cyrus dethroned reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who dropped to number two despite her highly publicized pregnancy, divorce and engagement.



Yahoo said swimsuit model Kate Upton was number three, followed by the online gaming phenomenon Minecraft. Next was actress-singer Selena Gomez, and sixth was the troubled rollout of President Barack Obama's health care plan, or Obamacare.



Some other popular items, Yahoo said, were searches related to the "Zombie Apocalypse," and the new $100 bill. Twerking was among the popular "Web obsessions," according to a Yahoo statement, along with "selfies," or self-directed photos captured on a smartphone.
