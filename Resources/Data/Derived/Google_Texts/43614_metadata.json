Rick Scott sat down with Channel 9, Charlie Crist did the same, giving investigative reporter Christopher Heath a one-on-one interview. The former Florida governor told Heath that he plans to run on his record and challenges to do the same. Crist was in town to speak at a conference for state business leaders, known as the Council of 100, but at the last minute his speech was canceled. The group will not say why it canceled Crist. Crist told Heath it was the Scott campaign that forced the cancellation. \"What do you make of the decision by the Council of 100?\" Heath asked Crist. \"You mean disinviting me to speak? I think it's kind of silly,\" said Crist. Silly perhaps, but the sudden snub of the former governor is the perhaps the best indication yet of how this race is shaping up with less than six months to go. \"I think that my fellow Floridians deserve to hear the truth,\" Crist said. Crist, a former Republican, defended his decision to switch to the Democratic Party, and his decision not to debate his Democratic primary opponent Nan Rich. \"My opponent is Rick Scott, and Chris, if I take my eye off that for one moment I'm doing the voters a disservice. He obviously thinks I'm his opponent,\" said Crist. In March and April, the Scott camp spent $6.5 million on ads, including an ad attacking Charlie Crist and his record as governor. That record includes high state-wide unemployment and budget shortfalls. \"We went through a difficult time -- a global economic meltdown -- and yet we got through it, and frankly the economy was already starting to come back at the end of my term,\" said Crist. Crist went on to say that he continues to back the Affordable Care Act, even calling out Scott for again failing to expand Medicaid, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without coverage, and billions of federal dollars that instead are going to other states", "article_metadata": {"description": "One day after his opponent Gov.
