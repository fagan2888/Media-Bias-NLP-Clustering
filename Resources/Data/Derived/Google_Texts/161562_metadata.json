Johnston went 58-37-15 during his brief stint with Pittsburgh.\n\nMike Sullivan, who was head coach of the Boston Bruins from 2003-06 and was serving as the coach of the Penguins\u2019 affiliate in the American Hockey League, replaced Johnston. Sullivan will run his first practice with the Penguins on Sunday. Pittsburgh hosts Washington on Monday night.\n\nPittsburgh fell to Los Angeles in a shootout on Friday to drop to 15-10-3 and in fifth place in the Metropolitan. Perhaps even more troubling than the uneven performances has been an inability to find the net. The Penguins rank 28th in scoring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not far from the top of the division, but we\u2019re not far from the bottom either,\u201d general manager Jim Rutherford said. It\u2019s bothered me, but I felt it was necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins hope Sullivan\u2019s arrival gives the team a needed spark. Sullivan went 70-56-15 in two years with the Boston Bruins and spent most of the past decade bouncing around as an assistant coach. He spent the 2014-15 season as player development coach for the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nPittsburgh will retain assistant coach Rick Tocchet. Jacques Martin, who had been serving as a special assistant to Johnston, will move down to the bench alongside Sullivan.\n\n\u201cI wanted somebody new to come in that the players aren\u2019t going to totally know,\u201d Rutherford said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pittsburgh Penguins ax Mike Johnston after 18 months", "title": "Pittsburgh Penguins ax Mike Johnston after 18 months", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/pittsburgh-penguins-ax-mike-johnston-after-18-months/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Mike-Johnstonp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Mike-Johnstonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T21:42:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:43:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The Pittsburgh Penguins hired Mike Johnston in summer 2014 and tasked him with guiding the star-laden roster back to the NHL\u2019s elite.\nJohnston went 58-37-15 during his brief stint with Pittsburgh.\nJacques Martin, who had been serving as a special assistant to Johnston, will move down to the bench alongside Sullivan.\nSullivan went 70-56-15 in two years with the Boston Bruins and spent most of the past decade bouncing around as an assistant coach.\nThe Penguins fired Johnston and assistant Gary Agnew on Saturday with the high-profile team languishing in the middle of the pack in the crowded Metropolitan Division."}
