Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday rejected President Barack Obama’s criticism that he failed to offer “viable alternatives” to the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, telling reporters upon his return to Israel that he was encouraged by the responses he got from U.S. lawmakers in both parties.

“I proposed a practical alternative that through tougher restrictions would extend the breakout time, by years, that it would take Iran to reach a nuclear weapon if it decides to breach the agreement,” the prime minister said, according to The Associated Press.

The prime minister told reporters that he got a good bipartisan impression at the U.S. Capitol.

“I got the impression that they better understand that the current proposal would lead to a bad deal and that the alternative is a better deal,” he said.

Netanyahu’s statement followed remarks from the president that dismissed the speech as “nothing new.”

“Nothing else comes close” to the current talks with Iran, Obama said Tuesday. “Sanctions won’t do it. Military action would not be as successful as the deal that we have put forward.”
