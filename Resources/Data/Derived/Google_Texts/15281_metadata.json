You do not want to miss it!\n\nAs a special project, Gilroy took some additional footage and re-edited and crafted seven short films, then distributed them to some of his favorite musicians. They had the freedom to shape a soundtrack for the clip, and the resulting collaborations take the movie in mind-bending and shape-shifting new directions.\n\nWe\u2019ll roll these out \u2014 along with interviews with the musicians \u2014 all this week, beginning with this clip, scored by the terrific singer Mark Mulcahy, whose album \u201cDear Mark J. Mulcahy, I Love You\u201d was one of our very favorites of last year.\n\nWe talked with Mulcahy about the collaboration last week. You can watch it above.\n\nSo how did you get started, and hit upon this approach? The music you did really creates a wild chase scene, in the way the edit and the footage and the drums work together. It builds this really distinct mood that complements the film, but has its own real feel.\n\nWell, first of all I watched the movie. It was nice to know about the movie \u2014 to me, this clip feels like a small version of the movie. When I watched what Tom gave me \u2014 the boy\u2019s around, and then he\u2019s on the run \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really have an ending. But the movie doesn\u2019t have a particular ending in a way, either. I felt like I had a leg up on it, in a weird way. It wasn\u2019t just landscapes, which some of them are.\n\nI wanted something with (the boy) in it. It was weird, a weird thing to have an opinion about, and I don\u2019t know why I had an opinion on it. I don\u2019t know what I want, but here\u2019s what I want. I had the clip and watched it a bunch of times. I probably did three different versions of it. I did it on Garage Band; if you were to look on that, there\u2019s 40 tracks and most of them are turned off. I just kind of came to this one. It\u2019s kind of an instinctual thing.\n\nWhat\u2019s the hardest part about having to compose for a film, as opposed to just a song of your own?\n\nI haven\u2019t done a ton of it, but certainly working on \u201cPete and Pete,\u201d and working with Tom before and on some other small things \u2014 a lot of the times if someone asks you to do something, you have some kind of rapport already. I just go with my instincts. Hopefully if I think it\u2019s working, he will too. So when I sent it to him, I said, \u201cI hope this is the right thing. Because it could be anything and everything. If you hate it, I\u2019ll do another one.\u201d But he said, \u201cHate it? I love it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The acclaimed musician adds the soundtrack to a clip from the new Lili Taylor film -- and you can only hear it here VIDEO", "author": "David Daley", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The acclaimed musician adds the soundtrack to a clip from the new Lili Taylor film -- and you can only hear it here VIDEO", "title": "Mark Mulcahy & \u201cThe Cold Lands\u201d: Exclusive new music from a visionary songwriter and film", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/mark_mulcahy_the_cold_lands_exclusive_new_music_from_a_visionary_songwriter_and_film/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/cold_lands_mark_mulcahy2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The acclaimed musician adds the soundtrack to a clip from the new Lili Taylor film -- and you can only hear it here VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/cold_lands_mark_mulcahy2.jpg", "title": "Mark Mulcahy & \u201cThe Cold Lands\u201d: Exclusive new music from a visionary songwriter and film", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mark Mulcahy & \u201cThe Cold Lands\u201d: Exclusive new music from a visionary songwriter and film", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adventures of Pete and Pete, Cold Lands, Mark Mulcahy, Music, Spring Forward, Tom Gilroy, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a4f\"", "article_summary": "I felt like I had a leg up on it, in a weird way.\nIt was weird, a weird thing to have an opinion about, and I don\u2019t know why I had an opinion on it.\nIt was nice to know about the movie \u2014 to me, this clip feels like a small version of the movie.\nWhat\u2019s the hardest part about having to compose for a film, as opposed to just a song of your own?\nThe music you did really creates a wild chase scene, in the way the edit and the footage and the drums work together."}
