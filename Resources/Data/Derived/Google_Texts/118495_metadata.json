Well, Smackdown Tuesday went more or less as expected: a big night for Trump and Clinton, with both of them moving closer to becoming the nominees. It\u2019s not a done deal yet, though, on the Republican side, where some still hope for an open convention. Taking this idea head on, Trump told CNN that in that scenario, if he lost, \u201cI think you\u2019d have riots. I\u2019m representing a tremendous \u2014 many, many millions of people.\u201d\n\nGail Collins: Yeah, talk about good times. When did we last have a political leader who promised his party there would be blood on the streets if he didn\u2019t get his way?\n\nArthur: Probably about five minutes ago, somewhere in the world. The funniest thing I\u2019ve seen recently is the Saturday Night Live opener from a couple of weeks ago. Hillary was speaking at a victory party, and said, \u201cTo all of you voters who always said, \u2018I hate Hillary, I could never vote for her,\u2019 I say to you, \u2018Welcome!\u2019 \u201d\n\nGail: Could that possibly, in any way, reflect your own current mood? So many of the things Bernie Democrats find off-putting in Clinton are qualities the Republican mainstream loves. On foreign affairs, she\u2019s been an interventionist. And then there are her pals on Wall Street.\n\nArthur: It\u2019s certainly true that Clinton is closer to mainstream Republicans than Sanders is, but let\u2019s not get carried away \u2014 many of her views are deeply at odds with core conservative beliefs. (If only she\u2019d hung onto her youth as a self-professed \u201cGoldwater Girl.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThanks to my nonpartisan day job, I won\u2019t bite on your fair question about my own mood. I will say, though, that I\u2019ve found conservative leaders on all sides of that question. What I always try to remind people is that the need for deep thinking and good ideas won\u2019t change, no matter what. Politics is like the weather; ideas are like the climate. Confusing them is a common but bad mistake. The struggle for ideas that bring freedom and opportunity to more people \u2014 especially people at the periphery of society \u2014 has to go on no matter what\u2019s going on in politics.\n\nGail: Noble sentiments.\n\nArthur: Thank you. I come from nobility \u2014 the House of Riffraff.\n\nGail: There\u2019s a difference between the candidate you want and the one you would support if the other side was appalling. Let\u2019s take the all-critical issue of economics. I can imagine voting for someone whose spending priorities were different from mine. But I find it hard to imagine voting for anyone whose tax plan involved less burden for the wealthy. And don\u2019t try to tell me you\u2019re going to make it up by cutting fraud and waste.\n\nArthur: Correct \u2014 simply cutting fraud and waste won\u2019t do it, although God knows there\u2019s a lot of waste. If conservatives want a smaller tax burden and lower deficits, the only answer is less spending. Long-term, reforming entitlements would have to play a central role. Yet the most likely Republican nominee at this point is actually opposed to conservative entitlement reform.\n\nThe cognitive dissonance isn\u2019t just on the Republican side, however. Sanders proposes showering cash out of helicopters, and as far as I can tell, he is really only proposing higher taxes on the much-regretted billionaires. The truth is that middle-class taxes would have to rise under his spending scenarios.\n\nGail: Let\u2019s talk about Hillary Clinton. I presume you\u2019re not thrilled with her sudden opposition to the Pacific trade agreement. Her explanation was pretty well-constructed, but I nevertheless acknowledge this was a political dive.\n\nHowever, looking at the big picture, her economic program is far, far and away the most responsible of all the remaining presidential candidates.\n\nArthur: Clinton\u2019s convenient turnabout on trade was a total union cave \u2014 but no worse than what so many conservative Republicans did when they turned against trade promotion authority to spite President Obama, who admirably supported it.\n\nGail: I love it when we come together in bipartisan agreement that everybody is in the tank.\n\nArthur: Yeah, people sometimes say we have the \u201cstupid party\u201d and the \u201cevil party,\u201d but in times of crisis they can really come together to be both stupid and evil.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for Clinton\u2019s economic program, there aren\u2019t any shocking surprises: tax cuts for some working families, more spending on infrastructure and research, a higher minimum wage, and so on. Obviously I would do many things differently, like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to better assist childless workers instead of hiking the minimum wage. But that\u2019s no surprise.\n\nAccording to one analysis by the Tax Foundation, a D.C. research outfit, Clinton\u2019s tax plan could raise far less new revenue than projected because parts of it could drag down growth and depress economic output. And some proposals, like hiking capital gains taxes, would more likely bring about a surge in legal tax avoidance than some new, fair utopia. A bunch of these policies sound good to populist left-wing audiences, but would do real damage in practice.\n\nGail: I don\u2019t want to sound like a total simpleton, but you could just change the rules and block that \u201clegal tax avoidance\u201d you\u2019re worrying over. Give me an example of something about her plan that really bothers you.\n\nArthur: I wish her healthcare ideas were more centrist, or at least more original. As far as I can tell, her top three priorities are to 1) Keep Obamacare as is, 2) \u201cCrack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable,\u201d and 3) Protect abortion rights with hardly any restrictions whatsoever. This is all just so \u2014 kabuki progressive.\n\nShe has to know that runaway costs are the result of a fundamental lack of market forces operating in health care, not just robber barons ripping us off. Scholars and others on both the left and the right have proposed lots of creative solutions that would better serve Clinton\u2019s own liberal goals than the status quo she insists on defending.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160322032105, "twitter": {"description": "Arthur C.
