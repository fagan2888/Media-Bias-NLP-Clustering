(AP) - Another warm, windy day challenged crews battling numerous wildfires in western Montana and brought more evacuations Saturday.\n\nAbout 20 residences in rural areas south of Libby were told to evacuate Saturday morning because of one of several fires burning in the Kootenai National Forest, fire spokeswoman Jennifer McCully said.\n\nFire managers were asking for more firefighters, but prospects for help were uncertain Saturday afternoon, McCully said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying but the resources are so limited right now,\u201d she said.\n\nElsewhere, the towns of Essex in Flathead County and Heart Butte on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation remain under evacuation orders.\n\nMontana National Guard troops were called in to help fight the fire on the reservation, and more crews are being sought, according to fire spokeswoman Margaret Hangan. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can get,\u201d Hangan said.\n\nA shelter was set up by the Red Cross and the Blackfeet tribe at nearby Browning for evacuees. About 200 people registered at the shelter Saturday, and another 100 people are likely staying nearby with family, said James McNeely, assistant to the Blackfeet tribal chairman.\n\n\u201cOur children are scared,\u201d Heart Butte resident Rebecca Rider, who has lived in the community for all of her 55 years, told the Great Falls Tribune (http://gftrib.com/1LCEhp0). \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nNear Essex, crews were able to make progress on building a fuel break to protect the town, which was ordered evacuated on Thursday. The terrain and weather conditions were too dangerous to have crews directly attack the fire on the ground, fire spokesman Gregg DeNitto said.\n\nDirect firefighting has been limited to dropping water and retardant from the air, he said.\n\nDeNitto said traffic on a major rail line for passenger and cargo trains was running mostly overnight and during the early morning hours when the fire was not as active.\n\nThe rail line is a major route for passenger and cargo trains hauling oil, coal and agricultural products to the Northwest.\n\nFirefighters battling blazes in the Bull Lake area in Lincoln County made progress Saturday, fire spokeswoman Peri Suenram said.\n\nAlthough there was only a small amount of rain in the area, \u201cit certainly helped,\u201d Suenram said. \u201cCloud cover and smoke moderated the weather. It\u2019s really a great day for mopping up.\u201d\n\nA new fire was reported Friday in a remote area about 20 miles northeast of Bozeman.\n\nBesides the Kootenai, fires are burning in the Flathead, Lolo, Custer Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, Helena, Bitterroot and Beaverhead-Deerlodge national forests as well as in Glacier National Park.\n\nA cold front was expected to bring cooler temperatures Sunday but not much precipitation.\n\n\u201cIt will be cooler, but it\u2019s still going to be dry,\u201d Hangan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another warm, windy day challenged crews battling numerous wildfires in western Montana and brought more evacuations Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Another warm, windy day challenged crews battling numerous wildfires in western Montana and brought more evacuations Saturday.", "title": "More wildfire evacuations in western Montana", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/large-part-of-western-central-montana-ripe-for-fir/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/28/0a125dcca42c6c26800f6a706700f816.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/28/0a125dcca42c6c26800f6a706700f816.jpg", "description": "Another warm, windy day challenged crews battling numerous wildfires in western Montana and brought more evacuations Saturday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "More wildfire evacuations in western Montana"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea43\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Another warm, windy day challenged crews battling numerous wildfires in western Montana and brought more evacuations Saturday.\nMontana National Guard troops were called in to help fight the fire on the reservation, and more crews are being sought, according to fire spokeswoman Margaret Hangan.\nFirefighters battling blazes in the Bull Lake area in Lincoln County made progress Saturday, fire spokeswoman Peri Suenram said.\nElsewhere, the towns of Essex in Flathead County and Heart Butte on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation remain under evacuation orders.\nFire managers were asking for more firefighters, but prospects for help were uncertain Saturday afternoon, McCully said."}
