Over the past four years, over three million young Americans have been able to stay on their family plans. And over the past five and a half months alone, more than five million Americans have signed up to buy private health insurance plans on HealthCare.gov \u2013 plans that can no longer discriminate against preexisting conditions or charge you more just because you\u2019re a woman or a cancer survivor \u2013 and millions more have enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nIt is these numbers, and the stories behind each one of them, that will ultimately determine the fate of this law. It is the measurable outcomes \u2013 in savings for families and businesses, healthier kids with better performance in schools, seniors with more money to spend because they\u2019re paying less for their medicine, and young entrepreneurs who\u2019ll have the freedom to try new jobs or chase that new idea \u2013 that will ultimately offer more security and peace of mind to more Americans who work hard to get ahead.\n\nLast month, after her first wellness visit under her new insurance plan, a woman from Colorado shared with me what that peace of mind meant to her. \u201cAfter using my new insurance for the first time, you probably heard my sigh of relief from the White House,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI felt like a human being again. I felt that I had value.\u201d\n\nThis is what\u2019s at stake any time anyone, out of some outdated obsession, pledges to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. And that\u2019s why my administration will spend the fifth year of this law and beyond working to implement and improve on it.\n\nIf you\u2019re an American who wants to get covered \u2013 or if you know someone who should \u2013 it\u2019s now last call for 2014. March 31st is the deadline to get covered this year. So check out HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to see what new choices are available to you, and get covered today.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/23/statement-president-fourth-anniversary-affordable-care-act", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "width": 240, "height": 240}, "title": "Statement by the President on the Fourth Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "Since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law, the share of Americans with insurance is up, and the growth of health care costs is down, to its slowest rate in fifty years \u2013 two of the most", "title": "Statement by the President on the Fourth Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/23/statement-president-fourth-anniversary-affordable-care-act", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2015-07-28T10:52:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-23T09:09:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T10:52:50-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde93f\"", "article_summary": "Over the past four years, over three million young Americans have been able to stay on their family plans.\nI felt that I had value.\u201dThis is what\u2019s at stake any time anyone, out of some outdated obsession, pledges to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act.\nMore Americans without insurance have gained coverage.\nSo check out HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to see what new choices are available to you, and get covered today.\nIt is these numbers, and the stories behind each one of them, that will ultimately determine the fate of this law."}
