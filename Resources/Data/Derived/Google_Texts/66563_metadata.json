He was accompanied at the table by a representative of pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action, which opposes the bill.\n\nPrior to his testimony, Brown wrote on Facebook: \u201cSitting here in the Capital, waiting to testify for open carry. MDA skanks coming outta the woodwork. It\u2019s all good, no collectivist waste of life is gonna steal my bliss today..Got muh Meskins with me, they got my back!\u201d\n\nDuring his testimony, proceeded to go off on an angry rant using his experience in prison to press for open carry.\n\n\u201cI did seventeen and a half years in the worst prisons Texas has to offer, and there is an evil in the world that you cannot describe,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere aren\u2019t the words for it. I\u2019ve at the table and listen to a man brag about killing children. Seems like have the people in this issue are living in some fantasy world of their own creation. They don\u2019t know what walks among them. You don\u2019t know until you\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve sat the table and drank coffee with it. I\u2019ve aten (sic) sandwiches out of the same bowl with it.\u201d\n\nHis voice rising, Brown said, \u201cI will look each one of you in the eye, and I will ask you, \u2018How dare you strip anybody of their right to defend themselves from the unspeakable evil that walks in this world?'\u201d\n\nFollowing the conclusion of testimony from the representative of Moms Demand Action, who said she had no \u201chard evidence\u201d that a loaded firearm deters crime, Brown rose from the table and began yelling at the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any evidence open carry prevents crime and you\u2019ve got a criminal standing in front of you? Ask me!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the evidence, goddam right it prevents crime. What are you people, stupid? How damn dumb you got to be to say something like that, lady?\u201d\n\nFollowing his testimony, Brown admitted on Facebook that he had gone too far, writing: \u201cFuck it, they stole my bliss\u2026\u201d\n\nOn Facebook this morning, Brown addressed Moms Demand Action admitting that, as a convicted felon he can\u2019t carry a weapon, before directing his ire at them once again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the nihilistic slaves of fascism, hell-bent on sacrificing others on the altar of your own mediocrity. You reject reality, while desperately clinging to a destructive neurosis. You are inferiority personified, and the first to bow the knee,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are the waste product of human evolution\u2026and you know it.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below, uploaded to YouTube by CoCo Mars:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/william_brown_facebook-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "WATCH: Ex-con goes off on Texas lawmakers as he demands open-carry: \u2018I\u2019m a criminal, ask me\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t have any evidence open carry prevents crime and you\u2019ve got a criminal standing in front of you?\nPrior to his testimony, Brown wrote on Facebook: \u201cSitting here in the Capital, waiting to testify for open carry.\nWilliam Brown III, who posts on Facebook as Revolution ATX, appeared before the Texas legislative panel testifying in support of an open-carry bill.\nHe was accompanied at the table by a representative of pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action, which opposes the bill.\n\u201cYou are the waste product of human evolution\u2026and you know it.\u201dWatch the video below, uploaded to YouTube by CoCo Mars:"}
