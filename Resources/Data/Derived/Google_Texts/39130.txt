On Pivot’s TakePart Live Wednesday, Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post was asked if she agreed with critics who say President Barack Obama should not be fundraising right now in light of the many conflicts overseas.

“I don’t criticize the president at all for going to Martha’s Vineyard, having a vacation — recharging and refueling,” Huffington said, referring to a leisure trip Obama has scheduled in August. “I’m just sick of the amount of time these politicians spend fundraising. It just really has destroyed our democracy. That’s why they spend so much time with people who can give them money and so little time — actually no time at all, with people who need their help.”

Since Tuesday, Obama has been on the West Coast attending a series of fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee. Republicans have criticized Obama for not stalling his fundraising schedule after a Malaysian commercial airliner was shot down in Ukraine.

The White House has remained on schedule, aside from canceling an appearance by Obama on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Obama returns to Washington, D.C., Thursday afternoon.
