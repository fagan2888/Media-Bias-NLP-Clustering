Z Block, the mixed-use development by McWhinney in Lower Downtown Denver, will include a 170-room hotel operated by Sage Hospitality.

“The hotel at Z Block is a continuation of a very positive relationship between Sage Hospitality and McWhinney,” Sage CEO Walter Isenberg said in a statement. “After the successful redevelopment of Denver Union Station, we are very pleased to work with McWhinney on another signature Denver project.”

Sage, based in Denver, also owns the historic Oxford Hotel, two blocks from Z Block, and the Crawford Hotel in Union Station.

Z Block, at 19th and Wazee streets, will include restaurants, retail shops, office and luxury apartments.

“By further revitalizing LoDo, Colorado is increasingly attractive to new business, workforce and tourism,” McWhinney CEO Chad McWhinney said in a statement.
