Folsom dedicates Johnny Cash bike/pedestrian trail

• Singers daughter sparks enthusiasm • If there is a Zeus of country western music it is Johnny Cash • WITH VIDEO

by Gene Beley, Delta CorrespondentFOLSOMMarch 2, 2014 9:00pmThe groundbreaking for the new $3 million Johnny Cash Trail for bikes and pedestrians began with two lucky breaks: the singer's daughter, Cindy Cash, helped balance off a lot of politician speeches, and the clouds parted from the much needed cloud burst just in time for the event to even see the sun shine on the shovel diggers.

Robert Gross, Folsom parks and recreation director, credited the sunshine lucky break to the Zeus god and added, "If there is a Zeus of country western music, we all know it is Johnny Cash."

Ms. Cash warmed up the crowd immediately, starting with saying she loved the mayor and her new friend, Kerri Howell, and loved the community so much that she wants to buy a small condo and move there. Mr. Gross joked that there were condo developers in the audience that would be glad to sell her one.

Why a Johnny Cash bike trail? Ms. Cash was the first one to admit she doesn't ever remember seeing her father on a bike, but does recall him loving to walk a trail, and would be really excited about this project. Mr. Gross said Folsom is known for gold, trains, the Pony Express, hydroelectric power, and, before that, Native Americans around the American River.

"But on Jan. 13, 1968, history was made again," he said. "Two concerts were performed at Folsom Prison by Johnny Cash. It resulted in a three times Platinum record with Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison. That album and the Folsom Prison Blues song are probably the number one reason why people all over the world know about Folsom, our great little town on the shores of the American River. It is a great way to link Johnny Cash to what the city of Folsom is about today with our history, Folsom Prison, and our great open space network in the city."

This trail may be the only one in the nation that crosses a state prison property. Folsom Prison agreed to it because it will enable their guards to bicycle to work when desired. A new bike-pedestrian concrete bridge over Folsom Lake Crossing is the most expensive part of the project. It will feature Gothic towers to reflect the architecture of Folsom State Prison's west gate built more than 100 years ago. The first phase will be 1.3 miles long and ultimately, 2.5 miles long, Mr. Goss said. The first phase will be finished by late summer or early fall, he added.

"It took me a long time to get here," Ms. Cash told the audience seated on the hill dedication site. "This is the only venue my Dad wouldn't bring me on. I was about 8 years old the first time he came here and I cried all day long, 'I want to go with you.' He just said, "This is a pickin' and grinnin'. You can't come with me today, Honey. It took me about 10 years more before I said, 'I get it. It's all men. No girls allowed.'"

Ms. Cash said she appreciated being invited to be a part of the dedication to represent the Cash family "and to bring the personal side of Dad into this and help choose some of the artwork that may go along the trail that really speaks about him. There are a lot of times things like this happen and they don't get a real image of Dad and the personal side of him. He was a great Dad and a great guy, other than being a great artist."

Behind the scenes, there was a lot of controversy when the present Folsom Crossing Bridge was built and not named in honor of Johnny Cash. Mayor Howell said she was disappointed when the bridge behind this location wasn't named the Johnny Cash Bridge, "but this is as good as it gets for the moment." Mr. Gross joked that the city has now come up with a crossing over the crossing and will refer to it as the "Johnny Cash crossing over the Folsom Lake Crossing."

Assemblyman Beth Gaines and her husband, Senator Ted Gaines, presented a huge, framed resolution from the California Legislature to the city and Ms. Cash. After the ceremony and official groundbreaking, a bevy of politicians with Ms. Cash and her friend, John LaSalle, shovelled the first dirt. Then a Johnny Cash tribute band, The Walking Phoenixes, entertained the guests. Ms. Cash created a happening when she stepped in on the song, Daddy Sang Bass, by adding her voice to "Mama Sang Tenor" lyrics.
