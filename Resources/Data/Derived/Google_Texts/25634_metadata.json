John Hart\n\nIt was the same message across the country on Wednesday: \u201cWe have a lot of visitors on the site right now. Please stay on this page.\u201d But some experts began to worry that Americans used to super-fast Internet speeds would quickly lose their initial interest in signing up for Obamacare.\n\nThe White House says more than 6.1 million people have tried to log on since the online health insurance exchange went live Tuesday morning. What they\u2019re not saying yet, is how many people managed to enroll.\n\nThe new health insurance marketplaces are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019re meant to start getting millions of Americans covered by health insurance for the first time, and to rein in what the federal government calls the worst abuses of the insurance industry.\n\nBut heavy demand turned the federal site into one big traffic jam.\n\n\u201cAmericans successfully enrolled through HealthCare.gov and State-based Marketplaces on Day 1. Volume at HealthCare.gov continues to be high, with 4.7 million unique visits in the first 24 hours, our call center receiving more than 190,000 calls, and more than 104,000 web chats requested,\u201d the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is running the sites, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see similar volume as yesterday, and while this overwhelming interest is continuing to cause wait times, there will be continuing improvements in the coming hours and days.\u201d\n\nThe White House said more capacity was being added, but gave no details.\n\nIn states that opted to run their own sites, many people could enroll with minimal problems, says Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute. She\u2019s spent some time cruising the various sites.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any problem in Colorado, I didn\u2019t have any problems in Rhode Island,\u201d she said. \u201cD.C. was really zipping along. I went really far through there before I realized I was about to make an agreement to buy health insurance,\u201d she added, laughing.\n\n\u201cMaryland we got into in the afternoon but it was really pretty poky.\u201d\n\nFor people living in 36 states, the federal website was the only option. Those states have left the exchanges to the federal government to run, and customers were immediately funneled into a logjam. The wait messages were still there Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPeople may not put up with this for long, warns Ceci Connolly of the PwC Health Research Institute.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are accustomed to going to an online website the same way they shop for shoes and coffee and books and music. Now they think they can do that for healthcare,\u201d Connolly said.\n\n\u201cThey are not going to tolerate not being able to make their purchases. This is retail come to healthcare and it is a big, big task.\u201d\n\nCMS spokesperson Alicia Hartinger says it\u2019s not time to worry yet.\n\n\u201cPeople are successfully completing the entire process,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that choosing a plan is a thoughtful decision and people will want to do some research and talk their friends or families to make the best decision for them. For some people, this is the first time they\u2019ve had access to coverage and they\u2019re going to want to shop, compare and in some instances come back in order to make the most informed choice to fit their needs and budget. Many people have waited years, or even decades, for this coverage and they are not discouraged by website slowdowns.\u201d\n\nThe federal government says it\u2019s only just getting started with trying to reach people to tell them they can start signing up. People have until Dec. 15 to enroll online for coverage that will start on Jan. 1. They have until the end of March to sign up for 2014.\n\nThe administration is enlisting celebrities from Pearl Jam (2.2 million Twitter followers) to comedian Sarah Silverman (4.7 million followers) to help get out the word. Both were Tweeting on Wednesday. \u201cIf you want to make sense of the whole healthcare thing, or just want to #GetCovered, check out healthcare.gov. #KnowYourOptions,\u201d @PearlJam tweeted.\n\nNews media are helping for free, encouraged by the political fight in Washington. Republicans in the House of Representatives are refusing to pass legislation to fund the federal government, and have forced a shutdown. They\u2019re demanding various concessions on the Affordable Care Act, all of which President Barack Obama says he\u2019ll veto and which the Democratic-controlled Senate has refused to consider.\n\nThe administration has made lemonade out of the online glitches, saying that there is clearly pent-up demand. Connolly agrees but says the tone from the White House may eventually change.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am waiting for the messages around the individual mandate,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far all of the messaging been to say to people, \u2018This now is going to be available to you \u2014 why don\u2019t you check it out\u2019. At a certain point it will pivot to \u2018Come Jan. 1 there is a requirement that virtually every American carry health insurance.\u2019 That may be a different kind of motivator.\u201d\n\nTom Costello contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was the same message across the country on Wednesday: \u201cWe have a lot of visitors on the site right now.
