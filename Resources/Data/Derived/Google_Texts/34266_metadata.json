The members had been called by the Republican leadership to open just one slice of the government without authorizing funds for the Affordable Care Act, a partial solution that had rallied Democrats in opposition. As dusk settled in, I lingered to interview the representatives as they walked in and out of what everyone considered at this point to be a scene of political theater.\n\nWhile I waited, a small crowd gathered, composed of men and women in business attire, creating something of a receiving line where they could exchange pleasantries with members of Congress as the latter made their way from their offices across Independence Avenue to cast a perfunctory vote. The city, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers sent home from the job, was far from dead. On Capitol Hill, the real financial engine of Washington, the selling of access and policy hummed along at full speed, and I was in the midst of it.\n\nMany of the people assembled around me, I noticed, were former lawmakers and their associates. Former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle was there, along with officials from his firm DLA Piper, to escort a group of international attorneys into a meeting with lawmakers. Men who said they were with Alston & Bird, another law firm heavily involved in lobbying, convened a few feet away. A cluster of businessmen with the credit-rating firm Experian prepped their own series of meetings with congressional staff.\n\nBehind me, I heard the distinctive croak of Zach Wamp, a former congressman who was busy talking up his new job to current members of Congress. He boasted that he is now working for Palantir, the controversial intelligence contractor. \"I'm kind of overseeing their operations up here,\" Wamp said when I asked what he does for Palantir. He ended the conversation abruptly when questioned about the scandals associated with the firm, which include allegations of spying on activists and other privacy violations.\n\nI returned to a computer later that day and pulled up the lobbyist-registration database to run the few names I had managed to write down. In theory, lobbyists are required to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) to give the public some idea about who is attempting to influence the laws and regulations that govern us. To my surprise, however, Wamp and most of the others were nowhere to be found. (Palantir\u2019s corporate counsel, Matt Long, would not comment on what Wamp does for the company.)\n\nDaschle, a \"policy adviser\" to a range of corporate interests and a close confidant of many top Democrats, has become one of the most famous unregistered lobbyists in the city. In fact, his escapades as a consigliere and go-between for business leaders and politicians, including President Obama, are so well known that among ethics watchdogs, the technicality in the law that allows lobbyists to evade registration has become known as the \"Daschle Loophole.\"\n\nOn paper, the lobbying industry is quickly disappearing. In January, records indicated that for a third straight year, overall spending on lobbying decreased. Lobbyists themselves continue to deregister. In 2013, the number of registered lobbyists dipped to 12,281, the lowest number on file since 2002.\n\nBut experts say that lobbying isn't dying; instead, it's simply going underground. The problem, says American University professor James Thurber, who has studied congressional lobbying for more than thirty years, is that \"most of what is going on in Washington is not covered\" by the lobbyist-registration system. Thurber, who is currently advising the American Bar Association's lobbying-reform task force, adds that his research suggests the true number of working lobbyists is closer to 100,000.\n\nA loophole-ridden law, poor enforcement, the development of increasingly sophisticated strategies that enlist third-party validators and create faux-grassroots campaigns, along with an Obama administration executive order that gave many in the profession a disincentive to register \u2014 all of these forces have combined to produce a near-total collapse of the system that was designed to keep tabs on federal lobbying.\n\nWhile the official figure puts the annual spending on lobbying at $3.2 billion in 2013, Thurber estimates that the industry brings in more than $9 billion a year. Other experts have made similar estimates, but no one is sure how large the industry has become. Lee Drutman, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation, says that at least twice as much is spent on lobbying as is officially reported.\n\nTrade association documents, bankruptcy filings and reports from political consulting firms reviewed by The Nation show that many of America's largest corporations have spent much more on lobbying than they've officially disclosed. In some cases, the quarterly registration system, used by the public and journalists, shows only one-tenth of the amount that firms spend to win favorable treatment by the federal government.\n\nThis explosion in spending on lobbying activities may not be visible in the lobbyist-registration system, but it is evident in Washington. The growth of the influence industry has created a new generation of millionaires while reshaping the region in its wake. The District of Columbia skyline, once dominated by monuments, is now dotted with cranes building some $5.5 billion in new development. The 14th Street and H Street corridors, formerly gritty sections of the city, are lined with more than forty new bars and restaurants. Census figures show that four of the five wealthiest counties in the country are now DC suburbs. In one of those counties \u2014 Fairfax \u2014 high-end carmakers Tesla and Aston Martin have opened new operations to keep up with demand.\n\nThe new captains of the influence-peddling industry lobby openly and with no interest in registration, reaping huge financial rewards. Tim Pawlenty, in his first two months as head of a lobbying association for financial companies that include Barclays and Wells Fargo, made more than double his annual $120,000 salary as governor of Minnesota. The self-described \"Sam's Club Republican\" earns over $1.8 million a year working largely on banking regulations. He is not a registered lobbyist.\n\nChris Dodd, the former Democratic presidential candidate who pledged not to become a lobbyist once he retired from the Senate in 2010, made $3.3 million in his second year as chief of the movie industry lobby. (Dodd's salary increased as he led the Motion Picture Association of America through a failed effort to pass an intellectual-property bill called the Stop Online Piracy Act, better known as SOPA.) Technically, however, Dodd hasn't broken his pledge: though he seeks to win policy victories for his Hollywood-based members, he is not registered as a lobbyist.\n\nRather than using the L-word to describe what they do, many lobbyists prefer the more banal rubric of \"government relations\" or \"government affairs.\" Reflecting this trend, the American League of Lobbyists \u2014 a professional association for the industry \u2014 changed its name in November to the Association of Government Relations Professionals. And while lobbyists must report their payments from clients, those ducking the system quietly bring in the biggest paydays.\n\nApple's former vice president of \"worldwide government affairs,\" Catherine Novelli, earned over $7.5 million last year while helping the company deal with congressional inquiries about its alleged tax-dodging strategies, without registering as a lobbyist. Deborah Lee James, until recently the vice president for government affairs at SAIC, a major defense contractor, earned nearly $1 million in 2013 despite also being unregistered. Luxury magazines such as the Washingtonian and Washington Life are filled with the latest displays of affluence by the district\u2019s nonlobbying lobbyists. BP's head of public affairs \u2014 another euphemism for influence peddling popular among unregistered lobbyists \u2014 recently spent $1.7 million for a six-bedroom house in the tony neighborhood of Spring Valley. Earlier this year, an executive from the Albright Stonebridge Group, a government-relations firm that influences policy on behalf of corporate interests without being registered under the LDA, shelled out $4.2 million for a home in Georgetown.\n\nTags: 401c3, dark money, investigative journalism, investigative reporting, lobbyists, money in politics, shadow lobbying, trade associations", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "investigate, investigative, fund, funding, support, research, journalism, reporting, mainstream, media, social, impact", "medium": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda70e\"", "article_summary": "Tags: 401c3, dark money, investigative journalism, investigative reporting, lobbyists, money in politics, shadow lobbying, trade associations\nOn paper, the lobbying industry is quickly disappearing.\nLee Drutman, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation, says that at least twice as much is spent on lobbying as is officially reported.\nMen who said they were with Alston & Bird, another law firm heavily involved in lobbying, convened a few feet away.\nIn 2013, the number of registered lobbyists dipped to 12,281, the lowest number on file since 2002."}
