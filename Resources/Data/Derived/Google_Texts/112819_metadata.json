Six executions have been carried out so far this year.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Indonesia had notified her government the execution of the two Australian men would be \"scheduled imminently\".\n\n\"Nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young Australians are executed,\" she said in a statement, urging clemency and that legal challenges still outstanding should be heard.\n\nA temporary reprieve was granted to the French citizen, Serge Atlaoui, who will not be in the next round of executions, a French embassy official said on Saturday. It was not clear why his execution was postponed.\n\n\"We remain extremely cautious. Everything can change from one day to the next,\" said Richard Sedillot, Atlaoui's lawyer.\n\n\"I am torn between an extreme sadness to learn that other (people) condemned could be executed and the relief to learn that the man I was defending for eight years could at this stage be spared.\"\n\nMarches in support of Atlaoui were due to take place in Paris and in Metz, eastern France, his home town.\n\nFrance has told Indonesia the executions could damage relations, while Australia has pleaded repeatedly for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran.\n\n\"I again respectfully call on the president of Indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency. It is not too late for a change of heart,\" Bishop said.\n\nOutside the maximum-security prison, an Australian diplomat and a lawyer for the two men showed a self-portrait painted by Sukumaran to reporters. On the back was written: \"The 72 hours just started.\"\n\nThe members of the Bali Nine were arrested at the main airport on the holiday island of Bali for trying to smuggle 8 kg (18 lb) of heroin to Australia. The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia.\n\n(Reporting by Randy Fabi and Fergus Jensen in JAKARTA, Dominique Vidalon and Marine Pennnetier in PARIS, and Christopher McCall in SYDNEY; Writing by John Chalmers)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CILACAP, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia has informed two Australians, one Nigerian an", "title": "Indonesia informs death row convicts execution just days away", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/25/French-convict-not-next-round-Indonesia-executions-embassy-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-executions_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/25/French-convict-not-next-round-Indonesia-executions-embassy-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-executions_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CILACAP, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia has informed two Australians, one Nigerian an", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d36\"", "article_summary": "CILACAP, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia has informed two Australians, one Nigerian and four other death-row drug convicts that they will be executed in a matter of days, possibly as soon as Tuesday.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Indonesia had notified her government the execution of the two Australian men would be \"scheduled imminently\".\nFrance has told Indonesia the executions could damage relations, while Australia has pleaded repeatedly for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran.\nAndrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, two Australians arrested as ringleaders of the 'Bali Nine' drug-smuggling group, were among the seven, lawyers said.\nThe seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia."}
