Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) took a symbolic stand against big government spending in voting against the recent omnibus bill\u2013despite the fact that one of his own amendments was included in it.\n\nThe bill passed easily, \u201c316-113, with 150 Republicans voting yes and 166 Democrats voting yes\u201d\u2013meaning that Rohrabacher\u2019s gesture of opposition may have been just that.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn a message explaining why he voted against the \u201ctrillion dollar fiasco,\u201d Rohrabacher\u2013one of 112 who voted against the bill\u2013listed and explained why he voted against the bill.\n\nThose reasons included: Huge spending increases, national security loopholes, government attack on internet freedom, funds illegal immigration, quadruples H-2B foreign worker visas, funds IMF bailouts, government control over all waters in the U.S. and a delay of the Obamacare \u201ccadillac tax.\u201d\n\nOne of the amendments to the gargantuan bill was co-authored by Rohrabacher and Rep. San Farr (D-CA) of Carmel. That amendment would maintain that the federal government would not prosecute medical marijuana use and sales that fall within an individual state\u2019s law. A similar amendment passed in the 2014 omnibus bill.\n\nRohrabacher told the Orange County Register, \u201cIf Congress wanted to address even a few of the major challenges America faces, this was the time and legislative vehicle to do it.\u201d He continued, \u201cInstead, we chose the path of least resistance and let our economic and security concerns fester yet another year.\u201d\n\nFellow Orange County Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) of Laguna Beach voted for the bill asserting that it represented \u201cresponsible spending.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Orange County's Rep.
