That is one of the reasons many policymakers hoped the slowdown in healthcare costs would bring some relief.\n\nOverall healthcare spending in the U.S. has risen at the slowest pace on record in recent years.\n\nThe Center for American Progress report, provided exclusively to the Los Angeles Times, offers additional evidence this slowdown is not helping workers, however.\n\nResearchers analyzed national survey data from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that measure how much employers and employees pay for health plans that workers get through their jobs.\n\nThey also looked at data gathered from major health plans by the Health Care Cost Institute on how much employees pay in co-pays, deductibles and other out-of-pocket health spending.\n\nEmployers still pick up the lion's share of workers' health costs, paying more than two-thirds of the average worker's insurance premium in 2013, or $7,238, according to the report.\n\nBut the employer share is shrinking.\n\nAt the same time, workers' out-of-pocket costs are rising as employers boost deductibles and co-pays in the health plans they offer.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2013, the average worker's annual out-of-pocket medical spending rose to $800 from $665, researchers found.\n\nThis trend is particularly troublesome at a time when paychecks are stagnating, said Topher Spiro, the center's vice president for health policy and lead author of the report. \"This issue is critically important to address the squeeze middle-class families are facing,\" he said in an interview.\n\nThe report suggests three potential responses. These include: requiring employers to more clearly tell employees how costs are rising in their health plans; mandating that employers return some savings to workers if employers' costs rise more slowly than overall healthcare costs; and expanding employees' access to primary care visits that are not subject to cost-sharing.\n\nSpiro acknowledged that large employers and major employer groups are unlikely to back any additional requirements.\n\nBut he said that increased focus on the issue may put pressure on employers, just as sustained calls to raise the minimum wage may have influenced decisions by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other businesses to boost pay.\n\n\"This is an issue that needs to be on the table,\" Spiro said.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Employees not benefiting from slower growth in healthcare costs", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "American workers already struggling with stagnant wages are being saddled with higher medical bills even as employers reap the benefits of a sustained slowdown in the growth of healthcare costs, a new report indicates.", "title": "Employees not benefiting from slower growth in healthcare costs", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0303-healthcare-employee-costs-20150303-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54f51f79/turbine/la-fi-0303-healthcare-employee-costs-20150303", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare costs, Center for American Progress, health system, insurance premium", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82956818", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-02", "Description": "American workers already struggling with stagnant wages are being saddled with higher medical bills even as employers reap the benefits of a sustained slowdown in the growth of healthcare costs, a new report indicates.
