Election results: All the numbers for all the races

All five Sarasota County Hospital Board incumbents up for re-election held onto their seats Tuesday, in a primary marked by an unusual number of challengers for this low-profile, unpaid office.

Because all candidates were Republican, the race was decided in the primary, and voting was open to everyone. Board members represent specific districts, but are elected countywide.

In Seat 2 of the Central District, retired utility executive Joseph J. DeVirgilio Jr. — who was appointed to the board by fellow members in May 2013 — was elected to his first full term, defeating Michael A. Sutphin, a former security guard for the hospital.

Richard C. Merritt, on the board for seven years, was returned to Seat 1 of the Northern District. His challenger was Stefan Butz, a hearing aid specialist who has served on the Sarasota County Charter Review Board since 1996.

Robert K. Strasser, a board member since 1994, successfully defended Seat 2 in the Northern District against John “Jack” Brill, a sales executive who is active in the local Republican Party.

Darryl W. Henry, elected to the hospital board in 2010, won a second term in Seat 1 of the Southern District against former North Port City Commissioner David Garofalo, who said he sought the position as a way of returning to public service after a re-election defeat in 2012.

In the race for Seat 2 of the Southern District, Gregory A. Carter — on the board since 2002 — defeated challenger Lydia Tower, a registered nurse, in the closest race of the night.

The nine board members oversee a $540 million budget for the public health care system, with just over $40 million of that coming from county property taxes. The other four seats will come up for election in 2016.

This year, the five incumbents ran on a nearly nine-year record of financial stability and steady expansion. In July, the board unanimously promoted David Verinder as the health system’s new CEO.
