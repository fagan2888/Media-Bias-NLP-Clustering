At-home disease monitoring\n\nBest for: Chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, heart failure\n\nHow it works: \"Patients don't live in a doctor's office. They must manage their care at home,\" says Monica Peek, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. There are a couple of ways to do that. One: with devices that hook up to your smartphone and allow you to measure your blood pressure, heart rate or blood-sugar levels at any time. Another: through automated text message-based programs that send alerts to your phone reminding you to take medication, get 30 minutes of exercise or check your blood sugar.\n\nStudies show both methods help patients control their disease better than trying to do it on their own. A 2014 study found a six-month diabetes coaching program helped lower patients' glucose levels. What's more, 73 percent of patients reported being satisfied with the program, which saved $812 in health care costs per patient from fewer doctor and ER visits.\n\nExamples: Self-monitoring devices such as Withings Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor and AliveCor Heart Monitor; education programs such as CareSmarts (mhealth-solutions.com)\n\nBeware: These devices are expensive \u2014 they can cost over $100 \u2014 and are usually not covered by insurance.", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "Division1": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "page_title": "High-Tech Ways to Stay Healthy", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-12-16T21:56:49.863-05:00", "keywords": "high tech, crowdsourcing, health apps, stay healthy, smartphone apps, videoconferencing, fitness devices, telestroke, medical options", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Jessica Migala", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_bulletin_today", "type": "info", "description": "From smartphone apps to virtual doctors, technology has opened up a whole new world of medical options.
