PARIS (AP) — French President Francois Hollande and other dignitaries are holding a special ceremony to honor all those killed in Islamic extremist attacks around Paris in 2015 — a year when the European way of life was targeted time and again with deadly consequences.

Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo unveiled a plaque Sunday in memory of victims targeted at newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market, a rock concert, cafes, a stadium and elsewhere.

The ceremony took place at Place de la Republique, a plaza that has become a symbol of Parisians’ solidarity since the attacks, which began Jan. 7, 2015.

French rocker and national icon Johnny Hallyday is joining the army choir in a special, somber musical performance.

The attacks left some 150 victims dead, and several attackers were also killed.
