She buckled under stress. Voices hounded her through the night until she could no longer sleep at all.\n\nAfter that came thoughts of suicide \u2014 persistent thoughts that would not give way, even when he told her that he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. She asked if people who killed themselves were denied funerals. She begged him to let her die.\n\nShe was put on meds.\n\n\u201cThe medicine combated the psychosis by slowing everything down: her metabolism, movements, and response time,\u201d Lukach wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 2011. \u201cI didn\u2019t like what the medicine did to her, but I liked even less what her unmedicated self was like and capable of doing, so I gave her the medicine.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, he decided to share his and Giulia\u2019s struggle with psychiatric disease at a TEDx event in Monterey, Calif. The talk offers a glimpse into the daily lives of countless sufferers of mental illness and those closest to them. It also addresses the question many asked him during the most difficult times: Why did he stay?\n\n\"First off ... I love my wife, I love her a lot,\" Lukach says in the video. \"The second reason I stuck around is because of this commitment to the idea of commitment itself.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mark lukach, mental illness, psychiatric disease, suicide, bipolar disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mark Lukach's TEDx Talk reveals the everyday reality of mental illness.", "title": "Man Talks About His Wife's Struggle With Mental Illness [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mark-lukach-discusses-his-wifes-struggle-mental-illness-tedx-event-video-271805", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/mental-illness.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mark Lukach's TEDx Talk reveals the everyday reality of mental illness.", "title": "Man Talks About His Wife's Struggle With Mental Illness [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mark-lukach-discusses-his-wifes-struggle-mental-illness-tedx-event-video-271805", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/mental-illness.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/mental-illness.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-21T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T11:20:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mark Lukach's TEDx Talk reveals the everyday reality of mental illness."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27a7\"", "article_summary": "I love my wife, I love her a lot,\" Lukach says in the video.\n\u201cThe medicine combated the psychosis by slowing everything down: her metabolism, movements, and response time,\u201d Lukach wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 2011.\nThe talk offers a glimpse into the daily lives of countless sufferers of mental illness and those closest to them.\n\"The second reason I stuck around is because of this commitment to the idea of commitment itself.\"\nIt began without warning in 2009: His wife of three years, Giulia, suffered a psychotic break and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder."}
