Their conduct will continue to reflect the values of the organization and of the Greek community.\"\n\nPhi Kappa Tau, founded in Boulder in 1924, was the fourth Boulder fraternity to close after the 2004 drinking death of freshman pledge Lynn \"Gordie\" Bailey Jr. In October 2005, the fraternity's national office revoked the local charter because of conduct violations and all members living in the house at 1150 College Ave. at the time were forced to move out.\n\nBoulder's fraternities cut ties with the university following Bailey's death because they refused to hire live-in advisers and delay recruitment until spring semester.\n\nPhi Kappa Tau national officials would not say in 2005 why the fraternity's charter was revoked, but said they were investigating safety concerns and violations to the fraternity's risk-management policy.\n\nThe fraternity closed shortly after several underage women were hospitalized after for alcohol-related problems after attending parties at Phi Kappa Tau and another fraternity, Sigma Pi.\n\nIn 2010, the fraternity began the rebuilding process by forming an interest group approved by the Interfraternity Council, an off-campus organization that's not affiliated with the university but recruits CU students.\n\nNow-senior and chapter president Zach Eiten was one of the first Phi Kappa Tau interest group members as a freshman. He said the men in the Boulder chapter today are \"complete, 180-degree opposites\" from the men in the fraternity in 2005.\n\n\"In 2010 when I was a freshman I elected to start it back up with some guys I had met in the dorms,\" Eiten said. \"These guys only want the best. They want to be true fraternity men. They're driven, hardworking guys that want to leave a legacy. They're not being handed an experience where you can slide through the cracks. They're all being leaders.\"\n\nThe fraternity has been an associate member of the Interfraternity Council for the last year, said CU Greek advocate Marc Stine. Associate members have all the privileges of full membership in the council, Stine said, but cannot vote or elect officers.\n\nThe next step is for the newly chartered fraternity to apply for full voting membership in the Interfraternity Council, Stine said.\n\nStine said he was pleased with Phi Kappa Tau's turnaround.\n\n\"It's a completely different set of students with much more involvement by their local alumni,\" he said. \"They're doing a lot of good things like a fraternity is supposed to, which they weren't doing before they lost their charter.\"\n\nPhi Kappa Tau still owns the house at 1150 College Ave. and has been renting it out to another Boulder fraternity, Stine said. Phi Kappa Tau will move back into that house next year.\n\nNotable Phi Kappa Tau alumni include former CU Board of Regents member and state senator Hugh Fowler, who along with his nephew Ames Fowler supported the re-charting of the fraternity, Hudson said.\n\nAmes Fowler is the Board of Governors chairman for the fraternity, Hudson said.\n\n\"We don't expand or return to locations unless we have a great group of alumni volunteers who can support the effort of the young men in the group,\" Hudson said.\n\nContact Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24583340/boulder-fraternity-phi-kappa-tau-re-chartered-after", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24583340:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-24T17:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "More than eight years after Boulder's Phi Kappa Tau was shut down by its national organization for conduct violations including underage drinking, the fraternity is back in Boulder with a new charter.", "title": "Boulder fraternity Phi Kappa Tau re-chartered after 2005 closing", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24583340/boulder-fraternity-phi-kappa-tau-re-chartered-after", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2013-11-25T11:34:26-0700", "endDate": "2023-11-22T18:08:11-0700", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah Kuta", "pubDate": "2013-11-22T18:14:23-0700", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-24T17:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder fraternity Phi Kappa Tau re-chartered after 2005 closing", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "More than eight years after Boulder's Phi Kappa Tau was shut down by its national organization for conduct violations including underage drinking, the fraternity is back in Boulder with a new charter.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24583340/boulder-fraternity-phi-kappa-tau-re-chartered-after", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "More than eight years after Boulder's Phi Kappa Tau was shut down by its national organization for conduct violations including underage drinking, the fraternity is back in Boulder with a new charter.", "title": "Boulder fraternity Phi Kappa Tau re-chartered after 2005 closing"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Phi Kappa Tau, founded in Boulder in 1924, was the fourth Boulder fraternity to close after the 2004 drinking death of freshman pledge Lynn \"Gordie\" Bailey Jr.\nPhi Kappa Tau still owns the house at 1150 College Ave. and has been renting it out to another Boulder fraternity, Stine said.\nThe fraternity closed shortly after several underage women were hospitalized after for alcohol-related problems after attending parties at Phi Kappa Tau and another fraternity, Sigma Pi.\nNow-senior and chapter president Zach Eiten was one of the first Phi Kappa Tau interest group members as a freshman.\nPhi Kappa Tau national officials would not say in 2005 why the fraternity's charter was revoked, but said they were investigating safety concerns and violations to the fraternity's risk-management policy."}
