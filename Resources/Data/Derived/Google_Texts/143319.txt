Some local boys and girls spent their Saturday afternoon picking up trash from the World's most beautiful beaches.

The Bay County Sheriff's Office Junior Deputies and Explorers conducted a beach clean-up Saturday.

The program offers teens a first-hand opportunity to learn about law enforcement and leadership skills.

This event is part of a fundraiser that goes towards a summer trip for the kids.

"It's awesome, it really is," explained Cpl. Larry Grainger from the Bay County Sheriff's Office. "You know, whenever I first mentioned it to the kids, I don't know how they would react because, they're kids and this is their Saturday, they have been in school all week. All of my kids with the exception of two are here and those two are out of town on family trips. It's the only reason they are not here."

The Explorers and Junior deputies picked up trash from Rick Seltzer park to Spinnakers.
