Yet it enacts or considers policies \u2014 currently, this includes tax cuts \u2014 that place or will place more burdens on the state treasury.\n\nThis is nowhere more apparent than in its attitude toward family planning.\n\nA recent report by the Guttmacher Institute tracks the link between unintended pregnancies and public costs for them nationally and in the states. Though the last figures it gives are for 2010, what\u2019s occurred in Texas since then offers little hope that the state\u2019s No. 1 ranking in tax dollars spent on unintended pregnancies \u2014 actually all births \u2014 is much abated.\n\nThe report says Texas led the nation in 2010, spending $2.9 billion in public funds for unintended pregnancies. Now consider what has occurred since 2010.\n\nThe state has waged a high-profile battle against the premier provider of family planning services in Texas and the nation. That would be Planned Parenthood. It did this though the clinics that get government funding for family planning cannot legally perform abortions.\n\nThe state tried to boot Planned Parenthood from the joint state-funded and federally funded Women\u2019s Health Program in 2012. When Planned Parenthood prevailed in court and the federal government balked, the state opted to run the program itself, having the effect of missing out on a 9-to-1 federal match for every state dollar spent.\n\nThis followed a cut in family-planning funding by two-thirds the year before. And though the state substantially replaced these funds, it\u2019s unlikely the damage has been undone. Clinics closed, not all of them Planned Parenthood\u2019s.\n\nTexas spends so much public money on births because it is among the most populous in the country. And, still, it\u2019s noteworthy that California has more people and spends less on this. The percentages tell a story. Nearly 61 percent of all Texas births were publicly funded in 2010 in Texas and 73.7 percent of all unintended births were.\n\nThe Guttmacher report notes, \u201cRates of unintended pregnancy are far higher among women living at or near the poverty level than among higher-income women.\u201d Texas has no shortage of low-income people, who are eligible for Medicaid during pregnancy.\n\nSince 2010, unintended pregnancy \u2014 and birth rates generally \u2014 have been trending downward. This occurs, however, as the medical costs of pregnancies have inched upward and Medicaid rolls have expanded. This occurs even in those states, such as Texas, that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Beyond more poor people, this also happens because determining ACA eligibility in states without their own exchanges often uncovers Medicaid eligibility.\n\nThe fact that Medicaid and other programs provide care to pregnant women \u2014 and to their children later \u2014 is part of what makes these programs so valuable. But, clearly, the state can save much if it invested more \u2014 including removing the ban on Planned Parenthood \u2014 in family planning. The state, according to Guttmacher, could save $620.5 million in state funds and $1.5 billion in federal funds if it more efficiently helped prevent these unintended pregnancies.\n\nBy family planning, we are referring to the kind of care, including birth control, that prevents pregnancies and otherwise helps women space out their wanted pregnancies. And, yes, this investment should start with age-appropriate, medically accurate sexual education in the schools, beyond teaching just abstinence.\n\nUnless Texas gets smarter about family planning, it cannot call itself a wise steward of public funds.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Though the last figures it gives are for 2010, what\u2019s occurred in Texas since then offers little hope that the state\u2019s No. 1 ranking in tax dollars spent on unintended pregnancies \u2014 actually all births \u2014 is much abated.
