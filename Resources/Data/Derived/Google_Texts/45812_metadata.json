And the conservative Texas Senator has not been ambivalent in the least about wanting to repeal Obamacare and reverse Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nCruz has also, with his actions, made it clear that he isn\u2019t the type of politician who campaigns as a conservative and then turns his back on the base as soon as he is elected. That, more than anything, is why the bipartisan permanent political class and Washington insiders despise him.\n\nDespite his fears, though, Pfeiffer, according to the Journal, ultimately \u201cpredicted Obama\u2019s administrative actions on immigration and Cuba will stand no matter who sits in the White House in 2017.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House Fears 'President Cruz' Will Overturn Exec Amnesty", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "White House Fears 'President Cruz' Will Overturn Exec Amnesty", "title": "White House Fears 'President Cruz' Will Overturn Exec Amnesty  - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/Ted-Cruzpng.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/19/white-house-fears-president-cruz-will-overturn-exec-amnesty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White House Fears 'President Cruz' Will Overturn Exec Amnesty", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/Ted-Cruzpng.png", "title": "White House Fears 'President Cruz' Will Overturn Exec Amnesty  - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, barack obama, immigration, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2014-12-19T15:34:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd05d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhite House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer conceded that he fears a President Ted Cruz will overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, perhaps signaling that Cruz represents the greatest threat to the progressive left.\nAnd the conservative Texas Senator has not been ambivalent in the least about wanting to repeal Obamacare and reverse Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nDespite his fears, though, Pfeiffer, according to the Journal, ultimately \u201cpredicted Obama\u2019s administrative actions on immigration and Cuba will stand no matter who sits in the White House in 2017.\u201d\nThat, more than anything, is why the bipartisan permanent political class and Washington insiders despise him.\nCruz has also, with his actions, made it clear that he isn\u2019t the type of politician who campaigns as a conservative and then turns his back on the base as soon as he is elected."}
