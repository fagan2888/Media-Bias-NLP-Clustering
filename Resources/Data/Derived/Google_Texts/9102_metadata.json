Imagine he\u2019s Hispanic, young, won re-election last year by a ridiculous 46 points, and has seen his state\u2019s unemployment rate drop quickly in recent years.\n\nI\u2019m referring to Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), who seems like an almost-perfect presidential candidate for his party, but who hasn\u2019t even considered testing the White House waters.\n\nTo understand why, consider Sandoval\u2019s perspective on the pending Supreme Court case that may gut the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI made a decision early on that we would be a state-based exchange because I felt it was in Nevadans\u2019 best interest to run their own,\u201d Sandoval said, even boasting that twice as many Nevadans enrolled this year over the first round. \u201cI\u2019m just pleased,\u201d he added, \u201cthat we don\u2019t have the anxiety of the outcome King v. Burwell.\u201d\n\nAt first blush, this may not seem striking at all \u2013 a governor embraced a sensible policy that helped his constituents have access to basic medical care. It\u2019s the sort of thing most Americans might expect every well-intentioned governor to do as a matter of course.\n\nBut in political terms, we\u2019re talking about a Republican governor who embraced the dreaded \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 including Medicaid expansion \u2013 and is \u201cpleased\u201d he implemented the Affordable Care Act in a way that may help protect his state from his party\u2019s Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe Nevada Republican also sided with congressional Democrats on unemployment benefits , and when the courts struck down the state ban on marriage equality, Sandoval didn\u2019t see the point in putting up a fight.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the governor is some kind of Republican In Name Only \u2013 he\u2019s really not \u2013 but he has demonstrated some pragmatism and moderation on some key issues.\n\nAnd the result is the kind of record that GOP voters in a presidential primary would reflexively reject out of hand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Why isn't Nevada Gov.
