Hobby Lobby aims for Obamacare win\n\nThe evangelical owners of Hobby Lobby made a fortune selling crafts supplies and made headlines fighting government-mandated birth control coverage. They\u2019re also using their billions to sell the American public on the literal truth of Scripture \u2014 through a public school Bible curriculum, a huge museum around the corner from the Smithsonian and public forums on the faith of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThe Green family may be best known in secular circles for their lawsuit against Obamacare, a high-stakes \u2014 and highly political \u2014 case that could undercut the administration\u2019s goal of setting minimum standards for health care coverage. By the end of this month, the Supreme Court will decide if the federal government can force the Greens to include methods of contraception they deem sinful as part of employees\u2019 health insurance.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe pending Hobby Lobby ruling has thrust the Greens into the national spotlight, but the family\u2019s mission is far bigger than a single court case. The Greens are spending hundreds of millions on a quiet but audacious bid to teach a wayward nation to trust, cherish \u2014 and heed \u2014 the Bible.\n\n( From POLITICO Magazine: Big Money, the Koch Brothers and Me)\n\nThey\u2019re building a huge museum dedicated to the Bible a few blocks from the Mall in Washington , with as much public space as the National Museum of American History. They\u2019ve financed a lavish traveling exhibit as well, complete with a re-created Holy Land cave, a \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark experience\u201d for kids and animatronic characters such as William Tyndale, who was burned at the stake for daring to translate the New Testament into English.\n\nThe Greens are sponsoring scholarly study of the Bible and hosting forums such as a recent panel on faith\u2019s role in shaping early America, which they hope to package for national broadcast.\n\nMost provocatively, they\u2019ve funded a multimillion-dollar effort to write a Bible curriculum they hope to place in public schools nationwide. It will debut next fall as an elective in Mustang High School, a few miles from Hobby Lobby\u2019s Oklahoma City headquarters.\n\nA draft of the textbook for the first of four planned yearlong courses presents Adam and Eve as historical figures and introduces God as \u201cfaithful and good,\u201d \u201cgracious and compassionate\u201d and \u201can ever-present help in times of trouble.\u201d A list of \u201ccurses for disobeying the Lord\u201d warns of defeat, fever and \u201cdisaster and panic in everything you do.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Iowa GOP takeover: The implications for 2016)\n\nHobby Lobby founders David and Barbara Green and their three adult children \u2014 sons Steve and Mart and daughter Darsee Lett \u2014 have donated generously to Christian institutions over the years, but these projects are on another scale entirely. A source close to the family estimates the museum alone will end up costing as much as $800 million, including the acquisition of thousands of ancient artifacts.\n\nThe family, with a net worth that Forbes estimates at $5 billion, has not flinched from the price or scaled back its vision.\n\n\u201cOur goal \u2026 [is to] reintroduce this book to the nation,\u201d Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby, said last spring before the National Bible Association. \u201cThis nation is in danger because of its ignorance of what God has taught. We need to know it. And if we don\u2019t know it, our future is going to be very scary.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s vision is beginning to stir concern, not just among the American Civil Liberties Union and atheist groups such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation, but even from some Bible scholars.\n\nThe plans that have been made public so far \u2014 including the high school curriculum \u2014 seem aimed at portraying Scripture as historically accurate and an unequivocal force for good, said John Kutsko, executive director of the international Society of Biblical Literature, the oldest and largest organization dedicated to biblical scholarship.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The fall of teachers unions)\n\nThat approach fails to incorporate the latest scholarship, acknowledge that the Bible has also played a role as a tool of oppression or recognize different religious viewpoints, Kutsko said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple, superficial, literal reading of the Bible,\u201d Kutsko said.\n\nIn his view, that\u2019s inappropriate both in a public high school and in a private museum that \u201cby virtue of being adjacent to the Mall gives the impression that it\u2019s almost a national museum,\u201d he said.\n\nSupporters, however, say they are confident the Greens will focus on scholarship rather than salvation in their public outreach.\n\nThe family does proselytize quite publicly three times a year, taking out full-page ads in newspapers across the country every Christmas, Easter and Independence Day. The ads celebrate the power of faith and direct readers to a toll-free number for Need Him Ministry, a global initiative to bring nonbelievers to Jesus.\n\nIf the goal of the museum were evangelizing, \u201cI can assure you, I would not be involved,\u201d said Harry Stout, a professor at Yale Divinity School who has consulted on the museum. \u201cThey\u2019re really interested in getting it right.\u201d\n\n( LISTEN to POLITICO Pro's Procast: Your guide to Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby)\n\nStout sees one motive above all in the family\u2019s work. The Greens, he said, \u201care really smitten with the Bible.\u201d\n\nNOT TYPICAL BILLIONAIRES\n\nThe Greens are not your typical tycoons.\n\nDavid Green, the son of a pastor, launched the company that would become Hobby Lobby in a garage in 1970, backed by a $600 loan. The arts-and-crafts chain now has more than 600 stores and some 16,000 full-time employees and brings in more than $3 billion a year in sales. David Green remains the CEO.\n\nFaith is at the foundation of the business. Stores play Christian music and are closed on Sundays. The Greens have steadily raised their starting wage, to $15 an hour for full-time workers, to reflect their belief, centered in their faith, of the dignity of all people. The company\u2019s first principle, posted on its website, is \u201chonoring the Lord in all we do \u2026\u201d\n\nGiven that credo, Steve Green has said he felt he had no choice but to sue over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that health insurance cover a full range of contraceptives. The Hobby Lobby plan covers most birth control, but Green has said he cannot in good conscience help employees pay for IUDs or emergency contraceptives because he believes them to be tantamount to abortion.\n\nMother Jones magazine has reported that Hobby Lobby covered some of the disputed methods of contraception in its health insurance plan until 2012, when the family began considering a lawsuit. The magazine also reported that Hobby Lobby contributes to an employee 401(k) plan with investments in pharmaceutical companies that make the IUD, emergency contraceptives and drugs used during abortions.\n\nThe Greens declined an interview request; a spokeswoman said their attorney had advised them not to talk publicly until after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn a video interview posted online by The Heritage Foundation, Steve Green said the family sued to uphold religious freedom. \u201cWe just felt like our hands were tied and that the only option we had was to sue the government, saying that this isn\u2019t fair, that you require us to do something that violates our conscience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has heard one other challenge to the ACA. In 2012, on a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d \u2014 the requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nFriends describe the Greens as reluctant plaintiffs who shun the spotlight. They shun most of the perks of wealth, too. They\u2019re not major political donors. Aside from the lawsuit, they generally don\u2019t weigh in on national debates. Those who know them unfailingly describe them as humble, gracious and reserved. Even their corporate headquarters is exceedingly modest.\n\nFamily members \u201cgenuinely see themselves as servants,\u201d said Wes Lane, who runs a faith-based civic organization in Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Greens have not been splashy in their philanthropy, either.\n\nThe family has quietly given away tens of millions of dollars to Christian colleges and churches. They saved a faltering Oral Roberts University after a scandal with a gift of more than $70 million, gave a 170-acre ranch to pastor Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback Church and have donated land and money to countless other Christian ministries, without fanfare.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Nick Gass @ 06/16/2014 01:56 PM CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled the name of David Green's daughter.
