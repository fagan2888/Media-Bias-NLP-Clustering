An Arvada fire chief has been accepted into the third year of the Fire Service Executive Development Institute, officials said.

Deputy Chief Mike Piper of the Arvada Fire Protection District competed with new fire chiefs and chief officers from around the nation to become a member of the 2015 cohort program, according to an Arvada Fire Protection District news release. Piper has also been awarded a scholarship to cover the program expenses.

The institute, according to the release, is a year-long leadership-development program created by the International Association of Fire Chiefs to provide new and aspiring fire chiefs the tools in order to have “successful, productive tenures.”

Members of the cohort will meet in May for their first six-day session in addition to two other sessions that meet six months apart, the release said.

Piper has been a member of the fire service and the Arvada Fire Protection District since 1991, starting as a volunteer firefighter, the release said. He has been the operations chief for the Arvada Fire Protection District for the last 8 years, previously serving as a line captain, lieutenant and firefighter.

“With the success of the prior two FSEDI programs, I am excited that we can make this program available to another group of upcoming leaders in the fire-ems service”, said Chief G. Keith Bryant, IAFC President and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
