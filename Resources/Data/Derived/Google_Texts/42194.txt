Amari Williams set out on foot to Washington D.C. from Killeen, Texas on July 27. His cause: to fight for change in the Department of Veterans Affairs, vowing to sit inside the VA office every day until he gets the help that he needs.

Only on 9: combat war vet walks 1500 miles after @DeptVetAffairs denies benefits for 11yrs @wusa9 @WhosSayingThis pic.twitter.com/SFkjg2aupb — suraechinn (@suraechinn) August 20, 2015

With just a backpack, Williams began the 1,500-mile journey.

According to WUSA9:

Williams received support from strangers and other veterans which overwhelmed him. But when he reached Knoxville, Tenn. he thought about giving up. “My feet are swollen. My ankles are swollen. My knees have been killing me since ten feet in. My shoulders are on fire,” Williams said. But he pushed on and thought about the veterans who feel the VA system failed them.

Williams served in the U.S. Army for one year in Iraq before returning home in 2004. He suffers from PTSD, anxiety, depression, hearing loss and pain throughout his body. For more than a decade, the VA has claimed his symptoms are not due to his deployment.

He arrived in D.C. on Aug. 14 and has been spending his days, from 8 a.m–4 p.m. sitting in the Veterans Affairs Benefit Administration office.

Jason Miller, outreach director of the office, said he was surprised Williams walked all that way and promised he would get Williams the help he needs.

“I feel like I can win this battle for all of us,” Williams told WUSA9.
