He did not elaborate on what form such objections might take.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of pastors and Christian schools are going to have a choice. They either are going to follow God, their conscience and what they truly believe is what the scripture teaches them, or they will follow civil law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey will go the path of Dr. Martin Luther King, who in his brilliant essay, the letters from a Birmingham jail, reminded us, based on what St. Augustine said, that an unjust law is no law at all,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said. \u201cAnd I do think that we\u2019re going to see a lot of pastors who will have to make this tough decision.\u201d\n\nThe ruling has further galvanized many in the party to keep up the fight, as Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana has taken a stand similar to Mr. Huckabee\u2019s and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has reiterated calls for a Constitutional amendment to let the states decide the issue for themselves.\n\nBut, some Republicans see the court\u2019s decision as a \u201cwiping of the slate,\u201d as The New York Times reported on Sunday, and other contenders appearing on the news shows reflected this thinking.\n\nOn CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio said that while Republicans should not just accept the court\u2019s decision validating a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, a ruling President Obama said meant that the law was \u201chere to stay,\u201d the party should \u201cmove on\u201d from the marriage issue.\n\n\u201cLook, I believe in traditional marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the Supreme Court has ruled, and it\u2019s the law of the land, and we\u2019ll abide by it. And I think everybody needs to take a deep breath to see how this evolves.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201d I think there\u2019s so many other things now that we have to focus on.\u201d\n\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who added his voice to those calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol in the wake of the mass shooting in Charleston, told Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, that a marriage amendment would not have enough support in the Congress to pass.\n\nAnd while \u201cWhat I want to do is protect the religious liberties of those who believe that opposing same sex marriage as part of their faith,\u201d a push for an amendment would hinder Republicans in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cYou can put it in the platform, but it will, in my view, hurt us in 2016, because it\u2019s a process that\u2019s not going to bear fruit,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150628131747, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Graham, Lindsey;Huckabee, Mike;Jindal, Bobby;Kasich, John R", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Graham Lindsey,Huckabee Mike,Jindal Bobby,Kasich John R,Evangelical Movement,Presidential Election of 2016,Same-Sex Marriage Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Republican Party,Uncategorized", "description": "A flock of Republican presidential contenders appeared on the morning news shows and showed the party\u2019s varied response to the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on gay marriage.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Eric Lichtblau", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Eric Lichtblau", "byl": "Eric Lichtblau", "twitter": {"description": "A flock of Republican presidential contenders appeared on the morning news shows and showed the party\u2019s varied response to the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on gay marriage.", "title": "Marriage Dominates Debate on Sunday Talk Shows", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/28/sanders-defends-gun-record-as-marriage-flag-dominate-debate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/28/us/28huckabee-firstdraft/28huckabee-firstdraft-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@EricLichtblau", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003769455, "news_keywords": "2016 Presidential Election,Bobby Jindal,Evangelical,John R Kasich,Lindsey Graham,Mike Huckabee,Republicans,Same Sex Marriage", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 28, 2015", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-06282015.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1435511867, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/eric_lichtblau/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T23:01:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150628230136, "PUD": 20150628, "pdate": 20150628, "des": "Evangelical Movement;Presidential Election of 2016;Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/28/us/28huckabee-firstdraft/28huckabee-firstdraft-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "A flock of Republican presidential contenders appeared on the morning news shows and showed the party\u2019s varied response to the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on gay marriage.", "title": "Marriage Dominates Debate on Sunday Talk Shows", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/28/sanders-defends-gun-record-as-marriage-flag-dominate-debate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/28/us/28huckabee-firstdraft/28huckabee-firstdraft-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Marriage Dominates Debate on Sunday Talk Shows", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/28/us/28huckabee-firstdraft/28huckabee-firstdraft-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 28, 2015"}, "article_summary": "PhotoA flock of Republican presidential contenders appeared on the morning news shows on Sunday and showed the party\u2019s varied response to the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on gay marriage.\n\u201cLook, I believe in traditional marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the Supreme Court has ruled, and it\u2019s the law of the land, and we\u2019ll abide by it.\nMike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and pastor who counts evangelical Christians among his strongest supporters, has said the high court\u2019s affirmation of gay marriage is an affront to religious voters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of pastors and Christian schools are going to have a choice.\nScott Walker of Wisconsin has reiterated calls for a Constitutional amendment to let the states decide the issue for themselves."}
