Rosenwald in the Washington Post:\n\nThe vitriol began almost immediately after The Washington Post reported that the Armatix iP1 smart gun was for sale at the pro shop. Electronic chips inside the gun communicate with a watch that can be purchased with the gun, making it impossible to fire without the watch.\n\nThe backlash \u201chas apparently shaken Oak Tree, one of the largest gun stores and shooting ranges in California,\u201d and the club\u2019s owner has denied \u201cever offering the gun\u201d and apologized for \u201cany confusion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Post account, Armatix claims Oak Tree at first said they needed more smart guns for a TV report, but then the tone \u201cquickly changed\u201d and the TV spot was cancelled, after Oak Tree received phone calls from irate gun rights supporters.\n\nThe somewhat murky situation was somewhat clarified by Oak Tree\u2019s owner, in comments to Examiner.com\u2019s David Codrea, to the effect that\n\nOur facility does NOT carry the Armatix pistol, never has\u2026 The FFL [Federal Firearms Licensed] dealer on site has not ever merchandised or sold the firearm and does not intend to carry this firearm.\u201d\n\nIt appears that a range owner allowing some shooting demos at his facility of the Armatix iP1 smart gun - a .22 caliber pistol that retails at $1,399 plus $399 for the enabling watch - combined with Armatix and the media jumping the gun on a story about the nation\u2019s first smart-gun for sale and the possible triggering of a New Jersey smart gun law, resulted in the heated backlash of the gun community.\n\nNew Jersey passed a law in 2002 mandating that \u201conly smart guns be sold in the state within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country,\u201d as another Rosenwald column recounts.\n\nOnce news of a smart gun for sale in California was reported last month, New Jersey state Senate Democratic Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, who sponsored the 2002 law, and who was allegedly recorded last year on a hot-mic advocating gun confiscation, lost no time in asking the Christie administration for action.\n\nA USA Today piece by Robert Farago at the time called smart guns a \u201cdumb idea,\u201d and said \u201crevoking New Jersey\u2019s law would be smart.\u201d As New Jersey\u2019s \u201cbeleaguered gun owners\u201d know, however, that\u2019s not about to happen, with \u201cthe forces of civilian disarmament running rampant\u201d under New Jersey Democrats.\n\nThe executive director of New Jersey\u2019s NRA chapter, quoted at North Jersey.com, says \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s smart-gun law is as dumb as it gets\u2026 It forces you to use an unproven technology to defend your life, and then exempts the state from liability when the gun goes \u2018click\u2019 instead of \u2018bang.\u2019\n\nThe NRA contends that \"the \u2018smart guns\u2019 issue clearly has the potential to mesh with the anti-gunner's agenda, opening the door to a ban on all guns that do not possess the government-required technology.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey law, or a federal bill recently introduced by Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) requiring smart technology on future gun sales, effectively reduces the resale value of existing guns to zero.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/03/california_gun_shop_drops_the_smart_gun_after_furious_backlash.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-03/191763_1_.jpg", "title": "Blog: California gun shop drops the smart gun after furious backlash"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde45f\"", "article_summary": "requiring smart technology on future gun sales, effectively reduces the resale value of existing guns to zero.\nNew Jersey passed a law in 2002 mandating that \u201conly smart guns be sold in the state within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country,\u201d as another Rosenwald column recounts.\nElectronic chips inside the gun communicate with a watch that can be purchased with the gun, making it impossible to fire without the watch.\nAttacks in online forums and social networks against the Oak Tree Gun Club have prompted the store to back away from any association with the Armatix iP1 smart gun\u2026Attacks in online forums and social networks against the Oak Tree Gun Club have prompted the store to back away from any association with the Armatix iP1 smart gun\u2026A California shooting club that was \u201cthe only outlet in the country\u201d selling the first smart gun is \u201cfacing a furious backlash from customers and gun rights supporters,\u201d as reported by Michael S.
