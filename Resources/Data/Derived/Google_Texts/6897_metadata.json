The injured men left the park in a white SUV, which police officers tried to flag down, but the driver kept going. Police pursued the SUV into Denver and stopped it at West Sixth Avenue and Kalamath Street.\n\nBut immediately after the SUV took off, Illanes said the situation remained calm in the park.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a ton of commotion,\u201d Illanes said. Without any idea what had happened, Illanes left the park before police arrived. Other concert goers who exited the show later ran into hours of traffic and confusion as police locked down the park.\n\nJosh Wills, who was attending the show with his mom, his son and his son\u2019s girlfriend, left the show shortly after 11 p.m. with no idea that a shooting had taken place about an hour beforehand.\n\n\u201cThere were no announcements. If you were in Red Rocks watching the show you would have no idea anything was going on,\u201d Wills said.\n\nAs Wills got in the car to leave, he was stopped by a parking attendant, who gave him the first notification of the night\u2019s shooting.\n\n\u201cHe said the venue was on lockdown and I should just turn off my car,\u201d Wills said.\n\nThat\u2019s when Wills decided to check Twitter on his phone, where he got the first news of what had happened. For the next three hours, Wills sat in his car waiting to leave the venue with only the information he could find on his phone.\n\nAt about 12:30 a.m., Wills said police started letting cars leave one at a time.\n\n\u201cI saw the police blockade from where we were stuck and could see them letting cars out one by one.\u201d Wills said. \u201cIt was maybe two city blocks from where we were parked to the exit.\n\n\u201cIt took two and a half hours to move two city blocks,\u201d Wills said.\n\nDuring that time, Wills and his company took turns sleeping, and finally by 2 a.m. they reached the exit. There, three police officers asked them to roll down the window.\n\n\u201cThey asked the driver\u2019s name and birth date and if anyone was injured and quickly shined a light in the car,\u201d Wills said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t step out of the car, they didn\u2019t search the car, they didn\u2019t ask for the driver\u2019s ID.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving at the venue at 6:30 p.m., Wills made it home by 3 a.m.. But while the show ended in violence and frustration, he said the concert itself was a great experience.\n\n\u201cThe show was amazing. There wasn\u2019t really any ruckus or trouble in the venue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a beautiful night at Red Rocks.\u201d\n\nMatt Miller: 303-954-1785, mrmiller@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Red Rocks shooting: Fans report hearing gunshots and hours of waiting", "title": "Red Rocks shooting: Fans report hearing gunshots and hours of waiting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/red-rocks-shooting-fans-report-hearing-gunshots-and-hours-of-waiting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__CD19SHOOTINGDSC_2601p1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__CD19SHOOTINGDSC_2601p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T13:08:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:01:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9902\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey asked the driver\u2019s name and birth date and if anyone was injured and quickly shined a light in the car,\u201d Wills said.\nBut immediately after the SUV took off, Illanes said the situation remained calm in the park.\nWithout any idea what had happened, Illanes left the park before police arrived.\nIf you were in Red Rocks watching the show you would have no idea anything was going on,\u201d Wills said.\n\u201cHe said the venue was on lockdown and I should just turn off my car,\u201d Wills said."}
