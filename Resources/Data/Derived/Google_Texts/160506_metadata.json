Smith, 61, confirmed that his GOP just. can\u2019t. stop. talking. about. abortion. and. gays. And that no matter what their platform (jobs, the economy, Obamacare, whatever) the GOP always finds itself back in their familiar anti-gay, anti-choice crouch. It\u2019s like a drug for these guys to \u2013 no matter the context \u2013 bring it all back to abortion and gays even if the topic is, oh I dunno, the Nigerian terrorist organization, Boko Haram. That was the case on Tuesday when Congressman Smith made his unfortunate remarks.\n\nSmith\u2019s actual comment went like this: \u201cI am a strong believer in traditional marriage and I do not construe homosexual rights as human rights.\u201d He went on to muse whether \u201cthe (Obama) Administration\u2019s views on LGBT rights affected or hindered our support for Nigeria to defeat Boko Haram.\u201d In Chris Smith\u2019s world we don\u2019t construe gays rights with human rights, but we do conflate supporting gays with somehow enabling terrorism.\n\nOne of Smith\u2019s (gay) colleagues, Congressman David Cicilline, was on that committee and I\u2019d love to know what Cicilline was thinking at that moment. (His office declined to comment.)\n\nContrary to Smith\u2019s throwaway line, gays in Africa have much bigger challenges than \u201chomosexual marriage.\u201d In many African countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, and Rwanda, it\u2019s illegal just to be gay. Marriage is nice, but gay Nigerians face more pressing, existential crises in their day-to-day lives. And Chris Smith outta know that. In fact, just as Smith was gaveling in last Tuesday\u2019s hearing, \u201creligious authorities in Nigeria detained 12 people accused of holding a \u2018gay wedding.'\u201d\n\n(Apparently the anti-gay features of Boko Haram\u2019s Sharia law have some currency within mainstream [Sharia-loathing] Republican party politics. Chris Smith just proves it. How ironic is that?)\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Chris Smith, he\u2019s the dean of the NJ Congressional delegation who serves on the House Foreign Affairs committee and chairs the House Subcommittee on Human Rights. So when this guy talks about Human Rights, people listen.\n\nChris Smith is also, literally, the most anti-reproductive choice politician in the country. I know the word \u2018literally\u2019 gets thrown around a lot these days, but Congressman Chris Smith literally wants to tell the rest of us when we can start (or grow) our family. No abortions ever, every single pregnancy in America must result in a baby.\n\nChris Smith also has a long history of fighting progress on gay rights. From HIV funding and prevention, to gay marriage equality and adoption, Chris Smith never misses an opportunity to spread his \u201ctraditional\u201d message if anti-gay intolerance. Smith\u2019s latest comments that America\u2019s global human rights objectives make us vulnerable to Boko Haram are simply a new low, even for him.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want Chris Smith to apologize to gay people for saying stupid stuff. Now that it\u2019s 2015 I pray Chris Smith (and his ilk) keep sharing their retrograde views whenever they can, as loudly as possible. Because every time they open their mouth, LGBT rights takes a big step forward.\n\nJay Lassiter is a gay rights activist living in Cherry Hill, NJ with his partner of 12 years.
