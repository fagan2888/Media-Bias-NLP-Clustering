AMC A scene from “The Walking Dead”

“The Walking Dead” cannot be stopped.

AMC’s zombie drama smashed ratings records with its season premiere of its fourth season last night, drawing 16.1 million total viewers and 10.4 million viewers in the key 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen data provided by the network – truly monster numbers for a cable network that once again placed it as the top show on television.

Those numbers beat both the previous record for “The Walking Dead” – the 12.4 million total viewers and 8.1 million in the demo it earned for last season’s finale – and the ratings for “Sunday Night Football” on NBC. They also come on the heels of some similarly hefty ratings numbers for the series finale of AMC’s “Breaking Bad” on Sept. 29, which drew 10.3 million total viewers and 6.7 million viewers in the demo.

As such, they suggest an acceleration of the trend we saw last season, in which “The Walking Dead” made history by routinely beating its broadcast competition in the 18-49 demographic.

For the entire 2012-13 season, “Sunday Night Football” still came out ahead for AMC’s gorefest, but this season’s strong start for the zombies makes this network-vs-cable contest worth keeping an eye on.

The show also generated major activity on social media. “The Walking Dead” topped the Nielsen’s weekly Twitter TV rating, drawing a unique audience of 7.5 million Twitter users to view its 1.17 million Tweets about the show on Sunday night. On Facebook, 5 million users had 9.3 million interactions about the show, according to AMC.
