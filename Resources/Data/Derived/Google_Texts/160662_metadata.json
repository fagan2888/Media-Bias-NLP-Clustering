House GOP cuts IRS, SEC funding\n\nHouse Republicans rolled out a $21.3 billion financial services bill Tuesday that cuts more than $2 billion from President Barack Obama\u2019s budget requests \u2014 chiefly at the expense of the Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe IRS is promised $10.9 billion, about $341 million below current funding and $1.5 billion less than what Obama has asked for in the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The SEC is essentially frozen in place at $1.4 billion, $300 million below the president\u2019s request.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt one level, the 148-page measure defines a new realism and measure of moderation for the GOP which sought much more dramatic cuts in the same bill a year ago. But it also keeps up what\u2019s become an almost relentless war of attrition aimed at slowing the implementation of the president\u2019s most prized initiatives: health care and Wall Street reforms.\n\nFor sure, the IRS has added to its troubles, given the ongoing controversy over its attempts to rein-in tax-exempt conservative political groups. But it\u2019s a target now too because of its role in administering the subsidies promised under the Affordable Care Act, just as the SEC is important to the Dodd-Frank law, enacted four months later in July 2010.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Congress ups budget for refugees)\n\nIncluded in the bill, for example, is legislative language barring any transfer of funds from the department of Health and Human Services to the IRS to assist in implementing the ACA. And the measure seeks to block the tax agency from using its powers to enforce the individual insurance mandate in the law.\n\nOn balance, the SEC has fared better than its smaller sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But in both cases, House Republicans\u2014whose leadership has greatly benefited from Wall Street campaign donations\u2014have taken the position of rejecting any major new funding for the two regulators going into November\u2019s elections.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The bill slashes more than $2 billion from President Barack Obama\u2019s budget requests.", "title": "House GOP cuts IRS, SEC funding", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/irs-sec-funding-house-gop-cuts-107940.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/05/14/130514_irs_building_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "SEC,Barack Obama,Money,House Republicans,IRS", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The bill slashes more than $2 billion from President Barack Obama\u2019s budget requests.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "House GOP cuts IRS, SEC fundingHouse Republicans rolled out a $21.3 billion financial services bill Tuesday that cuts more than $2 billion from President Barack Obama\u2019s budget requests \u2014 chiefly at the expense of the Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe IRS is promised $10.9 billion, about $341 million below current funding.\nThe IRS is promised $10.9 billion, about $341 million below current funding and $1.5 billion less than what Obama has asked for in the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\nThe SEC is essentially frozen in place at $1.4 billion, $300 million below the president\u2019s request.\nOn balance, the SEC has fared better than its smaller sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."}
