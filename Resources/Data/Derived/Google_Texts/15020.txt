Ted Cruz reads 'Green Eggs and Ham' during 'filibuster' [YouTube]

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) took a moment during his “filibuster” of the Affordable Care Act to read the Dr. Seuss story Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters, seemingly against their wishes.

“I don’t get to read it that often because I tell them, ‘Go pick the books you want to read and I read it to them,'” Cruz said on the Senate floor Tuesday night. “But since tonight, girls, you aren’t here, you don’t get to pick the book, so I get to pick Green Eggs and Ham.”

At that point, Cruz recited the entirety of Seuss’ story, though as PolicyMic noted, it can be argued that he unintentionally made a case for supporting the new law, since the unnamed protagonist eventually comes around to enjoying the titular food, and Cruz has been denounced — even by fellow Republicans — for calling for a government shutdown to avoid implementing the law.

“I want to say to Caroline and Catherine, my angels, I love you with all my heart,” Cruz said after finishing the story. “It’s bedtime. Give mommy a hug and a kiss, brush your teeth, say your prayers. And daddy’s going to be home soon.”

The junior senator from Texas continued speaking through Wednesday morning, joined at times by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Lee (R-UT).

Cruz’s speech cannot be considered a filibuster until it officially impedes further Senate business, and a vote has already been locked in for Wednesday morning by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) unless 41 senators object.
