YouTube\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Mental Health, one out of every 17 adults in the United States, 13.6 million people, are living with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder. Even more staggering than the number of people living with a mental illness is the number of people who understand very little about mental illnesses. A recent survey conducted by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) revealed that 44 percent of the American public admit that they know little or almost nothing at all about mental illnesses.\n\n\"The consequences of this gap in knowledge are quite serious,\" Dr. Carolyn Robinowitz, secretary-treasurer and 2006 president-elect of the APA said in a statement. \"About one-in-five Americans suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder during any given year. This means few families are untouched by a mental illness. All families will benefit from understanding how these disorders can impact their lives.\"\n\nFindings from the survey also revealed that one-third of Americans are under the impression that emotional or personal weakness and old age are major contributing factors to mental illness. Thankfully, people are willing to broaden their horizons when it comes to mental health. Eighty-four percent of survey respondents said they would benefit from knowing more about the warning signs for a mental illness. Here are five myths regarding mental illness that you may have been fooled by:\n\n1. Children don\u2019t experience mental illness. It\u2019s just bad parenting.\n\n2. Stress causes mental illness.\n\n3. People with mental illness are violent and unpredictable.\n\n4. People with mental health problems can\u2019t handle the stress of having a job.\n\n5. Weakness and flaws cause mental illness.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mental, illness, myths", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Were you under the impression that people with a mental illness are violent and unpredictable?", "title": "5 Things You Believe About Mental Ilness That Couldn't Be Farther From The Truth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stigma-mental-illness-5-things-you-believe-about-mental-health-couldnt-be-farther-truth-297686", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/mental-illness.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Were you under the impression that people with a mental illness are violent and unpredictable?", "title": "5 Things You Believe About Mental Ilness That Couldn't Be Farther From The Truth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stigma-mental-illness-5-things-you-believe-about-mental-health-couldnt-be-farther-truth-297686", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/mental-illness.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/mental-illness.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-12T12:39:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-12T12:39:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Were you under the impression that people with a mental illness are violent and unpredictable?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdba9\"", "article_summary": "Here are five mental illness myths that may have been fooling you.\nThankfully, people are willing to broaden their horizons when it comes to mental health.\nEven more staggering than the number of people living with a mental illness is the number of people who understand very little about mental illnesses.\nYouTubeAccording to the National Institutes of Mental Health, one out of every 17 adults in the United States, 13.6 million people, are living with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder.\nPeople with mental health problems can\u2019t handle the stress of having a job."}
