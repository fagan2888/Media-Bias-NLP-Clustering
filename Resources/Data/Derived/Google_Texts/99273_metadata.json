Surely she wants to play up some of her differences with Obama, and will play them up more aggressively in the future. There are pitfalls to this instinct. But there\u2019s also a real difference here, and there always has been. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll say Obama proved unprepared for that 3 a.m. phone call, but she\u2019s always believed, and still believes that he should\u2019ve answered it with more aggressive instincts.\n\nUnfortunately for the press, that\u2019s just about the whole story.\n\nAs it turns out, we have a pretty detailed roadmap of the Obama and Clinton worldviews\u2014showing where they overlap and where they depart from each other\u2014in the form of a very well documented 2008 primary campaign.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about that campaign was the overwhelming consensus among all of the top contenders on all key domestic policy issues. The lone, major exception to the consensus was then-Senator Obama's refusal to include an individual mandate in his national health care plan. He took a lot of guff from Clinton and John Edwards and health policy wonks for his position, but it made his plan easier to sell to the public, and perhaps was a smart way to tee off negotiations with the industry. The evolution of the Affordable Care Act, from Obama\u2019s blueprint in the primary, through passage of the law, is thus a story of Obama \u201cevolving\u201d toward Hillary's position, and eventually adopting it wholesale. I think Obama\u2019s original reluctance was a bit trumped up and cynical. But that's what happened.\n\nIf once in office, Obama had departed further from the primary consensus, and enacted a series of policies at odds with, or far short of, those he\u2019d campaigned on, then we\u2019d have a recipe for renewed Obama-Clinton warfare. Instead, the opposite is true. And as such I think there's almost no reason to think Hillary will run away from Obama\u2019s domestic record, or do damage to any of his accomplishments\u2014particularly Obamacare\u2014as a campaigner. She hasn't said much about ACA as a proto-candidate, but everything she's said has been consistent with the kinds of things you'd expect from a successor looking to shore up her predecessor's legacy. A great start, as good as we could have done with the constraints we faced, now we should strengthen it.\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t leave much material for the confrontation-obsessed. Saying that health care and Wall Street should be improved and strengthened isn\u2019t a great departure. Saying the steps Obama took through executive action\u2014particularly his greenhouse gas and immigration policies\u2014should be replaced by new statutes isn\u2019t much of a knock on his policies. I can imagine her attributing Obama\u2019s inability to squeeze climate change and immigration reform bills out of Congress to his unwillingness or inability to use the tools of political tradecraft\u2014hardball negotiating, political networking\u2014that she specializes in. But that\u2019ll just be a calculated way of saying that she\u2019s the person best suited to shore up and build upon his legacy.\n\nForeign policy will be the only substantive source of dissonance. I\u2019m just not sure that\u2019ll be enough to satisfy the people covering her.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The most important thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s interview with The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg might not be what it told us about Clinton herself, or the nature of her expected presidential candidacy, but about the political media and how it\u2019s coping with the absence of a clearly contested Democratic primary.The transcript has become a Rorschach test for the political press.
