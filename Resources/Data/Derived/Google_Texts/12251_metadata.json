Our last day at our retail store will be Sunday, August 17th. It is bittersweet, but we are also looking forward to the next chapter of our lives.\n\nThank you so much for supporting us from the beginning when most people were asking the question, \u201cyou\u2019re going to open a bakery that only sells pie??!?\u201d We hope you\u2019ve enjoyed our handmade pies as much as we\u2019ve enjoyed making them for you. Thank you to all the brides and grooms who have given us the honor of making your wedding pies. Most of all, thank you to our amazing staff who have always gone above and beyond throughout the years. We\u2019ll miss you.\n\nPlease stop by at street fair and over the next weeks to enjoy some pie and help us say goodbye. And remember, Pie Fixes Everything!", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Seattle news, 24/7", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "West Seattle Blog...", "description": "(King County Assessor's Office photo)\r\nShoofly Pie Company in The Junction has announced its shop will close next month.
