But Texas is hardly the only state that\u2019s successfully advancing this type of anti-choice agenda. In Louisiana, for instance, lawmakers have been quietly laying the groundwork to shutter clinics for the past several months \u2014 and they\u2019re currently poised to accomplish that goal.\n\nThe latest installment of this saga involves Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), who is currently pushing for a state investigation into Baton Rogue\u2019s only abortion clinic, alleging that it violated federal privacy laws. On Tuesday, Vitter sent a letter to the state\u2019s health department along these lines. Even though the letter doesn\u2019t contain any specific allegations, it asks the department to \u201cimpose serious consequences\u201d on the clinic if the accusations are proven true.\n\nReproductive rights advocates are questioning the timing of Vitter\u2019s concerns. On Wednesday, state lawmakers are scheduled to hear House Bill 388, a measure that\u2019s directly modeled after the new abortion restrictions in Texas. Vitter\u2019s letter, which was released just one day before the final vote, may be intended to influence state lawmakers by reinforcing the myth that reproductive health facilities need tighter regulations.\n\n\u201cIt seems like very suspicious timing that David Vitter would release information about an investigation the day before the House hears the bill for final passage,\u201d Ellie Schilling, the lawyer who represents Louisiana\u2019s abortion clinics, told the Times-Picayune. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure why David Vitter is involving himself in this.\u201d\n\nHB 388 would require the abortion providers in the state to obtain admitting privileges from a local hospital, a medically unnecessary requirement that\u2019s often impossible for clinics to comply with. It will likely force the majority of Louisiana\u2019s five clinics to close.\n\nThis type of legislation is known as the Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP. It\u2019s an indirect method of restricting women\u2019s access to abortion by making it too complicated and costly for clinics to remain operating. In reality, abortion clinics are already highly regulated and extremely safe. But conservatives\u2019 rhetoric around \u201cwomen\u2019s health and safety\u201d has helped advance TRAP laws across the country anyway.\n\nAnd in Louisiana, abortion opponents have furthered this framework through several different means. At the beginning of this year, the state\u2019s Department of Health and Hospitals attempted to regulate abortion clinics out of existence by imposing complicated and burdensome new rules on abortion providers with little public notice. Those rules were eventually rescinded after a massive outcry. But it\u2019s not hard to see why HB 388, which essentially seeks to accomplish the same goal, has been able to advance so easily this session. The state is all too eager to follow in Texas\u2019 footsteps.\n\nIn addition to the admitting privilege requirement, HB 388 includes several other problematic provisions that would limit women\u2019s access to reproductive health care. It would impose a mandatory 24-hour waiting period for surgical abortion procedures. It would also limit the number of abortions that private doctors are allowed to perform before they\u2019re officially considered to be an \u201cabortion provider\u201d \u2014 an obscure policy change that could actually have huge implications for women\u2019s access to the procedure, as the number of clinics dwindles and women increasingly turn to private physicians for first-trimester abortions.\n\nUltimately, these type of restrictions on the medical procedure end up having a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable women, who already struggle to afford the cost of an abortion. Even though Roe v. Wade is still technically the law of the land, an increasing number of harsh state laws ensure that women\u2019s ability to exercise their reproductive rights depend mainly on her bank account and her zip code.\n\n\u201cThe New Orleans Abortion Fund is outraged by this bill, which will push women and their families further into poverty,\u201d Amy Irving, a founding board member of the organization, which provides financial assistance to low-income individuals who need to end a pregnancy, told ThinkProgress. \u201cLouisiana lawmakers continue to pass laws that erode our communities\u2019 social safety net and demonstrate that they do not trust women to make decisions about their healthcare and abortion, in particular. This bill will penalize low income women, especially.\u201d\n\nIn a previous interview with ThinkProgress, Irving said she\u2019s noticed an uptick in the number of New Orleans women resorting to potentially dangerous methods of ending a pregnancy, like buying abortion-inducing drugs on the black market, as they lose access to legal clinics. That dynamic is already unfolding in Texas in the aftermath of its recent clinic closures, and there\u2019s no reason to think the trend won\u2019t continue in Louisiana if the state passes a similar law.\n\nIf Louisiana lawmakers approve HB 388, Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) is expected to immediately sign it into law. When it was first introduced, the governor\u2019s office released a statement praising the legislation, saying \u201cthese reforms will build upon the work Governor Jindal has done to make Louisiana the most pro-life state in the nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "For months, the state has been quietly laying the groundwork to shutter clinics -- and it's poised to accomplish that goal.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "For months, the state has been quietly laying the groundwork to shutter clinics -- and it's poised to accomplish that goal.", "title": "Louisiana Is About To Shut Down Its Abortion Clinics With Texas-Style Restrictions", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/05/21/3439960/louisiana-trying-close-abortion-clinics/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/closed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For months, the state has been quietly laying the groundwork to shutter clinics -- and it's poised to accomplish that goal.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/closed-321x214.jpg", "title": "Louisiana Is About To Shut Down Its Abortion Clinics With Texas-Style Restrictions", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/closed.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/closed.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-21T11:56:41+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb138\"", "article_summary": "Health Louisiana Is About To Shut Down Its Abortion Clinics With Texas-Style Restrictions CREDIT: ShutterstockThe Lone Star State, which now contains a 400-mile swath without a single abortion provider, has become somewhat of a symbol for what happens when harsh state laws force reproductive health clinics out of business.\nAnd in Louisiana, abortion opponents have furthered this framework through several different means.\nIn reality, abortion clinics are already highly regulated and extremely safe.\nOn Wednesday, state lawmakers are scheduled to hear House Bill 388, a measure that\u2019s directly modeled after the new abortion restrictions in Texas.\nIf Louisiana lawmakers approve HB 388, Gov."}
