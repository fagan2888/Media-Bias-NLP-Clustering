Sessions asserted. \u201cSince the founding of the Republic the states have decided marriage, and there\u2019s not one hint in the Constitution there\u2019s a constitutional right to redefine marriage from its current status. At the same time states are considering this in the political process with differing results. It\u2019s the kind of thing that ought to be decided by the people.\u201d\n\nThough gay marriage was already legal in 34 states prior to Friday, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, struck down traditional marriage laws in the remaining states.\n\nLibertarian-leaning Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with the Court\u2019s four liberal Justices to render the decision.\n\nSessions maintained that having five unelected, lifetime-appointed persons \u201cdictating such a tremendous basis is really damaging to the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if these kind of rulings continue unhinged without any constitutional foundation, respect for the Court and the willingness of the people of the United States to just acquiesce to Court rulings is going to be undermined\u2014which would be a colossal, damaging thing to our country,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nFor Sessions, and many others, the hangup isn\u2019t in the disagreement on how marriage is defined, but rather that the Court is taking liberties outside its duty to obey the rule of law\u2014most importantly by interpreting those laws through the lens of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really frustrated about it,\u201d Sessions explained. \u201cWe can disagree with how marriage should be defined, but I don\u2019t think we should be having a diktat from 5 of 9 members of the Court impacting the laws of every state in America.\u201d\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia slammed the decision made by the majority of his colleagues, saying, \u201cA system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\u201d\n\nSims asked Sessions if he agrees with Scalia\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s a constitutional provision that requires such a change, the Supreme Court does not have any basis to order a change,\u201d Sessions responded, enthusiastically. \u201cSo Scalia, gosh, his quote was powerful. This is one of the smartest people ever to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\n\nSessions then reminded proponents of traditional marriage who are now asking what\u2019s next that any reversal of direction now would be \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no appeal from the Supreme Court,\u201d said Sessions, a lawyer and former Alabama Attorney General. \u201cIt takes a constitutional amendment, now, to overturn their decision.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the American people are now without a voice to speak up against what Sessions called an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cI think this a time for the American people to start thinking clearly about how we can send a message to the Court that they are not free to just dictate policy from the bench,\u201d the Senator expressed in response to the last two days\u2019 rulings.\n\n\u201cThe Court is not a superior branch,\u201d he underscored. \u201cIt is not supposed to be setting policy.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans in Congress ran on promises they would \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, which the Supreme Court once again protected in a 6-3 decision Thursday. While the U.S. House voted multiple times to abolish the law, the Senate, which has now been under GOP control for six months, has yet to take such a vote.\n\nSessions said he is optimistic about the opportunity to scrap the law and put in its place a better alternative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pass\u2026 a reform and a replacement of ObamaCare under budget reconciliation, which means it can\u2019t be filibustered,\u201d Sessions explained. \u201cIt can be passed with 51 votes. [Republicans] have 54 votes in the Senate, and though there are differences of opinions about what exactly we should do, I believe we can get the 51 to agree on a plan to fix this thing.\u201d\n\nSessions admitted President Obama will certainly veto any legislations overturning or significantly altering his signature legislation, but said that healthcare is going to be a significant part of the national conversation surrounding the 2016 presidential election, and Congress would certainly be able to work with a Republican president.\n\nYellowhammer Radio airs daily in central and north Alabama from noon-1 p.m. on Superstation 101.1 WYDE and can be streamed online or through the TuneIn app. Audio of Friday\u2019s segment with Senator Sessions can be found below.\n\nLike this article?
