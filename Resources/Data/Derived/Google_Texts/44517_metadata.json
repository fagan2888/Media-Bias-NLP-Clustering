One new feature is designed to help companies limit costs: Employees can be given a fixed sum of money to spend on the plan they pick, with any extra cost coming out of each paycheck.\n\nExchanges have caught on in recent years as a way for employers to give employees more choices of coverage and potentially shift more of the cost to them as well. About 40 million people will pick a health plan for 2018 through an online exchange, up from 6 million for this year, according to Accenture Plc.\n\n\u201cMore people are going to need this high-grade shopping experience, they\u2019re going to want more information, and they\u2019re going to want to take more control over their health care,\u201d Gerry Leonard, president of ADP Benefits Services, said in an interview.\n\nADP, which handles health benefits for about 15 million people, has been expanding its offerings as companies work to comply with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law, known as Obamacare, requires many employers to provide health coverage to more workers and sets rules about what the policies need to include.\n\nManaging Benefits\n\nADP\u2019s website works with its other offerings that help employers manage payroll and benefits. That could help it compete with exchanges offered by firms like Aon Plc, Towers Watson and Marsh & McLennan\u2019s Mercer. Willis Group Holdings Plc said in June that it would merge with Towers Watson, in part to expand in employee benefits such as insurance exchanges.\n\nUSI Insurance Services will help companies pick health plans to offer on ADP\u2019s exchange, though employers also can use their own broker instead.\n\n\u201cThis question of payroll integration is one of the fundamental benefits administration challenges that needs to be solved,\u201d said Rich Birhanzel, managing director for Accenture\u2019s health administration services business. \u201cOne could imagine that that kind of package capability could be attractive to an employer.\u201d\n\nGrowing Demand\n\nCary Grace, chief executive officer of Aon Exchange Solutions, said ADP\u2019s new offering underscores the increasing demand for private insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cADP\u2019s announcement validates our vision of private health exchanges as an important and growing market trend,\u201d Grace said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cAon offers the broadest and deepest portfolio for companies of all sizes and industries.\u201d\n\nA tax on high-cost health plans that starts in 2018 is fueling employers\u2019 search for cheaper coverage options, ADP\u2019s Leonard said. The so-called Cadillac Tax, part of the Affordable Care Act, imposes a 40 percent levy on family plans with premiums that top $27,500 and individual plans costing more than $10,200.\n\n\u201cAs we approach 2018, we\u2019re going to start seeing activity really picking up more,\u201d said Amy Gurchensky, an analyst at consulting firm NelsonHall. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a question of if organizations are going to move to private exchanges. It\u2019s a question of when.\u201d\n\nShifting Costs\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that having employees pick coverage options on a private exchange can keep the total cost down, Leonard said. It does let employers shift more of the expense to their workers, by providing them with a fixed sum of money.\n\nThat could be a good thing for healthier workers, who might need less care. Yet sicker employees could wind up paying more, particularly if the cost of insurance increases more quickly than the size of the employer subsidy.\n\nA tie-up with closely held GoHealth represents a second avenue for cost savings. Through GoHealth, ADP will help employees who don\u2019t get workplace coverage -- such as part-timers -- select health plans on public exchanges, where they might be eligible for subsidies.\n\nThe integration could let employers drop part-time workers from their health plans without making them feel abandoned, according to Ryan Smolek, vice president of operations at GoHealth.\n\n\u201cThere is a calculation that needs to be done about whether the employee is better off under group insurance in the company versus on the exchange,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-06/adp-to-help-employers-set-up-their-own-health-insurance-markets", "title": "ADP Helps Firms Set Up Their Own Health Insurance Markets", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "Automatic Data Processing Inc., the payroll-processing giant, will offer companies a new way for their employees to select health benefits, challenging firms like Towers Watson &amp; Co. and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos."}, "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Automatic Data Processing Inc,Health", "news_keywords": "Automatic Data Processing Inc,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-06/adp-to-help-employers-set-up-their-own-health-insurance-markets", "parsely-title": "ADP Helps Firms Set Up Their Own Health Insurance Markets", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-06T09:00:00.002Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Automatic Data Processing Inc., the payroll-processing giant, will offer companies a new way for their employees to select health benefits, challenging firms like Towers Watson &amp; Co. and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.", "parsely-tags": "Automatic Data Processing Inc,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-08-06T09:00:00.002Z", "parsely-section": "personal-finance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-06/adp-to-help-employers-set-up-their-own-health-insurance-markets", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Automatic Data Processing Inc., the payroll-processing giant, will offer companies a new way for their employees to select health benefits, challenging firms like Towers Watson &amp; Co. and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.", "title": "ADP Helps Firms Set Up Their Own Health Insurance Markets"}, "fb": {"status": "Automatic Data Processing Inc., the payroll-processing giant, will offer companies a new way for their employees to select health benefits, challenging firms like Towers Watson &amp; Co. and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos."}, "parsely-post-id": "NSMJQL6K50XU01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd41\"", "article_summary": "\u201cADP\u2019s announcement validates our vision of private health exchanges as an important and growing market trend,\u201d Grace said in an e-mailed statement.\nADP, which handles health benefits for about 15 million people, has been expanding its offerings as companies work to comply with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nUSI Insurance Services will help companies pick health plans to offer on ADP\u2019s exchange, though employers also can use their own broker instead.\nThrough GoHealth, ADP will help employees who don\u2019t get workplace coverage -- such as part-timers -- select health plans on public exchanges, where they might be eligible for subsidies.\nThe law, known as Obamacare, requires many employers to provide health coverage to more workers and sets rules about what the policies need to include."}
