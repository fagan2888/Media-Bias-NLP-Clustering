The start of the football season is now just a few days away and the East Central Community College field has gotten a facelift.

The new turf at Bailey Stadium on the campus in Decatur is down. The company doing the work, Flowood-based Enviro-Turf, completed similar projects at Meridian High, East Mississippi Community College, and the University of West Alabama in recent years.

East Central President Dr. Billy Stewart says the project has generated a lot of excitement around campus. He also calls it a presentation of resources, showing the school is committed to both academics and athletics.

"One of the things that we needed here at East Central was a field that our teams could play on," Dr. Stewart says. "Not only our football cut, soccer too. We begin to dream about it and this is just one of our accomplishments for one of our visions of 20/20. As I tell people at ECCC, we're eating a big elephant one bite at a time and this just happens to be the next bite and we're just very proud of it, very pleased and we believe that all of our fans and our college is very proud of it."

The Warriors first game on it's new field will take place on Thursday, September 11th when the team plays host to Mississippi Gulf Coast.
