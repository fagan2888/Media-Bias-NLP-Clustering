Or failure to force a punt, which happened on another occasion against the Colts.\n\nThis was a 27-20 defeat that left the Chiefs wondering what might have been.\n\nWhat if their star players \u2014 wide receiver Jeremy Maclin, pass rushers Justin Houston and Tamba Hali, even running back Jamaal Charles \u2014 weren\u2019t dealing with injuries?\n\nWhat if Knile Davis hadn\u2019t had a costly fumble?\n\nWhat if the Chiefs didn\u2019t squander precious seconds at the goal line trying to score their final touchdown, ruining their opportunity to get the ball back?\n\n\u201cNo doubt it was successful,\u201d wide receiver Albert Wilson said of the season, \u201cbut we did have one goal, which was to get to the Super Bowl, and we came up a little short.\u201d\n\nConsider in order the frustrations of the Chiefs\u2019 first defeat in a dozen games.\n\nMaclin hurt his ankle in their playoff win in Houston and did not practice all week. And while he was able to play sparingly Saturday, the speed and quickness that made him such a dangerous target for Alex Smith this season were missing, and he was rendered nearly useless against New England.\n\nThe same could be said of Justin Houston and Tamba Hali, both of whom dealt with ailing knees late in the season. Houston came back from a hyperextended knee to play against the Texans, but he was still experiencing pain and a shadow of himself against the Patriots.\n\nCharles has been out most of the season, and the Chiefs got by with Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware. But both of them were also hobbled in the postseason, hampering Kansas City\u2019s ground game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Smith said of the injuries, which also included several offensive linemen. \u201cBut this time of year, every team\u2019s got them. Every team is dealing with it.\u201d\n\nWith the trio of Charles, West and Ware hobbled by injuries, that forced Davis into action at running back. With a history of fumble troubles, few were surprised when he coughed one up.\n\nThen there was the time management at the end of the game.\n\nOften criticized during his Philadelphia tenure for his time management, Reid was again left to defend his use of the clock during a wrap-up news conference at the practice facility Sunday.\n\nThe Chiefs, trailing 27-13, declined to use any of their timeouts during a 16-play drive that took more than 5 minutes off the clock. Then, with first-and-goal and 2:33 left, the Chiefs allowed 25 seconds to expire before the two-minute warning, and several more seconds to lapse before scoring.\n\nThat left them with 1:13 to go, essentially forcing Kansas City to try an onside kick. New England tight end Rob Gronkowski recovered it, wrapping up the outcome.\n\n\u201cWe work those situations all the time, so we wanted to maintain our timeouts the best we could,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a perfect world. It didn\u2019t quite work out how we wanted.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why the Chiefs huddled in those closing minutes, allowing more time to waste away, Reid replied: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Why not have another play called?\u2019 We had another play, absolutely. But you want to give it your best shot, your best plays in there.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it wasn\u2019t enough. The injuries and miscues and time management problems proved to be too much to overcome, leaving Kansas City with another bitter ending to a memorable season.\n\nAfter their sluggish start, the Chiefs set a franchise record for consecutive wins. They ended a 22-year streak without a playoff victory. They set all kinds of personal records and gave a fanbase that had grown tired of mediocrity a glimpse of what success might be like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always bittersweet if you\u2019re not winning the Super Bowl,\u201d Reid said. \u201cEvery year is different. I got it. And I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that every team is different. But you build foundations. That\u2019s where you start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kansas City Chiefs head into offseason after another playoff letdown", "title": "Kansas City Chiefs head into offseason after another playoff letdown", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/kansas-city-chiefs-head-into-offseason-after-another-playoff-letdown/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117_014955_kansas-city-chiefs.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117_014955_kansas-city-chiefs.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T13:34:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:38:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.\n\u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs have experienced myriad playoff heartbreaks over the years, yet their loss to the New England Patriots on Saturday may have left an entirely different kind of sting.\nThat left them with 1:13 to go, essentially forcing Kansas City to try an onside kick.\nThe injuries and miscues and time management problems proved to be too much to overcome, leaving Kansas City with another bitter ending to a memorable season.\nThis was a 27-20 defeat that left the Chiefs wondering what might have been."}
