According to police, the underground storm cellar was in an old, abandoned well house separate from the woman's home.

The Medical Examiner's office has identified a 43-year-old woman who drowned after becoming trapped in her storm shelter in southeast Oklahoma City.

According to police, officers are responding to the scene at a home in the 7900 block of S.E. 164th. Police said the victim's neighbor found her drowned in the storm cellar Thursday morning.

Thursday afternoon, the ME's office identified the victim as 43-year-old Skylyna Stewart.

According to police, the underground storm cellar was in an old, abandoned well house separate from Stewart's home. A river of floodwater went through the property.

Police said Stewart apparently got in the shelter when the weather turned severe and then the torrential rains hit, causing the shelter to fill up with water. She became trapped and could not get out.

Stewart's death is believed to be the first and only fatality related to Wednesday's severe storms at this time.
