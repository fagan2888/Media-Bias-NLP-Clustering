Joe Harvey.\n\nThe officer then asked if he should attempt to make a traffic stop.\n\nThe dispatcher asked if the officer was in a marked unit, but before the question was answered, the officer dropped his phone to confront the motorcycle rider.\n\nThat confrontation happened at 19th Street and 6th Avenue in Golden. \u201cThe gentleman was off his motorcycle and looked like he was going to start an altercation,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nThe motorcycle rider told the officer that he didn\u2019t believe that he was a police officer, and a struggle ensued, Harvey said. As the officer fired, his wife picked up the cell phone and told the dispatcher that her husband had shot someone.\n\nThe bullet hit the front end of the bike. The motorcycle rider had minor injuries to his hand from flying debris, Harvey said.\n\nNeither the name of the off-duty officer, nor his agency has been released. The incident is under investigation.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Off-duty officer tries to stop Golden road-rage incident, fires weapon", "title": "Off-duty officer tries to stop Golden road-rage incident, fires weapon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/25/off-duty-officer-tries-to-stop-golden-road-rage-incident-fires-weapon/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151026__golden_roadrage2p1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151026__golden_roadrage2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-25T17:12:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:35:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fe3\"", "article_summary": "The officer called 911 to say he was following vehicles involved in a road rage incident on eastbound 6th Avenue, said Golden Capt.\nA off-duty police officer fired his weapon into the front end of a motorcycle while attempting to stop a rider involved in a road rage incident Sunday.\nThe motorcycle rider told the officer that he didn\u2019t believe that he was a police officer, and a struggle ensued, Harvey said.\nNeither the name of the off-duty officer, nor his agency has been released.\nThe dispatcher asked if the officer was in a marked unit, but before the question was answered, the officer dropped his phone to confront the motorcycle rider."}
