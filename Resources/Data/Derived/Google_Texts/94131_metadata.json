Because Alaska has the highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome in the country, and state officials are trying to figure out how to address it. The tests are part of a new two-year initiative led by the University of Alaska, which is spending $400,000 to urge bar patrons to avoid drinking alcohol while they\u2019re expecting.\n\nThe pilot project involves installing wall-mounted pregnancy test dispensers and posters warning against the risks of drinking during pregnancy. \u201cThink before you drink,\u201d the posters caution. Researchers at the University of Alaska hope those public service ads will be more effective when they\u2019re plastered on pregnancy test dispensers, as opposed to simply hanging alone on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis is not a strategy for the chronic alcoholic who is drinking regardless of whatever message they see,\u201d Jody Allen Crowe, who spearheaded a similar program in Minnesota and is partnering with Alaska to install the dispensers, told the Anchorage Daily News. \u201cThis is really focused on the 50 percent of unexpected pregnancies, to find out they are pregnant as early as possible.\u201d\n\nThe pregnancy test initiative was first proposed by Alaska Sen. Pete Kelly (R), who\u2019s looking for ways to use state funds to help prevent the birth defects that can result from being exposed to alcohol in the womb. Compared to the national average, Alaskan women of reproductive age are about 20 percent more likely to binge drink. Alaska Native and American Indian infants are disproportionately affected by prenatal alcohol consumption.\n\nBut Kelly isn\u2019t receptive to all ideas about how to lower the number of women drinking while pregnant. Earlier this year, the lawmaker made headlines by suggesting that it\u2019s not appropriate to use state funds to put birth control in bars, even though that could help prevent pregnancies in the first place. \u201cBirth control is for people who don\u2019t necessarily want to act responsibly,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell them what to do, or help them do it, that\u2019s their business. But if we have a pregnancy test, because someone just doesn\u2019t know. That\u2019s probably a way we can help them.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s GOP colleagues have also actively worked to block low-income women\u2019s access to birth control services, claiming that it\u2019s not the government\u2019s responsibility to fund contraception because it\u2019s easy for everyone to afford it. The state has blocked Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, which would extend preventative health care to additional impoverished women, and recently defeated an amendment to an anti-abortion measure that would have expanded publicly funded family planning services to thousands of Alaskans.\n\nThe nonprofit group that\u2019s installing the pregnancy test dispensers also plans to put condoms in the bar restrooms.
