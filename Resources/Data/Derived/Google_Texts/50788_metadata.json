Ellison, the president of the Florida based St. Matthew\u2019s House, is trying to bring attention to the issue which he says affects people that fall between the $10,000 and $12,000 a year income range. St. Matthew\u2019s House, which takes care of roughly 1,500 people, provides food and shelter to those individuals trying to work their way out of poverty.\n\n\u201cWe generally deal with lower income people trying to get their lives together,\u201d Ellison told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cThese are people that can\u2019t afford their own apartments.\u201d\n\nThose in that income range make too much to qualify for assistance under Obamacare but often times make too little to actually afford coverage or the fee that comes with not being covered. It\u2019s an issue that impacts many of the lower income people Ellison is trying to help.\n\n\u201cI care about these people; I don\u2019t think these people should have to pay a fine,\u201d Ellison continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an unintended consequence of a law that was pushed out before it was thought through.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ellison, the $95 fee is a huge hardship on these individuals. The people he takes care of often can\u2019t afford their own apartments and food, let alone coverage or the fee. In the meantime Ellison is trying to help his residents the best he can and is relying on his community to do the same.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re informing our local doctors,\u201d Ellison noted. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure the medical needs of our people are met.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 4 million people fall into the coverage gap. As its report notes, the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare was supposed to address the problem but some states, including Florida, decided not to enact the expansion because it would owe untold billions of dollars to the federal government after 2017.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that people who fall into the coverage gap will be able to afford ACA coverage without financial assistance,\u201d KFF detailed in its report. \u201cIn 2015, the national average premium for a 40-year-old individual purchasing coverage through the Marketplace was $276 per month for a silver plan and $213 per month for a bronze plan.\u201d\n\nFollow Connor on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
