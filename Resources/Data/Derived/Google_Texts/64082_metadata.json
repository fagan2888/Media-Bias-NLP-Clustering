And this week, amid a government shutdown that sent hundreds of thousands of federal workers home without pay, Americans' confidence in the economy collapsed.\n\nAccording to a CBS News poll released earlier this week, 44% of voters blame Republicans in Congress, while 35% blame President Obama and congressional Democrats. 17% blame both parties equally.\n\nIndependent voters alone, however, are more likely (24%) to cast equal blame on both parties, with 40% blaming Republicans and 30% blaming Democrats.\n\nAnd while politicians remain in gridlock over how to end the government shutdown and raise the statutory debt limit, which the Treasury will hit Oct. 17, UBS senior lobbyist and managing director John Savercool says there is only one way that American opinion will give them a sense of urgency.\n\n\"The key thing to watch over the next week or two is how independent voters react to developments,\" writes Savercool in a note to clients. \"Only if independents swing heavily in favor of one side or the other will polling impact lawmaker thinking and positioning.\"\n\nSavercool expects the current episode of fiscal crisis in D.C. to be resolved by late October, but says it will only be a stop-gap solution.\n\n\"The fights will continue in the future as long as policymakers are unable to agree to a long-term deficit reduction deal, and it won't be long before the parties wrestle again over fiscal policy issues,\" he says. \"Any solution [to the current crisis] is likely to be more modest than ambitious. It is likely to allow Washington to simply move past the current crises as a primary objective and not much more.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Boesler", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "UBS lobbyist John Savercool says the key thing to watch is whether independent voters will increasingly place blame for the crisis on Republicans or Democrats.", "creator": "boes_", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/independent-voters-key-in-congress-fight-2013-10", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5250836aeab8eae148d59772-506-253/analyst-one-key-thing-will-force-members-of-congress-to-rethink-their-positions.jpg", "title": "ANALYST: One Key Thing Will Force Members Of Congress To Rethink Their Positions", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Government shutdown, Debt Ceiling, Polls, Matthew Boesler", "description": "UBS lobbyist John Savercool says the key thing to watch is whether independent voters will increasingly place blame for the crisis on Republicans or Democrats.", "author": "Matthew Boesler", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-05", "sailthru.title": "ANALYST: One Key Thing Will Force Members Of Congress To Rethink Their Positions", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5250836aeab8eae148d59772-50-50/analyst-one-key-thing-will-force-members-of-congress-to-rethink-their-positions.jpg", "news_keywords": "Government shutdown, Debt Ceiling, Polls, Matthew Boesler", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5250836aeab8eae148d59772/analyst-one-key-thing-will-force-members-of-congress-to-rethink-their-positions.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-10-05", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/matthew-boesler"}, "sailthru.description": "UBS lobbyist John Savercool says the key thing to watch is whether independent voters will increasingly place blame for the crisis on Republicans or Democrats.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "UBS lobbyist John Savercool says the key thing to watch is whether independent voters will increasingly place blame for the crisis on Republicans or Democrats.", "title": "ANALYST: One Key Thing Will Force Members Of Congress To Rethink Their Positions", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/independent-voters-key-in-congress-fight-2013-10", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5250836aeab8eae148d59772-1190-625/analyst-one-key-thing-will-force-members-of-congress-to-rethink-their-positions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "ANALYST: One Key Thing Will Force Members Of Congress To Rethink Their Positions", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5250836aeab8eae148d59772/analyst-one-key-thing-will-force-members-of-congress-to-rethink-their-positions.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea26\"", "article_summary": "According to a CBS News poll released earlier this week, 44% of voters blame Republicans in Congress, while 35% blame President Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\"The key thing to watch over the next week or two is how independent voters react to developments,\" writes Savercool in a note to clients.\nIndependent voters alone, however, are more likely (24%) to cast equal blame on both parties, with 40% blaming Republicans and 30% blaming Democrats.\nIt is likely to allow Washington to simply move past the current crises as a primary objective and not much more.\"\n\"Any solution [to the current crisis] is likely to be more modest than ambitious."}
