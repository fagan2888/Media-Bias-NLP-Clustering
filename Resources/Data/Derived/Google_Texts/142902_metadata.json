Folly and Isle of Palms seek federal help to fix eroded beaches.\n\nFolly Beach and Isle of Palms want federal help to fix battered beaches in the wake of the unusually high tides and storms of October.\n\nFolly Mayor Tim Goodwin made an urgent appeal for assistance in a letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nIsle of Palms applied to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for beach restoration funding, said Mayor Dick Cronin.\n\nBoth mayors said they worry that their beaches cannot protect property from another storm like the one associated with Hurricane Joaquin early last month.\n\nBecause of the storm, Folly lost an estimated 25 percent of the $30 million corps beach-restoration project completed 18 months ago, Goodwin said in his letter to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nCronin said IOP is awaiting the results of a post-storm beach survey it commissioned from Coastal Science and Engineering.\n\n\u201cThe contour of the beach throughout the island changed dramatically and a lot of primary dunes have been lost,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lost sand appears to have moved into the surf, he said.\n\nIOP has yet to hear from FEMA, he said.\n\nThe Corps, in response to Goodwin\u2019s letter, has ordered a new beach survey of Folly that is a first step toward a decision on whether the federal government will fund a new but smaller renourishment project than the one completed last year, officials said.\n\nThe Corps will collect new beach-condition data using a four-wheeler outfitted with survey equipment. The process takes a day or two, said spokeswoman Glenn Jeffries.\n\n\u201cIt runs up and down the beach and gets the measurements that we need,\u201d she said.\n\nThe resulting information is analyzed to see if the situation at Folly meets criteria for additional federal renourishment funding in the near term. A similar situation happened in 2005 and 2007 and the corps was able to respond and replace beach that was lost to storms, officials said.\n\nThe Folly renourishment project worked as designed during the storms of October, and without it there would have been more property loss, Jeffries said.\n\nThe corps also is taking a look at shoreline lost at Myrtle Beach in October to see if it qualifies for more federal funding. Like Folly, Myrtle Beach partnered with the corps on a recent erosion fix.\n\nPounding surf generated when Hurricane Joaquin passed far offshore destroyed the protective berm at the back of the beach on Folly for 5 miles of shoreline, Goodwin said.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the material be replaced,\u201d he said in his letter to the corps.\n\nHe also noted that half of the dune-stabilizing vegetation planted during the last Corps project was lost in the early October storm. And the storm stripped away sand covering hundreds of limestone rocks that have reappeared on the beach. The rock material was mixed in with sea-bottom sand that a Corps contractor dredged and pumped ashore to protect the shoreline as part of the $30 million Folly project. A beach rock cleanup was completed but the storm negated its effects because it washed away sand and exposed new rocks. The result is a \u201c100 percent loss\u201d of rock-picking efforts, Goodwin said.\n\nFolly gets millions of dollars in federal help replenishing its beaches because of the recognized effect of the Charleston Harbor jetties which block the southerly flow of beach-replenishing sand. Folly contributed a $5 million match for the $30 million project.\n\nFolly has an agreement with corps for mostly federally-funded beach renourishment about every seven years. If a new, smaller project is approved for the near term, the federal government would cover the entire cost, officials said.\n\nFolly consultant and coastal scientist Nicole Elko has determined that about 25 percent of the corps project that pumped 1.5 million cubic yards onto the beach was lost in early October. The city hopes that the beach renourishment will last another five years, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that they can withstand another storm like this without (property) damage,\u201d Elko said.\n\nIn late September, unusually high tides known as king tides caused erosion. The combination of the tides and the subsequent Joaquin-related storm was a \u201cdouble whammy,\u201d Elko said.\n\nHer survey of conditions at Folly happened not long after Joaquin passed offshore. The effect on the beach when the king tides returned in late October has not been documented.\n\n\u201cThe beach is probably in worse condition now,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Storm-ravaged beaches prompt federal aid requests from Folly, IOP, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Army Corps of Engineers,beach erosion,Folly Beach,Isle of Palms", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Folly Beach and Isle of Palms want federal help to fix battered beaches in the wake of the unusually high tides and storms of October.", "title": "Storm-ravaged beaches prompt federal aid requests from Folly, IOP", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151108/151109513/storm-ravaged-beaches-prompt-federal-aid-requests-from-folly-iop", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC16/151109513/AR/0/AR-151109513.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC16/151109513/AR/0/AR-151109513.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Folly Beach and Isle of Palms want federal help to fix battered beaches in the wake of the unusually high tides and storms of October.", "title": "Storm-ravaged beaches prompt federal aid requests from Folly, IOP", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC16/151109513/AR/0/AR-151109513.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151109513}}, "keywords": "Storm-ravaged beaches prompt federal aid requests from Folly, IOP , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Army Corps of Engineers,beach erosion,Folly Beach,Isle of Palms", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-08T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-08T19:55:00Z", "author": "Prentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Folly Beach and Isle of Palms want federal help to fix battered beaches in the wake of the unusually high tides and storms of October."}, "article_summary": "Beach erosion is visible Thursday during low tide on Folly Beach.\nFolly Beach and Isle of Palms want federal help to fix battered beaches in the wake of the unusually high tides and storms of October.\nThe lost sand appears to have moved into the surf, he said.\nHe also noted that half of the dune-stabilizing vegetation planted during the last Corps project was lost in the early October storm.\nBecause of the storm, Folly lost an estimated 25 percent of the $30 million corps beach-restoration project completed 18 months ago, Goodwin said in his letter to the Army Corps of Engineers."}
