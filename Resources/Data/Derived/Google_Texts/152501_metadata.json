The company provides human resources services to small and midsize businesses in the U.S and Canada.\n\nIt does payroll processing, handles aspects of employment law compliance and offers employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans and workers' compensation insurance.\n\nTriNet delivers its services via a cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. Its customers come from a diverse mix of end markets including technology, life sciences, property management, professional services, banking and financial services, retail, manufacturing and hospitality.\n\nEmployers Get Expertise\n\nMost of these customers lack the staff and resources to weave through complex human resources and employee benefit regulations.\n\nRather than do the work themselves, they outsource it to TriNet and peers such asAutomatic Data Processing ( ADP ),Paychex ( PAYX ) andInsperity ( NSP ).\n\nTriNet operates under a professional employer organization ( PEO ) model in which clients enter into a shared employment relationship. TriNet is the employer of record for work site employees, or WSEs, while clients retain day-to-day control and direction of the WSEs.\n\nObamaCare Costs Factor In\n\nAccording to industry data cited by Timothy McHugh, an analyst at William Blair & Co., the PEO sector grew at a compound annual rate of about 10% from 1995 to 2013, the last year data are available.\n\n\"We believe that this growth is occurring because PEOs provide a strong value proposition for small businesses, which are facing increasing regulation, a growing number of potential point-solution providers, and upward pressure on insurance rates as a result of the Affordable Care Act,\" he said in a report initiating coverage on TriNet.\n\nHe said TriNet's \"vertically oriented salesforce, multiproduct approach and transparent and flexible pricing\" are unique in the field.\n\n\"In our view, TriNet's technology ranks at the high end of the PEO sector and there are solid benefits to scale in this business,\" he added.\n\nIt's hard to argue with TriNet's sales results. The 26-year-old firm, which had its initial public offering in March, has run off nine straight quarters of double-digit-percentage revenue growth. Bottom-line performance has been choppier.\n\nOn Aug. 4, the company reported second-quarter revenue of $525 million, up 44% from the previous year. Adjusted earnings came in at 24 cents a share, topping consensus estimates.\n\nTriNet officials declined to comment for this story. On a Q2 conference call with analysts, CEO Burton Goldfield said TriNet has been adding clients who previously tried \"to stitch together their HR function through insurance brokers, software and limited internal capabilities, what we term an unbundled solution.\"\n\nAbout 75% of TriNet's new clients in the second quarter had not previously used a bundled solution, he said. That was about the same percentage as the first quarter.\n\n\"We witnessed a very strong performance across each of our bundled product offerings in the second quarter,\" Goldfield said. \"We saw healthy trends across multiple business segments and multiple geographies, with particular strength in California, New York, Massachusetts and Florida.\"\n\nFinancial Companies Sign On\n\nOne product that did well during the quarter was Ambrose, which TriNet acquired in July 2013.\n\nAmbrose helps hedge funds, private equity firms and other financial companies handle tasks such as payroll preparation, tax reporting and health plan management. As part of the service, TriNet provides a dedicated HR associate for personal support to all client employees.\n\n\"We saw several high-profile clients sign on to the Ambrose product due to our high-end ACA compliant health benefit plans,\" Goldfield said. \"Our Ambrose product is also benefiting from strong word-of-mouth. ...Frankly, being a public company has helped in this sector as well.\"\n\nPerformance Outpaces Peers\n\nTriNet had around 259,000 WSEs at the end of the second quarter, a gain of 31% from the previous year. That figure included approximately 13,000 WSEs acquired from Ambrose. Organic growth was 23%.\n\n\"Notably, both revenue and WSE growth came in ahead of peers ADP and (Insperity),\" JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang noted in a report on TriNet's Q2 results.\n\nHuang reckons TriNet will benefit from several different growth drivers in coming quarters, including increasing demand for bundled HR services. That market is only 4% penetrated, he says.\n\nHe also expects TriNet to benefit from an increase in health care regulation, which should convince more small and midsize businesses to outsource.\n\nMeanwhile, TriNet's \"vertically oriented sales force\" should drive market share gains, Huang said.\n\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TriNet to post full-year earnings per share of $1.09 in 2014 and $1.35 in 2015.\n\nThe company's stock debuted at an IPO price of 16 in March. It rose as high as 29.96 on Aug. 13 and currently trades near 28.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Investing,Investing Ideas", "og": {"url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/trinet-hr-services-boom-as-red-tape-swamps-businesses-cm383832", "site_name": "NASDAQ.com", "image": "http://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "TriNet HR Services Boom As Red Tape Swamps Businesses"}, "Robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "nasdaq news, market headlines, market news, stock market headlines, stock market news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T05:03:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "More than a million new business establishments formed in the U.S. last year, according to federal government data, and history suggests that roughly."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7048\"", "article_summary": "If you make your money serving small businesses, this can't be a very heartening figure.\nThe company provides human resources services to small and midsize businesses in the U.S and Canada.\nHuang reckons TriNet will benefit from several different growth drivers in coming quarters, including increasing demand for bundled HR services.\nHe also expects TriNet to benefit from an increase in health care regulation, which should convince more small and midsize businesses to outsource.\nIts customers come from a diverse mix of end markets including technology, life sciences, property management, professional services, banking and financial services, retail, manufacturing and hospitality."}
