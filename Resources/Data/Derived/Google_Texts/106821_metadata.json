What they are, what they do \u2014 it\u2019s a bit elusive and hard to squeeze into a nutshell.\n\nThere are, of course, publicly available rules and regulations for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Service\u2019s (CMS) Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings programs. A menagerie of organizations \u2014 integrated delivery systems, independent practice associations, hospital groups, hybrid organizations run jointly by hospitals and physicians \u2014 are participating.\n\nMeanwhile, detailed information about the ACO contracts that organizations have negotiated with commercial payers is hard to come by. Adding to the confusion is that the word accountable is now very much in vogue because of ACOs and is being used to describe almost any payment arrangement or incentive system that\u2019s not strictly fee for service.\n\n\u2018We define an ACO as the group of providers\u2019 with accountable care contracts, and often a private and public ACO is the same entity, says David Muhlestein, of Leavitt Partners.\n\nSo it\u2019s a relief to talk with David Muhlestein and experience a little bit of clarity. Muhlestein is director of research at Leavitt Partners, the Salt Lake City health consulting company founded by Michael Leavitt, the former Utah governor and health and human services secretary in the George W. Bush administration, and Rich McKeown, Leavitt\u2019s chief of staff at HHS. Muhlestein\u2019s employer has both feet in the ACO consulting business, so he\u2019s hardly a neutral bystander. But Leavitt has been an important source of information about ACOs since early 2011 when the company started keeping a running ACO tally and making it publicly available. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Muhlestein says, the company leaders decided that providing ACO advice would be a fruitful line of business, along with health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion.\n\nWhat counts as an ACO?\n\n\u2018We started tracking ACOs out of necessity because no one else was doing it,\u2019 he says. To conduct their research, Muhlestein and his colleagues scrounge online for ACO news and press releases and survey the organizations they identify.\n\nIt\u2019s a business school adage that you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure. A corollary might be that you can\u2019t count what you can\u2019t define. Muhlestein deploys more elaborate definitions (Figure 1), but for quick, handy comprehension he offers this three-part, flashcard-sized definition of ACOs: a provider-led organization that takes on the financial risk for the health care of a defined population.\n\nFigure 1 What is accountable care?\n\nProvider-led and defined population: Those are pretty straightforward and easy boxes to check. It\u2019s the financial risk aspect where things are muddy. Some provider-led organizations get pay-for-performance programs and care management fees, \u2018but they are not really at financial risk for the population,\u2019 notes Muhlestein.\n\nThe scope of the risk also matters. Primary care physicians organized into a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) may be at financial risk for the care they provide but not for the care they don\u2019t: \u2018If one of their patients is admitted to the hospital, it is not going to affect their per-member, per-month care management,\u2019 says Muhlestein.\n\nIn his \u2014 and Leavitt Partners\u2019 \u2014 book, what separates ACO claimants from the real deal is that the ACO shares financial responsibility for all of the health care of a population and \u2018not just your own little slice of it.\u2019 The mechanisms for sharing that financial risk vary and include old-fashioned capitated payments as well as the elaborate shared savings and losses schemes used by CMS and others.\n\nContracts and covered lives\n\nMuhlestein\u2019s most recent running total shows that the pace of the creation of new ACOs has leveled off this year after a burst of activity last year (Figure 2). The dynamics of early adoption is one reason for the trend line plateau.\n\nFigure 2 Overall trajectory\n\nAfter the initial wave, more cautious organizations are inclined to wait and see what works for ACOs \u2014 and that is far from clear yet, says Muhlestein: \u2018All the followers \u2014 the organizations coming second \u2014 want to see a path forward.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, though, existing ACOs are negotiating additional contracts, so the number of covered lives has climbed faster than the number of ACOs (Figure 3). Adding contracts means organizations can take advantage of the IT, management, and other investments they made to get the ACO off the ground. A second or third bite of the ACO apple may also allow for some tinkering with quality metrics. Ideally, these metrics are both convenient and inexpensive and truly improve outcomes and reduce costs. The ACO with several contracts may also speed the weaning of physicians and other providers off of the volume-driven fee-for-service practice of medicine. \u2018You no longer are living in two worlds,\u2019 says Paul Gardner, a senior analyst at Leavitt Partners.\n\nFigure 3 Covered lives\n\nMuhlestein says he has counted more than 900 ACO contracts and found that roughly a third of the more than 300 organizations participating in the CMS ACO programs also have commercial ACO contracts. Notably, Muhlestein avoids using the term \u2018commercial ACOs\u2019 because it suggests the organizations with commercial contracts are different from those in the CMS program when, in fact, they\u2019re often the same. \u2018We define an ACO as the group of providers that enters into accountable care contracts and we don\u2019t differentiate with names based on which contracts they have.\n\n\u2018We try to refer to CMS\u2019s ACOs as \u2018ACOs participating in the MSSP [Medicare Shared Savings Program]\u2019 or \u2018ACOs in the Pioneer program\u2019; for commercial contracts we call them \u2018ACOs with commercial contracts.\u2019 There are some people who refer to the latter as \u2018commercial ACOs\u2019.\u2019\n\nACO map shaped by local factors\n\nMuhlestein has several charts showing the geographic distribution of ACOs (Figure 4).

Some markets are dominated by brand-name provider organizations that do well with fee-for-service payment and see no reason to join or establish an ACO. In others, when the major provider sets up shop as an ACO, others are tugged along. State policies and programs can be a major factor.\n\n\u2018To be an ACO is a competitive edge [in Florida]. And if your competitors are doing it, then you\u2019d better do it, too.\u2019\n\nIn Oregon, for example, the state\u2019s Medicaid program has encouraged providers taking care of its beneficiaries to set up ACO-like coordinated care organizations (CCOs).

Figure 5 ACO sponsoring entities   Muhlestein has also come up with an ACO taxonomy (Figure 6) that includes six different types of organizations, ranging from what he has dubbed full-spectrum integrated systems \u2014 think Kaiser Permanente \u2014 to expanded physician groups.

Fisher, MD, MPH, the Dartmouth professor credited with inventing ACOs, recently published a cluster analysis that resulted in a not-dissimilar ACO taxonomy of three groups: large, integrated systems; smaller, physician-led practices; and a hybrid set of groups run jointly by hospitals and physicians.

Some groups are employing hospitalists to help manage inpatient care and oversee the discharge to outpatient, according to Muhlestein.
