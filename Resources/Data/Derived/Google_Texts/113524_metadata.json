One candidate accuses the IRS of auditing him because he\u2019s a strong Christian but he also promises to regulate immigration based on the religion of the immigrant.\n\nThere seems something contradictory about those two positions.\n\nBut, what is \u201creligious freedom?\u201d\n\nThere are two things to know from the start. One is the that the 13 original colonies did not invent or create religious freedom with the ratification of the Constitution and its First Amendment. That Amendment, which covers several freedoms, says in part, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d\n\nIt goes on to list the freedoms of speech, the press, assembly and petition for redress (of grievances). The Founding Fathers, after the Constitution was ratified in 1789, went on to prepare several Amendments, the first 10 of which came to be known as the Bill of Rights. This was then ratified by the states and adopted in 1791.\n\nBut, it is significant that the First Amendment made to our founding charter was all about the freedoms of citizens and restrictions on government power, and the first freedom described in the First Amendment is the freedom of religion.\n\nThe Amendment restricted Congress per se, because it was beyond the imagination of those Founding Fathers that the president or Supreme Court could so far fail in their constitutional roles as to attempt to \u201cmake law,\u201d since Congress and only Congress has that assignment in the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution further restricts the Federal government with the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which state, respectively, \u201cThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u201d And, \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of the Constitution is about designating (\u201cenumerated powers\u201d) certain obligations and duties of the three branches and restricting their power everywhere else. The Amendments were to clarify the nature of limited government, \u201cCongress shall make no law...\u201d\n\nThe notion of freedom of religion is part of the essence of humanity, what Jefferson referred to as \u201cinalienable rights\u201d in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAn inalienable right is a right from which a person cannot be separated while still being treated as a person. It inheres in his identity as a person. This is a truth that should be \u201cself-evident.\u201d\n\nSearch Mr. Google for \u201cinalienable\u201d and the first thing to pop up is this: \u201cfreedom of religion, the most inalienable of all human rights.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sort of an archaic use of alienate or alien, for what inalienable meant back then was inseparable.\n\nTake away a person\u2019s life, liberty or pursuit of happiness and you have declared that you don\u2019t regard him or her as a true \u201cperson\u201d under law. Thus, the just and proper complaint of slaves at that time and all the way to 1863. And thus the just and proper complaint, I think, of the unborn, who cannot speak for themselves, and who, without being consulted, may have their right to life taken from them under our current Roe v. Wade regime.\n\nGovernment is not a perfect vehicle by any estimation. The \u201cgovernment of men\u201d is always and ever in conflict with the \u201cgovernment of laws\u201d in old John Adams\u2019 formulation.\n\nSo, because freedom of religion is an inalienable right, the Constitution of the U.S. would more properly be said to have \u201cacknowledged\u201d or \u201crecognized\u201d that prior inalienable right, rather than to have \u201cinvented\u201d or \u201cenacted\u201d or \u201cassigned\u201d it to citizens.\n\nThe concept of freedom of religion does have a beginning though, first being talked about in a way that we would recognize in the 4th-century church under Emperor Constantine who was influenced by a theologian by the name of Lactantius.\n\nOften today we understand freedom of religion as a species of \u201ctoleration.\u201d You might hear it said that one should tolerate all religions because who can know for sure which is right?\n\nIn addition, toleration has taken on some of the cast of religion itself for those who are religion-less, coming to be used as a sort of unofficial litmus test, to the end that those who do not practice and exhibit toleration should not be tolerated.\n\nThe incoherent nature of this confusion \u2014 what must be tolerated and how that must be enforced \u2014 brings us back to the original idea of religious freedom. Those early Christians like Lactantius saw clearly that a religion that wasn\u2019t free, wasn\u2019t voluntary, let\u2019s say, was a mere simulacrum that didn\u2019t really fulfill the idea of a religion. Tolerance is not the originating value, freedom is.\n\nFor Lactantius, religion has to do with love of God and purity of mind. This cannot be forced. Lactantius considered that religion cannot be imposed on someone, it can only be by persuasion that it might make its way in the world and with the hearts of individuals.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d says Lactantius, \u201crequires freedom of the will as [much as] religion.\u201d\n\nAs Robert L. Wilken says in the journal First Things, \u201cLactantius claims that coercion is inimical to the nature of religion. This is the first theological rationale for religious freedom, because it is the first rationale to be rooted in the nature of God and of devotion to God.\u201d\n\nThe second thing to say about the freedom of religion is a correction of the way the current administration has taken to referring to this first of freedoms, and that is by proclaiming the importance of the \u201cfreedom of worship.\u201d\n\nThis is a distortion of the First Amendment and of the whole idea of freedom as understood in 1789.\n\nCongress shall not \u201cprohibit the free exercise\u201d of religion, and the exercise of religion goes far beyond worship. It\u2019s obvious if Congress has the prior right to define what religion actually is, then it can define its free exercise out of existence. Too many administration spokesmen have made this slip of the tongue lately, assuming that\u2019s all that it is.\n\nPart of the context of the 18th century was the jailing, fining or even flogging of Baptist preachers and teachers for evangelizing or proselytizing in predominantly Anglican colonies like Virginia. There was a great deal of conflict like this in those colonies that had an \u201cestablished\u201d church, such as Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n\nBut, the First Amendment was not written just so Baptists could stay inside their houses and chapels and worship in private to their heart\u2019s content, but not be allowed to follow the dictates, the mandates of Jesus\u2019 words, \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel.\u201d\n\nFree exercise covers much more than worship inside a sanctuary. Free exercise means the right to practice one\u2019s faith. It means the freedom to proselytize, to wear a cross, or a Jewish yarmulke, or a Muslim headscarf or a Sikh turban, to feed or shelter the homeless in places where neighbors are offended, to be exempt from participating in organized violence (Quakers), to be exempt from pledging allegiance to the flag (Jehovah\u2019s Witness), to be allowed to homeschool one\u2019s children (the Amish).\n\nFreedom of religion can be understood positively and negatively, so that sometimes it is freedom from coercion into activities that would violate one\u2019s religious conscience. For a Catholic organization, of nuns, for example, it might mean the freedom not to be required to provide contraception for its employees, contra the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements.\n\nReligion is not just thoughts and beliefs and prayers in a secluded space but the practice of (for Christians) following the example of Christ, or the law of Moses for Jews. Religion at its root means to bind together, like the words ligament or ligature.\n\nTherefore, to restrict and proscribe outward the behaviors of like-minded people that bind them together with their brothers and sisters and to God, is essentially to vaunt oneself higher than God and assert that only the state may dictate how one may and how one may not \u201cexercise\u201d one\u2019s religion.\n\nAny government that willingly and knowingly undermines this first and most important of freedoms has abrogated its reason for existence and abandoned its own legitimacy. Governments are instituted by God for the purposes of justice and liberty and order and peace.\n\nSteve Odom is pastor of Central Christian Church on East Main St. in Murfreesboro.
