Washington (CNN) - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he's not in favor of the Republican-led strategy to defund the federal health care law by tying it to a spending bill, a maneuver that risks a government shutdown if Congress doesn't reach a deal before the Tuesday deadline.

Asked in a CBS News interview if Republicans should be threatening a shutdown over Obamacare, the Republican governor said "no."



"I think there's got to be a solution other than that," he continued. "I think quite frankly, to be fair, I don't think you hear responsible Republican leaders advocating a shutdown of the government."

Christie is often mentioned as a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate along with Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who have all been at the front of the defund-Obamacare effort that could lead to a shutdown.

Some conservatives say they're not trying to shut down the government; rather, they say their plan keeps the government afloat. If the measure fails, it's the Democrats who are voting against it, they say.

But moderate Republicans in the Senate tend to argue the tactic is too dangerous. And Christie agrees.

"I think it's always irresponsible if you're running the government to be advocating for shutting it down," he said. "That by definition is a failure. You gotta work it out."

The governor, who's up for re-election in November, said he's confident Congress will "work it out" this weekend.

"I don't think anyone wants to go down that road," he said.
