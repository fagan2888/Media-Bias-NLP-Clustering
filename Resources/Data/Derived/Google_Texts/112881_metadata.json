After all, many states with Republican governors and legislators realize having the federal government cover 100% of the costs of the expansion for three years and never less than 90% thereafter is a good thing. Indeed, the NC Institute of Medicine estimated that NC actually saves $65 million over the next eight years because state and local governments are already paying so much for mental health and expensive ER care for folks who would get Medicaid coverage. And, of course, there\u2019s the fact that the federal government has never not paid its share of the Medicaid program to any state since Medicaid\u2019s inception in 1965. Even during last year\u2019s fiercely partisan partial federal government shutdown, Medicaid money kept flowing to the states just as it always has. Finally, of course, Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t permanent. NC legislators can always change their mind and rescind the expansion if indeed, the \u201cmoney isn\u2019t there.\u201d Some states did put this in as part of their expansion programs, for example requiring that the expansion automatically end if the federal government\u2019s share ever dipped below paying for 90% of the costs.\n\nTo these good reasons for expansion let me add one more: For NC legislators to take the stance that we shouldn\u2019t take federal money for major state-federal projects in NC because \u201cit might run out\u201d is highly hypocritical. Why? On the same day \u2013 in fact in the same hour \u2013 as NC House members passed the bill rejecting the Medicaid expansion in North Carolina citing as one of the major reasons that the federal money might \u201cnot always be there,\u201d they passed another bill. This second bill \u2013 taken up immediately after the vote blocking federal Medicaid money in NC, was on a bill paving the way for NC to obtain major federal government funding for the Interstate 540 loop south of Raleigh. [See the \u201cBlock Medicaid Expansion\u201d bill here. See the I-540 bill here. See news coverage of the federal money and the I-540 bill here. See the NC House Calendar for the day in question here.]\n\nThe I-540 bill \u2013 of course \u2013 sailed through the NC House with no one questioning that the millions of dollars of matching federal investment for Raleigh\u2019s latest loop freeway might not come through. Indeed, some House members stood up to talk about the importance of getting matching federal money for this southern loop when, just a few minutes before, they had been questioning whether matching federal money for health care would be available. How do I know this? I was sitting in the NC House chamber and heard them speak.\n\nA Medicaid expansion in NC would mean $15 billion in federal money coming to NC over the next eight years. States that have already expanded Medicaid this year are just starting to see the enormous economic benefits that sort of investment in a state can generate, not to mention the savings and improvements in general well-being of their citizens. I know it\u2019s hard to argue against this sort of investment in our state\u2019s health, but politicians certainly shouldn\u2019t try by using arguments that are so blatantly hypocritical.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d5a\"", "article_summary": "A Medicaid expansion in NC would mean $15 billion in federal money coming to NC over the next eight years.\nIndeed, some House members stood up to talk about the importance of getting matching federal money for this southern loop when, just a few minutes before, they had been questioning whether matching federal money for health care would be available.\nEven during last year\u2019s fiercely partisan partial federal government shutdown, Medicaid money kept flowing to the states just as it always has.\nThis second bill \u2013 taken up immediately after the vote blocking federal Medicaid money in NC, was on a bill paving the way for NC to obtain major federal government funding for the Interstate 540 loop south of Raleigh.\n[See the \u201cBlock Medicaid Expansion\u201d bill here."}
