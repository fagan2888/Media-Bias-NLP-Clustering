In East Germany, most of the scorn was saved for the party leader and head-of-state Erich Honecker. His portraits were vandalized and altered, representing widespread anger and charges that he was a war criminal resulting from the shooting deaths at the Berlin Wall. Mr. Honecker avoided trial because of deteriorating health and was allowed to be exiled in Chile.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe East German flag, with the central state seal cut out of the middle, was waved in opposition rallies, indicating a desire to return to some notion of unified German statehood, suggested by the historic black, red and yellow stripes of Weimar. And perhaps the most striking example was a bust of Lenin, once white, that was painted in the midst of the October uprising in Leipzig, using Western-made fluorescent pink and green paint.\n\nThese kinds of iconoclastic gestures had occurred within the Soviet bloc even before the watershed moment of 1989. Following the end of Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s reign in the Soviet Union, his fall from grace was represented in his crude removal from an official painting marking the occasion of the 22nd Party Congress. He remains as a scratched out ghost-like figure \u2014 just enough was left to remind viewers of the shift in party-line. His successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was attacked in the early 1980s by street protesters who painted \u201cWHY!\u201d in English over his portrait. The late 1980s saw a rise in dissident art with ample use of irony to help drive the point home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCollective memory and the desire for a particular national, political, or even religious identity are often bound up in historical sites and objects of commemoration and the way in which they are preserved or destroyed. From the mass destruction of Christian icons during the Reformation, to the appropriation of royal emblems during the French Revolution, to the vandalism of fascist art during and after World War II, history is filled with examples of manipulated images and defaced symbols of power \u2014 often these serve as an opposition rallying cry or a means to exorcise historical demons.\n\nPhoto\n\nSubverting icons of authority to demonstrate the state\u2019s lack of control over its own symbols has often been very effective. Likewise, mocking the seriousness of those symbols to undermine the visual threats that many regimes rely on to maintain order has long been a useful tool for protesters.\n\nBut the destruction or removal of symbols as a means of national reconciliation, building consensus, or cultivating a new collective memory is rarely successful.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, monuments and historical sites fell victim to what some German observers call the M\u00fcllphase, or \u201ctrash phase\u201d in which the materials of one era are physically thrown out to make room for a new one. Throughout the 1990s, bronze sculptures of old political heroes were melted down, artwork was de-accessioned or transferred to historical art depots, thereby deprioritizing it as art.\n\nEven the Palace of the Republic, the most important building constructed in the former East Germany, was disassembled in 2008. It housed the seat of government and hosted a range of recreational activities for citizens, including bowling, dancing and cafes. It did not align with the new historical narrative for contemporary Germany.\n\nNevertheless, the removal or dismemberment of these monuments or installations from their original locations, as most of the Berlin Wall was in 1990, did not resolve the often complex historical problems that they represented. The grinding of the wall into gravel did not eliminate the \u201cMauer im Kopf,\u201d or \u201cWall in the Head.\u201d In fact, such destruction sometimes makes the process of reconciliation more difficult because the absence of physical reminders within the urban landscape only pushes the invisible psychological scarring further into the recesses \u2014 until it erupts.\n\nThe Lenin statues have been treated by Ukrainian protesters as a stand-in for Russia itself. And while it surely is a captivating media moment and will perhaps galvanize like-minded protesters, it isn\u2019t likely to play a positive role in helping Ukrainians to come to terms with their complicated past and it is certainly not going to change the reality of Ukraine\u2019s geographic happenstance, sandwiched between Russia and the European Union.\n\nOnce historical sites and statues are gone, they do not come back. This is not just unfortunate for historians and museums but also for those whose history (whether glorious or uncomfortable) is being destroyed. It precludes the possibility of a public place for contemplation and psychological recovery. Ultimately, eradicating history in the pursuit of a revised national narrative represents a lack of confidence that past traumas and current debates will be fairly sorted in the future.\n\nIn Ukraine, the struggle for ownership of the past continues to unfold. And while the protesters\u2019 destruction of monuments might hasten their victory, it does not mean they will have an easy time putting their fragmented country back together.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140303065204, "twitter": {"description": "Destroying Soviet symbols might offer fleeting satisfaction to protesters but won\u2019t help build a better future.", "title": "Smashing Lenin Won\u2019t Save Ukraine", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/opinion/smashing-lenin-wont-save-ukraine.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742405"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/opinion/04iht-edjampolledeart/04iht-edjampolledeart-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/opinion/smashing-lenin-wont-save-ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742405", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/opinion/smashing-lenin-wont-save-ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 3, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Kiev (Ukraine),Russia,Ukraine,Demonstrations  Protests  and Riots,Monuments and Memorials (Structures)", "news_keywords": "Russia,Ukraine", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Justinian A.
