The measure (House Bill 1162) was approved by the Republican-controlled House last week by a vote of 60 to 10.\n\nSex selective abortion (also referred to as \u201cgender-based abortion\u201d) is the practice of terminating a pregnancy because of a fetus\u2019 predicted sex. It\u2019s common in places such as China and India, where male offspring are more highly prized than females.\n\nObviously, the sex selective abortion rate in America is hard to track, since women seeking abortions aren\u2019t required to provide a reason why they want to terminate their pregnancies. But based on the sex ratios of babies born here, the practice seems to be rare.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t happen. But\u2014at the risk of sounding like a sociopath\u2014so what? A woman\u2019s reproductive rights aren't invalidated just because we may not like her motivations. Women terminate pregnancies for all sorts of reasons\u2014economic hardship, medical conditions, simply not desiring to have a child. And, perhaps, to try again for a more preferred sex next time. Who are government officials to say which reasons are valid and which are not?\n\nThe whole thing reeks of thought policing: You can have an abortion, but only if we deem your attitudes toward it appropriate. I\u2019ve never been a fan of rape exceptions for the same reason. Either abortion (up to whatever point) is legal, or it isn\u2019t. The business of why shouldn't come into play. If sex selective abortions were so common as to create widescale gender imbalance, perhaps the issue might warrant attention (perhaps). But that is nowhere near the case in the United States.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s potential gender-based abortion ban is a solution in search of a problem. Here\u2019s the bill\u2019s sponsor, State Rep. Jenna Haggar, when asked in a hearing last Wednesday whether gender-based abortions actually happen in South Dakota.\n\nREP. JENNA HAGGAR: \u201cYes, as of right now, if a woman were to walk into an abortion clinic and say, \u2018I would like to have an abortion for no other reason than my unborn baby is a girl\u2019\u2026she absolutely would get an abortion.\u201d REP. TROY HEINERT: \u201cDo you have an instance of where that occurred?\u201d HAGGAR: \u201cWhat I know is that abortions up to 14 weeks right now are currently legal, so yes, I do believe that occurs.\u201d HEINERT: \u201cI guess that proves to me that is based on assumption\u2026The prime sponsor just said that she believes it happens, but can\u2019t prove that it happens.\n\nHaggar was undeterred, pointing out that international data \u201cconsistently (show) higher ratios of males over females...particularly in certain Asian countries.\u201d But since when do we set American policy based on what people are doing in Asian countries? Quick, somebody draft legislation banning betel leaf!\n\nSouth Dakota wouldn\u2019t be the first state to pass a bill banning sex selective abortion. Seven states (Arizona, Illinois, Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma) have already done so, and the issue was brought before the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. But the laws are\u2014at best\u2014little more than a feel-good circle-jerking opportunity for legislators (and at worst a time-wasting ploy to paint opponents as promoting a war on little girls). Because women aren\u2019t required to state why they want an abortion in order to get one, gender-based abortion bans accomplish effectively nothing.\n\nAnd even if women were forced to justify their reasons for terminating a pregnancy (under the South Dakota law, physicians would be required to ask those seeking abortions whether they're doing it because of the sex of the fetus), what's to stop them from simply concealing their true motivation? Do we start outfitting Planned Parenthood clinics with lie detectors? As Ed Kilgore wrote at Washington Monthly: \"Proponents of this kind of legislation must think Asians are not only misogynist, but too stupid to come up with another reason for seeking an otherwise entirely legal abortion.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s all too easy for politicians to drum up hysteria and support for these types of pointless abortion restrictions. I\u2019m glad to see at least some South Dakota politicans pushing back against the legislation.\n\n\u201cI think everybody in this room knows where everybody stands when it comes to this issue. I don\u2019t think anyone is \u2018pro abortion,\u2019\u201d Rep. Heinert said at last Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cMy point is it takes courage to stand up and say, \u2018This law is unneeded.\u2019 If this was happening in South Dakota, then bring it. Show me some instances where this happened\u2026but it takes courage to say, \u2018This is an unneeded law, it\u2019s unneeded regulation.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Despite having absolutely zero evidence that sex-selective abortions are a problem in South Dakota, state legislators are trying to pass a bill banning", "title": "South Dakota House Passes Pointless Ban on Sex Selective Abortions", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/26/sex-selective-abortion-ban-south-dakota", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13934516531388.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite having absolutely zero evidence that sex-selective\nabortions are a problem in South Dakota, state legislators are\ntrying to pass a bill banning such procedures.
