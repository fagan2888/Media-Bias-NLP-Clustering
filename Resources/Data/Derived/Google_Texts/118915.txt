For the second year in a row United National Indian Tribal Youth, or UNITY, is partnering with Nike N7 to support health promotion and disease prevention at its annual National UNITY Conference. The conference will be held July 10-14 in conjunction with the White House Tribal Youth Gathering on July 9.

In celebration of UNITY’s 40th birthday next year, Nike N7 athletes and UNITY youth leaders will kick off a year-long fitness campaign. During the conference, nearly 1,500 youth and their chaperones will participate in various fitness activities while in Washington, D.C.

“N7 is our commitment to bring sport and all of its benefits to Native American and Aboriginal communities in the United States and Canada, with a focus on youth,” said Sam McCracken, Nike N7 general manager, in a press release. “Beyond promoting healthy and physically active lifestyle, sport helps build self-confidence and enables youth to be a force for positive change in their community. We believe that through activity, competition and play, Native American and Aboriginal youth can unleash the power of their generation and inspire the next.”

“We are working with Nike N7 to create another memorable and special event to encourage Native youth to move and stay healthy not just at the conference, but all year long," said Mary Kim Titla, executive director of UNITY, Inc. “In 2011, UNITY promoted First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let's Move in Indian Country initiative and this year UNITY was an early acceptor of President Barack Obama’s Generation Indigenous Challenge, which Nike N7 also supports, so it makes sense to team up to promote fitness as our Native youth converge on our nation’s capitol.”
