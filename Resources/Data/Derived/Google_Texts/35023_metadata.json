He also spent some time on the sideline clarifying his remarks to ownership.\n\nThe 10th-year veteran talked to owner Mike Brown and other members of his family about comments expressing frustration over his uncertain status with the team. Whitworth was upbeat as he left the field when practice ended.\n\n\u201cI think they know that I love this place and I want to be here, and they know what I am to this organization and I know what they are to me,\u201d said Whitworth, with his 4-year-old and 3-year-old sons following him around. \u201cThey\u2019ve been great to me and my family. So there\u2019s nothing but mutual appreciation there, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d\n\nWhitworth was surprised when the Bengals took offensive tackles \u2014 Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher \u2014 with their first two picks in the draft. The team captain has been trying to get an idea of where he fits in the Bengals\u2019 plans beyond this season, his last under contract, but no one had been willing to discuss it with him.\n\nOn Monday, Whitworth expressed his frustration over the team\u2019s silence about his future. He also said the uncertainty made it more difficult for him to be a team leader. A few days later, a tongue-in-cheek tweet was accidentally sent on his account suggesting that Mike Brown was getting rid of him. The tweet was quickly deleted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "title": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "title": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/andrew_whitworth_talks_to_bengals_owners_about_future/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bengals-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "title": "Andrew Whitworth talks to Bengals owners about future", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bengals-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joe Kay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2265\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals captain Andrew Whitworth got permission to attend rookie camp on Saturday and mentor the linemen who were taken in the draft.\nOn Monday, Whitworth expressed his frustration over the team\u2019s silence about his future.\nThe team captain has been trying to get an idea of where he fits in the Bengals\u2019 plans beyond this season, his last under contract, but no one had been willing to discuss it with him.\nA few days later, a tongue-in-cheek tweet was accidentally sent on his account suggesting that Mike Brown was getting rid of him.\nThe 10th-year veteran talked to owner Mike Brown and other members of his family about comments expressing frustration over his uncertain status with the team."}
