He even made sure the message had sunk in with a follow-up phone call to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday.\n\nThe response in Seoul has been less than enthusiastic.\u201cFrankly speaking, there seems to be no easy way out of the present situation,\u201d a senior South Korean government official said in a blunt speech Tuesday to a group of American academics visiting Seoul \u2014 four days after Mr. Biden had visited the city.\n\nRelations between the two countries are \u201cat an all-time low\u201d since the two countries normalized diplomatic ties in 1965, said the official, according to the text of his prepared remarks at the private event, shown to The Wall Street Journal on condition that he not be identified.\n\nThe official blamed the predicament in part on Mr. Abe\u2019s \u201cassertive policy of historical revisionism,\u201d in the remarks delivered to explain the thinking behind South Korean President Park Geun-hye\u2019s stand-offish stance toward Japan. As the two neighbors have wrangled over the interpretation of Japan\u2019s wartime aggression and an island dispute, their leaders haven\u2019t met bilaterally for two years.\n\nTo break the impasse, the South Korean official urged the U.S. to play intermediary, noting that the disputes are deeply rooted in the incomplete settlement of various issues after World War II.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed time for the U.S. to play a more active role in addressing the disputes in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my observation, the U.S. is the only country that Japan would ever listen to.\u201d\n\nIt is a role that Mr. Biden has suggested that Washington would rather avoid. While the U.S. seems eager to urge Tokyo and Seoul to improve ties, the vice president has also expressed reluctance to try and broker some kind of compromise over historical tensions.\n\n\u201cWe welcome mutually acceptable solutions to historical and territorial disputes and support dialogue and diplomacy that can lead to such solutions,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a written interview with South Korea\u2019s Chosun Ilbo newspaper published Dec. 5. \u201cBut let me be clear: The United States does not intend to act as a mediator,\u201d he added.\n\nMasaru Sato, a Japanese foreign ministry spokesman, said he was not in a position to comment on the South Korean official\u2019s speech, as the Japanese government wasn\u2019t aware of its contents. \u201cWhat we can say is Japan will continue to work on our relationship with South Korea based on a broad perspective.\u201d\n\nMuch of Mr. Biden\u2019s visit to China, Japan and South Korea was focused on trying to lower tensions raised by Beijing\u2019s recent announcement of a new air-defense identification zone that included expansive areas of overlap with existing Japanese and South Korean zones. The vice president urged Ms. Park to reconsider her cold shoulder against Mr. Abe, while calling on Mr. Abe to make greater efforts to reach out.\n\nMr. Biden made a follow-up call to Mr. Abe Thursday, and reinforced \u201cthe importance of trilateral security cooperation among the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea\u201d and pledged continued support for improved relations between Tokyo and Seoul, according to a White House press release.\n\nIn the Tuesday speech, the South Korean official mounted a scathing attack on Mr. Abe as he alleged that Japan has become assertive on history issues under the prime minister and that it appears to be \u201cattempting a diplomatic isolation of Korea in this region and behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s historical perception is not just a bilateral issue between Korea and Japan or Japan and China,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt is a common issue which threatens the peace and stability of the region.\u201d\n\nSuch comments from Seoul have spawned resentment in Tokyo. \u201cThe current government in South Korea has completely shifted its focus from Japan-Korea relations to China-Korea relations,\u201d said Nobutaka Machimura, a former foreign minister and veteran lawmaker of Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative party, who has long been known for his moderate foreign policy views. \u201cIt puzzles us why they have to get so completely absorbed in China. In a situation like this, it is very difficult to improve Japan-Korea ties,\u201d he added in an interview Friday.\n\nAsked about Mr. Biden\u2019s call for closer ties, Mr. Machimura said there wasn\u2019t anything Japan could do. \u201cIt\u2019s just too bad, frankly,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Yuka Hayashi on Twitter @TokyoWoods", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "There is \"no easy way out\" for the strained South Korea-Japan relations, says a senior South Korean government official.", "title": "\u2018No Easy Way Out\u2019 For South Korea-Japan Feud, Despite Biden\u2019s Efforts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/13/no-easy-way-out-for-south-korea-japan-feud-despite-bidens-efforts/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AR469_skbide_G_20131206025019.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "\u2018No Easy Way Out\u2019 For South Korea-Japan Feud, Despite Biden\u2019s Efforts", "description": "There is \"no easy way out\" for the strained South Korea-Japan relations, says a senior South Korean government official.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Yuka Hayashi", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "There is \"no easy way out\" for the strained South Korea-Japan relations, says a senior South Korean government official.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-13T10:59:26-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/13/no-easy-way-out-for-south-korea-japan-feud-despite-bidens-efforts/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-15649", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "There is \"no easy way out\" for the strained South Korea-Japan relations, says a senior South Korean government official.", "title": "\u2018No Easy Way Out\u2019 For South Korea-Japan Feud, Despite Biden\u2019s Efforts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/12/13/no-easy-way-out-for-south-korea-japan-feud-despite-bidens-efforts/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AR469_skbide_G_20131206025019.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-15649", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-13T10:34:21-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd22c\"", "article_summary": "The vice president urged Ms. Park to reconsider her cold shoulder against Mr. Abe, while calling on Mr. Abe to make greater efforts to reach out.\nEuropean Pressphoto Agency U.S. Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with South Korean President Park Geun-hye in Seoul on Dec. 6.\nTo break the impasse, the South Korean official urged the U.S. to play intermediary, noting that the disputes are deeply rooted in the incomplete settlement of various issues after World War II.\nMasaru Sato, a Japanese foreign ministry spokesman, said he was not in a position to comment on the South Korean official\u2019s speech, as the Japanese government wasn\u2019t aware of its contents.\nAsked about Mr. Biden\u2019s call for closer ties, Mr. Machimura said there wasn\u2019t anything Japan could do."}
