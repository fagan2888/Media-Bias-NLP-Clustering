The GOP managed to hold those legislative majorities (despite Mitt Romney\u2019s abysmal showing in the state in 2012) and now controls the Pennsylvania state Senate 27 to 23 and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives 110 to 92.\n\nSo market-based solutions to the State\u2019s health care and health insurance policy challenges would be the preferred solution, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nAs De Maura documented in a two recent articles, legislation introduced by Pennsylvania Republican State Rep. Jim Christiana, R-Beaver (and which has the backing of liberal special interest groups who advocated in support of Obamacare we might add) takes the same unpopular \u201cgovernment is the answer to everything\u201d approach that has made Obamacare such an economic and personal disaster for millions of Americans.\n\nBriefly summarized, Republican State Rep. Jim Christiana\u2019s legislation would kill market competition and limit affordable consumer choices by forcing two entities that offer both health insurance and healthcare into a contract. Not surprisingly, the legislation has the backing of the Service Employees International Union, which represents healthcare workers.\n\nAs DeMaura has written, the battle between the two private entities that have both for-profit and non-profit subsidiaries, Highmark Inc. and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, has generated news coverage in Pennsylvania and across the country.\n\nHighmark is western Pennsylvania\u2019s largest health insurer, and they have also recently acquired a network of struggling hospitals. UPMC, as it's known locally, is the region\u2019s largest health network. They are also an insurance provider.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Highmark\u2019s decision to acquire West Penn Allegheny Health System, a direct competitor of UPMC. As a result of Highmark\u2019s decision, UPMC chose to not renew a decade-long contract.\n\nBut State Representative Jim Christina isn\u2019t a single Big Government outlier in Pennsylvania\u2019s State House. This week, state Senator. Randy Vulakovich, R-Shaler Township, introduced a similar bill in the Pennsylvania state senate.\n\nNow here\u2019s the real issue from our perspective \u2013 despite this matter being a disagreement between two private entities \u2013 Republican state legislators have decided to intervene.\n\nThat\u2019s right; Republicans \u2013 the alleged party of the free market \u2013 are proposing to legislate a contract between two private corporations.\n\nThe thinking behind that decision is apparently the dangerous notion that non-profits should be viewed as an extension of the government. This is exactly the sort of \u201cgovernment knows best\u201d philosophy held by Big Government liberals, not Republicans.\n\nPennsylvanians aren\u2019t the only ones who should be concerned about this.\n\nWe typically think of Republican legislators as the last line of defense against these Big Government schemes. The decision of Christina and Vulakovich to interject themselves into the debate is, as Stephen DeMaura put it, \u201centering into unprecedented territory, leading to serious implications for the rest of the country if other legislators take similar steps. It could also set the stage for one large insurer to continue dominating the market, further threatening all hospitals in Pennsylvania.\u201c\n\nDeMaura is right; the suggestion that partial non-profits in Pennsylvania should be forced into a contract is not only anti-free market, if establishment Republican state legislators across the country adopt this kind of \u201cgovernment is the answer to everything\u201d thinking it portends a slippery slope for future progressive Republican schemes involving government intervention, and not just limited to health care and health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Pennsylvania GOP Legislators Adopting Obamacare Tactics"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d87\"", "article_summary": "So market-based solutions to the State\u2019s health care and health insurance policy challenges would be the preferred solution, right?\nNow here\u2019s the real issue from our perspective \u2013 despite this matter being a disagreement between two private entities \u2013 Republican state legislators have decided to intervene.\nThe GOP managed to hold those legislative majorities (despite Mitt Romney\u2019s abysmal showing in the state in 2012) and now controls the Pennsylvania state Senate 27 to 23 and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives 110 to 92.\nRandy Vulakovich, R-Shaler Township, introduced a similar bill in the Pennsylvania state senate.\nWe typically think of Republican legislators as the last line of defense against these Big Government schemes."}
