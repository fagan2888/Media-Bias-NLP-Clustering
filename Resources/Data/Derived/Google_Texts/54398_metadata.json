(WTNH) \u2014 A portion of Momauguin Elementary School has been turned into a health center. There was an official grand opening for it on Thursday.\n\n\u201cParents have easy access to quality health care,\u201d said Melanie Wilde, program manager for the School-Based Health Center. \u201cBehavioral health, medical and dental. It\u2019s right here in the school.\u201d\n\nHaving the health center in the building will allow students to have access to such services in a timely manner. It also means they\u2019re in a comfortable environment and won\u2019t have to miss school.\n\nAside from dental check-ups and immunizations, there\u2019s also a tremendous emphasis put on mental and behavioral health.\n\n\u201cIn order for a child to learn, the child has to be healthy,\u201d said Dr. Portia Bonner, superintendent of East Haven Schools. \u201cAs generations change we see there\u2019s more mental health issues. We are dealing with social needs. So it not only helps the child, but it also helps the family.\u201d\n\nThere are nearly 190 health centers located in schools throughout the state. Community Health Center Inc. is behind them all and also pays the staff who help run the operations. Officials say local, state and federal grants help make it all possible. The health center does accept private insurance, but there are no co-pays or deductibles. Even those who are uninsured are still treated, and often times staff will help the family find an insurance plan that helps fit their needs.\n\nOfficials say the health center does not replace the school nurse, they will still see students on a daily basis during school hours.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "east haven, school, health care, students, children", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "Children at one East Haven school will soon have quick access to health care.
