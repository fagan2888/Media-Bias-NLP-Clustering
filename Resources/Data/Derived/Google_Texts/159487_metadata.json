They already owned two bars \u2013 the Fin 'N Feather in Greenfield and Brew City Tap on 31st and Forrest Home Avenue \u2013 but they decided to open another place in West Allis.\n\nThe couple found a building at 7527 W. Becher St. and when they found out it was built in 1936, they decided to go with a '20s and '30s theme and named the bar Flappers.\n\nIn the \"roaring '20s,\" Flappers were a type of young woman who bucked \"appropriate behavior\" for women at the time and instead smoked, drank, hung out in jazz clubs and wore short skirts, bobbed hair and heavy make up.\n\n\"The building was built in the aftermath of the Flappers era, but we still went with the name because the building was not built long after,\" says Mark.\n\nFlappers has a corner bar feel and also serves as a neighborhood sports bar. Shuttles run to and from Brewers games for night and weekend games and the bar also hosts chartered bus trips to Wrigley field when the Brewers play the Cubs.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, the Silbers hired Sue Der to operate the kitchen.\n\n\"We already had the kitchen, so it made sense to offer food,\" says Mark, who grew up on the South Side and raised, with his wife, four sons.\n\nDer's menu continues the theme with \"flappetizers\" which include mini tacos, bruschetta, deep fried clams, stuffed portobella mushrooms, wontons and \"half naked cheese curds\" which are light on the breading.\n\nThe menu also features wings, salads, pizzas, wraps and sandwiches with era-appropriate names like The Great Gatsby grilled cheese, Al Capone club, Betty Boop burger, Bing Crosby BLT, Greta Garbo Chicken Sammie and the Progressive Era portobella sandwich.\n\nThe Friday night fish fry offers three kinds of cod \u2013 fried, baked or Cajun \u2013 and a lake perch dinner. All come with coleslaw, rye bread and a choice of fries, Cajun fries, tots or potato pancakes.\n\nThe kitchen is open from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. every day of the week.\n\nAs a passionate sports fan, Der sometimes offers dinner specials that reflect the visiting team's home town.\n\n\"For example, I make pierogis when the Pirates are in town because it's a Pittsburgh tradition,\" says Der.\n\nThe burgers are also sports-themed and are available as singles, doubles, triples or a home run which features four patties on one kaiser roll. There's also a grand slam that has four burgers as well as bacon.\n\n\"These burgers are $1 off during any live Brewers game or for shuttle riders,\" says Der.\n\nPrices are moderate with appetizers and sandwiches between $6 and $8, pizzas $12-$15 and $10-$13 for the fish fry specials.\n\nFlappers also hosts a Tuesday night poker game, with sessions starting at 7 and 10 p.m. \"Everyone is invited to stop by and play,\" says Mark.\n\nThe bar also features drink specials every night.\n\nMark says the key to the bar's charm is the location \u2013 Becher Street is a busy street both day and night \u2013 and also his staff.\n\n\"I like to think we have some of the best staff in the city,\" he says. \"There are a lot of bars out there with dedicated staffs, but I believe we truly have some of the best. And our customers are really friendly, too.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Flapper's tributes the '20s and '30s in theme, but the new kitchen offers contemporary food items including lightly breaded cheese curds and vegetarian sandwiches.
