Tajh Boyd is well within in his element, no stranger to friendliness, more chummy than celebrity.\n\nMoving to a booth for a wide-ranging half-hour interview on a Wednesday afternoon, Boyd does relive a few memories, but only out of old habit. Clemson\u2019s former All-American quarterback sounds much more interested in discussing what\u2019s next.\n\nThat\u2019s probably because the 2012 ACC Player of the Year has crafted a future equitable with off-the-field endeavors along with fading yet breathing football dreams.\n\nApp-lying himself\n\nAfter setting an ACC record with 107 career touchdown throws and leaving Clemson as the league\u2019s No. 2 all-time passer (11,904 yards), Boyd was drafted 213th overall by the New York Jets in the 2014 NFL Draft. He did not survive fall cuts.\n\nLater, he dabbled in the Fall Experimental Football League with two separate clubs, failed to make cuts in his second NFL venture (with the Pittsburgh Steelers) and bounced around the Canadian Football League as property of three separate teams in a span of two months. He is now one of eight quarterbacks whose rights belong to the Montreal Alouettes, to whom he\u2019ll report for the 2016 season in May.\n\nUntil then, Boyd keeps busy. He\u2019s working out, preparing to conduct a youth camp in Greenville next Sunday, staying involved with his foundation, networking with officials connected to Clemson University and the athletic department, pursuing several broadcast opportunities, and even producing the early stages of a mobile applications that would serve as something like a combination of Yelp and Google Maps for tattoo parlors.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m just doing a little bit of everything at this point,\u201d Boyd says. \u201c(Ex-South Carolina running back) Marcus Lattimore and I are going to do a camp donating whatever we make to one of the areas affected by (this year\u2019s) flood. Got a lot of different things moving.\u201d\n\nBoyd majored in sociology and criminal justice, but he laments \u201cnothing I ever really wanted to do deals with that.\u201d When he left the Hampton Roads in Virginia to begin his college career, choosing Clemson over offers from Ohio State and Oregon, Boyd had designs on studying veterinary medicine, but couldn\u2019t follow through when those afternoon classes conflicted with football practice. He has considered going back to school for a Masters in business administration, musing the possibility of being Clemson\u2019s athletic director someday.\n\nBut once the summer rolls around and Boyd returns to Canada, his third and perhaps last shot at the NFL will command his full attention.\n\n\u201cKnowing I can play, knowing I am good enough, I don\u2019t want to be one of these guys looking back saying I wish I would have stuck with it a little bit longer,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my due diligence. I\u2019m going to go up there and ball, do what I need to do, and see if I can make my way back.\u201d\n\nBut ...\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to let football solely control my emotions. Because that\u2019s happened before,\u201d he continues. \u201cSometimes when you put your eggs in one basket and it doesn\u2019t work out, you kind of get lost, and you have to find yourself again.\u201d\n\nTajh the broadcaster?\n\nIn 2014, TeamTajh.com was launched, allowing Boyd to express himself in blogform. Later that year, Boyd hooked up with ESPN Upstate, providing commentary on postgame and midweek radio programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. It broadens you mentally. It broadens your vocabulary. It broadens your thoughts,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cWriting became an outlet as something I really enjoy doing, whether it\u2019s writing about real life or writing poetry.\n\n\u201cI had some experiences with the ACC Network this year. Sturg (Mark Sturgis, a weekday afternoon radio show host in Greenville) has been a great outlet for me to get out there and learn how to articulate my words, say what I need to say, so I give that guy a lot of praise for letting me do that.\u201d\n\nBoyd has sought advice from Clemson Tigers Sports Network play-by-play announcer Don Munson, along with other former Tigers and radio voices Patrick Sapp and Rodney Williams.\n\n\u201cThe thing for me is figuring out what I\u2019d like to do and make the most of that,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cBeing a fan of Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard, Lee Corso, at some point, they\u2019re going to get old. Hopefully I can jump right in there.\u201d\n\nNo regrets\n\nThat a man in his 20s with a revolving door of full-time employment isn\u2019t certain what he wants to do with the rest of his life is not breaking news. That this 25-year-old was once in line to become a millionaire before his 23rd birthday makes Tajh Boyd\u2019s journey a little more fascinating.\n\nFans, media and friends questioned Boyd\u2019s decision to stay at Clemson for his senior year, both derisively and sympathetically. Sitting here three years later with a Canadian contract still waiting to fire his first NFL pass, well, Boyd does not care for your derision or sympathy.\n\n\u201cI made a decision, and I don\u2019t regret a damn thing about it, to be honest,\u201d Boyd said, without a bitter tone. \u201cWould I have come out and been drafted higher after my junior year? Absolutely. It would\u2019ve happened. I came back. You get critiqued for whatever. That\u2019s just the nature of the business.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s times like these Boyd feels for old teammates like running back Wayne Gallman or tight end Jordan Leggett, agonizing over their NFL futures. One of Boyd\u2019s old buds, wide receiver Martavis Bryant, has caught on with the Steelers after a somewhat surprising decision to turn pro early. But these days, a third of all underclassmen who declare don\u2019t even get drafted, and many end up in limbo without an NFL contract or college degree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for the Sammys and DeAndres, because they know right now,\u201d Boyd says, referring to Watkins and Hopkins, two first-round picks who rose to stardom catching passes from Boyd. \u201cWhen you\u2019re still undecided, that\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough because,\u201d \u2014 he takes a long pause \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of dilemmas that go on internally. A lot of agents contacting you, a lot of people you\u2019re going to call to figure out what the right process is.\u201d\n\nNo regrets? None at all?\n\n\u201cNo regrets,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cI was the first person in my family to graduate from college. We won our first BCS game. All these things matter to me. I remember people being like, \u2018you may not see it right now, but you\u2019ll always be remembered for that reason (not going pro early).\u2019 My whole thing was never to be remembered. I just wanted to put my best product out there.\n\n\u201cI appreciate people. I appreciate the support. Appreciate the Clemson family. I think they know I genuinely, truly care about them as well. ... At some point, \u201ceverybody moves out the house. I just decided to stay in the house a little longer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "One-on-one with Tajh Boyd, keeping busy with and without football, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Clemson football,Tajh Boyd", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "GREENVILLE \u2014 The broad-shouldered, broad-smiling young professional is settled on corner stool at the bar of a local restaurant, and he chats up a fellow patron on whatever topics strike them as interesting.
