It's Monday evening here in Washington and we're expecting some pretty nasty storms tonight. Stay safe out there, everyone. Here's the latest:\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nThe House Rules Committee will meet on Tuesday evening to discuss a bill to repeal the U.S. country-of-origin labeling (COOL) rule, which forces beef, pork and chicken retailers to label where their meat has come from.\n\nCountries like Canada and Mexico have long argued that the rule puts their meat at an unfair disadvantage in the U.S. market.\n\nLast month, the World Trade Organization's said the U.S. rule violates trade obligations and imposes a disproportionate burden in record-keeping and verification requirements on meat producers and processors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMembers of the COOL Reform Coalition are concerned that Canada and Mexico will now retaliate against the U.S by imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on U.S. food, agriculture and manufacturing.\n\nLawmakers are looking at how to bring the U.S. into compliance with its trade obligations. One bill, the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act, introduced by Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas.) would repeal the rule. The House Agriculture Committee passed the bill late last month by a 38-6 vote.\n\n\"This bill is a targeted response that will remove uncertainty and restore stability for the United States by bringing us back into compliance,\" Conaway said in a news release at the time. \"We must do all we can to avoid retaliation by Canada and Mexico, and this bill accomplishes that through full repeal of labeling requirements for beef, pork, and chicken. http://1.usa.gov/1AYsG2n\n\nThe House could vote on the bill this week.\n\nON TAP FOR TUESDAY\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on \"Oversight of the Transportation Security Administration: First-hand and Government Watchdog Accounts of Agency Challenges.\" http://1.usa.gov/1dhihDx\n\nTOMORROW'S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 242 new regulations, proposed rules, notices and other administrative actions in Tuesday's edition of the Federal Register.\n\nHere's what to watch for:\n\n--The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will issue new recommendations for police departments responding to situations where there is an active shooter or someone with an improvised explosive device.\n\nThe guidance document -- \"First Responder Guidance for Improving Survivability in Improvised Explosive Device and/or Active Shooter Incidents\" -- comes from a list of military strategies in responding to such situations, the agency noted. http://bit.ly/1eYItnP\n\n--Financial regulators will look into a rule aimed at rooting out illegal Internet gambling.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and Treasury Department will renew a recordkeeping requirement intended to show that payment systems are implementing policies to \"identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit transactions in connection with unlawful Internet gambling.\" http://bit.ly/1F4F7V2\n\n--The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will issue a new transportation security plan for protecting the shipment of classified materials.\n\nThe regulatory guide suggests what measures should be taken to \"protect classified matter while in transport.\" http://bit.ly/1FF9mn9\n\n--The Obama administration will issue a new rule for appraisal management companies, which comes as part of a requirement from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\n\nThe Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will all issue new supervisory rules for appraisal management companies.\n\nThe rules go into effect in 60 days. http://bit.ly/1JzK28w\n\nNEWS RIGHT NOW\n\nPlastic guns: Democrats are proposing to ban plastic guns following reports of major security lapses at the nation's biggest airports. http://bit.ly/1eYLqVi\n\nMass shootings: The Department of Homeland Security is training local police departments how to respond to mass shootings and bombs. http://bit.ly/1G7QCz7\n\nNFL: The Dallas Cowboys are using a drone to film the team's practices, according to ESPN. http://es.pn/1KXzVL4\n\nMinimum wage: Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonTrump aide: 'Hillary is the one who\u2019s got a gender gap' WaPo editorial board: 'No excuse' for Clinton email practices Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE is throwing her support behind the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, The Washington Post reports. http://wapo.st/1G7qFzN\n\nLabor dispute: The Supreme Court will weigh in on a labor dispute between Tyson Foods Inc., and its employees that could have far-reaching implications for class-action lawsuits. http://bit.ly/1Gv58nI\n\nNuke watchdog: The Obama administration plans to downsize the number of nuclear regulators. http://bit.ly/1IqAtpi\n\nChemical laws: The Senate's Republican leader promised to hold a vote on legislation that would update the nation's toxic chemical laws by the end of the summer. http://bit.ly/1Qj5kem\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n95: The percentage of cases in which undercover federal agents were able to sneak fake explosives and guns through airport security.\n\n15,500: Transgender members of the military.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\"If detectable weapons can make it through security checkpoints, how can we expect to catch wrongdoers carrying undetectable plastic firearms?\" -- Rep.
