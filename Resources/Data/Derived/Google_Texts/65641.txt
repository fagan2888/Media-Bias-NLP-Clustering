(CNSNews.com) -- Although the national unemployment rate in January was 4.9%, a broader measure used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), called U-6, which includes total unemployed, persons marginally attached to the labor force, and those working part-time for economic reasons, shows that the unemployment rate was 9.9% in January 2016.

That 9.9% unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, was the same in December and November 2015, and up slightly from October, when it was 9.8%.

In January 2015, a year ago, the U-6 unemployment rate was 11.3%.

Prior to October 2015, the last time the U-6 unemployment rate was in the 9.8-9.9% range was in May and June 2008, seven months before Barack Obama was inaugurated president.

When Obama entered office in January 2009, the U-6 unemployment rate was 14.2%. It's peak was in late 2009, early 2010, when it hit 17.1% unemployment for several months.

The Gallup polling company calls the U-6 number the "Real Unemployment" rate in America. As it states, "Widely reported unemployment metrics in the U.S. do not accurately represent the reality of joblessness in America."

"For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not count a person who desires work as unemployed if he or she is not working and has stopped looking for work over the past four weeks," says Gallup. "Similarly, the BLS does not count someone as unemployed if he or she is, for instance, an out-of-work engineer, construction worker or retail manager who performs a minimum of one hour of work a week and receives at least $20 in compensation."
