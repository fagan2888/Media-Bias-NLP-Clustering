It also released more detailed numbers by state.\n\nThe tally in California is 13.5 million current and former Anthem customers dating back to 2004 as well as other Blue Cross Blue Shield members who received care in the state.\n\nLarge employers, for instance, often have workers scattered across the country and treated under various Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans.\n\nFederal healthcare officials and state insurance commissioners are investigating whether Anthem took sufficient security measures to safeguard its massive database.\n\nAnthem is offering people who are affected two years of free identity-theft protection and credit monitoring. More information can be found at https://anthem.allclearid.com or by calling 877-263-7995.\n\nConnecticut officials said Tuesday that 315,000 people nationwide have signed up for the company's credit-monitoring services.
