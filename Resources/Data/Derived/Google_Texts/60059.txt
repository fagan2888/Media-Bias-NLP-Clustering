SOUTH PEKIN — A South Pekin man was charged with motor vehicle theft and driving under the influence of drugs after allegedly stealing and crashing an SUV used to flee from a different accident Friday.

About 6:40 p.m., Tazewell County deputies responded to a call of a rollover crash at the intersection of Chester L Road and Illinois Route 29. They determined Eric Peters of South Pekin crashed into a Ford Explorer driven by Darren Carrington of Green Valley while Peters was going west on Chester L Road.

According to a Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office news release, Peters reportedly fled the scene, eventually stealing another vehicle and crashing it after driving through a yard and hitting a parked truck. Peters then drove south for a short distance before hitting a mailbox, power pole and garage at 12517 IL Route 29.

Peters and Carrington were both taken to Pekin Hospital.

Peters has been charged with motor vehicle theft, driving under the influence of drugs, leaving the scene of a personal injury crash and multiple other traffic violations.

There were no updates on Peters’ or Carrington’s conditions Sunday.

The investigation is ongoing.
