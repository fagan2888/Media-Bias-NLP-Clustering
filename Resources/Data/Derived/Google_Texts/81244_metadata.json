It had the doctors she needed, and the price seemed right.\n\nNow, two years later, she has had to scramble to find another insurer because Health Republic announced that it was closing shop and wouldn\u2019t make it even to the end of the year, forcing roughly 200,000 New Yorkers out of their plans and back onto the market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of annoying,\u201d the 43-year-old Brooklyn resident said. She has settled on a more-established plan that has expanded its network and now covers all of her doctors, giving her the assurances she wants.\n\nSEE ALSO: Initiative to replace Obamacare with $25B ColoradoCare qualifies for 2016 ballot\n\n\u201cMyself, personally, I prefer a brand I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d she said.\n\nThe co-ops were supposed to be the happy face of health care \u2014 user-friendly, noncorporate plans offered as part of the Obamacare\u2019s exchanges, designed to convince consumers skeptical of major insurance companies that there was a real alternative for them in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nFor hundreds of thousands of co-op customers, however, the experience has been anything but easy. They now find themselves rushing to find alternative plans amid a string of failures that are shutting down more than half of the 23 co-ops that have formed.\n\nSome of the co-ops\u2019 problems were self-inflicted because they severely miscalculated the market. The Obama administration also undermined them by cutting the potential customer base and, under pressure from Congress, cutting off funding that the co-ops expected and leaving them struggling to meet expectations.\n\nDr. Katherine Collier\u2019s story is how the co-ops \u2014 short for Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans \u2014 were supposed to work.\n\nThe dentist said she was more likely to associate co-ops with health food stores than with Obamacare when she picked Evergreen Health Cooperative, but she quickly warmed to the young insurer.\n\nIts premiums were competitively priced in Maryland\u2019s marketplace, but not too good to be true. After she signed up with her 10 employees, someone from the co-op called to welcome them.\n\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018Wow, I never had that,\u2019\u201d Dr. Collier said.\n\nCo-ops were added to the Affordable Care Act after Democrats lost their fight to include a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d plan that would compete with private plans on the Obamacare exchanges. As a compromise, Kent Conrad, a Democratic senator from North Dakota, pushed to allow states to start the co-ops, which are nonprofits designed to be responsive to residents\u2019 needs rather than to investors\u2019 demands.\n\nGiven initial infusions of federal cash, the co-ops attracted 400,000 customers in Obamacare\u2019s first year and more than 1 million people last year, drawn by experiences like Dr. Collier\u2019s.\n\nBut the plans, which started from scratch, had to put together doctor networks and try to estimate their potential customer base and set rates based on the risk pool they thought they might attract \u2014 all difficult for insurers at any time, but particularly tough for startups in a market made all the more unpredictable by Obamacare\u2019s advent.\n\nPundits warned from the start that the plans would struggle for market share, and that turned out to be the case in many states.\n\n\u201cThis is not a market that\u2019s easy to break into, even with millions in funding,\u201d said Chris Sloan, a manager at the Avalere Health consultancy in Washington, D.C.\n\nSuccess and failure\n\nIn Maine, the Community Health Options plan is doing well. It was the only co-op to make money last year, offering competitive rates and good customer service. Of course, it was helped by the fact that only one other insurer, the for-profit Anthem Inc., was offering plans on the exchange in Maine.\n\nCommunity Health Options had nearly 40,000 customers at the end of last year, far more than the 15,000 or so the co-op had predicted. That accounted for 80 percent of the marketplace. The co-op had figured to lose $1.5 million in 2014, but it ended up earning a profit of $5.9 million, which it pumped back into its operations.\n\nThe co-op now has branched out to offer plans in neighboring New Hampshire.\n\nEven high enrollment wasn\u2019t a signal of success, however. The co-op serving Iowa and Nebraska by July 2014 had nearly 80,000 customers, well more than the 11,000 it predicted \u2014 but the state took control in December and liquidated the operation in March.\n\nCo-ops in Louisiana, Nevada, Kentucky, Tennessee, Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona and Michigan have said they would shutter next year, forcing customers to find other coverage.\n\nState regulators shut the co-op in Colorado, leaving 83,000 customers hunting for other plans. Co-op officials said the state gave up on them too early and insisted they had a firm grasp on the market and were on a path to profitability.\n\n\u201cThis is the most data that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Julia Hutchins, CEO of the Colorado HealthOp. \u201cWe were stress-testing our rates.\u201d\n\nShe said part of co-ops\u2019 troubles can be traced to the White House, which decided under intense political pressure in late 2013 to let people with substandard plans keep that coverage instead of forcing them to enter the marketplace and buy plans that met Obamacare\u2019s standards.\n\nThe about-face was an attempt to fulfill Mr. Obama\u2019s promise that people who liked their plans could keep them under his signature law.\n\nThe result was hundreds of thousands of low-risk customers who stayed with their plans. Meanwhile, customers with higher health risks switched to co-op plans, unleashing a tide of claims.\n\n\u201cLimiting the marketplace just to people who hadn\u2019t had health care previously was the single most impactful policy change that occurred,\u201d Ms. Hutchins said.\n\nThough the pent-up demand subsided, it was too late.\n\n\u201cWe really saw it decline dramatically in the second year,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we were so frustrated and upset about the decision to shut us down.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said that was just one of the factors involved.\n\n\u201cThis likely contributed somewhat to plans seeing worse risk than expected in 2014, but it isn\u2019t a smoking gun for the co-ops or other plans\u2019 woes,\u201d said Mr. Sloan, at Avalere. \u201cIt is hard to know the exact magnitude of the impact.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very slow but steady\u2019\n\nEven if the risk pool was worse than expected, many insurers \u2014 co-ops and other plans \u2014 underpriced their products in the Obamacare marketplace.\n\nThat, Mr. Sloan said, contributed to the administration\u2019s announcement in October that plans would receive only 12.6 percent of what they thought they would get in 2014 risk corridor payments, which is money the government promised to cover losses in poorly performing plans.\n\nSome of the bigger for-profit players could weather that hit because they had lines of business outside the exchange market, but not the co-ops.\n\n\u201cThat is what hit them pretty hard,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cThey\u2019re all in on the exchanges.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans investigating the swift fall of the plans said a mix of poor business sense and shoddy oversight led them over the cliff. It\u2019s unclear whether taxpayers will recoup much of the $1.2 billion they have lent to the failed co-ops, they said.\n\nDemocrats say Republicans hastened the co-ops\u2019 demise by slashing startup loans from $6 billion to $2.4 billion, prohibiting the co-ops from spending the money on marketing and failing to step in when risk-adjustment payments fell short.\n\nNo matter what the cause, the string of failures has taken its toll. Even in Maryland, where Evergreen is bullish about its future, new customers are leery.\n\n\u201cSo what happened with all these other co-ops? Are you OK?\u201d they ask, said President and CEO Peter Beilenson.\n\nHe said his operation survived because it took a \u201cnimble tortoise\u201d approach in its first two years, refusing to set prices too low and building its small-group line of business when Maryland\u2019s state-run Obamacare website crashed in the first enrollment season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very slow but steady,\u201d Mr. Beilenson said.\n\nIn New York, however, Health Republic is shuttering, and it is facing an investigation into whether it misled auditors about its financial difficulties.\n\nHealth Republic did not return requests for comment about the investigation, though it pointed to the \u201csystemic challenges\u201d to the co-op program when it announced it was closing in late September.\n\nHoping to ease the way, New York officials say they have moved the deadline for affected customers to pick new plans from Nov. 15 to Nov. 30 and will enroll customers who do nothing into a plan on the state-run health care exchange.\n\nMs. Grech, the former Health Republic customer, said she rushed to submit an application to Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield by Friday the 13th.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of superstitious,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Amy Grech, a freelance Web consultant and horror story author in New York, was looking for health insurance, a broker pushed her toward Health Republic, the state's co-op under Obamacare.
