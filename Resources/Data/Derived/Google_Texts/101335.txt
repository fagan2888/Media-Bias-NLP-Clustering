George Clooney has taken a swipe at Donald Trump, saying his "Make America Great Again" slogan flies in the face of what the Republican presidential front-runner really stands for.Clooney, who supports Hillary Clinton, went after Trump in a pitch letter for a $33,400-a-plate fundraiser he and his wife, Amal, are holding for her at their luxurious Los Angeles home on April 16."If you listen to the loudest voices out there today, you'd think we're a country that hates Mexicans, hates Muslims, and thinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again," the Hollywood superstar says in the letter, obtained by CNN "The truth is that the only thing that would prevent America from being great would be to empower these voices."Instead, Clooney says, voters should look to Clinton to lead the nation forward."In all of this clutter, there's been one consistent voice. A voice of tolerance and experience, from a candidate who's spent a lifetime fighting for the rights of the less fortunate," Clooney writes."As this primary process continues, Hillary could soon have an insurmountable delegate lead and with that, the Democratic nomination. That would then make her the only grown-up in the room. And if ever there was a time for a grown-up, that time is now."Clooney's latest movie is the Coen brothers' PG-13 comedy "Hail, Caesar.""
