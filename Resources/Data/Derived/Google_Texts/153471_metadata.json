As an obstetrician, I was particularly pleased that the recommendations now include screening pregnant women or those who have recently given birth, because 10% of these women suffer from depression.\n\nHow new moms can benefit from enhanced depression screening\n\nThe prior recommendations did not include pregnant and postpartum women. The USPSTF also found that treatment with a type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy alone, without the use of antidepressants, benefits pregnant and postpartum women with depression. While some pregnant women will need medication for serious depression, there are rare but serious risks to the fetus if the mother takes antidepressants, so it is not a decision that women or their obstetricians should make lightly.\n\nAnd there are other good reasons to avoid antidepressants with pregnant and postpartum women. According to Alice Domar, a psychologist in my department and author of the soon-to-be-released Finding Calm for the Expectant Mom,\n\n\u201cScreening pregnant and postpartum women for depressive symptoms is a wonderful way to improve care and a terrific example of integrative medicine. However, I am concerned that this may be interpreted as an effort to get more young women on medication. Yes, there are some young women who need to be on medication in order to be safe and live a normal quality of life. However, counseling, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has been shown to be as effective in treating depression as medication and has no risks. There are other effective approaches, including exercise, social support, and more partner involvement. We do need to screen pregnant women for depressive symptoms, but all options to treat depression need to be presented and discussed.\u201d\n\nGuideline updates hold benefits for everyone else, too\n\nThere are other important elements of the new recommendations. The Task Force now recommends regular depression screening for all adults, a change from the last time it updated its depression screening guidelines (in 2009). In the previous version of the recommendations, screening for depression was recommended only in clinics or by doctors who already had adequate support systems to provide mental health care for anyone the screening identified as having depression. Since that time, multiple studies have found that mental health care in primary care settings works very well, and probably just as well as treatment by a psychiatrist. Psychiatric care is still important for many people, particularly those with severe depression. But those with mild to moderate depression might do just as well receiving treatment through their primary care doctors.\n\nIn fact, one size does not fit all when it comes to mental health, and tailoring care to each person\u2019s preferences with regard to how and where to receive mental health care actually improves depression treatment. While some people might prefer a psychiatrist, for example, others would rather get this kind of care from their primary care doctor or a trained nurse specialist. Similarly, some people might prefer counseling and other behavioral therapies, while for others, medication may be the right answer.\n\nAnother important benefit from the USPSTF\u2019s strong recommendation is that the Affordable Care Act specifies its recommendations be covered by health insurance. As a physician, one of the most vexing problems I\u2019ve had with the health care system is access to affordable mental health services for my patients. Because mental health care is poorly reimbursed, many mental health providers don\u2019t accept health insurance and instead only accept payment directly from patients. This greatly limits the pool of available health care providers for those who can\u2019t afford standard fees. It is my hope that this recommendation may provide greater access to mental health services, especially for those who can\u2019t currently afford it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Depression screening for pregnant and postpartum women will benefit many new moms who experience mood changes that go beyond the \"baby blues.\"", "author": "Hope Ricciotti, MD", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Health Blog", "description": "Depression screening for pregnant and postpartum women will benefit many new moms who experience mood changes that go beyond the \"baby blues.\"", "title": "New depression screening guidelines benefit pregnant women and new moms-and everyone - Harvard Health Blog", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 566, "identifier": "http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pregnancy-depression-screening-blog-image.jpg", "height": 848}, "updated_time": "2016-03-01T18:02:53-04:00", "url": "http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-depression-screening-guidelines-benefit-pregnant-women-and-new-moms-201603029222", "type": "article"}, "title": "New depression screening guidelines benefit pregnant women and new moms-and everyone - Harvard Health Blog - Harvard Health Publications", "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Anxiety and Depression", "published_time": "2016-03-02T09:00:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T18:02:53-04:00"}, "keywords": "harvard health blog, health blog, health blogspot", "google-site-verification": "rVNZFJgfV62EiwoqW6JZj2MKSZjLHzIZwJ8u7ayyIu8", "verify-v1": "ynVFsi9WmrI6X1eDUBLcorfGemNtxuH1/S5VuMXuXIA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd714e\"", "article_summary": "The Task Force now recommends regular depression screening for all adults, a change from the last time it updated its depression screening guidelines (in 2009).\nBecause mental health care is poorly reimbursed, many mental health providers don\u2019t accept health insurance and instead only accept payment directly from patients.\nFollow me @hricciotIn January, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released an important update to their depression screening recommendations.\nAs an obstetrician, I was particularly pleased that the recommendations now include screening pregnant women or those who have recently given birth, because 10% of these women suffer from depression.\nHow new moms can benefit from enhanced depression screeningThe prior recommendations did not include pregnant and postpartum women."}
