Lee Terry.\n\nState Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha, who switched his registration to Democrat in August, told The World-Herald that he will file for the 2nd Congressional District seat today.\n\nThat represents an about-face from October, when Ashford said he didn't plan to run so he could focus on legislation to reform the state's overcrowded prison system.\n\nBut the 64-year-old lawmaker, who ran unsuccessfully for Omaha mayor as an independent a year ago, said he was urged by his family and others to reconsider.\n\nHe said he enjoys the work of a legislator and can offer a \u201ccentrist\u201d approach in highly partisan Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI've learned how to work from the center here,\u201d Ashford said from his State Capitol office. \u201cPeople say you can't do that in Washington. I think I can.\u201d\n\nAshford has represented central Omaha's District 20 for 16 years in the Legislature, from 1987 to 1995 and from 2007 to the present. Because of term limits, he is ineligible to run for re-election this year.\n\nAs chairman of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee, he oversees the crafting of bills concerning juvenile justice, crime and punishment and abortion and gun rights. He has pushed several bills on behalf of the City of Omaha, including the law that provided financing for the CenturyLink Center.\n\nHe said he would begin campaigning in earnest after the Legislature's session ends April 17.\n\n\u201cI'm going to have time to run after that,\u201d Ashford said.\n\nHe describes his political views as \u201cpragmatist,\u201d \u201cpro-business\u201d and \u201cindependent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI borrow from both parties on issues,\u201d Ashford said.\n\nFor instance, he supports abortion rights but voted in favor of bills that ban abortions later than 20 weeks after fertilization and require notification of at least one parent when a girl 17 or younger seeks an abortion.\n\nAshford said Wednesday he would have voted against the Affordable Care Act because it was \u201ctoo far-reaching.\u201d Yet he supports a bill in the Legislature to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income residents, as was proposed in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAshford criticized Terry's role in the federal government shutdown last year. Terry voted with other House Republicans to fund the government only if Congress defunded the health care law, a position that led to the partial shutdown.\n\nHe also said Terry was among those in Washington who would rather criticize President Obama instead of work collaboratively.\n\n\u201cYou don't shut the government down because you don't like the president,\u201d Ashford said.\n\nAshford, an attorney and a businessman, previously served as director of the Omaha Housing Authority and as a judge for the Nebraska Commission of Industrial Relations. He was co-owner of the Nebraska Clothing Store in the Old Market from 1993 to 2006.\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for Congress in 1994.\n\nHe is from a prominent Omaha family. His brother, Mark, is a Douglas County district judge. His father-in-law, Randy Ferlic, is a former member of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents. His wife, Ann, was an unsuccessful candidate for regent in 2012.\n\nAshford's candidacy comes two months after Omaha City Council member Pete Festersen, a Democrat, dropped out of the race, citing family responsibilities.\n\nTerry also faces a challenge in the May 13 primary from Republican businessman Dan Frei.\n\nAshford placed fourth in the Omaha mayor's race last spring. He said he learned two things: you cannot win unless you have a party affiliation, and running for office while the Legislature is in session doesn't work.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Ashford told The World-Herald that he will file for the office today.
