This is where we start the battle? You f***ing idiots!\u201d Mr. Maher said, Mediaite reported.\n\nGeorgetown Professor Michael Eric Dyson pushed back, arguing that no one called Mrs. Clinton a racist but instead activists were pointing out that her husband\u2019s policy of mass incarceration, which she advocated, had negative consequences for black people.\n\nHe also noted that Mrs. Clinton apologized for calling black criminals \u201csuper predators\u201d in a speech she made about mass incarceration in the 1990s.\n\nMr. Dyson argued that it is sexist for people to punish Mrs. Clinton for the actions of her husband during his presidency.\n\nActor Mark Ruffalo jumped in and said Black Lives Matter protesters were trying to hold Democrats accountable as the party that is supposed to be on the side of the black community, but \u201chas let them down continuously,\u201d Mediate reported.\n\nMr. Maher still argued that Black Lives Matter activists were making a mistake by going after Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cPeople need to learn the difference between an imperfect friend and a deadly enemy,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cYou want to tear Hillary Clinton down? Great. Then enjoy President Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Late-night talk show host Bill Maher on Friday railed against a Black Lives Matter protester who targeted Hillary Clinton at a campaign fundraising event this week, saying she and other Black Lives Matter activists need to remember that Mrs. Clinton is not the racist here.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Late-night talk show host Bill Maher on Friday railed against a Black Lives Matter protester who targeted Hillary Clinton at a campaign fundraising event this week, saying she and other Black Lives Matter activists need to remember that Mrs. Clinton is not the racist here.", "title": "Bill Maher to Black Lives Matter protesters: Hillary\u2019s not the problem, \u2018you f***ing idiots!\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/27/bill-maher-black-lives-matter-protesters-hillarys-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/16/TV-Maher-Obama.JPEG-07ec2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/16/TV-Maher-Obama.JPEG-07ec2.jpg", "description": "Late-night talk show host Bill Maher on Friday railed against a Black Lives Matter protester who targeted Hillary Clinton at a campaign fundraising event this week, saying she and other Black Lives Ma", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Maher to Black Lives Matter protesters: Hillary\u2019s not the p"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Social Issues, Politics, Bill Maher, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34d9\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Maher still argued that Black Lives Matter activists were making a mistake by going after Mrs. Clinton.\nLate-night talk show host Bill Maher on Friday railed against a Black Lives Matter protester who targeted Hillary Clinton at a campaign fundraising event this week, saying she and other Black Lives Matter activists need to remember that Mrs. Clinton is not the racist here.\nActor Mark Ruffalo jumped in and said Black Lives Matter protesters were trying to hold Democrats accountable as the party that is supposed to be on the side of the black community, but \u201chas let them down continuously,\u201d Mediate reported.\nMr. Dyson argued that it is sexist for people to punish Mrs. Clinton for the actions of her husband during his presidency.\nHe also noted that Mrs. Clinton apologized for calling black criminals \u201csuper predators\u201d in a speech she made about mass incarceration in the 1990s."}
