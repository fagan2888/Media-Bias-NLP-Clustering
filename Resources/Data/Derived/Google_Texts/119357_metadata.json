No matter which party ends up with a majority, Americans will still wake up on Nov. 5 to a seemingly immutable stalemate in Washington. But pragmatic progressives should take heart. Over the next two years they have an historic opportunity: to build a broad center-left majority that can break the paralyzing grip of polarization and get America moving forward again.\n\nNot so long ago, U.S. politicians who robotically toed the party line were considered shameless hacks. And ideologues were seen as wingnuts\u2014self-righteous cranks unable to cope with life\u2019s complexities. Today, such people dominate our national politics. How are they doing? If the measure is simplifying and sharpening dueling political narratives, they are doing a fine job. If it is governing, they are failing miserably.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe more polarized our politics, it seems, the less productive our government. In this sense, polarization serves conservative rather than progressive ends. If you hate government, you probably don\u2019t mind that Washington has degenerated into Fight Club. Conservatives come to fight liberal schemes to enlarge government; liberals come to fight conservative schemes to succor the rich and screw everyone else. And the fight is what matters, not getting things done, because the fight is how you raise money, energize supporters and get media attention. Compared with the give and take of governing, partisan combat is easy, because you never have to think independently, face inconvenient facts or accomplish anything more than keep the other side down. Plus, you get to pose as a paragon of deep conviction.\n\nIn this Manichean hothouse, the battle lines are clear and everyone knows their place. To break ranks on any major issue is treason, to see merit in the other side\u2019s point of view is heresy, to compromise is to sell out and to engage in political horse-trading is corrupt. Finding common ground? That\u2019s so 20th century. Don\u2019t bore us with intellectual honesty, nuance or shades of grey\u2014just pick a side, slug it out and let the best team win.\n\nSuch are the new rules of political competition in the Polarized States of America. There\u2019s just one hitch: They clash with the basic design of our democracy. Winner-take-all outcomes are better suited to parliamentary systems. When a party wins a parliamentary majority, it is expected to enact its platform unilaterally or with minor party partners. America\u2019s political operating system is different: With three separate and distinct branches of government, our constitutional frame is rife with divided powers, checks and balances and constraints on majority rule.\n\nOur system is intended, in other words, to thwart just what today\u2019s polarizers dream of: imposing their philosophy in all its undiluted glory on the nation. The Founders, who really were wise in these matters, didn\u2019t trust what they called political \u201cfactions\u201d to wield that much power. \u201cGreat innovations,\u201d warned Thomas Jefferson, \u201cshould not be forced on slender majorities.\u201d Our political system isn\u2019t supposed to produce ideological coherence; it\u2019s geared to yield outcomes that balance competing values and interests, and in consequence are broadly accepted as fair and legitimate. Our system is built for pragmatists. And absent the pragmatist\u2019s values\u2014power-sharing, the willingness to compromise, regard for minority rights and some measure of comity between the branches and parties\u2014our democracy doesn\u2019t work very well.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) is an exception that proves the rule. In 2010, Democrats resorted to an unusual legislative tactic, budget reconciliation, to pass the law without a single Republican vote. Since then the GOP has waged an obsessive campaign to demonize \u201cObamacare\u201d as a naked partisan power grab\u2014even though their mean-spirited refusal to offer a serious alternative for covering the uninsured forced the majority\u2019s hand. So while the ACA is a landmark achievement, as a strictly partisan one it rests on a wobbly political foundation. Most voters say they oppose the law, and conservative legal challenges are working their way through the courts. Should they win a Senate majority this year, Republicans say they\u2019ll exact payback by using reconciliation to kill or nullify the law.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s implacable hatred of Obamacare also underscores an oft-noted fact about polarization: It is asymmetrical. Surveys confirm what impartial observers of U.S. politics can readily observe: Republicans are more ideologically extreme and more stridently partisan than Democrats. Conservatives also are significantly less interested than liberals in political compromise. Under the sway of a new breed of anti-government zealots, the GOP is chiefly responsible for blocking action on some of the most pressing issues we face, from tax and fiscal reform to immigration and climate change.\n\nThe Democrats aren\u2019t blameless. Many liberals, for example, are just as theologically opposed to modernizing entitlements as conservatives are to raising taxes. The result of this demagogic stance is anything but progressive. It means Washington will continue to direct a growing share of the country\u2019s resources to seniors while starving investment in children and families and future growth.\n\nIn any case, Democrats have been moving steadily to the left, about as fast but not nearly as far as Republicans have shifted rightwards. The share of Democrats holding consistently liberal views, for example, has quadrupled from 5 percent in 1994 to 23 percent today. This leftward movement is a big problem for the party. If Democrats follow the GOP into the fever swamps of ideological purity, the nation\u2019s political crisis will only grow deeper. Absent a fundamental and highly improbable revamping of our constitutional system, America can\u2019t be governed from either ideological pole. Only by leading from the pragmatic center can Democrats capitalize on GOP extremism and rally broad public support behind new ideas for breaking the partisan log jam in Washington.\n\nThe Muzzled Center\n\nUnfortunately, such problem-solving pragmatism is currently out of fashion. Actually, it\u2019s worse than that: Politicians who try to break the partisan impasse risk self-immolation. A Republican who reaches out to Democrats on immigration or some other highly charged issue risks being \u201cprimaried\u201d and mauled by political goon squads with gobs of money, like the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action. When even powerful GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell and Eric Cantor are attacked by the right as squishes, you know the conservative revolution has begun to devour its own.\n\nPressure to conform is mounting on the other side, too. An array of powerful interest groups, plus self-appointed ideological minders like MoveOn and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, are quick to pounce on Democrats who deviate from leftish orthodoxy by, say, supporting trade agreements, real accountability in education, changes in entitlements, development of America\u2019s shale-gas windfall and efforts to lower regulatory obstacles to entrepreneurship. The wealthy liberals of the Democracy Alliance aren\u2019t investing in new ideas; they are building a \u201cprogressive infrastructure\u201d by lavishing money on think tanks and advocacy groups that think exactly as they do. The result is a liberal groupthink that stands guard over the programmatic status quo and stifles public innovation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Democrats may be glum now, but Republicans\u2019 extremism has presented them with an historic opportunity to build a lasting majority\u2014and make America work again.", "title": "How to Seize Back the Political Center", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/democratic-party-moderates-111770.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/10/141010_marshall_democrats_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Moderates,Democratic Party,The Big Idea,Politics,The Friday Cover", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Democrats may be glum now, but Republicans\u2019 extremism has presented them with an historic opportunity to build a lasting majority\u2014and make America work again.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2240\"", "article_summary": "When a party wins a parliamentary majority, it is expected to enact its platform unilaterally or with minor party partners.\nNo matter which party ends up with a majority, Americans will still wake up on Nov. 5 to a seemingly immutable stalemate in Washington.\nNot so long ago, U.S. politicians who robotically toed the party line were considered shameless hacks.\nSurveys confirm what impartial observers of U.S. politics can readily observe: Republicans are more ideologically extreme and more stridently partisan than Democrats.\nIf Democrats follow the GOP into the fever swamps of ideological purity, the nation\u2019s political crisis will only grow deeper."}
