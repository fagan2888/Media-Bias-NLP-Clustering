They were bound for a new life in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nForty-seven miserable days later \u2014 a voyage across two oceans and around the Strait of Magellan \u2014 the dazed passengers arrived in Hawaii. Fourteen babies had been born, but 19 children died. The Del Rio couple were among the 8,000 \u201ccontract employees,\u201d who had endured hunger and unrest in southern Spanish villages, lured to an \u201cisland paradise\u201d with promises of a house, an acre of land, medical care and 20 gold pieces a month.\n\n\u201cMy great-grandfather was a pineapple picker,\u201d Jack Del Rio told me.\n\nThe imported workers had not understood they would labor 16 hours a day 26 days a month at the blooming pineapple plantation on the northwest side of Maui.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather (Louis Del Rio) was born by the banyan tree (one of the world\u2019s largest) in Lahaina,\u201d says Del Rio, who has visited the site. Maui has become one of the world\u2019s most popular vacation destinations, and the old pineapple plantation and the workers\u2019 homes have been replaced by a scenic golf course \u2014 \u201cThe Plantation\u201d at Kapalua.\n\nWhen their \u201ccontracts\u201d expired in three years, 5,000 Spaniards left for another ocean trip \u2014 to California.\n\nThe Del Rio family settled in the Napa Valley area and, later, Hayward.\n\nLouis found Hope \u2026 Italian-American Hope Grasseschi. Their son, Jack Louis Del Rio, served in the Army, married, started his own business as a building contractor and wore a blue collar.\n\nJack Jr. was born in 1963 and would become protectorate of three younger brothers (James, Jason and Jeff).\n\nIn the summer the four boys lifted and loaded, and shoveled stuff, for Jack Sr. \u2014 and played every type of ball. At Hayward High School, Jack Jr. was the star on seven state title teams in football, basketball and baseball. He turned down an offer from the Toronto Blue Jays and played baseball and football at Southern Cal from 1981-84.\n\nDel Rio was drafted into the NFL and developed into a tireless, tough Pro Bowl linebacker.\n\nAfter his fourth season, while with the Chiefs, Del Rio finished college at Kansas. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that I was the first in my family to earn a degree,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter 11 seasons as a player and six more as an assistant coach, Del Rio was the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 head coach for nine years. He was fired in 2011. John Fox offered him the defensive coordinator\u2019s position in 2012.\n\n\u201cI could lie on the beach for a year and collect my (contract) money or join the Broncos. My brother-in-law and 13 friends voted 14-0 that I should lie on the beach,\u201d Del Rio laughs.\n\n\u201cI made the right choice. The Broncos have a great coach, great organization, great city, great talent. And I knew John Elway would produce a winning team every year.\u201d\n\nLast season, when John Fox experienced a serious heart issue over the bye week, then underwent surgery, Del Rio was the obvious selection for interim coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike. Only difference was I never had this good a bike before, one with Manning racing tires. But if we won, it was because we had an outstanding team. If we lost, it was my fault.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos won three out of four, and, oddly enough, Rio\u2019s overall head coaching record nearly reached .500 (71-72).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it. If we hadn\u2019t blown the game in New England, I\u2019d be a winning coach.\u201d\n\nHe wants it.\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019m anxious to be a head coach again. It has to be the right fit for some team, and that hasn\u2019t happened yet. But I\u2019m so happy and satisfied to be right where I am.\u201d\n\nIn 2012 the Broncos ranked No. 2 in yards allowed. Struck by injuries and the loss of Elvis Dumervil and, for most of the season, Von Miller, the defense dropped off considerably last year. Now, Del Rio has new toys and repaired players.\n\n\u201cIt starts with the edge rushers, and we\u2019ve got two of the best \u2014 like we did in 2012. You put pressure on the quarterback, protect the backside with your secondary and stop people from running right at you, and that\u2019s what we have a chance to do this year.\u201d\n\nThe season also will include a particularly special day for Jack. He will be inducted into the USC Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cThe school called and said they knew I couldn\u2019t be there because of the Broncos\u2019 season. I\u2019d already looked at the schedule. That\u2019s our bye weekend (Sept. 28), plus USC is playing Oregon State.\u201d\n\nLuke Del Rio, Jack\u2019s son and a graduate of Valor Christian High School, where he was the quarterback on the state championship team, is one of two candidates to be the Beavers\u2019 backup at QB this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be with my son that day.\u201d\n\nFor more than a century, the Del Rio family has traveled long and hard, far and wide \u2014 beginning with a young man who courageously and adventurously left his home in Spain to pick pineapples.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: D-coordinator Jack Del Rio \u201cmade right choice\u201d with Broncos", "title": "Paige: D-coordinator Jack Del Rio \u201cmade right choice\u201d with Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/23/paige-d-coordinator-jack-del-rio-made-right-choice-with-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__Jack-Del-Riop1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__Jack-Del-Riop1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T19:25:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:44:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy grandfather (Louis Del Rio) was born by the banyan tree (one of the world\u2019s largest) in Lahaina,\u201d says Del Rio, who has visited the site.\nThe Broncos have a great coach, great organization, great city, great talent.\n\u201cMy great-grandfather was a pineapple picker,\u201d Jack Del Rio told me.\nAfter 11 seasons as a player and six more as an assistant coach, Del Rio was the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 head coach for nine years.\nMy brother-in-law and 13 friends voted 14-0 that I should lie on the beach,\u201d Del Rio laughs."}
