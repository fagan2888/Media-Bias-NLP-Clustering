You can fly from Kangerlussuaq to Reykjavik in a little less than five hours, and from there to New York in just under six; from New York to St. John\u2019s, on the south\u00ad east side of the island of Newfoundland, will take about three more. From there, you either drive or fly four hundred miles west-perhaps ten hours by road; an hour and fifteen minutes by twin-engine turboprop-to Deer Lake. Then, another three hundred miles by car on Canada\u2019s picturesque Route 480, along the Newfoundland coast, until you run out of road, and walk the last bit to a peat farm, a reconstructed forge, and half a dozen sod-roofed houses.\n\nAll of the available options are far easier than the direct route, first taken a thousand years ago: nine hundred stomach-heaving miles across the North Atlantic in a sixty-foot-long square-rigged wooden ship. But that ship, and others like it, are the reason L\u2019Anse aux Mead\u00ad ows is a UNESCO World Heritage Site: the first European settlement in the New World, and probably the most famous place ever colonized by the merchants and traders we know as the Vikings.\n\nIt\u2019s nowhere near the largest. A Viking settlement on the banks of the Dnieper River, near Smolensk, has more than three thousand funeral mounds scattered across its forty acres. For centuries, the people who built them controlled the trade that moved along Europe\u2019s rivers all the way from the Baltic to Constantinople, and even as far as ninth\u00ad century Baghdad, when it was Islam\u2019s\u2013and probably the world\u2019s\u2013richest and most sophisticated city. Along the Dnieper and Volga, the traders were generally known as Varangians or \u201crowers\u201d and formed the personal guard of the Byzantine Emperor; sometimes as Rus, from which modern Russia takes its name. Closer to home, in Ireland, they were often known as Finngaills, or \u201cfair foreigners.\u201d The earliest occupants of Britain called them Danes\u2014in the story of Beowulf, \u201ceast-Danes\u201d or \u201cspear-Danes.\u201d Most frequently, they were known as Northmen, or Norsemen; after 793, when they raided the monastery at Lindisfarne, on the east coast of England, with \u201crapine and slaughter,\u201d it was said that all over Europe, people prayed, \u201cA furore norman norum libera nos, Domine\u201d: From the fury of the Northmen, deliver us, Lord.\n\nThe Norse\u2014the word \u201cViking\u201d comes from an Old Norse word meaning \u201cvoyaging,\u201d later refined to mean \u201craiding,\u201d rather than \u201ctrading\u201d\u2014were merchants, warriors, farmers, and artisans. Despite a well-earned reputation for fearsomeness in battle, they appeared less savage to their contemporaries than to their modern mythmakers; in 1220, the chronicler John of Wallingford described them as, in thirteenth-century terms, a bit dandified:\n\nThey were\u2014according to their country\u2019s customs\u2014in the habit of combing their hair every day, to bathe every Saturday, to change their clothes frequently and to draw attention to themselves by means of many such frivolous whims. In this way, they besieged the married women\u2019s virtue and persuaded the daughters of even noble men to become their mistresses.\n\nBut first, last, and always, they were sailors. Their only real competition for the title of the greatest sailing culture in history came from the eleventh- and twelfth-century Polynesians who colonized Hawaii and Easter Island, and their greatest accomplishments are best understood in the same context: travel across vast distances with neither magnetic compasses nor maps, navigating by their knowledge of currents, swells, and the migrations of birds and fish.\n\nThe fish weren\u2019t just an aid to sailors but the most important reason they went to sea in the first place. Long before they were trading gold and amber along the shores of the Caspian, Black, and Mediterranean seas, Norse sailors honed their maritime skills in the most basic of human activities: gathering food, especially cod from the North Atlantic, which was, and is, the world\u2019s greatest fishery.\n\nBy the beginning of the ninth century, they were ready to expand to the west, east, and especially south. Historians have been puzzling over the impetus for centuries; Edward Gibbon, in the forty-ninth book of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, argued that the brutal conquest of the Saxons by Charlemagne in 804 not only opened the door to invasion of Europe from Scandinavia, but provoked it:\n\nThe subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives.\n\nMore methodical, though less eloquent, historians have looked, instead, to increased numbers of gravesites in the relatively poor lands of ninth-century Scandinavia and Iceland\u2014areas, by most estimates, able to support no more than one to two people per square kilometer\u2014 as a clue to just the sort of population pressure that might have inclined Norsemen to go a-viking. Or, perhaps the Norse were simply reacting to a later invasion by Europe\u2019s Christian sovereigns, who were forcibly converting the pagan peoples on the continent\u2019s periphery by the beginning of the tenth century.\n\nThere is, though, a more powerful and plausible cause for the explosive spread of the Norse. The great achievements of the Viking Age were almost entirely enabled by the impersonal workings of climate. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. All human civilizations are hostage to weather, but none more so than sailors, who must confront both the violent nature of the ocean\u2019s surface and the capricious atmosphere that imparts motion to their wind-powered vessels. When those mariners are surrounded by seas that produce icebergs and pack ice for up to six months of the year, even a few more weeks of warmer weather a year were literally life-changing.\n\nFluid dynamics is the branch of physics that studies liquids and gases in motion\u2014among other things, weather, which gets its dynamism from the heat energy of the sun. That energy is received by every object in the solar system, but if the object in question lacks a fluid atmosphere, it has no weather, which is why a barren rock like Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, has none, and Jupiter, which receives a tiny fraction of the solar energy that hits Mercury, has hurricanes twenty-five thousand miles in diameter that last hundreds of years.\n\nEarth\u2019s weather lacks Jupiter\u2019s violence, but has its own complexities. Not because the source of heat\u2014the sun\u2014is so variable, but rather because the amount of heat energy absorbed by the Earth during its annual orbits is distributed unevenly. The consequences of that variability are such things as the ice ages\u2014there have been at least four in the last billion years\u2014when glaciers left huge chunks of the northern hemisphere covered with ice sometimes hundreds of feet thick, as well as eras when temperatures were 4 to 5 degrees warmer than today, causing sea levels to be at least twenty-five feet higher.\n\nWeather and climate remain the product of complex interactions between ocean and atmosphere, a dance set to almost unimaginably complicated rhythms, made even more complicated because one partner\u2014 the atmosphere\u2014is enormously quicker to respond to change than the other.\n\nThe boundary between atmosphere and water is where the dance partners meet, but their rhythms are created elsewhere: in the ocean\u2019s depths, a three-dimensional maze of conveyor belts, powered by heat and salt. The top layer is warmed by the sun, whose rays penetrate a good forty meters, and not only contains most of the ocean\u2019s marine life (and CO2) but stores more than ten times as much energy as the entire Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The reason is specific heat: the amount of energy, measured in calories, needed to raise the temperature of a given mass of a particular substance by one degree Celsius. When the given mass is a gram, the specific heat is measured in small c calories; when it\u2019s a kilogram, the measure is kilocalories.* Whether measured in grams or kilos, the specific heat for water is higher than for virtually any other common substance. It takes one calorie to heat a gram of water by a single degree, which is nearly twice as much as alcohol, five times as much as aluminum, and\u2014most important\u2014more than four times as much as air. And that\u2019s just the top forty meters; because the total mass of the oceans is four hundred times that of the atmosphere, the amount of heat energy stored in the Earth\u2019s oceans is some sixteen hundred times that of the atmosphere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historians have long puzzled over the explosive growth of the Vikings.
