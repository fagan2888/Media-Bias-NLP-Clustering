Burwell. Would you be surprised to hear that it is a 100% political maneuver, and not backed by sound policy?\n\nRepublican senators, Politico reports, are \u201ccoalescing\u201d around a proposal put forward by endangered Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. It would temporarily extend the subsidies for plans purchased on federally facilitated exchanges if the Supreme Court invalidates them in its King decision. This would come at a big price: it \u201cwould also repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates and insurance coverage requirements.\u201d Johnson\u2019s bill would essentially restore one core component of the Affordable Care Act while eliminating the others. It would upend the mechanisms for universality on which the economics of the law hinge, and it would weaken the quality of coverage available. And since the subsidies would only be extended until 2017, that gives Republicans another opportunity in two years: either to repeal the law entirely, if there\u2019s a Republican president, or to extract more concessions, if the president is a Democrat.\n\nBut look at us being so whiny, trying to explain their obvious and cynical political strategy. Did we forget to take our chill pill this morning? It must be so. Because all Ron Johnson is trying to do with this bill is restore \u201ca little bit of freedom\u201d to the balance of the universe.\n\n\u201cIn that moment of what could be political chaos, we\u2019re offering such a reasonable proposal that solves a mess,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt fixes a mess caused by a sloppily written law, unlawfully implemented. All we\u2019re asking for is a little bit of freedom back, which would be, I think, pretty popular,\u201d Johnson said. Even Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is backing Johnson\u2019s measure, along with the rest of the chamber\u2019s GOP leaders.\n\nThe danger with Johnson\u2019s plan is that some of these alterations, specifically the repeal of the individual mandate, will indeed be \u201cpretty popular.\u201d The Democrats who wrote the bill did not include in the individual mandate because they thought that it would be popular. They put it in there to ensure the balance of risk pools. Without the individual mandate, some young and healthy people convinced of their invincibility might not sign up for health insurance, spiraling up the costs for those who do need health insurance right now, such as those with pre-existing conditions. This explanation of the law\u2019s mechanics, though, just isn\u2019t as politically compelling on a gut level as the Republicans\u2019 argument, which is that the individual mandate represents the greatest abrogation of freedom since slavery, or whatever is worse than slavery. Is anything worse than slavery? Yes: the tax penalty for those who do not carry health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If SCOTUS strikes down subsidies, the GOP has leverage.
