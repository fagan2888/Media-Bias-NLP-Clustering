Crooks themselves could become navigators, he said.\n\nIn a letter to Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber, he urged the department to \u201cmove quickly to establish state regulations that will protect Texans\u2019 medical privacy.\u201d\n\nRepublican members of the U.S. House, GOP state attorneys general and Gov. Rick Perry have warned that the federal government\u2019s rules and online 20-hour training course for navigators were inadequate.\n\nIn a mid-August letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Abbott and his peers in a dozen other states called the grant program \u201ca privacy disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nAbbott, a Republican who hopes to succeed Perry as governor in next year\u2019s election, has supported lawsuits and congressional efforts to overturn Obamacare.\n\nSupporters of the health care law, though, have dismissed the criticism. They say the objections over navigators are efforts to discourage enrollment in health insurance offered under the law.\n\nCommunity groups that for many years have received federal money to help enroll people in other programs have said their outreach workers have never caused identity theft and criminal scams.\n\nTexas doesn\u2019t require criminal background checks of the state eligibility-determination workers who help people sign up for Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, food stamps and cash assistance, said Stephanie Goodman of the state Health and Human Services Commission. Background checks are performed on those working for state contractors, though.\n\nSpokesman Jerry Strickland said he couldn\u2019t say whether Abbott sees danger in the lack of screening of state eligibility workers. He said, though, that the state workers receive regular and comprehensive training on proper handling of sensitive personal information.\n\nFollow Robert T.
