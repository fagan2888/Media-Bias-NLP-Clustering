Boston, MA

Chris Pratt made good on the Super Bowl bet he made with Chris Evans.

Pratt, a Seattle Seahawks fan bet Evans, a New England Patriots fan, that the Seahawks would win Super Bowl XLIX. The “loser” would have to dress up as their respective superhero character at a children’s hospital of the winners choosing.

Pratt came to Christopher’s Haven children’s hospital in Boston dressed as Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy. As you can see from the pictures, fun was had by all.

GREAT day at @chris_haven! You're my hero, @prattprattpratt. And look out @seattlechildren, you're next!! — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 6, 2015
