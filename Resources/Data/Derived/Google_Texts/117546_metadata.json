Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) had one of the more difficult tasks in politics, delivering the official Republican response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nAs with previous responders, she had to speak from an isolated setting \u2014 a quiet room inside the Capitol \u2014 and without the pomp and near-constant applause given to the president down the hall. Nevertheless, and to the surprise of many insiders, McMorris Rodgers largely succeeded \u2014 mixing plain-spoken platitudes with tenderly told stories about her children and her blue-collar roots.\n\nHouse GOP aides said her selection was driven in part by a desire to highlight Republican women, hoping to combat Democrats\u2019 aggressive criticism of the GOP\u2019s approach to women\u2019s issues.\n\nIt was all there \u2014 easygoing populism and an emphasis on jobs and her family, which includes a son with Down syndrome and a Navy veteran husband. It was as if a Republican pollster had created a politician with the exact profile that Republicans are looking to promote as they head toward this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nHere was an antiabortion, \u00adnever-offensive woman from a Western state who grew up picking apples on a farm; a youthful, 44-year-old evangelical Christian who is known as one of the savvier social-media users in the House, uploading photos to Instagram and videos to Vine.\n\n1 of 30 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 President Obama delivers his fifth State of the Union address View Photos The president focuses on ideas to improve the U.S. economy \u2014 including a new executive order to raise the minimum wage for workers employed through new federal contracts.

Marco Rubio (Fla.) did repeatedly last year in his response, and none of the clumsy articulation that caused long\u00ad-lasting headaches for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal in 2009 after he delivered the Republican response to an Obama economic speech. Instead, the congresswoman\u2019s delivery was relatively smooth as she whisked through her scripted remarks late Tuesday, seated on a gold couch with a folded American flag on a shelf behind her.\n\nNo drama, no problems. You could almost hear the collective exhale of relief by Republicans as they strolled through Statuary Hall, many of them watching McMorris Rodgers on their iPhones or televisions nearby. After a tumultuous year full of shutdowns and drama, Republicans cheered McMorris Rodgers\u2019s understated manner and upbeat, check-the-box appeal.\n\nThe essence of the speech was soft outreach and balance. \u201cI\u2019d like to share a more hopeful Republican vision,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said.\n\nShe criticized the president without going overboard. She talked about repealing the Affordable Care Act but didn\u2019t use a rhetorical hammer to make the point. On policy, she touched on economic growth and fiscal reform but never dove into the weeds, frustrating some conservative onlookers. She fulfilled the unspoken part of her duties: sound winsome and engaging, but do not make news.\n\n\u201cToo many people are falling further and further behind because, right now, the president\u2019s policies are making people\u2019s lives harder,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said, citing her days as a McDonald\u2019s drive-through employee as evidence of her empathy. \u201cRepublicans have plans to close the gap.\u201d\n\nOn health care: \u201cWe\u2019ve all talked to too many people who have received cancellation notices they didn\u2019t expect or who can no longer see the doctors they always have,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t go back to the way things were, but the president\u2019s health-care law is not working.\u201d\n\nYet, despite the clapping of the GOP faithful, questions linger, especially this one: Why is McMorris Rodgers only now getting widespread attention and a heavyweight billing from her party after five terms in the House and more than a year in the leadership? Until Tuesday night, many Americans, outside the usual Beltway types, had never heard of her.\n\nThe answer is complicated, partly because expectations for McMorris Rodgers inside the party hierarchy have rarely been as high as they are this week. She\u2019s admired and respected, but she has never been thought of as the next Nikki Haley or Susana Martinez \u2014 a possible star who could fire up a convention hall or a national ticket.\n\nNor has she been a major policy leader in the House in the Paul Ryan mold, building a reputation with reporters and colleagues as a wonk and legislative power broker. Rather, she is just \u201cCMR,\u201d as House aides have dubbed her, a low-key workhorse spokeswoman for the GOP cause, standing dutifully beside House Speaker John A. Boehner at weekly news conferences and touting the party\u2019s Web presence.\n\nHer ascension this week is partly due to the qualities that have kept her below the radar. In a House full of tea party sharks, Boehner has struggled to build a trusted coterie of younger lawmakers around him. Since they first met, he has been drawn to McMorris Rodgers\u2019s no-fuss approach to internal House politics. Boehner blessed her campaign for conference vice chairman in 2008 and then for conference chairman in late 2012, when she fended off a challenge from Rep. Tom Price (Ga.), a conservative who was endorsed by Ryan (Wis.) and his allies. McMorris Rodgers\u2019s personality also appealed to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who trusted her to be his Capitol Hill liaison.\n\nWith her assured response Tuesday night, that image as a friendly, iPad-toting leadership loyalist finally seems to be falling away.\n\nTalk of a possible veep slot in 2016 is in the air, as is the possibility that McMorris Rodgers will rise through the House Republican ranks should Boehner decide to step down in the coming years. Even though she has been part of the brass for a while, it\u2019s as if Republicans are suddenly waking up to the focus-group charm of CMR.\n\nHere was someone with a compelling story who spoke Tuesday like a real person \u2014 a little stiff, maybe, but someone who doesn\u2019t suffer from the usual Capitol Hill airs.\n\n\u201cThe most important moments right now aren\u2019t happening here. They\u2019re not in the Oval Office or in the House chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re in your homes: kissing your kids good night, figuring out how to pay the bills, getting ready for tomorrow\u2019s doctor\u2019s visit, waiting to hear from those you love serving in Afghanistan or searching for that big job interview.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, the challenge for McMorris Rodgers will be whether she can seize the moment and build the national profile that so far has eluded her.\n\nShe has a leadership political action committee, which was busy last cycle raising more than $1 million for the National Republican Campaign Committee, but she doesn\u2019t have an extensive political team. Her brother, Jeff McMorris, is probably her closest political adviser, having guided her campaigns since she first ran for the House.\n\nIt\u2019s an open playbook for McMorris Rodgers. She has Boehner\u2019s full support and new interest from the media, and she remains the only woman in the elected Republican leadership in Congress. With all she had to offer Tuesday for a party that is struggling to close the gender gap and rebound from back-to-back defeats in national elections, it\u2019s a wonder she hasn\u2019t appeared on the scene sooner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "McMorris Rodgers does the impossible - succeeding at a response speech.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "McMorris Rodgers does the impossible - succeeding at a response speech.", "title": "McMorris Rodgers shines in giving plain-spoken GOP response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcmorris-rodgers-comes-through-for-gop-in-response-to-state-of-the-union/2014/01/29/3e8f3dd0-88b1-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/29/Others/Images/2014-01-28/_MAM94201390963215.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@costareports"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcmorris-rodgers-comes-through-for-gop-in-response-to-state-of-the-union/2014/01/29/3e8f3dd0-88b1-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "cathy mcmorris rodgers, republican response, state of the union", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports"}, "eomportal-uuid": "3e8f3dd0-88b1-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "cathy mcmorris rodgers, republican response, state of the union"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3549\"", "article_summary": "Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\nBobby Jindal in 2009 after he delivered the Republican response to an Obama economic speech.\nNevertheless, and to the surprise of many insiders, McMorris Rodgers largely succeeded \u2014 mixing plain-spoken platitudes with tenderly told stories about her children and her blue-collar roots.\nIt\u2019s an open playbook for McMorris Rodgers.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to share a more hopeful Republican vision,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said."}
