Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Orin Hatch, R-Utah, Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Chris Coons, D-Del., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.\n\nThe I-Squared bill would more than double the number of H-1B work visas handed out to foreigners with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in a STEM field. The U.S. currently allows 65,000 of these visas per year but the corporate lobby is pushing Congress to up that number to at least 115,000 and possibly as high as 200,000, claiming there is a shortage of American tech workers with STEM degrees (science, technology, engineering and math).\n\nThey say increasing the allotment of H1-B workers coming into the country from places like China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Turkey, Yemen and Saudi Arabia would jump-start economic growth.\n\nOpponents of I-Squared say the entire argument of this lobbying group is built around a false narrative. Groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies and the Economic Policy Institute point to statistics that show roughly half of Americans who graduate with STEM degrees have been unable to find work in a STEM field because there is already a glut of STEM workers. This is underscored by another stark trend \u2013 the utter lack of wage increases among tech workers over the past 10 years.\n\nWND reported in depth on the H1-B worker scam last month.\n\nSecret meeting on Capitol Hill today\n\nAccording to a brochure obtained by WND, Friday\u2019s lobbying event is co-sponsored by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Business Roundtable, the Council for Global Immigration, FWD.us, HR Policy Association, Information Technology Industry Council, National Association of Manufacturers, National Venture Capital Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, Society of Human Resources Management, and TechNet.\n\nThe brochure says the lobbying \u201cbriefing,\u201d which includes lunch, is \u201cclosed to the press.\u201d It was slated to begin at 11 a.m. Friday in the Senate Visitor\u2019s Center Room 212-10. The title of the event is: \u201cUnderstanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program.\u201d\n\nThe companion to the Senate I-Squared bill is the SKILLS Visa Act in the House, sponsored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. and co-sponsored by 22 congressmen.\n\nAlso included as part of the legislation is a measure to grant work permits to spouses of the H1-B visa holders.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, recently authored a study of the H1B guest-worker program and concluded there is no shortage of STEM workers in America. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, there were more than twice as many people with STEM degrees (immigrant and native) as there were STEM jobs \u2014 5.3 million STEM jobs vs. 12.1 million with STEM degrees,\u201d Camarota said. \u201cOnly one-third of natives who have a STEM degree and hold a job do so in a STEM occupation.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as Camarota explains it, the \u201cskilled-labor shortage\u201d argument is little more than a con game waged on Congress and the American public by corporate interests seeking to further their goal of open borders or what they call \u201clabor mobility.\u201d\n\nAmong the most impassioned proponents of this strategy are Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Marco Rubio, the Florida senator. Both have announced they are running for president on the Republican ticket.\n\nBush, in an interview with Thane Rosenbaum, said America\u2019s best chance to rejuvenate itself and get back on the path of sustained economic growth lies with increased immigration. He calls for unlimited growth in guest-worker visas and is critical of the \u201cborder security first\u201d approach to immigration.\n\nRubio, while trying to paint himself as a hawk on \u201cborder security,\u201d sources on Capitol Hill say he has been working behind the scenes to increase legal pathways into the country for more immigrants. The I-Squared bill is one example.\n\nOne source on Capitol Hill told WND that many congressmen are sold on the merits of such anti-American worker bills as I-Squared by their staffs. If they push these bills, staff members can look forward to a lucrative corporate job when they leave Capitol Hill.\n\nIn contrast, there is nothing to be gained by listening to experts such as professors Ron Hira of Howard University and Hal Salzman of Rutgers, both of whom testified at a Senate hearing last month on the H1-B program. They explained how the program started out with laudable goals of meeting real shortages in certain skilled positions. Those shortages have long since been solved, with universities churning out scores of STEM graduates, and now the program is being abused by corporate leaders who see the program as a way to further drive down wages. Some companies such as South California Edison and Northeastern Utilities have even had American workers train their own H1-B replacements.\n\nIn the SoCal Edison case, about 500 American workers earning $110,000 per year were replaced by foreign H1-B visa holders who will do the same job for $70,000.\n\nExploiting loopholes\n\nHira, a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute and a professor of public policy at Howard University, told a Senate panel last month the H1-B guest-worker program has evolved into a highly profitable business model of bringing in cheaper H1-B workers to replace American workers.\n\nIn explaining the H1-B rules, he said the U.S. Department of Labor clearly states that the hiring of a foreign worker \u201cwill not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers comparably employed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a direct quote from the website that describes the H1-B program to employers. The reality is, that in fact the intent of the law is not being met,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recent replacement of 500 American IT workers at Southern California Edison shows that this intent is clearly not being met and that U.S. workers are clearly getting adverse effects in terms of their wages and working conditions.\u201d\n\nThe corporations are able to get around the H1-B requirements of recruiting Americans first because rules are waived for jobs paying at least $60,000 or if the foreign worker has a master\u2019s degree.\n\nWatch clip of Professor Hira\u2019s testimony March 18 before Senate panel:\n\nCo-Chairs of the Partnership for a New American Economy are:\n\nMichael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and billionaire founder of Bloomberg news.\n\nSteven A. Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft and owner of the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team.\n\nJ.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and CEO of Marriott International.\n\nJulian Castro, former mayor of San Antonio, one of the first cities to pass controversial \u201canti discrimination\u201d laws that forbid businesses from saying or doing anything deemed discriminatory against the LGBT community. President Obama appointed him last year to head the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. He is the brother of Rep. Joachin Castro, D-Texas.\n\nBob Iger, chairman, CEO of Walt Disney Co.\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman, founder of Newscorp, owner of Fox News network.\n\nMichael Nutter, Democrat mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nJim McNerney, Chairman CEO of Boeing.\n\nAnother point of contention with the H1-B visa program is the security risk. Critics say workers coming in from Muslim countries with large radicalized populations such as Iran, Yemen, Pakistan, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, are only lightly screened and may wish to harm Americans. The U.S. record of screening immigrants is not good, as scores of terrorists or terrorist sympathizers have slipped through in recent years, even in the State Department\u2019s refugee resettlement program, which the government claims is the most highly scrutinized of all immigrant categories.\n\nThe employer-based immigration programs, including H1-B and L-1B visas, are basically \u201crubber stamped,\u201d from a security standpoint, said Jessica Vaughn, director of policy research at Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe U.S. is currently allowing about 100,000 immigrants per year to enter from Islamic countries, including refugees and those on student visas and employer-based visas, according to the CIS study.\n\nThe H1-B visa is good for three years and can be renewed one time for a total of six years. It can eventually lead to a permanent green card.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A group of business leaders and progressive mayors is hosting a closed-door meeting in Washington today, pushing for a big increase in the number of foreign \u201cguest workers\u201d allowed into the United States to fill skilled positions.
