Both the MOB and the hospital are 100 percent leased and occupied.\n\nDurango, located in southwest Colorado at the foot of the San Juan Mountains, is home to more than 17,000 residents and is a popular vacation destination.\n\n\u201cRiverGate Medical Center is a very solid investment with significant long-term market share,\u201d says MedProperties Managing Principal Darryl E. Freling. \u201cIt\u2019s also a unique asset that is delivering high-quality, much-needed healthcare services to both local and second-home residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe medical center is in an ideal location near downtown Durango and has the closest emergency room to the nearby skiing and snowboarding areas. It\u2019s home to some of the top orthopedic surgeons in this area,\u201d says MedProperties Managing Principal Roman J. Kupchynsky II.\n\nAnother attractive feature of the investment, Mr. Kupchynsky continues, is that the physician-owned surgical hospital is eligible for federal reimbursements for treatment of Medicare patients. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010, commonly called the healthcare reform law, barred new physician-owned hospitals from receiving Medicare reimbursement. However, because the hospital was built in 2005, it is \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d and is eligible to receive those federal dollars.\n\n\u201cRiverGate is one of the few physician-owned hospitals that can accept both private pay and government reimbursed patients,\u201d Mr. Kupchynsky points out. \u201cThat gives our hospital tenant a sustainable, long-term competitive advantage, which makes the real estate an even more solid investment for MedProperties, Caddis Partners and our investors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Caddis Partners\u2019 seventh investment with MedProperties, continuing with what has been a very successful partnership over the years,\u201d says Matt Mattox, Executive Vice President/Partner with Caddis. \u201cThese two assets are an integral part of the Durango community and the Four Corners region and are a great fit for our respective platforms. We intend to work collaboratively with our tenant base to make a great healthcare setting even better.\u201d\n\nThe RiverGate hospital, which is operated by Nashville, Tenn.-based Symbion Healthcare, offers a full range of services including anesthesiology, ear/nose/throat, emergency medicine, plastic/reconstructive surgery and pain management, as well as quality care for women including gynecology. RiverGate Medical Center is close to downtown Durango, with frontage along the east side of the Animas River and views of the Rocky Mountains. The facility is accessible via Saw Mill Road, which connects with Colorado Highway 3 and is a major thoroughfare to downtown Durango.\n\nDebt for the acquisition was provided by GE Healthcare Financial Services, a division of GE Capital Corp.\n\nAbout MedProperties\n\nMedProperties Holdings LLC is a Dallas-based healthcare real estate private equity firm with offices in Greenville, S.C., that provides qualified developers and owner/operators with a consistent source of equity investment for the development of new, or value-added acquisitions of existing, healthcare-related real estate projects, including both multi-tenant medical office buildings and single-tenant, specialty facilities, as well as selected senior housing communities.
