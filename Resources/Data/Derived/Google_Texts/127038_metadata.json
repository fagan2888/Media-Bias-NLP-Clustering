Parker and Ward of WDBJ7\u2013a local CBS station\u2013were in Moneta, Virginia around 6:45am this morning when suspect Vester Lee Flanagan, a reportedly \u201cdisgruntled\u201d ex-employee, opened fire. As Cortney reported earlier this morning, Parker was interviewing local Chamber Commerce official Vicki Gardner, who was hit in the back. She\u2019s currently in surgery.\n\nThis is a horrific incident. Parker was 24-years-old. Ward was 27. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families. Sadly, not everyone had such sentiments. While they may have offered prayers, the gun control crowd unsurprisingly took a jab at the National Rifle Association in yet another feeble attempt to make their cause relevant.\n\nThere\u2019s no hot-take Twitter quite like gun-control-hot-take Twitter \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) August 26, 2015\n\nFirst, let\u2019s go to Everytown\u2019s Twitter account, who decided to remind us that a firearm is the weapons of choice for domestic abusers. Katie wrote a while back how they even produced an ad about this subject, which actually demonstrated why more women should exercise their Second Amendment rights. Obviously, that wasn't their intention.\n\nThe United States the most dangerous country for women in the developed world. #WDBJ pic.twitter.com/ijiIFq5bFY \u2014 Everytown (@Everytown) August 26, 2015\n\nThen, the New York Post\u2019s Bart Hubbuch who decided to engage in similar nonsensical behavior, praising New York City\u2019s tough gun laws while also claiming that today\u2019s tragedy was \u201canother proud moment for the NRA.\u201d\n\nHorrifying. Another proud moment for the NRA. Thank you, NYC, for your strict gun laws! https://t.co/RyW73dh5nL \u2014 Bart Hubbuch (@BartHubbuch) August 26, 2015\n\nI support your Second Amendment right to be well regulated. \u2014 Bart Hubbuch (@BartHubbuch) August 26, 2015\n\nPeople bum-rushing my mentions: If you want to live where guys tote AR-15s to the grocery store, fine. I just choose to live somewhere sane. \u2014 Bart Hubbuch (@BartHubbuch) August 26, 2015\n\nPeople bum-rushing my mentions: If you want to live where guys tote AR-15s to the grocery store, fine.

Terry McAuliffe tweeted that he was \u201cheartbroken over [these] senseless murder today,\u201d but also made a call for more gun control:\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called for tighter gun laws in response to the deadly shooting of two Roanoke, Virginia-based TV journalists during a live broadcast this morning in his state. \u201cThere are too many guns in the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have guns,\u201d McAuliffe said during an interview with WTOP. \u201cThere is too much gun violence in America,\u201d he said, adding that he has long advocated for strengthening gun background checks and that it should be made a priority. [\u2026] The shooting quickly captured national attention \u2014 with presidential candidates like Martin O\u2019Malley, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz all sending their condolences to the victims\u2019 families on social media.\n\nFor starters, I wish I could say a prayer and offer a condolence without things getting political, but the other side has no standards, no decency, and must make made statements in the hopes that the national attitude towards, in this instance, Second Amendment rights might change with this horrific double-murder. It\u2019s hasn\u2019t. It won\u2019t.\n\nIn Virginia, our gun laws will be safe. We have a Republican-controlled legislature, with a supermajority in the House of Delegates. We\u2019ve killed gun control measures from the governor before, and it will happen again.\n\nWhile New York City has strict gun laws, so does Washington D.C.\u2013and they\u2019re seeing a spike in homicides. Police Chief Cathy Lanier says this is due to an influx of firearms with high-capacity magazines. Yet, Fox5DC\u2019s Emily Miller aptly noted that magazine capacity isn\u2019t listed on the police form regarding recovered firearms:\n\nLast week, I asked the chief to back up her claim. \u201cIn D.C., over ten rounds is high capacity, but your department doesn\u2019t trace what kind of magazine size guns have. I\u2019m asking when you say high capacity, where are you getting that information?\" I asked. \u201cFrom the guns that we\u2019ve recovered,\u201d Lanier responded. \u201cSo I'm talking about 100-round drum magazines -- that would be high capacity.\u201d She also added, \u201cHigh-capacity magazines are magazines that are designed to enhance the normal capacity of a firearm.\u201d But a form police use when they get property in a crime has a section for firearms. It asks for a brand name -- a Glock would be an example for that column -- and then type -- such as a handgun or rifle. Then there are other specifics. No. of shots is for how many rounds of ammunition is still in the gun when the police seize it. But there is no section for ammunition capacity on the form, which means how many rounds the gun, could hold. Sources in the police department said they just don\u2019t track it.\n\nMaybe the spike in crime in DC\u2013and in Chicago\u2013are due to stringent anti-gun laws that keep law-abiding citizens open to harm, chief. As for New York City, there\u2019s an ongoing debate about whether stop and frisk was effective. Moreover, a change in policing\u2013broken windows theory\u2013during the Giuliani mayoralty might have also impacted the decrease in New York City\u2019s crime rate. After all, New York City wasn\u2019t always safe. For nearly a quarter century, the city was a nightmare, with homicides soaring to over 2,000 by 1990. I doubt the murder rate ever reached that high in Moneta, Virginia, even by percentage.\n\nRegardless, today was a dark day. The families of these two young journalists are devastated, and they surely got no help from the political left today. Keep in mind, that all of this progressive nonsense was being spewed before the suspect was even caught. We now know that Flanagan shot himself and is in critical condition.\n\nParting Thoughts:\n\n.@NRA Was that on-air double homicide by handgun sponsored content? \u2014 rob delaney (@robdelaney) August 26, 2015\n\nThe @NRA & the politicians they own must not know this T.

This is America 2015, a brave new world. \u2014 Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) August 26, 2015\n\nThat's a gross exaggeration, Ms. Ioffe.\n\nClinton also gave her thoughts, which, as Truth Revolt's Caleb Howe noted, placed prayers for the victims' families in the third spot.\n\nHeartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 26, 2015\n\nFriendly Reminder: That time RedState's Erick Erickson said that everything is political to the left, there's an arc of history where they must land on the right side of, and you will be forced to care. No one can escape. This is why such tragic incidents will always turn into political theater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took less than five hours....05/26/2016 18:29:42PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It took less than five hours...", "title": "Matt Vespa - Gun Control Crowd Already Exploiting Horrific WDBJ Shooting", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/26/gun-control-crowd-already-exploiting-horrific-wdbj7-shooting-n2044046", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/238/7f3dcd47-fb31-45d0-aa14-adc3bae658ee.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It took less than five hours...", "title": "Matt Vespa - Gun Control Crowd Already Exploiting Horrific WDBJ Shooting", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/26/gun-control-crowd-already-exploiting-horrific-wdbj7-shooting-n2044046", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/238/7f3dcd47-fb31-45d0-aa14-adc3bae658ee.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Gun Control Crowd Already Exploiting Horrific WDBJ Shooting, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While New York City has strict gun laws, so does Washington D.C.\u2013and they\u2019re seeing a spike in homicides.\nThank you, NYC, for your strict gun laws!\nTerry McAuliffe called for tighter gun laws in response to the deadly shooting of two Roanoke, Virginia-based TV journalists during a live broadcast this morning in his state.\nhttps://t.co/RyW73dh5nL \u2014 Bart Hubbuch (@BartHubbuch) August 26, 2015I support your Second Amendment right to be well regulated.\nIn Virginia, our gun laws will be safe."}
