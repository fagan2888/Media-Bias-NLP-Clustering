He was among six northern political and business leaders participating in the live stream web event on economic opportunities in Northern Ontario. Other panelists included Al Spacek, mayor of Kapuskasing and president of Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities; Lawrence Martin, Grand Chief of Mushkegowuk Council and former mayor of Sioux Lookout; Jamie Lim, president and CEO, Ontario Forest Industries Association\n\nModerator and Empire Club president Ted Griffith invited the panelists to share their views on the region\u2019s potential for economic growth as well as the barriers and solutions to natural resource development in the North.\n\nCanfield noted that Northern Ontario occupies 86 per cent of Ontario\u2019s geography but just six per cent of the province\u2019s population. As a result, the northern perspective is often ignored at Queen\u2019s Park when decisions are made on natural resources development in region.\n\n\u201cCentralized decision-making in Queens Park doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s too far away. Include us in the policy process and it will work,\u201d he said.\n\nCanfield cited the need for new transportation and energy infrastructure in to support economic development in the north. He noted the new roads and rail lines will provide access to resources and markets while electrical generation will provide energy for sawmills and mines.\n\nGrand Chief Martin expressed similar sentiments noting resource developments such as the Ring of Fire mineralization zone provide unprecedented opportunities for employment, economic and social growth on remote First Nation communities. He noted new transportation corridors and power stations to power sawmills and mines could also connect remote First Nations to the rest of the province and provide a clean energy alternative to diesel generation in these communities.\n\nHowever, the grand chief suggested the historic relationship between government and First Nations is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and poses a barrier that must be overcome to engage aboriginal communities in development initiatives.\n\n\u201cFirst Nations are new players in the process. Watching what\u2019s happening in the north; it\u2019s a great opportunity to get involved and to be a part of that development.\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to spend time in the courtrooms, we want to spend time in the board rooms. Now it\u2019s time for business.\u201d\n\nAccording to OFIA\u2019s Lim, misguided environmentalism and public polices based on sentiment rather than scientific due diligence poses the greatest barrier to ensure a consistent supply of affordable fibre and customers to facilitate a resurgence in the regional forest industry.\n\n\u201cLess wood equals fewer jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are 85 billion trees in the province and the annual harvest of 0.5 per cent supports 170,000 jobs in 260 communities. That\u2019s not a bad return.\u201d\n\nLim did not mince words in accusing environmental organizations such as Green Peace and the Rain Forest Action Network for launching \u201carbitrary misinformation campaigns\u201d targeting customers of forest products providers, urging them not to buy from producers. She said the influence of special interest lobbies extends to the premier\u2019s office resulting in more rather than fewer barriers to harvesting the region\u2019s greatest renewable resource.\n\nShe suggested the Ontario government should follow the example set by Manitoba and Quebec by finding the \u201cpolitical will to stand up to special interests with the clear message that the province is not going to turn the Boreal Forest into a park.\u201d\n\nRegarding development of the North\u2019s energy generating potential, Spacek said the province needs to streamline rather than complicate the permitting process. He referred to the 10,000 MW of untapped electrical generating potential in the North and a $300-million initiative to develop 14 hydro generating stations that won\u2019t move forward without provincial support.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s broke and it needs to be fixed,\u201d Spacek said.\n\nThe panelists agreed the province can reduce barriers by appointing a \u2018Business Commissioner\u2019 to act on behalf of industry by streamlining the process of permit approvals from the various ministries involved in natural resources development.\n\n\u201cThe province\u2019s \u2018Open for Business\u2019 (slogan) hasn\u2019t made it any easier,\u201d Lim concluded. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the people who created the issues to solve the issues.\u201d\n\nReg.Clayton@sunmedia.ca\n\ntwitter@RegClayton", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, Local, Provincial, Canada, World, Sports, High School Sports, Local Hockey, Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Lacrosse, Curling, Other Sports, Entertainment, Local, Movies, Music, Television,  Celebrities, Life, Health, Food, Travel, Money, Opinion, Editorial, Letters, Column, Your Newspaper, Social medias, Events, UR, News, Sports, Life, Entertainment, Money, Opinion, Marketplace, Photos, Videos, Contests, Polls, Weather, Sitemap, Event Submission", "author": "nurun.com", "og": {"image": "http://storage.kenoradailyminerandnews.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297683865953_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1428273056174", "site_name": "Kenora Daily Miner and News", "description": "Northern Ontario is rich in minerals and timber but \r\nunless the provincial government changes the way it \r\nthinks and acts about the region, the potential of \r\nthese resources to create jobs, spur economic \r\ndevelopment and social growth will remain untapped.", "title": "State of the North"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Canfield noted that Northern Ontario occupies 86 per cent of Ontario\u2019s geography but just six per cent of the province\u2019s population.\nCanfield cited the need for new transportation and energy infrastructure in to support economic development in the north.\nHe was among six northern political and business leaders participating in the live stream web event on economic opportunities in Northern Ontario.\nAs a result, the northern perspective is often ignored at Queen\u2019s Park when decisions are made on natural resources development in region.\nCanfield was taking part in a panel discussion as president of the Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association."}
