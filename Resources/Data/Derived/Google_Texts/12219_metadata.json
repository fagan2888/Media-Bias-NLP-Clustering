At the same time, the number of psychiatric hospital beds available decreased by 32 percent.\n\nThis has left hundreds of thousands of the mentally ill on the streets, in emergency rooms or behind bars. Mental illness accounts for 6 percent of total health care costs and yet the cost of treatment, disability benefits and lost productivity add up to a loss of almost $450 billion for the U.S. economy.\n\nThese numbers frame a year-long investigation by USA Today into the toll this crisis is taking on families, on the economy and on the health care system. They\u2019re calling it \u201cThe Cost of Not Caring.\u201d\n\nLiz Szabo is a health reporter for USA Today and she is the main author of the series.\n\nAnd, Liz Szabo, welcome to the program.\n\nLIZ SZABO, USA Today: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The sheer magnitude of this problem is staggering, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLIZ SZABO: Yes, it\u2019s really something that touches everyone, and we wanted to call the series \u201cThe Cost of Not Caring\u201d to show how we all pay the cost both in dollars and in human suffering.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What drew your attention to it in particular? You cover health regularly, but what about mental health in particular?\n\nLIZ SZABO: I think this story grew out of some of the mass tragedies that we have suffered in the past few years, but we also wanted to go beyond those shootings.\n\nI learned a lot about the health care system and what\u2019s going wrong, but we really wanted to look at the tragedies that happen every day, privately in people\u2019s homes and the losses that people are suffering from mental illness that don\u2019t make headlines.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How did you find out how widespread this is?\n\nLIZ SZABO: We made a lot of phone calls and we talked to a lot of people around the country. We have heard from many families with heartbreaking stories that are just sadly familiar, people trying to get help and just not managing.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, Liz, we have right now \u2014 as you were saying, you talked to a lot of people around the country.\n\nI want to show our viewers just a short excerpt of one of the people you spent time with. Her name is Karen Kelly. She lives in Vermont. And here\u2019s part of what she had to say.\n\nKAREN KELLY: The year I turned 40, I noticed that was really sad. I couldn\u2019t get happy or excited about anything.\n\nMy husband gave me a wonderful weekend in Montreal, and I had an absolutely miserable time. I came back and told him that I thought that I was depressed. I went through a screening. And the psychologist said, you absolutely have depression.\n\nMost of the time, it\u2019s not something you can explain. For a lot of people, they can look really good on the outside, and on the inside be a total mess, yet they have to still live with it, and it\u2019s a struggle.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What happened to her? She got into a pretty dire set of circumstances, didn\u2019t she?\n\nLIZ SZABO: It was an extraordinary situation. She\u2019s a wife and mom, like many of your viewers. And she recognized that she needed help. She was thinking about death and her psychiatrist couldn\u2019t find her a hospital bed.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t get help. She knew she would have to be on the verge of death to get help, so she swallowed an entire bottle of pills, went to the emergency room. The closest bed they could find three days later was in the next state.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: She had to go across state lines.\n\nLIZ SZABO: She had to go 200 miles.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: To get into a place where she could be treated.\n\nLIZ SZABO: That\u2019s right. And an ambulance took her to Massachusetts, at a cost of $3,600, which was paid for largely by Medicare.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How typical is her situation?\n\nLIZ SZABO: It\u2019s pretty typical.\n\nWe hear horror stories from every emergency room in the country that we talk to. There is something going on called boarding. When someone goes to the emergency room and they can\u2019t get a psychiatric bed, they just live in the E.R. We talked to someone who said he has had psychotic patients for two weeks waiting in the E.R. just waiting a bed.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Why, Liz Szabo, do you believe in your reporting it\u2019s gotten to this sort of epidemic state that it is?\n\nLIZ SZABO: There are a lot of complicated reasons, but the recession really hit the mental health field hard. States cut nearly $5 billion from mental health care services just from 2009 to 2012.\n\nSo they cut 10 percent of all the health care psychiatric beds in the country. So, it\u2019s really just gotten to be a crisis state.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But, before that, was the country doing pretty well by people who were mentally ill?\n\nLIZ SZABO: I don\u2019t think there has ever been a sense that the mental health system has done particularly well.\n\nThere was a move in the \u201960s to get people out of hospital beds and to get people out of institutions into the community. Unfortunately, the community resources never materialized. People really were left with nowhere to go.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And I remember \u2014 you and I were talking just before the year here. I covered the Jimmy Carter presidency.\n\nRosalynn Carter, the first lady, made this a central focus for herself, that the mentally ill, not enough attention, not enough resources. And yet I have guess you have seen since then it just takes a constant effort.\n\nLIZ SZABO: Yes. It really does get pushed to the back-burner.\n\nPeople say that when there are budget cuts, mental health is one of the first things to be cut. Maybe it\u2019s because people who are profoundly disabled can\u2019t always advocate for themselves. And I think there seems to be a false idea that \u2014 that we don\u2019t have to pay for mental health, we can somehow get by on skimping.\n\nBut what we find is, when mental health care gets cut, states do pay. They pay by paying for the emergency room. They pay to build homeless shelters. They pay to build prisons. I think something like 16 percent of people in prison and jails are psychotic, acutely psychotic.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So if these people, if these folks are not able to get some kind of treatment early on, then they end up in a much worse place?\n\nLIZ SZABO: Often, yes.\n\nWhen did the tally, I think we tallied up 590,000. Over half-a-million Americans are in these new institutions, in prisons, in homeless shelters or the morgue. There are 38,000 suicides a year. That\u2019s more than deaths from homicide, more than deaths from prostate cancer, more than deaths from car accidents.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And you were also telling me \u2014 we mentioned USA Today is making this a year-long series.\n\nYou\u2019re focusing on the costs. There\u2019s also the stigma associated with being mentally ill or having an emotional illness.\n\nLIZ SZABO: Yes. And we\u2019re going to be looking into the issue of stigma, because stigma can prevent people from getting help if they\u2019re afraid of being labeled.\n\nIt also \u2014 it also keeps people from just supporting their neighbors. People tell me that if you have, God forbid, a child with cancer, your neighbors will come over and offer their support. When you have a child with schizophrenia, your neighbors turn away.\n\nSo, what we\u2019re hoping is \u2014 we can\u2019t put $5 billion back into state coffers by ourselves, but we\u2019re hoping that we can help inspire a little compassion and understanding, if only for these families and people going through the suffering.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Liz Szabo, reporter with USA Today.\n\nAnd the series you\u2019re doing this year is \u201cThe Cost of Not Caring,\u201d about the mentally ill.
