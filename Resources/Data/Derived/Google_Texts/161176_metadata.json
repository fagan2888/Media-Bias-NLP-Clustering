CoverKids, which is Tennessee\u2019s verison of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, is available for a family of four making up to $59,628 a year.\n\nRon Pollack, president of Families USA, said he\u2019s worried that political gridlock in Congress could put health coverage in jeopardy for as many as 2 million children. It could cost a family as much as $16,000 a year to buy coverage on the private market, he said.\n\n\u201cThe refunding of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is the most important health policy issue that Congress will need to face in the next year and possibly the entire next Congress,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nOn July 29, the heads of the House and Senate committees responsible for bills that would extend funding sent letters to the nation\u2019s governors asking for their input on whether and how the program should be extended and what changes should be made.\n\n\u201cGovernors know best how CHIP is working for their state\u2019s children, families and hospitals, and I\u2019m glad members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Finance Committee first asked Gov. Haslam and others to inform any work we do in Washington on this program,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. \u201cInsight from governors will be critical in best serving children in Tennessee and across the country.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said the CHIP program matters for families.\n\n\u201cCHIP makes sure health insurance is available and affordable for millions of children,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWithout it \u2014 and especially if Tennessee fails to expand Medicaid \u2014 many children could lose coverage. No one wants that.\u201d\n\nPollack is worried that the program will become part of the battle over the Affordable Care Act or get caught up with a bigger funding issue involving Medicare payments to doctors. The letter from the heads of the two congressional committees asks governors how that federal health law has changed their CHIP programs. But it also asks other questions, such as how to improve enrollment.\n\nThe bipartisan letter was signed by both the top Democrat and top Republican from each committee.\n\nCHIP was created by Congress in 1997 and reauthorized in 2009, when there was more political debate about the program. Both Alexander and U.S. Sen. Bob Corker supported that reauthorization bill, which also included funding for safety-net hospitals in the state that treat large numbers of uninsured and under-insured people.\n\nReach Tom Wilemon at 615-726-5961 or on Twitter @TomWilemon.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/08/11/coverkids-funding-runs-september/13873747/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Political gridlock in Congress could jeopardize renewed funding.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Political gridlock in Congress could jeopardize renewed funding.", "title": "CoverKids funding runs out in September 2015", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/08/11/coverkids-funding-runs-september/13873747/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Political gridlock in Congress could jeopardize renewed funding.", "title": "CoverKids funding runs out in September 2015", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8e59b842c7cd27a5b67d19d9bfd014097dbb8c/c=170-0-853-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tom-WilemonThe-Tennessean/120277341389247?ref=hl"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Jim Cooper", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Jim Cooper", "title": "CoverKids funding runs out in September 2015", "author": "Tom Wilemon", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b528a7eac22cc5cd1908eba51a8107fe161d07a/c=256-0-768-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c92e25f510c9b23dbabc529941195a50a3815bd3/c=56-0-967-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46e362b5c8a42f83e67d9ae3b3126cb697ee5c08/c=0-54-1024-630&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-10T23:04:01.667000-05:00", "shorthed": "CoverKids funding runs out in 2015", "articleid": 13873747, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5761a5644dbbbc0d07f1118b0a22ef5d2dbaa88b/c=0-54-1024-630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0228b51f267028c240180b67da039bf980e3fa9/c=320-0-704-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/10/kidshealthcare.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "CoverKids, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, health care, Ron Pollack, Families USA, Lamar Alexander, Jim Cooper"}, "article_summary": "CoverKids, which is Tennessee\u2019s verison of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, is available for a family of four making up to $59,628 a year.\n(Photo: Thinkstock.com )Money that provides health insurance to 68,000 children in Tennessee through CoverKids ends in September unless Congress renews funding for the program.\n\u201cCHIP makes sure health insurance is available and affordable for millions of children,\u201d Cooper said.\n\u201cThe refunding of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is the most important health policy issue that Congress will need to face in the next year and possibly the entire next Congress,\u201d Pollack said.\nRon Pollack, president of Families USA, said he\u2019s worried that political gridlock in Congress could put health coverage in jeopardy for as many as 2 million children."}
