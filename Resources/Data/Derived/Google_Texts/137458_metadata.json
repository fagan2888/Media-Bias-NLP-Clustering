The Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed in 2010, after taxpayer-funded bailouts of banks during the financial crisis, made it a matter of law that public funds would no longer be used to save troubled banks.\n\nRELATED: BREAK UP BIG BANKS? HERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION\n\nIn his speech, delivered at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington, Lew said, \u201ctough rules are now in place to make sure banks have the capital to absorb their own losses; monitoring through stress tests is underway; and resolution authorities and plans are in place. There is a growing recognition of these changes, and market analysts are now factoring them into their assumptions.\u201d\n\nU.S financial services regulators, he assured listeners, have put in place new rules that mean \u201cshareholders, creditors, and executives\u2014not taxpayers\u2014will be responsible if a large financial institution fails.\u201d\n\nThe assessment from bankers, former regulators, and academics was not as positive.\n\n\u201cThey are dreaming,\u201d said Peter Wallison, a former Treasury Department general counsel who now serves as co-director of the American Enterprise Institute's program on financial policy studies\n\n\u201cWhat we had in the financial crisis was weakness among all the banks at the same time -- correlated risk. Dodd-Frank doesn\u2019t even address correlated risk,\u201d Wallison said. \u201cIf you think about what an administrator or government official is going to do in the future when we have something like what occurred in 2008, the only solution for the government at the time will be to prevent the failure of that large institution that will be the first of many.\u201d\n\nCamden Fine, president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group in Washington representing small banks, said, \u201cI take his statement not with a grain of salt but with a block of salt.\u201d\n\nFine continued, \u201cTreasury secretaries, for several years prior to the recent crisis, would disavow that too big to fail even existed. They said it was just a myth. Then in 2008, we found out it wasn\u2019t a myth.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 5 YEARS AFTER THE CRISIS: WHAT BANKS HAVEN'T LEARNED\n\nIn the future, Fine said, there\u2019s little reason to expect anything different to happen.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee you that politics trumps policy every time and if we got into a true Fall of 2008 situation again, where a dozen of the nation\u2019s very largest financial firms were collapsing, I guarantee you that whatever administration is in power would act to stabilize the system and I fear they would have to bail them out,\u201d Fine said.\n\nFine said that the changes to the regulations under Dodd-Frank have had a positive effect on the safety of large banks. The requirement that banks hold more capital to guard against losses, to decrease leverage, and the upcoming finalization of a rule barring banks from making speculative investments all help, he said.\n\n\u201cBut that does not necessarily end too big to fail. When you are dealing with a dozen banks that hold collectively $13 plus trillion of assets, that is going to become a political question,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked to comment on Lew\u2019s speech, Cornelius Hurley, a professor with the Boston University Center for Finance Law and Policy who also worked as an associate general counsel at the Federal Reserve Board and as general counsel at a commercial bank, also disagreed with Lew.\n\nHurley said that large banks still appear to enjoy a significant discount to the rates at which they can borrow money in the markets relative to small banks.\n\n\u201cThe market seems to have a high degree of confidence that Lew and [FDIC chairman Martin] Gruenberg and [presumptive Federal Reserve Board chair Janet] Yellen will do whatever it takes to assure the survival of one of the too big to fail banks if they get in trouble.\u201d\n\nOn Lew\u2019s speech, he said, \u201c\u201cI think he\u2019s wrong.\u201d - Follow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Thursday morning", "title": "Why Jack Lew Is Kidding Himself About Too Big to Fail", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/05/Why-Jack-Lew-Kidding-Himself-About-Too-Big-Fail", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01232012_CEOs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/05/Why-Jack-Lew-Kidding-Himself-About-Too-Big-Fail", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01232012_CEOs_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Thursday morning", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Fine said that the changes to the regulations under Dodd-Frank have had a positive effect on the safety of large banks.\nRELATED: BREAK UP BIG BANKS?\nHurley said that large banks still appear to enjoy a significant discount to the rates at which they can borrow money in the markets relative to small banks.\n\u201cBut that does not necessarily end too big to fail.\nThe idea that some banks are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2013 meaning that if they were allowed to collapse they would take the rest of the economy with them \u2013 has troubled policymakers for years."}
