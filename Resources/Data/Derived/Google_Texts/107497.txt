Anadarko police and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation are working together on a murder case after a shooting on the 900 block of Sunset Drive.

Friday evening, authorities said people had gathered for a party when 20-year-old Gabriel Goombi-Manudjano was shot inside of the home.

Authorities said he died at a local hospital. Overnight, investigators said they gathered enough information to make an arrest.

Then, Saturday afternoon, Anadarko officers arrested 30-year-old Michael Lee Autaubo.

He's being booked into the Caddo County Jail on a complaint of first degree murder.
