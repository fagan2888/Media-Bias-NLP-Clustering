A lot of people had the chance to enjoy the outdoors this Labor Day.

The Red Top community gears up for their holiday parade each year in West Ashley right off Bees Ferry Road.

The parade features classic cars, music, and dancing.

A large group of Military Magnet Academy students came out to march.

Motorcyclists showed off their tricks and there was plenty of candy for everyone.

The parade ended on Old Charleston Highway.

The community is already looking forward to next year.

The annual tradition is put on by community and church members.

It is free for all those who attend.
