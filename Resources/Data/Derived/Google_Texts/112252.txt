With locations closed in Mesa and Peoria, Toby Keith’s I Love This Bar & Grill has closed its doors at its north Phoenix location. Tuesday officially marked the High Street restaurant location’s closure.

According to Phoenix Business Journal, the restaurant’s owners have been locked out of the business by the landlord, while Boomtown Entertainment, the company that owns Toby Keith’s franchised restaurants, has not responded to requests for comment.

Based in Phoenix, Boomtown has come under fire after reportedly failing to pay wages for employees at the franchise’s Cincinnati location and also been accused of ducking contractors in San Antonio who performed approximately $850,000 worth of work on was to be the city’s first Toby Keith location.

Houston, Sacramento and Newport News, Virginia have also seen their Toby Keith franchises close.

The franchise still operates in five other cities across the country and the restaurant’s website says there are new locations planned in other states.
