Wilson, who just months ago won a commendation in a Town Council ceremony, now remains under the police\u2019s protection and hasn\u2019t spoken about the incident.\n\nBut as the public continues to search for answers, the Washington Post has published a report on Wilson\u2019s career, including a brief biography, that offers some insight into Wilson\u2019s past.\n\nAccording to officials interviewed by the Post, Wilson maintained a clean record, but the Post reports that his first job \u201cwas not an ideal place to learn how to police.\u201d He entered the police force in 2009, joining a nearly all-white, 45-member task force that patrolled Jennings, Missouri, a small, impoverished city of 14,000 where the residents were 89 percent African-American. The racial tension was high, and the police were accused of using excessive force against its residents:\n\nRacial tension was endemic in Jennings, said Rodney Epps, an African American city council member. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with white cops, and they don\u2019t know how to address black people,\u201d Epps said. \u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, an officer shot at a female. She was stopped for a traffic violation. She had a child in the back [of the] car and was probably worried about getting locked up. And this officer chased her down Highway 70, past city limits, and took a shot at her. Just ridiculous.\u201d Police faced a series of lawsuits for using unnecessary force, Stichnote said. One black resident, Cassandra Fuller, sued the department claiming a white Jennings police officer beat her in June 2009 on her own porch after she made a joke. A car had smashed into her van, which was parked in front of her home, and she called police. The responding officer asked her to move the van. \u201cIt don\u2019t run. You can take it home with you if you want,\u201d she answered. She said the officer became enraged, threw her off the porch, knocked her to the ground and kicked her in the stomach. The department paid Fuller a confidential sum to settle the case, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Post gives additional insight into the background of the officer who killed Michael Brown", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Washington Post gives additional insight into the background of the officer who killed Michael Brown", "title": "Darren Wilson\u2019s former police force was disbanded for excessive force and corruption", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/darren_wilsons_former_police_force_was_disbanded_for_excessive_force_and_corruption/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/polic-shooting-missouri.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Washington Post gives additional insight into the background of the officer who killed Michael Brown", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/polic-shooting-missouri.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Darren Wilson\u2019s former police force was disbanded for excessive force and corruption", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Darren Wilson\u2019s former police force was disbanded for excessive force and corruption", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, darren wilson, excessive force, ferguson police, jennings police, racial tension, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, an officer shot at a female.\nThe racial tension was high, and the police were accused of using excessive force against its residents:Racial tension was endemic in Jennings, said Rodney Epps, an African American city council member.\nBut as the public continues to search for answers, the Washington Post has published a report on Wilson\u2019s career, including a brief biography, that offers some insight into Wilson\u2019s past.\nAnd this officer chased her down Highway 70, past city limits, and took a shot at her.\nShe said the officer became enraged, threw her off the porch, knocked her to the ground and kicked her in the stomach."}
