(David R. Jennings)\n\nTwo people were arrested during a third straight Saturday of protests in Boulder, in a continuing campaign to raise awareness over concerns about police brutality, and show solidarity for hundreds of thousands doing the same across the nation.\n\nThe two arrested \u2014 Joe Harris, 31, a black man from Boulder, and Jorge Chavez, 19, a Hispanic man from Denver \u2014 were taken into custody in the parking lot just north of the Boulder Running Company, 2775 Pearl St., just after 3 p.m. In a march that at times swelled to more than 100 people, Harris and Chavez were among about a dozen people of color participating.\n\nThe police department clarified its motives for making the arrests, in a press release sent out Saturday night.\n\n\"(Chavez) was arrested after a motorist complained to police that the protester spit on the motorist's car,\" the release reads. In an interview Saturday evening, Chavez admitted to spitting on the car.\n\nAccording to police, officers' initial scan indicated Chavez was wanted on several warrants, which led to his arrest.\n\nAround the time Chavez was being apprehended, the release continues, Harris \"became combative with police and refused to cooperate with orders to clear the area around the police car which had been surrounded. (Harris) sat on the hood of the patrol car, preventing the police officer from leaving the area.\"\n\nHe allegedly also \"fought with several officers as he was being arrested and continued to be combative in his efforts to resist being taken into custody.\"\n\nHarris was released around 8 p.m. on a personal recognizance bond, and faces charges of resisting arrest and obstructing a peace officer. He has been among the Boulder movement's most vocal leaders since protests began several weeks ago, in the wake of a St. Louis County grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer who shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nProtesters staged a die-in today at the Pearl Street Mall, near the Boulder County Courthouse, as part of their third consecutive Saturday of demonstrating in solidarity with those across the nation protesting police brutality. (David Jennings)\n\nHarris declined to comment when reached after his release.\n\nChavez, meanwhile, was released less than 30 minutes after arriving at the Boulder County Jail, 3200 Airport Road. He was upset that his arrest resulted from police confusing him with another man who authorities want in connection with possible domestic violence charges. The police department's press release called the arrest of Chavez a \"miscommunication.\"\n\n\"They weren't able to prove the person they were looking for,\" Chavez said. \"They told me they were looking for a Caucasian male, same height, same hair color, same eye color, same weight. They literally tried saying it was me. Nobody even fingerprinted me. They just called the DPD in Denver and they figured out who I was.\n\n\"They literally walked up to me, and lied to my face about me having a domestic violence warrant against my name.\"\n\nChavez has been an active participant in Denver protests, and has worked there as a street medic, offering first aid to fellow protesters who have either been injured or sprayed with chemical disablers such as tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nAfter the incident outside Boulder Running Company, about 40 protesters gathered at the Boulder County Jail, to support their arrested comrades. Many lingered there until Harris' release.\n\n'They don't like that people are treated differently'\n\nActivists marching today from the Boulder Municipal Building toward the Pearl Street Mall, in solidarity with protest actions taking place across the country to highlight issues relating to police brutality. (Alex Burness)\n\nPrior to the arrests, Saturday's protests resembled those of the previous two weeks, though their numbers were much smaller than the Dec. 6 crowd of about 500. Protesters started, as before, at 12:30 p.m. at Broadway and Canyon Boulevard, with plans to head toward the Pearl Street Mall. Early estimates put the crowd at slightly over 100, including more than a dozen children under the age of 10.\n\nSome parents were carrying toddlers, while older children marched alongside their parents.\n\nElicia Arwen, a Boulder woman who brought her three children to the event, said, \"I want my kids to understand the importance of using their voices and speaking up.\n\n\"They know there's an issue, to the extent that they're 3 and 7 and 14, and they don't like that people are treated differently because of the color of their skin.\"\n\nKeith Percy, 29, of Boulder, spoke to the group before they embarked on their actions.\n\n\"Know this is about institutional racism. It is about 'black lives matter,' it is about our solidarity and allyship,\" Percy said.\n\n\"We know these things are really in Boulder, because five times the people of color are arrested in Boulder as compared to white people, whereas white people are in the high 80s percentage-wise (in population), and people of color are less than 1 percent. Stay on that.\"\n\nPercy also said, \"If we weren't confronting institutional racism in Boulder, we would have a whole lot more people of color and we would raise the economic and social conditions that keep them away. So black lives matter. They're dying. They're dying expediently fast.\n\n\"Let's show that we are allies, so they know that we have solidarity and that black lives matter.\"\n\nAs the group marched, participants chanted \"Black lives matter,\" \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" and \"No justice, no peace. No racist police.\"\n\nSeeking change through 'disruption'\n\nRoughly an hour into their action, demonstrators staged an 11-minute die-in, in front of the Boulder County Courthouse at 13th and Pearl streets, representing the 11 times that Eric Garner stated that he could not breathe, while a Staten Island, N.Y., police officer had him in a choke hold. Garner died, in that incident.\n\nProtesters met with some resistance from a number of motorists during today's march, resulting in a few shouting matches. Activists were seen photographing the license plates of those drivers.\n\nGary Roland, one of the early organizers of Occupy Wall Street, as well as a leader of the recent Boulder protests, said motorists upset with the marches may misunderstand their purpose.\n\n\"The way that social justice movements make change is through disruption,\" he said. \"If there's a demand, but no actual economic disruption, such as shutting down traffic or bus boycotts or stuff like that, the powers that be don't have a reason to comply to the demand.\n\n\"So it might be inconvenient to sit in traffic for 15 minutes, but our movement is about people who have been inconvenienced their entire lives and so as much as it is an inconvenience, it's also important to allow these sort of manifestations to occur, and these are actually what pushes our society forward.\"\n\nFor most of the day, police were keeping a distance from the marchers, until they reached Pearl and 26th streets, at which point they blocked off eastbound Pearl, as more tension developed between protesters and some drivers.\n\nClose to 3 p.m., another 11-minute die in was being staged at the intersection of Pearl and 28th streets. In Saturday's die-ins, roughly 15 participants of color were the ones actually lying down, while white demonstrators, identifying themselves as \"allies,\" stood with linked arms in a circle around them.\n\nFrom 28th and Pearl, and following the two arrests, protesters got into cars, about 45 of them heading for the Boulder County Jail.\n\nThe previous two weeks of protests also saw the activists perform die-ins at key intersections in the city, as well as the Apple store at the Twenty Ninth Street Mall, on Dec. 6. At this past Monday evening's rush hour, their actions also briefly closed down U.S. 36, near Baseline Road.\n\nThe protests had been peaceful, with Boulder police prioritizing the activists' safety, and making no arrests, prior to today.\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27129268/protesters-again-march-boulder-show-solidarity", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness, Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27129268:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-13T13:24:08-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Two people were arrested during a third straight Saturday of protests in Boulder, in a continuing campaign to raise awareness over concerns about police brutality, and show solidarity for hundreds of thousands doing the same across the nation.", "title": "Police arrest 2 during Boulder demonstration over police brutality", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27129268/protesters-again-march-boulder-show-solidarity", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1213/20141213__154dcaprow~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2014-12-13T20:53:16-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-13T13:24:08-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Alex Burness,", "pubDate": "2014-12-13T13:32:21-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-13T13:24:08-0700", "sailthru.title": "Police arrest 2 during Boulder demonstration over police brutality", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1213/20141213__154dcaprow~2_300.jpg", "description": "Two people were arrested during a third straight Saturday of protests in Boulder, in a continuing campaign to raise awareness over concerns about police brutality, and show solidarity for hundreds of thousands doing the same across the nation.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27129268/protesters-again-march-boulder-show-solidarity", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Two people were arrested during a third straight Saturday of protests in Boulder, in a continuing campaign to raise awareness over concerns about police brutality, and show solidarity for hundreds of thousands doing the same across the nation.", "title": "Police arrest 2 during Boulder demonstration over police brutality"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1213/20141213__154dcaprow~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc43b\"", "article_summary": "After the incident outside Boulder Running Company, about 40 protesters gathered at the Boulder County Jail, to support their arrested comrades.\nChavez, meanwhile, was released less than 30 minutes after arriving at the Boulder County Jail, 3200 Airport Road.\nFrom 28th and Pearl, and following the two arrests, protesters got into cars, about 45 of them heading for the Boulder County Jail.\nProtesters staged a die-in today at the Pearl Street Mall, near the Boulder County Courthouse, as part of their third consecutive Saturday of demonstrating in solidarity with those across the nation protesting police brutality.\nProtesters started, as before, at 12:30 p.m. at Broadway and Canyon Boulevard, with plans to head toward the Pearl Street Mall."}
