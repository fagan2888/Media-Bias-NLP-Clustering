Dave Loebsack of Iowa City, but because he faces a voter registration disadvantage in the 24-county southeast Iowa district. Among active voters, 35 percent are registered as Democrats, 30 percent as Republican and 35 percent as no party.\n\nHowever, Peters, who will make a campaign stop at 6 p.m. Saturday at Midtown Family Restaurant in Iowa City, sees opportunity in that large bloc of no party voters because he hopes to appeal to Republicans who are looking for an alternative to \u201cthe establishment\u201d as well as independent-minded voters.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s only beginning his campaign, Peters thinks his odds are even.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Democratic-leaning district, but we\u2019re talking about the issues people are concerned about, issues a typical Republican wouldn\u2019t talk about or, at least, talk about in this way,\u201d he said Friday afternoon.\n\nA former member of the Libertarian Party National Committee and supporter of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s campaign in the Iowa caucuses, Peters doesn\u2019t sound like the typical GOP candidate.\n\nIn addition to calling for a balanced budget and changes to the Affordable Care Act, he also wants to work on \u201cwidespread criminal justice reforms including civil asset forfeiture and restoring felons\u2019 voting rights. Peters wants to look at the mass collection of personal data by the government and structural changes, such as term limits, that he believe would help make Congress less partisan and dysfunctional. He\u2019s promised not to serve more than five two-year terms.\n\n\u201cDave Loebsack is a good man, but he\u2019s been in Congress for 10 years,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone needs to spend a decade in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe owner of Corridor Surgery and Vein Center, Peters believes he can help make improvements in the ACA \u2014 he dislikes the term Obamacare \u2014 but said too much \u201cpolitical energy\u201d has been wasted on attempts to defund it.\n\nHe prefers market-based reforms that would lower costs while maintaining the safety net for those who can\u2019t afford health care insurance in the traditional sense.\n\nPeters believes four-year House terms, so members aren\u2019t always running for re-election, would help Congress accomplish more. He promises to seek common ground with Democrats if it helps accomplish common goals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important first step,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of the deadlock in Congress is partisan-based. People don\u2019t want to see the other party succeed.\u201d\n\nThis is his first race on the federal level. However, as a Libertarian, Peters challenged longtime Sen. Bob Dvorsky, D-Coralville, in 2010, losing 17,964-6,092 in the reliably safe Democratic district.\n\nA native Kansan, Peters has degrees in psychology, biology and medicine from the University of Kansas. In addition to the vein center, he is a surgical consultant to the Iowa City Free Medical Clinic.\n\nThe University of Virginia Center for Politics calls the race \u201cLikely Democrat\u201d and the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report calls the 2nd District \u201cCurrently Safe Democratic.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd District includes Iowa City, Coralville, the Quad Cities, Fort Madison, Clinton and Burlington.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - A Coralville surgeon hoping to replace Iowa's 2nd District Democratic congressman is kicking off his campaign Saturday in Iowa City.Republican, C", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - A Coralville surgeon hoping to replace Iowa's 2nd District Democratic congressman is kicking off his campaign Saturday in Iowa City.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/elections/2nd-district-gop-challenger-kicks-off-campaign-20160401", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160401/ARTICLE/160409937/AR/0/AR-160409937.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/elections/2nd-district-gop-challenger-kicks-off-campaign-20160401", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - A Coralville surgeon hoping to replace Iowa's 2nd District Democratic congressman is kicking off his campaign Saturday in Iowa City.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "2nd District GOP challenger kicks off campaign"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2016-04-01T20:14:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-04-01T20:14:11-05:00", "title": "2nd District GOP challenger kicks off campaign"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "CEDAR RAPIDS \u2014 A Coralville surgeon hoping to replace Iowa\u2019s 2nd District Democratic congressman is kicking off his campaign Saturday in Iowa City.\nAlthough he\u2019s only beginning his campaign, Peters thinks his odds are even.\nThe University of Virginia Center for Politics calls the race \u201cLikely Democrat\u201d and the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report calls the 2nd District \u201cCurrently Safe Democratic.\u201dThe 2nd District includes Iowa City, Coralville, the Quad Cities, Fort Madison, Clinton and Burlington.\nIn addition to the vein center, he is a surgical consultant to the Iowa City Free Medical Clinic.\nPeters believes four-year House terms, so members aren\u2019t always running for re-election, would help Congress accomplish more."}
