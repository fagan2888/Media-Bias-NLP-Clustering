All insurers selling policies on the state's health care exchange have agreed to extend the enrollment deadline for coverage that begins Jan. 1, state officials said Tuesday.

Kaiser Permanente, United Healthcare and Evergreen Health Co-op on Tuesday joined CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state's largest insurer, in agreeing to extend the deadline four days to Dec. 27 from Dec. 23.

Consumers also now have until Jan. 15 to make their first premium payments to insurers.

"As we continue to improve the website's functionality, we are working to make it easier for Marylanders to get health care by working with the insurance community to extend the deadline for Marylanders to sign up for coverage on Jan. 1," said Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown in a statement. "While we still have work to do, we're committed to expanding access to quality affordable care."
