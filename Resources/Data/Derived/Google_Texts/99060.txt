AUGUSTA, Ark -- Former banker and U.S attorney Conner Eldridge officially launched his bid for U.S Senate Saturday.

Family, friends and supports gathered at Eldridge Supply Company in Augusta for the big announcement.

"People in Arkansas are frustrated when they see Washington, that's completely dysfunctional, is broken and they see people who have been there for over a decade too long and have become part of the problem," said Eldridge.

He told the crowd that in the nation's capitol, leaders brag about unemployment being down, but he said it's a different story here at home.



"In Arkansas, we know that the number of participation in the workforce is the lowest that it has been in almost forty years," said Eldridge.

He criticizes both parties in their response to the affordable care act and other issues, like the federal debt. However, he stayed hush on giving specifics on policy issues.

"Those are the kind of things we've got to dig into issues on and find common sense solutions that get things done and make sense to all sides, and make sense to our state and our country," said Eldridge.

Eldridge pointed out how his parents, specifically his mom, makes him continue a fight he said he's been dealing with for years.

"All issues that are affecting kids ... something that's important to me," said Eldridge. "With my mom having been a public school teacher and then also as a federal prosecutor, the work that I did for kids in need and as a prosecutor, people who threatened kids."

Eldridge will most likely be the only candidate of either political party running against incumbent U.S Senator John Boozman in next year's general election. Something, Eldridge knows may not be an easy battle.

"Well, I only know one way to do it, and that's to be myself and work hard," said Eldridge.

November 9 is the last day for anyone else to join the race.
