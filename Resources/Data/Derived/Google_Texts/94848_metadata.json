Paul Ryan says he understands people\u2019s frustration with Congress right now. He\u2019s frustrated, too.\n\nBut there\u2019s really nothing to be done, said the Republican lawmaker from Janesville. His party just doesn\u2019t have the votes to push priority bills through the Senate. And some of the bills they have managed to pass \u2014 like the Keystone pipeline measure \u2014 are then vetoed by President Barack Obama.\n\nRyan said there are plenty of measures that pass the House of Representatives but stall in the Senate beacuse Republicans don\u2019t have the 60-vote supermajority needed to break a filibuster.\n\n\u201cPeople think we have more tools than we actually have,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think we have more authority than the Constitution actually gives us. They look at it as if we could, but we aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe spoke about his feelings in response to questions from frustrated constituents at a listening session at Snap-on, 2801 80th St., Monday afternoon.\n\nBig to-do list\n\nThe list of things Ryan wishes Congress could tackle is long: Immigration, Planned Parenthood funding, the tax code, foreign policy, environmental regulations and overturning the Affordable Care Act, to name a few.\n\n\u201cThe only real substitute for fixing an abuse of power or bad decisions is to win an election,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cElections have consequences. If you can\u2019t win an election, you can\u2019t fix these things.\u201d\n\nRyan said it is difficult for people watching the political process from home to understand what is going on.\n\n\u201cPeople are really frustrated. They say, \u2018You guys can\u2019t pass anything, you won\u2019t pass anything,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe pass things all the time in the House, but they need six Democrats to get things out of the Senate and to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nAwaiting 2016\n\nRyan said he is staying neutral on the 2016 Republican presidential field, but said this is the kind of election where people need to pay attention.\n\n\u201cThis is the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why I think 2016 will be a clarifying election, and it should be a clarifying election.\u201d\n\nLike some of the people at the listening session, Ryan said, he is worried.\n\n\u201cI ran against this president in 2012,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan said the problems he saw then haven\u2019t gone away.\n\nRepublicans need to bring voters a plan, he said. And that\u2019s his goal for this election cycle \u2014 to get his party to be able to say what it will do to balance the budget, to replace the Affordable Care Act, to fix the tax code.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do in 2016, to bring it to the voters so they can choose which plan they want,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, if we win, we have the obligation of the mandate to put that in place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"robots": "index,follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 424648924332198}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ef0\"", "article_summary": "They say, \u2018You guys can\u2019t pass anything, you won\u2019t pass anything,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe only real substitute for fixing an abuse of power or bad decisions is to win an election,\u201d Ryan said.\nIf you can\u2019t win an election, you can\u2019t fix these things.\u201dRyan said it is difficult for people watching the political process from home to understand what is going on.\nBig to-do listThe list of things Ryan wishes Congress could tackle is long: Immigration, Planned Parenthood funding, the tax code, foreign policy, environmental regulations and overturning the Affordable Care Act, to name a few.\nAnd some of the bills they have managed to pass \u2014 like the Keystone pipeline measure \u2014 are then vetoed by President Barack Obama."}
