Distractions of any kind \u2014 those that take your eyes off the road, that take your hands off the wheel, or that avert your attention away from driving \u2014 all cause your risks for injury to shoot up. Texting while driving, it turns out, combines all three.\n\nThe risks of texting while driving aren\u2019t new, necessarily. The general public might not know that nearly half of all U.S. high school students 16 or older regularly text while driving, or that students who text and drive are significantly more likely to get in the car with a drunk driver or drive drunk themselves. But past these statistics, people generally have an idea that texting while driving can be life-threatening. So why do they still do it?\n\nThat was the question Steven Seiler sought to answer in a study recently published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. Seiler is an assistant professor of sociology and political science at Tennessee Technological University, and he\u2019s interested in so-called \u201ctechnological deviance\u201d as a way to explain rampant cell phone use. What started as a tool for making and receiving phone calls has transformed into a tether that connects us, at all times, to the rest of the world \u2014 whether we\u2019re safe or not.\n\nIn his study, Seiler made several hypotheses about the reasons for which people text and drive. He wondered if people who engaged in the behavior were also more likely to talk on the phone while driving, text in other inappropriate settings, engage in sexting, and turn to their phones as a cure for boredom. Looking at the data from the 2010 Spring Change Assessment, conducted by the Pew Research Center, he discovered many of his hypotheses held true, and they were anchored in those ideas of technological deviance. The bottom line: Social influence is everything.\n\n\u201cCommonsensically, observing people engaging in dangerous driving behaviors would deter people from texting while driving,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, sociologically, riding with others who engage in such behaviors without consequence contributes to a culture of multitasking while driving.\u201d\n\nWhen people see their friends and family texting while driving, Seiler explains, they don\u2019t see the behavior as necessarily dangerous, but normalized and accepted. A wealth of research has shown evidence of this trend in other lifestyle choices. We tend to think, usually erroneously, that if a certain behavior is more widely practiced, it\u2019s probably safer. (After all, why would so many people put themselves at risk?) But plenty of injurious behaviors persist for reasons that take priority over people\u2019s sense of well-being. The U.S. is in the middle of an obesity epidemic and nearly a fifth of the country still smokes, but the health risks of both are well understood.\n\nPutting addiction aside, the reason has a lot to do with culture. The more people gain weight, the more acceptable obesity becomes. Fortunately, smoking popularity has been declining, and stigma plays a leading role in that trend. And, as per the new study, \u201ctexting while driving is a learned behavior reinforced through observing others engaging in such behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe ubiquity of cell phones and texting doesn\u2019t help. As Seiler\u2019s research confirms, people who use their phones in other non-texting situations, such as in meetings or at the movies, are more likely to text while driving, as are people who sext. These trends indicated a bleeding over from other aspects of people\u2019s lives. Many of the survey respondents reported they texted multiple people throughout the day. So, it may be more accurate to say the people who text while driving are actually driving while texting.\n\nFor drivers, the risks of texting appear to be minimal. However, the perception of risk for getting caught by the police is great, so Seiler argues the smartest way to get people off their phones is simply to make cars more caller-friendly. \u201cSince the culture of texting while driving is likely to change slowly \u2014 if it changes at all \u2014 more innovative in-vehicle voice-to-text technologies allowing drivers to use voice prompts to text \u2014 and engage in other forms of mobile multiplexing \u2014 are necessary.\u201d Safety campaigns should also seek to educate teenagers on the dangers of texting while driving, he added.\n\n\u201cTexting while driving is undoubtedly a dangerous social phenomenon,\u201d Seiler noted. \u201cThis study provides additional evidence that such behaviors are embedded in sociocultural norms in other areas of social life.\u201d\n\nSource: Seiler S.
