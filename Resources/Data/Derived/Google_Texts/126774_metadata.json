As in that case as well, however, the scoop came courtesy of U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government staunchly upholds cyber security, firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks in accordance with law,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan told Reuters.\n\nThe Russian Embassy declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cyberattacks purported to have been waged against American targets from China and Russia have prompted Washington to seriously consider implementing new sanctions against Beijing and Moscow, officials say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cyberattacks purported to have been waged against American targets from China and Russia have prompted Washington to seriously consider implementing new sanctions against Beijing and Moscow, officials say.", "title": "U.S. considering sanctions against China, Russia for cyberattacks, officials say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/1/us-considering-sanctions-against-china-and-russia-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/06/afb4be03b66a091e5c0f6a706700e174.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/06/afb4be03b66a091e5c0f6a706700e174.jpg", "description": "Cyberattacks purported to have been waged against American targets from China and Russia have prompted Washington to seriously consider implementing new sanctions against Beijing and Moscow, officials", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. considering sanctions against China, Russia for cyberattacks, off"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Russia, China"}, "article_summary": "Cyberattacks purported to have been waged against American targets from China and Russia have prompted the Obama administration to seriously consider implementing new sanctions against Beijing and Moscow, officials say.\nAs in that case as well, however, the scoop came courtesy of U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nRussia could face similar penalties in addition to those already implemented in response to the Kremlin\u2019s policies regarding Ukraine, Reuters reported.\nSeveral administration officials told Reuters and The Washington Post this week that the White House is weighing whether to respond to a rash of network intrusions with sanctions \u2014 a potential first for the U.S.\nThe Post reported that the administration is \u201cdeveloping a package of unprecedented economic sanctions\u201d that could be implemented against companies and individuals in China that are believed to have benefited from cyberespionage campaigns waged against American entities."}
