The event starts at 11:30 a.m. with the presentation beginning at noon in the hospital conference center at 14100 Yosemite Drive. Reservations are required; call (727) 869-5498 or (888) 741-5119.\n\nThe clinic was supposed to open shortly after the December 2009 dedication of the shelter. The shelter\u2019s namesake, Pasco Tax Collector Mike Fasano, then a state senator, arranged some $1.1 million in funding for startup costs.\n\nSeveral postponements developed, however. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed any funds remaining after June 2011, Fasano recalled. He was delighted the new clinic is now about to open.\n\n\u201cThis is a great thing for Pasco,\u201d Fasano, who did not attend Friday\u2019s tour, later said in an interview. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for those who don\u2019t have access to health care.\u201d\n\nIt also could reduce the number of people who wind up in hospital emergency rooms as a last resort, Fasano said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame anyone who has nowhere else to go,\u201d but ER care is expensive and can end up costing taxpayers, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a safety net,\u201d Pollock said in a Thursday interview. Census data indicates about 170,000 Pasco residents fall at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, she noted.\n\nLast year, about 36 percent of Premier patients had no medical insurance, while 42 percent fell under Medicaid coverage, Pollock recalled. Premier also accepts people with private insurance or Medicare.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people that are still uninsured,\u201d Pollock emphasized, even after the federal Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nA \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d developed after Florida lawmakers did not expand Medicaid here and refused additional federal funding. Some people who earn about $16,000 annually, or 100 percent of the poverty level, still don\u2019t qualify for help through ACA.\n\nEven with ACA, the number of uninsured seeking help at Premier has fallen from 42 percent of all patients at Premier clinics to 36 percent now, Pollock said.\n\n\u201cWe just knew this was a commitment we needed to fill,\u201d Pollock said about the long-delayed Hudson clinic.\n\nLast fall, Premier won a federal New Access Point grant for $382,000 toward opening the new clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re held to high standards,\u201d Pollock said to earn annual renewals of the federal grant.\n\nThe Premier clinic in New Port Richey served 2,589 patients its first year, records show. Premier and Pasco health department officials plan to coordinate efforts. The public health agency operates its Women, Infants and Children program at the Fasano shelter. \u201cBack in January, we transitioned our prenatal (maternity) services to them,\u201d health department spokeswoman Deanna Krautner wrote in a Friday email reply.\n\n\u201cAccess to care combined with a strong message regarding healthy behaviors, such as reducing rates of obesity and tobacco use, will move Pasco toward better health outcomes and improve our quality of life,\u201d Health Department Administrator Mike Napier wrote in an email", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 10:08:48 -0400", "Description": "HUDSON \u2014 After several false starts during the past five years, Premier Community HealthCare Group is preparing its Hudson clinic to see its first patients on Aug. 31.", "og": {"description": "HUDSON \u2014 After several false starts during the past five years, Premier Community HealthCare Group is preparing its Hudson clinic to see its first patients on Aug. 31.", "title": "Premier readies Hudson area clinic for opening", "url": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/su/list/news-pasco/premier-readies-hudson-area-clinic-for-opening-20150825/", "image": {"width": 1800, "identifier": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20150825/ARTICLE/150829964/EP/1/3/EP-150829964.jpg", "height": 1134}, "updated_time": "2015-08-25T10:08:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "suncoastnews.com", "image": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20150825/ARTICLE/150829964/AR/0/AR-150829964.jpg", "description": "HUDSON \u2014 After several false starts during the past five years, Premier Community HealthCare Group is preparing its Hudson clinic to see its first patients on Aug. 31.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Premier readies Hudson area clinic for opening"}, "fb": {"app_id": 437550169655494}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-08-25T10:08:48Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T10:08:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0e3\"", "article_summary": "Residents can learn more about the Hudson clinic during a free luncheon Friday at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point.\n\u201cWe just knew this was a commitment we needed to fill,\u201d Pollock said about the long-delayed Hudson clinic.\nAfter several false starts during the past five years, Premier Community HealthCare Group is preparing its Hudson clinic to see its first patients on Aug. 31.\nThe Premier clinic in New Port Richey served 2,589 patients its first year, records show.\n\u201cThis is a great thing for Pasco,\u201d Fasano, who did not attend Friday\u2019s tour, later said in an interview."}
