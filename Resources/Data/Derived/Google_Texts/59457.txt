Cavour, SD

Two Cavour men are the first in Beadle County to be charged under a new felony animal cruelty law.

67-year-old Dennis Kerney and 35-year-old Justin Murray were arrested Wednesday after abusing an Appaloosa horse. Reports say they struck the animal multiple times with a wooden club, causing serious injury.

Both men face a single count of felony animal cruelty under a law that had been approved in last year's legislative session.

The men are currently being held on $500 bond each. They may have to pay for the care of the animal, along with facing up to two years in prison and $4,000 in fines.

South Dakota was the last state in the country to pass a law that included a felony charge level of animal cruelty.
