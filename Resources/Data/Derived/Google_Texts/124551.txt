More than a decade after the song's debut, the summer hit Hot in Herre has reappeared on the airwaves of the Bay area. Nelly's famous song, which reminds everyone of fun summer times, burst unexpectedly through the radio without explanation over and over again. Listeners, though amused at the beginning, became irritated as it continued to drag on. At least, some of them did.

Across Reddit and Twitter, listeners began pouring in their comments about the onslaught of Nelly assaulting everyone's ears. According to the San Francisco Gate, the radio station Latino Mix, 105.7 (Santa Clara) and 100.7 (San Rafael), has been playing Hot in Herre for 17 hours straight. It all began at 3 p.m. on Friday, and it left listeners wondering why the station was playing the same song on repeat.

Listeners later learned the reasons behind the storm of Nelly hitting the airwaves.

Latino Mix will be no longer and has been rebranded as Hot 105.7, according to RadioInsight. The Univision-owned radio station used the constant playing of Nelly's hit song as a publicity stunt that would bring more listeners to the new station and, at least, on social media it seems to have worked.

Hitting the top charts on Reddit and Twitter, with #Nelly1057 trending on the latter, it showed that the station's attempt to raise awareness of its change had indeed succeeded. The station's stunt reached such notoriety to deem an update on Hot in Herre's Wikipedia page, which now reads "On March 14, Latin Mix 105.7 in San Francisco began playing this on a loop for eternity."

Although it probably will not play for eternity, it amused many listeners. According to commenters on various sites, radio stations have pulled similar stunts before when switching genres. According to Wikipedia this is called "stunting."
