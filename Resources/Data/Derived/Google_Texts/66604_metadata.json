And Vermont exchange officials disclosed Wednesday that 600 new applications had been made on the site, which also had processed more than 3,000 renewals. Colorado's exchange has said it will release enrollment day bi-weekly, and Connecticut is considering doing the same.\n\nAs of Friday, however, HealthCare.gov had released no such metrics.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which operates HealthCare.gov, had no immediate comment when asked if CMS will immediately release ongoing open-enrollment statistics as a number of states have done, and why that information has not been released so far.\n\nThe spokesman said CMS will be releasing enrollment information on a monthly basis, as it did during the first open enrollment season.\n\nHowever, even if it does such updates, it's not clear that CMS will be as forthcoming with other information the media has sought about Obamacare data. CMS did not do detailed enrollment updates between April and November\u2014the so-called special enrollment period when people with qualifying life events such as marriages, divorces, job losses, moves out of state, and the births of children are allowed to enroll in insurance plans.\n\nLast week, CNBC and the Wall Street Journal separately asked CMS how many people had enrolled in Obamacare plans during the special enrollment period. CMS told both outlets it would get back to them on that question, but has yet to give an answer. In August, CNBC reported that at least 11 state-run exchanges either released special enrollment tallies on their own or would share that data when asked.\n\nCMS also has failed to release a breakdown of how many people were enrolled in plans sold by each insurer on the exchanges, which could reveal those companies' individual market share.\n\nCharles Gaba, a Michigan-based website developer, last fall launched ACASignups.net, a site that tracks and projects Obamacare enrollments because CMS was not releasing data as often as some states were doing. Gaba's site since has been closely watched by health-care reporters, particularly since his projections have closely mirrored officially released numbers.\n\nRead MoreSicker seniors: US elder health lags other nations\n\n\n\nGaba said CMS should do more frequent updates because of the significance of Obamacare, both politically and in terms of giving uninsured people health coverage.\n\n\"It's an important law that impacts a lot of people, and as a supporter I feel it's important to track the first few years,\" he said.\n\nGaba said that with nearly a week gone by in this open enrollment season, CMS \"should be able . . . to give a number from at least the opening weekend\" of how many people selected insurance plans. He also said HealthCare.gov should be releasing a summary of enrollment data each week.\n\nGaba said that CMS did so, \"It would actually put me out of business.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A number of states have been releasing enrollment information for their Obamacare markets, but HealthCare.gov hasn't.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "A number of states have been releasing enrollment information for their Obamacare markets, but HealthCare.gov hasn't.", "title": "Cat got your tongue, HealthCare.gov?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/22/cat-got-your-tongue-healthcaregov-obamacares-secrets.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/11/21/102208562-RTR4EHYX.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A number of states have been releasing enrollment information for their Obamacare markets, but HealthCare.gov hasn't.", "title": "Cat got your tongue, HealthCare.gov?
