An Aurora police officer was injured Sunday after being dragged 20 yards when he stopped a car that apparently had a wanted man inside.

The officer sustained minor injuries to his head, leg and foot. He was treated at a hospital and has been released, Aurora police Sgt. Chris Amsler said.

When the officer reached the driver, he drove off, dragging the officer, Amsler said.

The incident happened near South Buckley Road and Exposition Avenue. Police later found a vehicle they believe was involved along East Tennessee Avenue, he said.

The wanted man was located shortly after that and has been taken into custody. Aurora detectives have been called to investigate.
