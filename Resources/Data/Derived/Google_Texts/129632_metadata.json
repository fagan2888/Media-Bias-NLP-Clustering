We found:\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said his bill on Social Security would extend the life of the trust funds by 58 years. It\u2019s 40 years, according to the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Affordable Care Act \u201chas helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance.\u201d But the Obama administration\u2019s own figures show a larger drop in the uninsured among Latinos.\n\nClinton repeated a claim that \u201cAmericans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\u201d Real weekly earnings went up 9.2 percent in that time frame.\n\nBoth candidates glossed over some context during a disagreement about whether Sanders had once advocated regime change in Libya and Iraq.\n\nSanders inflated unemployment figures, including the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate for African American youth, which he says is more than 50 percent. The official rate for blacks age 16 to 19 is half that.\n\nThe candidates disagreed over whether Sanders had been critical of Obama\u2019s leadership, specifically in a blurb for a new book. Both made some accurate statements, but we provide context.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe sixth Democratic debate, and the second between only Clinton and Sanders, was hosted by PBS and held at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nExtending the Life of Social Security Sanders said his legislation to lift the cap on payroll taxes and expand benefits would extend the life of the Social Security trust funds by 58 years. Not quite. The Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary said this month that Sanders\u2019 bill would extend the trust funds by 40 years, from 2034 to 2074. Sanders is the sponsor of the Social Security Expansion Act. To pay for an expansion in benefits, the bill would lift the contribution limit on the Social Security payroll tax, which now applies to earnings up to $118,500. The Vermont senator challenged Clinton to support his legislation. Sanders: And here\u2019s an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. And when we \u2014 and when we do that, we don\u2019t do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Stephen Goss, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration, twice has looked at the financial impact of Sanders\u2019 bill on the combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance trust funds. In a March 26, 2015, letter to Sanders, Goss projected that under Sanders\u2019 bill, \u201cthe year of reserve depletion for the combined OASDI Trust Funds would be extended by 32 years, from 2033 under current law to 2065.\u201d A year later, Goss increased the projected lifespan of the trust funds by another eight years to 40 years. \u201cAssuming enactment of the proposal, we estimate the funding for the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds would be sufficient to extend the projected year of reserve depletion from 2034 to 2074,\u201d Goss wrote in a Feb. 4 letter to Sanders. Under current law, full scheduled benefits would continue through 2033 and then drop to 79 percent in 2034, 74 percent in 2074 and 73 percent in 2089, Goss wrote. But under Sanders\u2019 bill, full benefits would be paid through 2073, with benefits being reduced to 88 percent in 2074 and 87 percent beginning in 2089. A Sanders spokesman told us the senator was referring to \u201c58 years from now,\u201d meaning from 2016 to 2074. But Sanders said \u201cwe extend the life of Social Security for 58 years,\u201d taking credit for 18 years when the Social Security trust funds will pay out full benefits whether his bill passes or not. African Americans and the ACA Clinton said that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of.\u201d But the Obama administration\u2019s own figures show a larger drop in the uninsured among Latinos. The Department of Health and Human Services released an analysis in late September, saying 17.6 million had gained health insurance coverage under the ACA. The administration said that figure included three groups: young adults who were able to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until age 26, those who signed up for the Medicaid expansion and those who gained coverage through the state and federal insurance marketplaces. The rate of uninsured African American adults dropped by 10.3 percentage points, a greater decline than among whites but not as much as the rate drop for Latinos. Here are the HHS figures for the decline in the uninsured between October 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015: 4 million Latino adults gained coverage, with the uninsured rate dropping 11.5 percentage points to 30.3 percent\n\n2.6 million African American adults gained coverage, with the uninsured rate dropping 10.3 percentage points to 12.1 percent\n\n7.4 million white adults gained coverage, with the uninsured rate dropping 6 percentage points to 8.3 percent An HHS fact sheet, also released in September 2015, said generally that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act is working to increase access to affordable, quality health care. This is especially true of the African-American Community.\u201d But in terms of the uninsured, the coverage gains have been greater for Latinos. A December 2014 Urban Institute report projected the ACA could \u201csubstantially narrow differences in uninsurance rates between whites and all racial/ethnic minorities, except blacks,\u201d because blacks disproportionately live in states that did not expand Medicaid.\n\nClinton Still Wrong on Wages\n\nClinton repeated a bogus claim that \u201cAmericans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\u201d\n\nClinton: I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\n\nBack in November, she said essentially the same thing at the second Democratic debate. Her claim fell short of being accurate at the time, and it\u2019s even further short of the mark today.\n\nThe most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show real weekly earnings in December 2015 were 9.2 percent higher than they were 15 years earlier. That includes a 2.3 percent jump last year. (\u201cReal\u201d earnings are inflation-adjusted.)\n\nIt may well be so that many voters are \u201cangry about the economy.\u201d But the fact is, wages are rising faster than inflation.\n\nClinton went on to say that \u201c[t]here aren\u2019t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.\u201d\n\nHow many job openings are \u201cenough\u201d is a matter of opinion, as is what pay level is high enough to be considered \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nBut the fact is, the number of job openings was more than 5.6 million last December, according to BLS data. That\u2019s nearly the highest in the 15 years the BLS has tracked job openings. It is just shy of the record of nearly 5.7 million set in July 2015.\n\nAs for \u201cyoung people,\u201d it\u2019s true that, in January, the 10.3 percent jobless rate for those 16 to 24 years old was more than double the 4.9 percent rate for all adults. But the youth rate is always higher than the rate for older, more experienced adults. And the rate for 16- to 24-year-olds has now dropped back down to where it was in January 2007, before the Great Recession sent it soaring to nearly 20 percent.\n\nSanders on Regime Change\n\nIn heated foreign policy exchanges, Sanders and Clinton disagreed about whether Sanders had once advocated regime change in Libya and Iraq. Both sides glossed over some of the context.\n\nThe disagreement on Libya was part of an exchange initiated by Sanders, who criticized Clinton for being too eager to advocate regime change in countries, which he said has often led to \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named [Moammar] Gadhafi,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.\u201d\n\nClinton responded that Sanders, himself, \u201cvoted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participant in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.\u201d\n\nSanders said that the resolution \u201cwas a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that. That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.\u201d\n\nClinton then reiterated that Sanders \u201cdid support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.\u201d\n\nAs we said, both sides are glossing over some important context.\n\nIt is true that on March 1, 2011, Sanders not only voted in favor of Senate Resolution 85, he also cosponsored it. The resolution, which was nonbinding and passed by unanimous consent, called on Gadhafi \u201cto desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people\u2019s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy. \u2026\u201d So Sanders is correct that the resolution did not authorize or advocate for military action, though it did call for Gadhafi to resign his position.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News in March 2011, Sanders said, \u201cLook, everybody understands Qaddafi is a thug and murderer. We want to see him go, but i think in the midst of two wars, I\u2019m not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Clinton said, the resolution Sanders cosponsored also urged the United Nations Security Council \u201cto take such further action as may be necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory.\u201d Indeed, a couple weeks later, the Security Council did approve a resolution calling for a no-fly zone and called on members \u201cto take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the same debate exchange, Sanders wagged his finger and mouthed the word \u201cno\u201d when Clinton said, \u201cSenator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.\u201d He did.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true, as Sanders said, that he opposed the war in Iraq under President Bush (and that then Sen. Clinton voted in favor of authorizing the use of force), Clinton was referring to votes cast by Sanders in 1998 when Bill Clinton was president. Sanders voted in favor of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which included a \u201csense of the Congress\u201d statement that \u201cIt should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.\u201d He also voted in favor of a resolution that similarly stated, \u201cCongress reaffirms that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.\u201d\n\nInflated Unemployment Numbers\n\nSanders padded his numbers when speaking of the unemployment rate.\n\nSanders: Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.\n\nWhat Sanders refers to as \u201creal\u201d unemployment actually includes \u2014 as he admits \u2014 a lot of people who have jobs, plus a lot more who aren\u2019t currently looking for work.\n\nHe is referring to one of several \u201calternative\u201d measures of labor \u201cunderutilization\u201d published each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The U-6 measure starts with those the BLS officially classifies as unemployed \u2014 meaning those who say they have looked for a job at least once in the past four weeks, but don\u2019t have one.\n\nTo that is added those \u201cmarginally attached\u201d to the labor force, meaning those who say they want work and have looked for a job in the past year, but aren\u2019t currently looking. Also added are those who say they want a full-time job but are forced to work part time because full-time work isn\u2019t available, or their employer has cut back their hours.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U-6 rate was 9.9 percent in January, which indeed is \u201cclose to 10 percent.\u201d But Sanders fails to mention that the rate has dropped substantially since hitting more than 17 percent in 2009 and 2010, and is not far above the 8.4 percent rate that prevailed in January 2007, before the recession. In fact, it\u2019s almost exactly the median rate for all the months since the BLS began publishing the figures in 1994 \u2014 which is 9.8 percent.\n\nAs for African American youth, the official unemployment rate for blacks age 16 to 19 was 25.2 percent \u2014 half the figure cited by Sanders. The U-6 rate for black teens isn\u2019t readily available on the BLS website, and it could well be more than 50 percent, as Sanders claims. But even so it would still include many who have part-time jobs, and many more who aren\u2019t actually looking for work.\n\nSanders\u2019 Book Blurb\n\nClinton and Sanders disagreed over whether Sanders had been critical of Obama\u2019s leadership, in particular in a forward or a blurb for a new book. We\u2019ll lay out what exactly Sanders said.\n\nHere\u2019s that exchange:\n\nClinton: But I want to \u2014 I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Sen. Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers\u2019 remorse when it comes to President Obama\u2019s leadership and legacy. \u2026 Sanders: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. \u2026 As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You\u2019re right. Maybe you haven\u2019t. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That\u2019s what I said. That is what I believe.\n\nSanders didn\u2019t write a forward for the book by liberal radio and TV host Bill Press, but he did write a blurb of praise. Press\u2019 book, titled \u201cBuyer\u2019s Remorse: How Obama Let Progressives Down,\u201d carries a much-shortened version of Sanders\u2019 quote. The blurb across the top is: \u201cBill Press makes the case \u2026 Read this book.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders didn\u2019t say that Press made the case that Obama had \u201clet progressives down,\u201d as that blurb may lead some to believe. Sanders\u2019 full quote is close to what he described in the debate. He wrote: \u201cBill Press makes the case why, long after taking the oath of office, the next president of the United States must keep rallying the people who elected him or her on behalf of progressive causes. That is the only way real change will happen. Read this book.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about Sanders calling Obama \u201cweak\u201d and a \u201cdisappointment.\u201d He said in a July 2011 radio interview: \u201cI think that there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 in negotiating with Republicans, and there\u2019s deep disappointment.\u201d\n\nClinton also mentioned a more recent Sanders comment, saying that \u201ctoday Sen. Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.\u201d Sanders didn\u2019t say Obama had failed a \u201ctest,\u201d but did say Obama hadn\u2019t succeeded in terms of presidential leadership.\n\nIn an interview for MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap right now between Congress and the American people. What presidential leadership is about is closing that gap.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought President Obama had succeeded in closing that gap, Sanders said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I mean, I think he has made the effort. But I think what we need, when I talk about a political revolution, is bringing millions and millions of people into the political process in a way that does not exist right now.\u201d\n\n\u2014 by Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D\u2019Angelo Gore\n\nSources\n\nSocial Security Administration. \u201cContribution And Benefit Base.\u201d Undated, accessed 12 Feb 2016.\n\nStephen C.
