The Democratic frontrunner responded to Chuck Todd's question on whether or not an unborn child has constitutional rights by saying, \"The unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights.\"\n\n\"When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?\" Todd asked.\n\n\"Well, under our laws currently, that is not something that exists. The unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t do everything we possibly can in the vast majority of instances to, you know, help a mother who is carrying a child and wants to make sure that child will be healthy, to have appropriate medical support. It doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, don\u2019t do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations. But it does not include sacrificing the woman\u2019s right to make decisions. And I think that\u2019s an important distinction that under Roe v. Wade we\u2019ve had refined under our Constitution,\" Clinton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton: \"The Unborn Person Doesn\u2019t Have Constitutional Rights\" - Justin Holcomb : Hillary Clinton made her point on abortion clearly known on\u00a0NBC\u2019s .05/27/2016 11:07:06AM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/04/03/hillary-clinton-the-unborn-person-doesnt-have-constitutional-rights-n2142977", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/93/2016-04-02T033415Z_3_LYNXNPEC303EC_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Hillary Clinton: \"The Unborn Person Doesn\u2019t Have Constitutional Rights\""}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/04/03/hillary-clinton-the-unborn-person-doesnt-have-constitutional-rights-n2142977", "site_name": "Townhall", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/93/2016-04-02T033415Z_3_LYNXNPEC303EC_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "type": "Article", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Hillary Clinton: \"The Unborn Person Doesn\u2019t Have Constitutional Rights\""}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton: \"The Unborn Person Doesn\u2019t Have Constitutional Rights\", Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Democratic frontrunner responded to Chuck Todd's question on whether or not an unborn child has constitutional rights by saying, \"The unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights.\"\nThe unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights.\n\"When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?\"\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, don\u2019t do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations.\nHillary Clinton made her point on abortion clearly known on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday morning."}
