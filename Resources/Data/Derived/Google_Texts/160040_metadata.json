The office will have administrative oversight by Administrative Director Rick Kamerzell and will be managed operationally by Noreen Willett and Lawrence Estrada. Other staff will include radiological technologists, medical assistants and patient access representatives.\n\n\"We will provide basic health care and encourage the community to use Urgent Care for conditions that require attention but do not suggest an immediate threat to your life or health,\" Kamerzell said. \"We will not establish primary care for patients, nor will we manage patient health care long term.\"\n\nKamerzell said the Urgent Care will help alleviate overuse of the hospital's emergency room with minor patient needs, and provide patients with a lower cost option for urgent health needs.\n\n\"We will have X-ray services at the Urgent Care, and if it is determined that a patient needs emergency evaluation, we will recommend that they be taken to the emergency room,\" he said.\n\nWith a renewed focus on wellness and health management, St. Thomas More has found that long term wellness is where \"value\" lies for the health care consumer.\n\nThe hospital is pursuing a revolution called Colorado Health Neighborhoods, moving away from the current fee-for-service model that rewards volume instead of value, and encouraging consumers to play an active role in their health care. The goal of CHN is to create a system that promotes coordination among providers to improve health outcomes at an affordable cost in a convenient, service-oriented setting.\n\n\"With the Urgent Care, St. Thomas More Hospital, the St. Thomas More Physician Group and CHN network providers, CCOM services, and community outreach, I have no doubt we are well on our way to creating a successful CHN in Fremont County,\" said Sheri Trahern, Chief Administrative Officer.\n\nFor information, visit stmhospital.org/urgent-care.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2013-09-06T18:09:44-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/0906/20130906__07DRSTMw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Helpful Information\nWhen to use urgent care: \n\n\n\n\n- minor injuries and lacerations\n\n\n- eye redness or discomfort\n\n\n- minor fractures, sprains and strains\n\n\n- urinary symptoms\n\n\n- coughs and colds\n\n\n- fever, flu or sore throat\n\n\n- skin rashes and infections\n\n\nWhen to use the emergency department: \n\n\n\n\n- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n\n\n- chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure\n\n\n- fainting, sudden dizziness, weakness\n\n\n- changes in", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:24036044:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/0906/20130906__07DRSTMw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Helpful Information\nWhen to use urgent care: \n\n\n\n\n- minor injuries and lacerations\n\n\n- eye redness or discomfort\n\n\n- minor fractures, sprains and strains\n\n\n- urinary symptoms\n\n\n- coughs and colds\n\n\n- fever, flu or sore throat\n\n\n- skin rashes and infections\n\n\nWhen to use the emergency department: \n\n\n\n\n- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n\n\n- chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure\n\n\n- fainting, sudden dizziness, weakness\n\n\n- changes in", "title": "New St. Thomas More Hospital Urgent Care slated to open Oct. 7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Helpful Information\nWhen to use urgent care: \n\n\n\n\n- minor injuries and lacerations\n\n\n- eye redness or discomfort\n\n\n- minor fractures, sprains and strains\n\n\n- urinary symptoms\n\n\n- coughs and colds\n\n\n- fever, flu or sore throat\n\n\n- skin rashes and infections\n\n\nWhen to use the emergency department: \n\n\n\n\n- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n\n\n- chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure\n\n\n- fainting, sudden dizziness, weakness\n\n\n- changes in", "title": "New St. Thomas More Hospital Urgent Care slated to open Oct. 7", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/0906/20130906__07DRSTMw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-06T18:09:44-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "New St. Thomas More Hospital Urgent Care slated to open Oct. 7", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/0906/20130906__07DRSTMw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Carie Canterburycanterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2013-09-07T09:50:43-0600", "endDate": "2023-09-06T18:09:44-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2013-09-06T18:15:09-0600", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Canyon City Colorado Education news, Canyon City Colorado news, Education Canyon City news, Education Colorado news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd777a\"", "article_summary": "St. Thomas More Hospital expands services to offer urgent careRick Kamerzell, administrative director of the new Centura Health Urgent Care Ca\u00f1on City, speaks to St. Thomas More Hospital employees and board members Friday about the new urgent care center that is slated to open Oct. 7.\nThe new Centura Health Urgent Care Ca\u00f1on City will be located at 3245 E.
