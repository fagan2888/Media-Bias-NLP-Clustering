The company announced it would cover same-sex spouses after the state of Washington launched an investigation. That followed a similar move by Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad last December.\n\nThere are the only two examples Attorney General Bob Ferguson says he\u2019s aware of where same-sex spouses were allegedly denied benefits.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that we\u2019ve received other complaints so far on this issue in our office,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nNonetheless, Ferguson, along with the state\u2019s insurance commissioner and Human Rights Commission, have written an open letter to health plan administrators, insurance companies and employers. It reminds them that it would be a violation of Washington\u2019s anti-discrimination law to cover opposite-sex spouses, but refuse coverage to same-sex spouses.\n\nThe warning comes as health care coverage expands under the Affordable Care Act and more health plans are certified in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Law", "description": "Washington\u2019s Attorney General is reminding employers they may not discriminate against same-sex spouses when it comes to health coverage.
