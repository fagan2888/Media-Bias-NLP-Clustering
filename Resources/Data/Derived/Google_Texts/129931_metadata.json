Doctors were 44 percent slower in starting patients aged 18 to 39 on high blood pressure drugs than they were for patients aged 60 and older.\n\nThe study was published online recently in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.\n\n\"Even with regular primary care contact and continued elevated blood pressure, young adults had slower rates of [high blood pressure] medication initiation than middle-aged and older adults,\" study leader Dr. Heather Johnson said in a journal news release.\n\nPrescribing rates were slowest for young adults who were white, male, not on Medicaid and who were not regular clinic visitors, the study found.\n\nThe prescribing rate for men was 36 percent slower than for women, and slower among whites than among patients in other racial/ethnic groups. The latter finding may be due to the fact that minorities, especially blacks, are at increased risk of having other health problems along with high blood pressure, the researchers said.\n\nThey also found that patients with diabetes in all age groups were prescribed high blood pressure medications 56 percent faster than other patients.\n\nAbout 10 percent of Americans aged 18 to 39 have high blood pressure, which puts them at increased risk for heart problems later in life, according to the news release. There is a need to improve high blood pressure control in young adults through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, the use of blood pressure drugs, the researchers said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about high blood pressure.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/age-health-news-7/doctors-slower-to-prescribe-high-blood-pressure-meds-to-younger-patients-685073.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/bloodpressure_40266.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Study found age was a factor in how quickly patients got treatment", "title": "Doctors Slower to Prescribe High Blood Pressure Meds to Younger Patients"}, "description": "Study found age was a factor in how quickly patients got treatment", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Doctors were 44 percent slower in starting patients aged 18 to 39 on high blood pressure drugs than they were for patients aged 60 and older.\nMore informationThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about high blood pressure.\nThere is a need to improve high blood pressure control in young adults through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, the use of blood pressure drugs, the researchers said.\nThey also found that patients with diabetes in all age groups were prescribed high blood pressure medications 56 percent faster than other patients.\nEn Espa\u00f1olMONDAY, Feb. 24, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors wait longer to prescribe blood pressure drugs to young adults than to older patients, a new study finds."}
