Mr. Chad Selweski stated that Obamacare the myth has become Obamacare the reality. I would differ in that statement and say the myth of Obamacare has become a forced disaster that will only grow in its economic meltdown affect.

It was passed outside of Constitutional law without one single Republican vote and Republicans were never even asked to participate in any of the writing of the legislation as a liberal president and his liberal Senate and House shut out the other side and shoved this socialist mess through in a total power grab... Of course, everyone knows that the writing of this mess has been an on-going process for liberals for decades and it just didnt get written after Obamas election.

If Obamacare is so great, then why did the President have to buy off many of his liberal voting blocks and special interest groups by giving them waivers so they do not have to participate in this great program? That fact all by itself speaks volumes to just how bad this legislation really is!

This socialist power grab/mess should apply to everyone or it should apply to no one! Every waiver that has been given for political purposes should be revoked... Every single one of them, but especially those that have been given to federal employees, bureaucrats and our elected officials!

This disaster should apply to everyone  including the president and his family  or it should be thrown out!
