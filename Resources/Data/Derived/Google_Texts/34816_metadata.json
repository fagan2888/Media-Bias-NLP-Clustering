Neither the WAWM Schools nor Central High School staffs condone the use of alcoholic beverages or material that portrays these types of material. All advisors will be required to pre-approve any further favors (gifts) to their building administrators prior to ordering and/or distributing items like this in the future for any events.\u201d\n\nA school district spokesman says students were supposed to receive a candle with the glass, but for some reason, they only received the champagne flutes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WEST ALLIS, Wis. -- Parents of students at West Allis Central High School in Wisconsin were confused by the inappropriate prom favor given to students on Saturday night.
