(WISH) \u2013 After nearly three decades, a staple in Knightstown is closing down.\n\nThe Carthage, Knightstown, Shirley Railroad, or CKS, has stopped running after 27 years.\n\nTom Allison, owner of CKS, was the man behind the big blue engine, which gave pumpkin picking rides in the fall and did old western robbery reenactments in the summer.\n\n\u201cOnly a fool operates at a loss on a continuous basis,\u201d Allison said.\n\nAllison says people just don\u2019t have the disposable income they once did.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. We haven\u2019t even found the tunnel yet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any downside until the last five, six years where you just sit and watch things go out from under you and there isn\u2019t anything you can do about it,\u201d Allison said.\n\nAllison is hanging up his conductor hat and hoping someone with money and vision will buy CKS before August rolls around.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Carthage, Knightstown, Shirley Railroad, or CKS, in Knightstown, Indiana has stopped running after 27 years.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wish", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "The Carthage, Knightstown, Shirley Railroad, or CKS, in Knightstown, Indiana has stopped running after 27 years.", "title": "Knightstown railroad shuts down after 27 years", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2014/06/27/knightstown-railroad-shuts-down-after-27-years/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/knightstown-train.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Carthage, Knightstown, Shirley Railroad, or CKS, in Knightstown, Indiana has stopped running after 27 years.", "title": "Knightstown railroad shuts down after 27 years", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/knightstown-train.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WISH_TV", "site": "wish_tv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "fb": {"pages": 51020120862}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WISH-TV", "google-site-verification": "-0bIsWnsWP_Tti2P_v5CM_6E-Jif4gWmQWQHbxcE9q4", "keywords": "Henry County, Knightstown - Indiana, Local News, News, Top Video, Brooke Martin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wishtv", "published_time": "2014-06-28T00:47:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T19:12:57+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wishtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3eda613633012e4513b3dffff2e4b0bc?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc14b\"", "article_summary": "The Carthage, Knightstown, Shirley Railroad, or CKS, has stopped running after 27 years.\n(WISH) \u2013 After nearly three decades, a staple in Knightstown is closing down.\nAllison is hanging up his conductor hat and hoping someone with money and vision will buy CKS before August rolls around.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.\nAllison says people just don\u2019t have the disposable income they once did."}
