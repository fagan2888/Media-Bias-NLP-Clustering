"2.5 million Jobs" grabbed the headlines, but that misses the point. The study is correct in assuming that some Americans forced to work for health care benefits will quit, but that doesn't mean that the work will no longer need to be done. If the study assumed employers wouldn't make up the reduced number of hours by hiring new employees then it is simply wrong.

Of course there will be costs and dislocations associated with implementing the new law. Several small business owners I talked to have reduced employee hours and shifted to part-time or temporary help to avoid the "employer mandate."

Notwithstanding the short-term costs, longer-term, one of the most important consequences overlooked by the study is that by disentangling health-care benefits from the employer-employee relationship, entrepreneurship will flourish. In an economy where risk-taking is rewarded, encouraging bright, entrepreneurial-minded large company employees to leave the comforts of their nine-to-five jobs to start businesses is critical to America's long-term success.
