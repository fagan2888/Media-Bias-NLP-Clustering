Ross, of a district court in Missouri, wrote in his ruling that being publicly named as an Ashley Madison user amounts to more than common embarrassment, but noted the 42 plaintiffs have special roles in the case that require identification.\n\nThe plaintiffs are \"class representatives\" and may need to testify or offer evidence, unlike \"class members,\" those in the lawsuit who do not need participate as actively, Ross wrote.\n\nHe ruled that the plaintiffs must either identify themselves or proceed as class members, who can remain anonymous.\n\nThe \"class\" for the collective lawsuit has not yet been certified, the ruling noted. There are at least 10 plaintiffs who are publicly named.\n\nAvid Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Ethan Lou in Toronto; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Forty-two plaintiffs, seeking to represent users of the website who had their informat", "title": "Ashley Madison plaintiffs cannot sue anonymously over hack, judge says", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Ashley-Madison-plaintiffs-cannot-sue-anonymously-over-hack-judge-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ashleymadison-cybersecurity_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Ashley-Madison-plaintiffs-cannot-sue-anonymously-over-hack-judge-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ashleymadison-cybersecurity_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Forty-two plaintiffs, seeking to represent users of the website who had their informat", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5ff\"", "article_summary": "Their action comes after hackers who claimed to be unhappy with Avid Life's business practices publicly released Ashley Madison customer data last August.\nForty-two plaintiffs, seeking to represent users of the website who had their information compromised, had proceeded anonymously against Ashley Madison's Toronto-based parent company Avid Life Media, the ruling released on April 6 showed.\nThe \"class\" for the collective lawsuit has not yet been certified, the ruling noted.\nHe ruled that the plaintiffs must either identify themselves or proceed as class members, who can remain anonymous.\nThe plaintiffs are suing Ashley Madison, a website that facilitates extramarital affairs, for failing to adequately secure their information, marketing a \u201cFull Delete Removal\u201d service that did not work, and using fake female accounts to lure male customers, according to the ruling."}
