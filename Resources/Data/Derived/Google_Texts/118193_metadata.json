As we head into the holiday, we catch up with Scott Edwards, managing director at Sun Capital Partners, a distressed debt and turnaround firm based in Boca Raton, Fla.\n\nWhat surprised you the most about 2015?\n\nI don\u2019t know that anyone anticipated such a prolonged period of low oil prices. We and other firms have seen some benefit from that as the profitability at some portfolio companies has been enhanced by lower transportation, energy and input costs. In addition, we believe lower gasoline prices have continued potential to stimulate consumer spending as they may create greater disposable income.\n\nWhat do you think will be the biggest challenge the industry will face in 2016?\n\nThe superabundance of capital in the market will continue to be a challenge that impacts firms across the spectrum of size and strategy. As a result, I expect valuations to remain high and firms to face strong competition for not only winning but finding deal opportunities. Firms will have to differentiate to get deals and generate returns.\n\nWhat do you think will be the biggest drivers of distressed deal flow in 2016?\n\nLiquidity. Distressed and underperforming business with more access to liquidity can \u201ckick the can\u201d and continue operations as they attempt to right their ship. We\u2019ll likely be more focused on acquiring performing companies where there is opportunity for us to have positive impact in helping them transform potential into business results.\n\n-Compiled by Laura Kreutzer", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "title": "In Their Own Words With Sun Capital\u2019s Scott Edwards", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/24/in-their-own-words-with-sun-capitals-scott-edwards/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "In Their Own Words With Sun Capital\u2019s Scott Edwards", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-12-24T16:30:53-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/24/in-their-own-words-with-sun-capitals-scott-edwards/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19350", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "title": "In Their Own Words With Sun Capital\u2019s Scott Edwards", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/24/in-their-own-words-with-sun-capitals-scott-edwards/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19350", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-12-22T15:35:09-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd366b\"", "article_summary": "What do you think will be the biggest drivers of distressed deal flow in 2016?\nIn addition, we believe lower gasoline prices have continued potential to stimulate consumer spending as they may create greater disposable income.\nAs we head into the holiday, we catch up with Scott Edwards, managing director at Sun Capital Partners, a distressed debt and turnaround firm based in Boca Raton, Fla.What surprised you the most about 2015?\nAs a result, I expect valuations to remain high and firms to face strong competition for not only winning but finding deal opportunities.\nWhat do you think will be the biggest challenge the industry will face in 2016?"}
