But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled state governments have a right to opt out of that provision, and about half have decided against Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn Kentucky, residents have had an unfavorable opinion of President Obama\u2019s signature overhaul.\n\nBut Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky President and CEO Susan Zepeda says their polling has consistently shown residents embrace key provisions of the law such as barring pre-existing conditions and tax incentives for employers.\n\n\u201cKentuckians have throughout the years that we\u2019ve been asking this question supported access,\u201d she says. \u201cThey do poll as not knowing a lot about the Affordable Care Act or opposing it at about the same rate that national surveys find.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing to us on the expansion support is it does seem aligned with Kentuckians willingness to recapture the funds that Kentucky has sent to Washington in the form of our taxes, to get those back to Kentuckians through the appropriation process or in this case through embracing the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nSince the state launched it health exchange last October, over 162,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in either Medicaid or private health plans. State officials estimate approximately 308,000 uninsured residents will now qualify for health care coverage due to Medicaid expansion.\n\nMost Kentucky Republicans at the state and federal level have been critical of Beshear\u2019s decision, either questioning his constitutional authority to expand the entitlement program or pointing out the state will have to pick up the additional cost in the coming years.\n\nUnder the health care law, federal funding will decrease gradually after three years to about 90 percent at the end of the decade.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steurer, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told WFPL adding more Kentuckians to the state\u2019s \u201cstruggling Medicaid program\u201d is not the solution.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell continues to hear daily from constituents who are upset and angry that Obamacare means higher premiums and deductibles and less access to the doctors and hospitals they trust. More than 280,000 Kentuckians have had their private insurance policies canceled, despite the president\u2019s repeated promise that \u2018if you like your plan, you can keep it.\u2019 But according to the Governor\u2019s office, fewer than 40,000 Kentuckians have signed up for new private plans. Most new Obamacare enrollees are not on private plans, but are added to the state\u2019s struggling Medicaid program, where one hundred percent of these costs will be picked up by taxpayers and where there is already a shortage of physicians accepting Medicaid patients.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s polling shows most Kentucky adults who identify as GOP voters agree with the governor, however.\n\nAlong party affiliation the survey shows 90 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of independents support expanding the Medicaid rolls.\n\nAmong Republicans, 60 percent said they either strongly or somewhat favor the decision. Specifically, 27 percent said they \u201cstrongly favor\u201d expansion compared to 33 percent who \u201cfavor somewhat\u201d the decision.\n\n\u201cWe agree that making health care accessible to all Kentuckians is a worthy goal,\u201d says Jodi Whitaker, spokeswoman for the state Senate GOP. \u201cWe have better ideas on ways to make that happen, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur proposals would include tort reform and a plan to increase the number of health-care providers in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nThe poll\u2019s findings pull back some of the partisan lenses that the law has been viewed through since its passage four years ago.\n\nAll of the states rejecting Medicaid expansion are represented by Republican governors, and a study by The Commonwealth Fund shows those states are set to lose billions of dollars in federal funds in the coming years.\n\nCongressman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., who voted for health care reform in 2010, says the survey should serve as a wake up call for the GOP in 2014, adding it shows residents are more interested in the law\u2019s benefits than its ongoing politics.\n\n\u201cThis means that people like Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell are clearly out of touch with their own party in Kentucky as it relates to at least that portion of the law,\u201d he says. \u201cVirtually every Republican in the state has been critical of not only the law, but Gov. Beshear\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid to cover a lot more low-income people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis poll indicates people understand the magnitude of the problem in Kentucky with poor health outcomes and with very poor access to health care for many of our citizens, and they\u2019re actually showing a broader concern so that\u2019s very positive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "An overwhelming majority of Kentuckians support the state's decision to expand Medicaid for low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act,...", "title": "Poll: Majority of Kentuckians Support Expanded Medicaid Under Obamacare, Including Most Republicans - 89.3 WFPL", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_71153212.jpg", "height": 2000}, "updated_time": "2014-10-14T16:39:42-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/poll-majority-kentuckians-support-expanded-medicaid-under-obamacare-including-most-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An overwhelming majority of Kentuckians support the state's decision to expand Medicaid for low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act,...", "creator": "@WFPLNews", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_71153212.jpg", "title": "Poll: Majority of Kentuckians Support Expanded Medicaid Under Obamacare, Including Most Republicans - 89.3 WFPL", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2014-01-24T16:42:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T16:39:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14d5\"", "article_summary": "An overwhelming majority of Kentuckians support the state\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid for low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act, including most self-identified Republicans.\nUnder the health care law, federal funding will decrease gradually after three years to about 90 percent at the end of the decade.\nIn Kentucky, residents have had an unfavorable opinion of President Obama\u2019s signature overhaul.\nUnder the president\u2019s health care law states are provided funding to increase Medicaid eligibility to all residents with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line.\nState officials estimate approximately 308,000 uninsured residents will now qualify for health care coverage due to Medicaid expansion."}
