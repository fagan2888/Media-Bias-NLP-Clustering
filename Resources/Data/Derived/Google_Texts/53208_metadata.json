(AP) - The fight to establish charter schools in Nebraska isn\u2019t over, despite the loss of a key advocate in the Nebraska Legislature and opponents\u2019 vow to keep the publicly funded, independently run schools out of the state.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, the conservative anti-tax, small-government group, said the issue is one of its top priorities for Nebraska.\n\n\u201cFamilies should not be hindered by their zip code; they should have more education options and get to choose the school that best suits them,\u201d said Matt Litt, director of the Nebraska chapter of Americans for Prosperity.\n\nThe group\u2019s educational foundation issued a release earlier this week calling for education reform in Nebraska - including legislation to allow charter schools in the state.\n\nNebraska is one of only eight states that have not passed legislation to allow charter schools, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Charter schools are publicly funded and typically governed by an organization under a legislative contract - or charter. A charter school has more flexibility in its operation and can avoid some rules and regulations, but it can be more easily closed than a public school if it doesn\u2019t meet accountability standards.\n\nLast year, a Stanford University study said that charter schools benefit black and Hispanic English-learning student and students living in poverty, more than their peers in other groups.\n\nBut the schools have not been without controversy. Opponents say that charter schools drain money from public school systems and can cherry-pick the best students, while turning away weaker and disruptive ones - a choice public schools don\u2019t have.\n\nOmaha state Sen. Scott Lautenbaugh has twice introduced legislation to allow charter schools, only to see the bills die in committee. He said there will be another effort to pass charter school legislation in the upcoming session beginning in January, but the bill won\u2019t come from him - Lautenbaugh is leaving his seat at the end of the year because of term limits.\n\nLautenbaugh said he believes another Omaha senator will take over his effort to allow for the creation of up to five charter schools in the Omaha Public Schools - the state\u2019s largest with more than 46,000 students. Americans for Prosperity will work with any state lawmaker who wants to propose a charter school bill, Litt said.\n\nCharter schools are more nimble to adapting to new practices and to the needs of their students, Lautenbaugh said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for a single entity like a stand-alone charter school to go with what works and readily leave behind what doesn\u2019t if you don\u2019t have to try to go before a school board and a district and a union rep, etcetera,\u201d Lautenbaugh said.\n\nOmaha Public Schools and the Nebraska State Board of Education have steadfastly opposed efforts to allow charter schools in Nebraska.\n\nState Sen. Ernie Chambers also vowed to fight any renewed effort, saying he rejects proponents\u2019 stance that it\u2019s better to help some children escape struggling schools than none.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feed some of our children and starve the others,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, lawmakers and education administrators need to strive for equality in existing public schools and address the problem of retaining incompetent teachers, Chambers said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fight to establish charter schools in Nebraska isn't over, despite the loss of a key advocate in the Nebraska Legislature and opponents' vow to keep the publicly funded, independently run schools out of the state.", "Author": "MARGERY A.
