Beginning May 1, the park will be offering Fremont County residents half-off regularly-priced season passes or daily admission with proper ID or proof of residency until May 31. This offer is good for Adult, Senior, and Children passes only, and cannot be combined with any other discounts or coupons, said Vice-President and General Manager, Mike Bandera. All it takes is a trip to the park as pre-purchase tickets are not available online for this special offer.\n\nRecovering from the Royal Gorge Fire June 2013, the majority of the park is brand new after a giant rebuild. The park is open 7 a.m. to dusk with attractions and the Visitor Center opening at 10 a.m.\n\nGeneral Admission includes passage across North America's Highest Suspension Bridge, Caf\u00e9 1230, named for its height over the Arkansas River, the new Aerial Tramway and several other features. Attractions that cost extra includes North America's Highest zip line crossing the gorge 2,400 feet, the Royal Gorge Cloudscraper by Zip Rider, and internationally-acclaimed thrill ride, The Royal Rush Skycoaster which sweeps riders 1,200 feet above the Arkansas River at 50 mph.\n\nIt's best to buy passes before May 22, as regular prices go up May 23, said Bandera.
