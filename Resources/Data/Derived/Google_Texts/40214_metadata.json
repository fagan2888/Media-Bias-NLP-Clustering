In 2014, total U.S. sales for the men's personal care market hit $4.1 billion, up 6.7 percent from 2012 and 19 percent from 2009, making it one of the fastest-growing segments of the beauty industry. Mintel predicts sales will grow to $4.6 billion by 2019.\n\n\"Men want an upgraded experience,\" said Matthew McCarthy, senior marketing director of antiperspirants and deodorants at Unilever, who has also been instrumental in the company's skin and hair care brands. \"Guys are more discriminating today than ever. They want quality and personalization that meets what they are looking for,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRead MoreHot holiday gifts for her in 2014\n\n\n\nOne hundred million dollars a year in sales growth to 2019, and the slower growth over the next five years may not seem like a sales juggernaut, but the mampering trend comes at a time when many traditional personal care categories for both men and women are showing flat sales. And the slowing growth overall in the personal care market makes new, targeted products critical to the industry.\n\nAntiperspirant and deodorant have traditionally been major drivers of growth, but Mintel states that the men's skin care segment\u2014which consists of body care and facial care products\u2014has experienced the most significant increase, with sales gains of 57 percent from 2009 to 2014. The smallest segment? Hair care.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A grave threat to macho men is taking place across the land: the rise of 'mampering'\u2014eye creams, exfoliation and facial moisturizers for guys.", "news_keywords": "Rise of mampering, eye creams, for men, real men, threat to macho men, metrosexual", "author": "Barbara Booth", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "A threat to macho men is taking place across the land: the rise of 'mampering'\u2014eye creams, exfoliation and facial moisturizers for guys.", "title": "Real men don't cry\u2014but they are exfoliating", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/05/real-men-dont-cry-but-they-are-exfoliating.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/04/102240989-83865377.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A threat to macho men is taking place across the land: the rise of 'mampering'\u2014eye creams, exfoliation and facial moisturizers for guys.", "creator": "@CNBC", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/05/real-men-dont-cry-but-they-are-exfoliating.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/04/102240989-83865377.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Real men don't cry\u2014but they are exfoliating.
