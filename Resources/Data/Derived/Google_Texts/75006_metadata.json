Co-owner Brian Buckley recommends: \u2022 A local book: \"Wastoid,\" by Mathias Svalina of Denver. \"He took the themes Shakespeare sonnets and rewrote them in our time and place,\" Buckley says. \"They're heartbreaking and beautiful, joyous language pieces to read.\" \u2022 For the new year: \"Geography III,\" by Elizabeth Bishop. \"Poems in here are full of questions that could be good for the beginning of a new year,\" Buckley says. He says the book poses questions about travel, your place in the world and whether you are doing the things your soul needs you to be doing. \"It's a beautiful, small book,\" Buckley says.\n\nThis place is different. It aims to be an island.\n\nThe front door proclaims to those on busy University Hill, \"Poetry and fair trade matter.\"\n\nHere, thoughts and emotions join words that find their rhythm, both silently on the shelves and sometimes loudly on stage. The space is small and, therefore, carefully curated. The coffee is fair trade, organic and local, and the books for sale offer exclusively poetry.\n\nIn fact, Innisfree is one of four poetry-only bookstores in the nation.\n\nIt was inspired by the nearly 90-year-old Grolier Poetry Book Shop in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass. Seattle is home to another poetry bookstore, and the fourth and newest, in Brooklyn, is temporarily closed because of a new baby.\n\nBoulder's Innisfree, named after a William Butler Yeats poem, \"The Lake Isle of Innisfree,\" is celebrating its fifth year.\n\nJustin Medford reads from his book of poems as Gary Erb looks on during the weekly poetry open mic at the Innisfree Poetry Bookstore & Cafe.

And the National Endowment for the Arts recently reported only 6.7 percent of American adults read poetry last year, down from 12 percent in 2002 \u2014 marking the most significant drop-off of any genre.\n\nBut Boulder's not a typical city, he says.\n\nSome residents go out of their way to support a small business, even though Starbucks is walking distance away, he says. English and creative writing teachers at the University of Colorado, Naropa University and area high schools often conduct classes at Innisfree, he says.\n\nThe Boulder Writing Dates Meetup Group gathers at Innisfree on Saturday mornings once a month. They talk about their writing projects and then write for several hours.\n\nOrganizer Norah Charles, of Boulder, says she prefers Innisfree because it's quiet, supportive of literature and inspirational.\n\n\"It's a place to work and feel inspired,\" Charles says. \"You can go back and forth between the books and your work, and that's pretty cool.\"\n\nShe says that, unlike other Boulder bookstore-coffee shops, Innisfree is calm, intimate and not too loud.\n\n\"Innisfree is a serious gem,\" she says, adding it might not be the best place to hang out and talk, considering other patrons often are silently reading and writing.\n\nThe next Writing Dates get-together, free and open to the public, is 9 a.m.-noon on Valentine's Day. Although the group has more than 100 members, about a dozen attend the monthly events.\n\nPoetry in Boulder\n\nIn the evenings, local poets flock to Innisfree. They share their words during the weekly Tuesday open mics or listen to a new featured poet or musical guest on Thursdays.\n\nKate Heidelbach and Dave Essig show their appreciation for a reader during Innisfree s poetry open mic.

Naropa's annual, internationally known Summer Writing Program brings in more than 60 guest faculty members, and the poetics school itself holds weekly readings, performances and discussions.\n\nNearby CU is home to assistant professor Noah Eli Gordan and associate professor Julie Carr, both authors of multiple poetry books and recipients of big-name awards. Ruth Allen Kocher, professor and associate chair of the creative writing program, is also an award-winning, published poet.\n\nClubs such as the Boulder Poetry Tribe boldly proclaim that Boulder's poetry scene is \"dynamic and thriving.\" One will find poetry readings at coffee shops, such as The Laughing Goat, and poetry clubs at other bookstores, including the Living Poets Society at the Boulder Book Store.\n\n\"For a small town, it's amazing what goes on in the poetry realm,\" Buckley says. \"There were amazing things going on anyway, and we'd like to think we added another little ripple supporting the art of poetry.\"\n\nBut even so, Buckley says, he doesn't believe he could keep the store open without the coffee component.\n\nHe and his wife met in a poetry class at college in Boston, he says, and began dreaming about a poetry-exclusive bookstore then. After 20 years of teaching, Buckley says he decided to finally pursue the idea.\n\n\"The store is an attempt to honor the art of poetry, the muse, the teachers and parents who delivered poetry so wisely, and the way in which Kate and I met,\" he says.\n\nBuckley says poetry has always been a part of his life.\n\n\"Growing up a child in Boston,\" he says, \"poetry was prevalent in our Irish neighborhood. There was pride in it, especially where many Irish people in Boston had crossed the ocean and felt like it was a bridge back to Ireland.\"\n\nTo Buckley, poetry is so important because it speaks to our inner voices.\n\n\"When you're reading it, you feel that someone took incredible care with word choice, placement, deciding the beats, for the words to appear on the page in this form, this shape,\" he says. \"It's a writer-reader exchange that's quiet, intimate, that flushes through the heart, soul and mind as you read it.\"\n\nAimee Heckel: 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_27382126/innisfree-poetry-bookstore-and-cafe-hotspot-poem-lovers", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n   Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27382126:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-25T21:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Shop on The Hill is one of four poetry-only book stores in the nation.", "title": "Poems get their due at Boulder's Innisfree", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_27382126/innisfree-poetry-bookstore-and-cafe-hotspot-poem-lovers", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0123/20150123_054828_25DCPCOV-1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0123/20150123_054828_25DCPCOV-1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-01-23T17:57:36-0700", "endDate": "2025-01-23T16:54:45-0700", "description": "Shop on The Hill is one of four poetry-only book stores in the nation.", "byline": "By Aimee Heckel", "pubDate": "2015-01-23T17:58:26-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-25T21:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Poems get their due at Boulder's Innisfree", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado news, Lifestyles Boulder news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_27382126/innisfree-poetry-bookstore-and-cafe-hotspot-poem-lovers", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Shop on The Hill is one of four poetry-only book stores in the nation.", "title": "Poems get their due at Boulder's Innisfree"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0123/20150123_054828_25DCPCOV-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5c0\"", "article_summary": "Justin Medford reads from his book of poems as Gary Erb looks on during the weekly poetry open mic at the Innisfree Poetry Bookstore & Cafe.\nBoulder's Innisfree, named after a William Butler Yeats poem, \"The Lake Isle of Innisfree,\" is celebrating its fifth year.\nClubs such as the Boulder Poetry Tribe boldly proclaim that Boulder's poetry scene is \"dynamic and thriving.\"\nKate Heidelbach and Dave Essig show their appreciation for a reader during Innisfree s poetry open mic.\n\"It's a beautiful, small book,\" Buckley says."}
