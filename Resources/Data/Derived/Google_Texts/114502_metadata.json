The Skydance Bridge is ridiculous, and the Devon Tower is an eyesore.\n\nAnd he couches all of that with the statement Tulsa used to be a little jealous of Oklahoma City.\n\nUsed to be, clearly not anymore.\n\nAll that aside, T-Town is finally on the right track. Their downtown is coming back to life with entertainment, dining, an arena and a ballpark. They've yet to figure out what to do with their river, but there's great potential there.\n\nBottom line, Tulsa's grown into a nice minor league city.\n\nOk, one parting shot.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "For decades, Tulsa tried to look down its nose at a largely oblivious Oklahoma City.", "author": "Kelly Ogle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25697848/my-2-cents-tulsa-world-reporter-slams-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25697848_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For decades, Tulsa tried to look down its nose at a largely oblivious Oklahoma City.", "title": "My 2 Cents: Tulsa World Reporter Slams OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25697848_SA.jpg", "description": "For decades, Tulsa tried to look down its nose at a largely oblivious Oklahoma City.", "card": "summary", "title": "My 2 Cents: Tulsa World Reporter Slams OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "my-2-cents-tulsa-world-reporter-slams-okc", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/06/04", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3027\"", "article_summary": "And he couches all of that with the statement Tulsa used to be a little jealous of Oklahoma City.\nAnd Green Country took on a whole new meaning, as our envious neighbors up the turnpike watched Oklahoma City reinvent itself, while moss gathered on the old oil capitol.\nFor decades, Tulsa tried to look down its nose at a largely oblivious Oklahoma City.\nI say all this because of a recent column by a Tulsa World reporter who dogged Oklahoma City, despite the fact that he brought his family to visit our fair city for Memorial Day rather than stay in Tulsa and take a nap.\nBut in the last 20 years, Tulsa's imagined superiority has dried up like the Arkansas River in August."}
