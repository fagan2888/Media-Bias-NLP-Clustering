(Photo: Jason Bean/RGJ)Buy Photo\n\nA lot can change in a year, just ask Kristen Aaquist, a transgender woman in transition and a Sparks city employee.\n\nAaquist is breaking ground as the first openly transgender woman to work for Sparks, but there is a major obstacle that is affecting her ability to fully transition: her health insurance plan. The city does not currently cover gender reassignment surgery as part of its employee health plan.\n\nA recent decision by the city\u2019s Group Healthcare Committee, however, may change that very soon. The committee, a panel of experts and city employees who help form city health care policy, voted to approve more inclusive coverage last Wednesday.\n\nTheir approval was the last step before the issue is presented to the Sparks City Council for a final vote. The issue will likely be on the agenda Oct. 26 or in mid-November at the latest.\n\nWhen the committee announced their affirmative vote, it was an emotional moment for Aaquist.\n\n\u201cThis was an absolutely wonderful thing to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI was crying in the room.\u201d\n\nLast year, Aaquist requested insurance coverage for both hormone replacement therapy and gender-confirming surgery but was given some disappointing news.\n\nShe gave what she called a \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d presentation to the city\u2019s Group Healthcare Committee where she explained the necessity of her request. She was later told that while hormones would officially be covered, her surgery would not be.\n\nHormones for transgender women repress physical male characteristics while boosting female ones, but Aaquist\u2019s goals are to take her transition to the next level through surgery. Disappointed by the decision last year, she started thinking about how she could raise the funds herself.\n\nMale to female gender reassignment surgery can cost between $21,000 and $50,000, a large amount to pay out of pocket. Female to male surgery can run an even higher cost, in the ballpark of $100,000. Potential complications from surgery, which would also be out of pocket, can cost even more.\n\nAaquist is a legal secretary and has been a city employee for 14 years. She considered taking on a second job but was hesitant to do so, as she wouldn\u2019t be able to spend as much time with her two sons. The only other option would be to take out a loan.\n\nNow 35 years old, Aaquist officially began to transition in the fall of 2013, when she began to come out to friends and family, and eventually work colleagues, as a woman. About that time, she also began to follow a blog kept by a transgender woman, where the blogger described her journey of realizing her desire to live life as a female.\n\n\u201cAs I was reading it, all I could think was, \u2018Oh my god, she\u2019s telling my life story,\u2019\u201d Aaquist said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the city of Sparks will sooner or later be required to cover gender reassignment surgeries because it receives federal dollars. If the Sparks City Council does not approve the insurance decision this fall, the city will eventually be required to offer the benefit or face legal repercussions.\n\nOn a national scale, coverage of gender reassignment procedures has been a challenge for many transgender individuals, according to Brock Maylath, president of Reno\u2019s Transgender Allies Group. Antiquated language and a misunderstanding of the medical necessity of gender reassignment surgery still exists in many states. A general misconception is that such surgeries are cosmetic, when in fact they are considered by the medical community to be a necessary option for people who experience gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a state of disconnection between the gender someone is assigned at birth and the one he or she connects with on an emotional and psychological level.\n\nTransgender individuals are statistically more likely to experience discrimination, poverty, harassment and depression during their lifetimes, according to GLAAD, an organization that focuses on advancing equality for the LGBT community. As a result, suicide attempts in the transgender community are around a staggering 41 percent, compared to less than 5 percent of the general population.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing experimental about these surgeries,\u201d Maylath said. \u201cThere is no humane reason to deny coverage.\u201d\n\nA lack of coverage could also leave the city at risk for future lawsuits, but Maylath said that he hopes it doesn\u2019t need to come to that.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody sues, everybody loses,\u201d he said.\n\nDiscrimination against transgender people is not always widely acknowledged, due to the smaller percentage of the population that they make up. But Maylath said that even if the community is small, transgender men and women have medical needs that ought to be protected.\n\n\u201cNot covering gender-affirming therapies is the same as saying, \u2018We don\u2019t know anyone in our company who\u2019s black, so we\u2019re not going to cover sickle-cell anemia,\u2019\u201d Maylath said.\n\nAs for the future of coverage in Sparks, city officials hope to plan an educational session to brief the council members on the issue before they vote on it in a public meeting.\n\n\u201cIn general terms, I support anything we can do as a city to be inclusive,\u201d said Sparks Councilwoman Julia Ratti.\n\nEarlier this year, the cities of Reno and Las Vegas have both opted to cover gender reassignment surgeries for transgender city employees. If Sparks City Council approves coverage, it\u2019s likely that they will follow the plan adopted by Reno.\n\nSparks\u2019 new healthcare plan with Renown and Hometown Health goes into effect Jan. 1. If the city approves gender reassignment surgery as a covered procedure, then that change will take place on Jan. 1 as well.\n\nRegardless of the City Council\u2019s decision, Aaquist plans to have her surgery in early February. She just hopes that her insurance plan will cover it. With no surgeons in Nevada who specialize in gender-reassignment surgery, Aaquist plans to travel to Pennsylvania for her procedure. Perhaps poetically, the doctor is located in a town called New Hope.\n\nIf coverage is approved, Aaquist believes that the decision will improve the lives of other future transgender employees that the city may hire.\n\n\u201cThis is something down the road that\u2019s really going to help people,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s great to be a part of making that happen.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1RChVpW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Transgender city employees must currently pay for surgery costs out of pocket.
