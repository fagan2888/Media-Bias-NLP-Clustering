The pullout, which finishes an Israeli ground operation that began July 17, was completed before a 72-hour cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas went into effect at 8 a.m. local time, the spokesman said. But the cease-fire remained fragile. The Israeli Defence Forces said a barrage of 20 rockets was fired into Israel around the deadline. A Hamas-run news station reported that two houses were hit by Israelis in northern Gaza.\n\nReuters\n\nNo previous cease-fire in the conflict has lasted more than a day, but U.S. officials said they are hopeful that this one will work. Both sides are under pressure to stop fighting. Israel said it has destroyed more than a third of Hamas\u2019s estimated arsenal of 10,000 rockets and razed more than 30 tunnels, and at least 260,000 of the territory\u2019s 1.8 million people have been displaced, the U.N. said. The U.S., meanwhile, has upped its pressure on Israel in recent days to scale back the operation and negotiate a durable cease-fire. Nicholas Casey, Adam Entous and Joshua Mitnick report.\n\nCAROL E. LEE\u2019S EARLY HIT: FORECASTING PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S FINAL TWO YEARS IN OFFICE\n\nWith the prospect of a Republican takeover of the Senate looming, the White House is quietly mulling potential silver linings of such a dynamic during President Barack Obama\u2018s final two years in office. While it\u2019s hard to find anyone in the administration who sees any upside for Mr. Obama if the GOP controls both chambers of Congress\u2013certainly no one is making a public case\u2013one optimistic view of a GOP-controlled Congress is that maybe Mr. Obama would finally be able to cut some deals.

Mr. Mamiyev is part of a chaotic insurgent movement that, with Moscow\u2019s help, has brought to east Ukraine the kind of warfare\u2014featuring assorted militias, artillery, tanks and trenches\u2014that calls to mind World War II and the 1990s Balkan conflicts.

Watergate\u2019s legacy, he writes, is the age of cynicism that persists today.\n\nEverett Collection\n\nALSO IN THE NEWS: A last-minute deal between two of Colorado\u2019s top Democrats would keep anti-fracking measures off the ballot in November \u2026 Nearly one in four U.S. banks said they had eased mortgage-lending standards for borrowers with strong credit in the second quarter \u2026 A man who recently returned from West Africa with symptoms consistent with the Ebola virus is being tested for the disease in New York City \u2026 Former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, died Monday.\n\n\u2013Compiled by Rebecca Ballhaus\n\nNEIL KING JR. (VIDEO): WHY AFRICA IS IMPORTANT TO THE U.S.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has invited leaders from nearly 50 African nations to Washington for a reason: Six of the ten fastest-growing countries are in Africa as is much of the world\u2019s untapped oil and mineral resources. It\u2019s also an untapped resource for U.S. goods. But, Africa is also drifting away from the U.S. and toward China.

But, she writes, \u201cWe still don\u2019t fully understand why [Medicare] spending growth has declined so much.\u201d\n\nRobert Samuelson writes in the Washington Post about the anxious generation: parents of millennials who worry that the economy is endangering the future of their offspring and other young adults. \u201cAs parents, our sense of self-worth depends heavily on the success and happiness of our children. These seem increasingly imperiled,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe child refugee crisis is a U.S. problem now because the drug-linked violence the children are fleeing is in large part the U.S.\u2019s fault, writes Charles Kenny for Bloomberg Businessweek. \u201cAnti-drug policies in the U.S. and Europe have not succeeded in curbing drug use or in raising drug prices, but they have considerably increased crime and violence worldwide.\u201d\n\nIn WSJ\u2019s Think Tank, Michael O\u2019Hanlon writes about the risks in focusing on withdrawal from Afganistan. \u201cThe U.S. has fought this frustrating war for more than a dozen years. We should not lose patience at such a late, but still crucial, stage.\n\nMILESTONES\n\nU.S. trade with Africa is less than one-fifth the volume of its trade with Europe, and 60% the level of China\u2019s trade with Africa.\n\nAmerica\u2019s merchandise exports grew 37% to 13 Asian countries other than China between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the MAPI Foundation, while China hiked exports to those countries by 85%.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY\n\n@DanaPerino: RIP James Brady.
