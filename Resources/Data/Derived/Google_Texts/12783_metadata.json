Ed Clere, R-New Albany, shown speaking in the Indiana House in 2014, lost his chairmanship of the House Public Health Committee. Clere said he\u2019s proud of his work as chairman and called House Speaker Brian Bosma\u2019s explanation a \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d (Photo: Charlie Nye/The Star 2014 file photo)\n\nThe former chairman of the Indiana House health committee blames his removal from the position on his policy differences with fellow Republicans, a claim the GOP House speaker disputes.\n\nSpeaker Brian Bosma said he demoted Rep. Ed Clere of New Albany because of \u201crudeness\u201d in his dealings with committee members and others. Bosma announced last week that Rep. Cindy Kirchhofer of Indianapolis was replacing Clere as the committee\u2019s leader.\n\nClere said he\u2019s proud of his work as chairman and called Bosma\u2019s explanation a \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d\n\nClere was the main sponsor of the bill allowing county needle-exchange programs for intravenous drug users approved by the Legislature this year following an HIV outbreak in rural southern Indiana. Republican Gov. Mike Pence initially didn\u2019t support the move. Clere had previously pushed for an expansion of Indiana\u2019s Medicaid program that was opposed by Pence and many Republican legislators.\n\nClere said Bosma called him last week to warn him about his demotion.\n\n\u201cHe told me that he and other members of the House Republican caucus were upset with me about a number of controversial issues and my stance on those issues,\u201d Clere told the News and Tribune.\n\nBosma said the decision had nothing to do with Clere\u2019s position on issues but with how he treated other legislators, Pence administration officials and the public.\n\n\u201cI have had more complaints about how a chairman deals with those entities \u2026. about Ed than I have about any other committee chairman or ranking member that I have appointed in my 15 years as the Republican leader,\u201d Bosma said.\n\nBosma also said he didn\u2019t want to talk publicly about Clere\u2019s removal but changed his mind \u201csince Ed has chosen to paint a different picture.\u201d\n\nClere, who was health chairman for three years, also sponsored a bill that would\u2019ve established goals for increasing vaccination rates among Indiana teenagers for the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus, or HPV, that\u2019s blamed for causing most cases of cervical cancer. That bill failed after facing opposition from the Pence administration and social conservatives.\n\nBeth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention for the Indiana University School of Public Health, said she worked closely with Clere on the needle exchange and HPV vaccination bills.\n\n\u201cHe really worked very hard to make sure the science was clear so his colleagues would know how to make decisions,\u201d Meyerson said.\n\nShe called Bosma\u2019s decision to remove Clere a vendetta for not marching to an \u201cideological drum.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a great public health leader. We were so lucky to have him as chair,\u201d Meyerson said. \u201cI am absolutely flummoxed and deeply disappointed.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Htf6XV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Speaker Brian Bosma said he demoted Rep.
