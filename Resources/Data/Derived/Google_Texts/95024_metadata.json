The populace was stunned to hear the Governor say that he intends to build a wall along Maine\u2019s border to keep drug dealers out and young people in. And, said he, Mexico was going to pay for it.\n\nOkay, he did not say that, but it would have been funny, no? Just a little fairy tale. But wait. The town of Blue Hill is considering a proposal from a local author to adopt an official town fairy tale. Really. Selectmen passed the decision to the citizenry who will take it up at a real town meeting, the kind where actual decisions are made, in April.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting proposal. Maybe Maine, which already has a long list of official stuff, needs a state fairy tale. We already have a bird, a flower, a tree, a fish, a beverage and a cat. Shall we go on? An animal, a berry, a gemstone, a fossil, a soil, a vessel, an insect, a crustacean, a dessert, and a treat (the last two separate and distinct). So why not a fairy tale?\n\nThe biggest challenge would be deciding which of the many existing, though unofficial, fairy tales we should pick. The one that says there is so much fraud, waste and abuse in state government that we could cut the state budget in half by eliminating it?\n\nThe one that says we can continue to underfund public schools but still attract quality teachers and turn out well-educated students? The one that says we should have complete local control of our schools, and still manage to get equal results in every town?\n\nThe one that says we should cut, cut, cut our taxes but still maintain a robust infrastructure of roads and bridges, water systems, parks, dams and solid waste?\n\nThe one that says welfare recipients should just go out and get a job? The one that says welfare recipients shouldn\u2019t be \u201cstigmatized\u201d by cutting off the use of state benefit cards for the purchase of soda, junk food and lottery tickets?\n\nThe one that says that millions of dollars flooding into Maine elections do not influence the candidates elected to our legislature and which issues they support? The one that says it\u2019s okay to elect a governor, a legislator or a congressman with less than a majority vote?\n\nPerhaps the nominee for state fairy tale should be the one that celebrates voter turnout in our state when only about half of us vote in midterm elections. Or the one that celebrates high school student proficiency rates of less than 50 percent in reading and math (2013 NECAP test).\n\nYes, there is no shortage of fairy tales in Maine. Some depict our state as an Eden made up entirely of clean air and water, low crime, and beautiful lakes, mountains and coastlines. Others call out our dark side of drug addiction, lack of job opportunities, an inadequately trained workforce and underperforming technology.\n\nOur two major political parties each have their own fairy tale about Maine. Republicans think our government is too big, our taxes too high, our welfare too generous. Democrats think government has a role to play in almost every aspect of our lives. In their purest forms, both are fairy tales.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 draft party platform for 2016, to be approved at their state convention, starts with this: \u201cOur American democracy is a powerful and effective form of organization that strives to treat all with dignity and functions for the betterment of the collective good.\u201d If that is an aspiration, okay. If they think it is reality, it\u2019s a fairy tale.\n\nThe preamble is followed by 11 pages of party ideology that addresses everything from \u201ca new economic deal for\u2026all Mainers\u201d to \u201cprotection from the repercussions of natural disaster.\u201d Then there is this: The platform \u201cextends to people of all marginalized orientations, gender identities and intersex statuses \u2014 such as LGBTQ people \u2014 all the same legal and social rights as their heterosexual, cisgender, and dyadic counterparts receive\u2026.\u201d\n\nIt makes a reader inclined to support Republicans\u2019 call to affirm English as the state\u2019s official language. True to their \u201cless is more\u201d philosophy, the Republican 2016 platform draft is just three pages long, and frames their view of state government like this: \u201cThe government of Maine exists to preserve and protect certain natural, inherent and inalienable rights endowed by our Creator for the benefit, protection and security of all citizens and future generations.\u201d\n\nAmong these rights are the right to keep and bear arms, the right to express one\u2019s religious faith in public forums, the enactment of \u201cRight to Work\u201d laws, and requirements for mandatory minimum sentencing and photo IDs in order to vote.\n\nAbolished under the Republican platform would be the income tax, \u201cfederalization\u201d of the Maine woods, any marital unions other than those between one man and one woman, the use of state funds for abortions and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs the song goes, fairy tales can come true. It can happen to you. But don\u2019t bet on it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently Governor Paul LePage held one of his \u201ctown meetings\u201d in the town of Mexico.
