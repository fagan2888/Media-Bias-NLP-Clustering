Consequently the target audience includes physicians; community-based organizations; private companies; local, state and national government agencies; and the community at large.\n\nDr. Cato T. Laurencin, Chief Executive Officer of CICATS, said \u201cThe National Health Disparities Elimination Summit will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to learn from and engage with national champions in the fight to eliminate health disparities. A major goal of the Summit is to build on the collective knowledge of our speakers and presenters to foster a lasting network of collaborative partnerships among the attending researchers, physicians, students and community leaders.\u201d\n\nDr. Louis W.

This event is timely in that we have a window of opportunity to reduce health disparities through provisions in the Affordable Care Act, but we cannot stop with coverage. Eliminating barriers, such as navigating the complex health care system, must be addressed if we want people of color to experience quality health care,\u201d said Pat Baker, President and CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation and a speaker at the Summit, who is renowned for her nonprofit work in promoting initiatives to address health disparities in Connecticut.\n\nJoin us for a Welcome Reception at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, June 12, at the Hartford Marriott Downtown to welcome the Cobb Institute Senior Fellows.
