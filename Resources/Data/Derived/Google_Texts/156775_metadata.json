Bob Menendez Robert MenendezDems pressure Obama on vow to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees Lobbying World This week: GOP lawmakers reckon with Trump MORE (D-N.J) called the upgrade for Malaysia \u201ca clear politicization of the report\u201d and said he would use hearings and legislation to challenge the move.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe administration has turned its back on the victims of trafficking, turned a blind eye to the facts, and ignored the calls from Congress, leading human rights advocates, and Malaysian government officials to preserve the integrity of this important report,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have elevated politics over the most basic principles of human rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod BrownThe Hill's 12:30 Report Clinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick Groups urge Senate to oppose defense language on for-profit colleges MORE (D-Ohio) said, \u201cGiving countries with clear evidence of human rights violations, like Malaysia, a front-row seat to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership is unconscionable.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarah Sewall, Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, insisted Monday that Malaysia\u2019s qualification to remain part of the TPP didn\u2019t come into play when evaluating its status.\n\n\n\nSewall said the \u201cwatch list\u201d status means there is \u201cstill much room for improvement in the government\u2019s anti-trafficking efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to encourage Malaysia and Malaysian officials of civil society to work together to make tangible progress to combat human trafficking,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n\n\nShe said that Malaysia \u2014 one of 44 countries on the Tier 2 Watch List \u2014 has made significant efforts, since being downgraded last year, to comply with the minimum standards through several channels, including increasing trafficking investigations and prosecutions as well as providing better victim protections.\n\n\n\nLast year, the Malaysian government worked with civil society stakeholders to draft and propose amendments strengthening the existing anti-trafficking law and addressing concerns raised in previous TIP reports, she said.\n\n\n\nThe amendments were still pending at the end of the reporting period this spring.\n\n\n\nStill, criticism \u2014 primarily from the political left \u2014 piled up in the hours after the report was released.\n\n\n\nRep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), the ranking member on the House Committee on Ways and Means, said the \u201cadministration\u2019s upgrade of Malaysia in the human trafficking report \u2014 without evidence of significant changes on the ground \u2014 is extremely concerning.\u201d\n\nLevin, who has traveled to Hawaii for what could be the final round of TPP talks, said that \u201cinstead of paving the way for Malaysia\u2019s participation in TPP, we should be working on actions that Malaysia should be taking to come into compliance\u201d with international labor standards that ban forced labor.\n\n\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who has been rallying opposition to TPP, said that human trafficking is rife in Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\u201cMalaysia is being upgraded, at least in part, to ease passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRecently, a bipartisan group of 160 House lawmakers \u2014 including 14 Republicans and 12 Democrats who supported fast-track legislation \u2014 and 19 senators wrote letters to Secretary of State John Kerry John KerryGOP senator calls for China to crack down on illegal opioid Obamas to live in home of former Clinton press secretary: report Even in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably MORE, asking him to keep Malaysia as a Tier 3 country.\n\n\n\nEven amid optimism, there are questions about whether the 12 TPP nations can wrap up an agreement because of the number of complex unresolved issues.\n\n\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers have expressed skepticism about the TPP, calling on U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman Michael

enforcement.\n\n\n\nU.S. negotiators are in Hawaii this week seeking to complete the long-awaited deal.\n\n\n\nKerry is headed to Malaysia next week to attend an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the trafficking report out of Foggy Bottom Monday sent fresh ripples of frustration through human rights groups and labor unions.\n\n\n\nAlisa Simmons, Deputy Director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, said in a statement that the \"administration knows that the TPP will have trouble in Congress, but turning a blind eye to Malaysia\u2019s grave human rights violations in order to include Malaysia in the pact because it\u2019s one of the few TPP countries we don\u2019t already have a trade deal with and keeping the TPP on Fast Track so Congress\u2019 oversight is limited is shameful.\"\n\n\n\nPhil Robertson, Deputy Director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said that Malaysia\u2019s \u201crecord on stopping trafficking is far from sufficient to justify this upgrade by Washington,\u201d and he said it is more about TPP and trade politics.\n\n\n\nShane Larson, Legislative Director of the Communications Workers of America, said that \"it shouldn't be a surprise that backers of the TPP would resort to any means possible to finish this deal.\"\n\n\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called the decision to upgrade Malaysia \u201cwrong and outrageous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe administration has had difficulty securing approval for fast-track,\u201d he said. \u201cToday's cynical upgrade of a nation where forced labor, human trafficking, and exploitation remain pervasive, undermines its promises on labor rights, human rights, and anti-corruption in trade deals and does not bode well for TPP passage.\u201d\n\n\n\n",
