The lawmakers said they would block any effort to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat same day the Republican-controlled House continued hearings on a bill that would do just that. Rep. Noel Torpey, R-Independence, is sponsoring a bill that would expand Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level as called for under the ACA. Torpey\u2019s bill also contains a number of reform provisions typically favored by conservatives, like some work requirements.\n\nAs Republicans continue to battle within their majority on how to handle expansion, most groups lobbying for the expansion have taken to leaving financial discussions to hospitals and healthcare providers. Groups like Missouri Health Care for All came to Torpey\u2019s hearing with witnesses that would benefit from expansion.\n\nJeri Smith Landon and Jamie Kanan both fall into the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d left by states that have not expanded Medicaid. Both women make too much qualify for current Medicaid eligibility and too little to afford insurance through the ACA exchanges. Individuals that fell into the donut hole would be covered if Medicaid eligibility were to expand.\n\n\u201cI always hear [lawmakers] talk about the people who sit around and do nothing and get Medicaid,\u201d Kanan said. \u201cBut what about me? I work full time in home health care and I work an extra job as well and I have five kids. I\u2019m not just sitting around, I\u2019m working.\u201d\n\nKanan has five children and was the victim of an abusive relationship. As the result of injuries received from her ex-husband, Kanan has chronic back pain and leg numbness. She says it is getting worse, but only surgery can fix the problem, surgery she can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cI have head trauma too, a lot, from being hit so many times,\u201d Kanan said. \u201cI know I need to see a neurologist but I can\u2019t afford it, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if it gets worse.\u201d\n\nKanan is the Washington County low-income representative for the East Missouri Action Agency, works at the Mineral Points Lions Club and chairs the Mineral Point Back to School program. She says she\u2019s been told she could apply for disability but that she doesn\u2019t want to at 29.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be disabled, I want to get better.\u201d\n\nLandon, from Camden County, has a similar tale. Landon lives with her husband who recently became disabled, her disabled adult daughter and her adopted 17-year-old grandson. Landon says her income situation is so dire that she no longer takes high-cholesterol medication recommended by her doctor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $38 a month and I truly can\u2019t afford that,\u201d Landon said. \u201cThat\u2019s money that feeds my family. That money being spent literally means less food for us.\u201d\n\nLandon\u2019s grandson, whose parents died, suffers from severe trauma associated with their death. He was able to visit a psychiatrist under Medicaid, but fears that at 19, he\u2019ll no longer have that option. Landon fears the worst. Ironically, Landon\u2019s work involves caring for the disabled, and she is paid through Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that uncertainty that is so hard; it just weighs on you,\u201d Landon said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. And if anything happens, anything, there\u2019s nothing for us to count on. We\u2019re just out in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nLandon and Kanan, along with Missouri Healthcare for All, visited fence-sitting lawmakers throughout the day. According to Executive Director Jen Bersdale, the first senator the group visited cried.\n\n\u201cIf these lawmakers want to stand up and say they won\u2019t do this, then I think they least they can do is look these women in the eye and say why,\u201d Bersdale said. \u201cThere\u2019s a solution out there to give these people healthcare. If they don\u2019t like it, then what\u2019s the alternative plan? What\u2019s your plan if not this?\u201d\n\nIf a combination reform and expansion bill could survive the conservative Republican House \u2014 far from guaranteed \u2014 it would face it\u2019s greatest uphill battle in the Senate. The upper chamber\u2019s interim committee on Medicaid concluded that no expansion would even be considered until sweeping reforms were passed. It\u2019s unclear whether Torpey\u2019s bill would mollify some of Medicaid expansion\u2019s biggest opponents.\n\nBersdale\u2019s group brought more than 2,100 testimonial forms favoring expansion. Landon and Kanan both said they felt lawmakers were respectful and even sympathetic to their testimony. Torpey\u2019s bill has not yet been voted on in committee, and even more testimony and discussion is expected.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 On Monday, five state senators took the floor to re-iterate\u00a0 their opposition to Medicaid expansion.
