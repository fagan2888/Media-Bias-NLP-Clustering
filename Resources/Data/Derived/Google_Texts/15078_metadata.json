She didn\u2019t tweet at all from Dec. 6 to Jan. 16. Even in February, she sent only four tweets.\n\nBut noticeably over the past week, she has been quick to publish her thoughts on a pertinent topic through the medium. On Monday and Tuesday alone, in fact, she posted more tweets than she did all of last month.\n\nA week ago, as controversy about her email habits continued to fester, she criticized Senate Republicans for signing onto a letter sent to Iran\u2019s leadership, directly blasting those \u201cconsidering running for commander-in-chief\u201d:\n\nGOP letter to Iranian clerics undermines American leadership. No one considering running for commander-in-chief should be signing on. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2015\n\nOn Monday, she weighed in on the Senate fight over a human-trafficking bill that has been held up because of abortion-related language, the inclusion of which caught Democrats off guard. She also blasted Republican leaders for holding up a confirmation vote on Loretta Lynch, the nominee for attorney general:\n\nCongressional trifecta against women today: 1) Blocking great nominee, 1st African American woman AG, for longer than any AG in 30 years\u2026 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 16, 2015\n\n\u20262) Playing politics with trafficking victims\u2026 3) Threatening women's health & rights. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 16, 2015\n\nAnd on Wednesday, she addressed the release of the House Republican budget. She previewed some general attack lines\u2026\n\nBudgets reflect our priorities. They should help families get ahead, educate our kids, and spark small business growth. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2015\n\nOur nation's future \u2013 jobs & economic growth \u2013 depends on investments made today. The GOP budget fails Americans on these principles. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2015\n\n\u2026Singled out her criticism of the cuts to Pell grants included in the budget:\n\nMaking college more affordable is an investment in our kids and economic growth. Cuts to Pell Grants hold our kids back. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2015\n\n\u2026And gave a hint of how she\u2019ll defend the Affordable Care Act on the trail:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Hillary Clinton has been tweeting up a storm (and tweet-storming) lately, wading more into the political topic du jour as she gears up for an expected run for president in 2016.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Hillary Clinton has been tweeting up a storm (and tweet-storming) lately, wading more into the political topic du jour as she gears up for an expected run for president in 2016.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Is Tweeting Up a Storm All of a Sudden", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/105798/hillary-clinton-twitter-campaign/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150318-hills-twtr.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton has been tweeting up a storm (and tweet-storming) lately, wading more into the political topic du jour as she gears up for an expected run for president in 2016.", "title": "Hillary Clinton is tweeting up a storm all of a sudden", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/105798/hillary-clinton-twitter-campaign/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150318-hills-twtr.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "Politics,Elections,Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca174\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2015\u2026And gave a hint of how she\u2019ll defend the Affordable Care Act on the trail:\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 16, 2015And on Wednesday, she addressed the release of the House Republican budget.\nHillary Clinton has been tweeting up a storm (and tweet-storming) lately, wading more into the political topic du jour as she gears up for an expected run for president in 2016.\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 18, 2015Our nation's future \u2013 jobs & economic growth \u2013 depends on investments made today.\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2015On Monday, she weighed in on the Senate fight over a human-trafficking bill that has been held up because of abortion-related language, the inclusion of which caught Democrats off guard."}
