Millions of Americans rely on Form W-2 for critical information in completing their annual tax filings. But ADP's survey shows that according to employers awareness among the millions of U.S. employees who will receive the new Form 1095-C is very low.\n\nTo learn more about these forms and how to effectively communicate with employees concerning IRS Form 1095-C, visit ADP's Form 1095-C Guide for Employers.\n\nIn fact, 83 percent of midsized employers and 57 percent of large employers don't think their employees clearly understand the forms or how they may be related to their 2015 tax filing obligations. And, only 20 percent of midsized businesses and 32 percent of large organizations have started communicating with their workforce about the new form and the implications it carries.\n\n\"Form 1095-C requires data from systems ranging from payroll, HR, leave of absence and benefits, well as specific codes based on each employee's situation, to be completed accurately in compliance with the Affordable Care Act,\" said Saliterman. \"Many employers in our study indicated they plan to prepare their Forms 1095-C internally. Since their HR systems are often not linked this will most likely prove to be a significant challenge. Other employers are choosing to enlist an outside partner such as ADP for help.\"\n\nAccording to ADP's study, more than half of midsized businesses (52 percent) and 45 percent of large employers are unsure if they're at risk of violating ACA compliance requirements this year. Nearly one in five employers think they are at risk of not complying with Form 1095-C requirements. Visit the ADP@Work blog post to find out more and view an infographic of the findings.\n\nA lack of preparation to manage these new forms can lead to a large volume of calls for assistance to HR departments, potential financial penalties and employees not submitting their 2015 taxes accurately.\n\nForm 1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage, includes identifying information for the employee and employer, and the employer's offer of health coverage (if any). Form 1094-C is the Employer Transmittal to IRS and summarizes information contained in the 1095-C.\n\nFor legislative updates and their impact on employers, please visit Preparing for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reporting: What Employers Need to Know and subscribe to receive email alerts.\n\nAbout ADP ( NASDAQ : ADP )\n\nPowerful technology plus a human touch.
