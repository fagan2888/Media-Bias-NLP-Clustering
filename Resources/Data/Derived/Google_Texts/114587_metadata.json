Really, it was not much different from his former home digs at Lakewood High School.\n\nFootball was a dusty game back then, the one-platoon era in which Romig truly starred as a linebacker. And in football\u2019s family tree, Romig, who is still considered one of the toughest hombres ever to put on shoulder pads in this state, is not far removed from Stanford tailback Christian McCaffrey.\n\nSaturday in New York, McCaffrey finished second in the Heisman Trophy race as college football\u2019s best player in 2015. His record-breaking sophomore season, which includes 3,496 all-purpose yards, set McCaffrey apart.\n\nIt put the former Valor Christian star in elite Colorado company, right next to Romig. McCaffrey is only the fifth Colorado high school product to finish in the top 10 in Heisman voting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted McCaffrey is up for it,\u201d Romig said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. And a Colorado guy. And he\u2019s a great student.\u201d\n\nCU\u2019s Byron \u201cWhizzer\u201d White, from now-defunct Wellington High School northeast of Fort Collins, finished second in the Heisman race in 1937 and Romig was sixth in 1961. White, like Romig a Rhodes scholar, was runner-up to Yale star Clint Frank.\n\nRomig trailed Heisman winner Ernie Davis of Syracuse. Davis topped Ohio State\u2019s Bob Ferguson in one of the closest votes in Heisman history.\n\nFor Romig, it all came as a surprise. \u201cI thought if things went well, I\u2019d make the starting lineup (at CU) as a senior,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I would get that kind of attention.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey\u2019s rocket rise to the Heisman presentation ceremony in New York was equally sudden. National observers started pegging him as a dark-horse candidate in October. By November, he had wrestled attention. Last weekend, playing in the Pac-12 championship game against USC, his 461 all-purpose yards included 207 rushing. He ran for a touchdown, threw a TD pass and had a TD reception against the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what the season was going to hold,\u201d McCaffrey told reporters Friday in New York. \u201cI just try to put my head down and focus each and every day by doing my job. To be here right now is extremely special. I\u2019m honored.\u201d\n\nIn the past 40 years, only three others from Colorado figured highly for the Heisman. Terry Miller, a tailback from Mitchell High School in Colorado Springs, was a two-time Heisman finalist with Oklahoma State, finishing fourth in 1976 and second in 1977. He fell short of Pitt\u2019s Tony Dorsett in 1976 and Texas\u2019 Earl Campbell in 1977.\n\nKansas State QB Collin Klein, from Loveland High, carried the Wildcats in 2012 and finished third in the Heisman voting. Texas A&M\u2019s Johnny Manziel won it that year.\n\nMcCaffrey entered Colorado football lore in high school when he set the state record for career touchdowns with 141. He went a step further with his Heisman run.\n\n\u201cI was teasing him; one day he\u2019s going to be the governor,\u201d Stanford coach David Shaw said in November after McCaffrey led the Cardinal to a 42-10 rout of CU.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Christian McCaffrey joins elite club of Colorado Heisman hopefuls", "title": "Christian McCaffrey joins elite club of Colorado Heisman hopefuls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/christian-mccaffrey-joins-elite-club-of-colorado-heisman-hopefuls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151207_040211_christian-mccaffrey-1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151207_040211_christian-mccaffrey-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T20:12:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:37:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19d6\"", "article_summary": "McCaffrey is only the fifth Colorado high school product to finish in the top 10 in Heisman voting.\nSaturday in New York, McCaffrey finished second in the Heisman Trophy race as college football\u2019s best player in 2015.\nMcCaffrey entered Colorado football lore in high school when he set the state record for career touchdowns with 141.\nReally, it was not much different from his former home digs at Lakewood High School.\nIt put the former Valor Christian star in elite Colorado company, right next to Romig."}
