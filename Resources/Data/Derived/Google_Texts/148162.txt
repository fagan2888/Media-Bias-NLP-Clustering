And I'm not even talking about Hillary's big re-launch. Those millionaires are crunchy ice cream magnates Ben and Jerry, who hail from Sanders' home state of Vermont, so I'm trolling a bit. But this is all technically accurate:

SANDERS: … If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent.



HARWOOD: When you think about 90 percent, you don’t think that’s obviously too high?



SANDERS: No. That’s not 90 percent of your income, you know? That’s the marginal. I’m sure you have some really right-wing nut types, but I’m not sure that every very wealthy person feels that it’s the worst thing in the world for them to pay more in taxes, to be honest with you. I think you’ve got a lot of millionaires saying, “You know what? I’ve made a whole lot of money. I don’t want to see kids go hungry in America. Yeah, I’ll pay my fair share.”

“When you hustle money like that, you don’t sit in restaurants like this, you sit in restaurants like where you are spending hundreds of dollars for dinner...That’s the world that you are accustomed to and that’s the worldview that you adopt…that kind of wealth can, you know, has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.”
