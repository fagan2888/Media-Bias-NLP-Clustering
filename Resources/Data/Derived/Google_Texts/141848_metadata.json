Maybe no one likes or takes y\u2019all seriously because no one can see past your egotistical [expletive]. Some people might just look past it, but fair warning I am not one. All lives matter, that has always been the case, and you part of the problem if you think other wise [sic].\u201d\n\nMs. Faz\u2019s post soon went viral, and prompted some black students who considered her comment a threat, to respond on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSomebody should\u2019ve warned this #EmilyFaz chick \u2026 dont come for Black GSU unless we send for you,\u201d one GSU student tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe gotta find this Emil Faz,\u201d another user tweeted.\n\nThe same user later called for Ms. Faz\u2019s expulsion tweeting, \u201cLol let the football team go on strike and they\u2019ll expel #EmilyFaz before midnight.\u201d\n\n\u201c#EmilyFaz getting police escorts for being RACIST and black people got 0 positive attention from cops at mizzou #whiteprivilege,\u201d another user tweeted.\n\nAnother student urged activists to call the restaurant where Ms. Faz was employed about her post.\n\n\u201cWanna have a word with the manage at Wild Wings Cafe about Emily Faz, here you go (912) 681-9453,\u201d the student tweeted.\n\nAccording to Everything Georgia, Ms. Faz lost her job.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, one day after Ms. Faz wrote her original post, Jean Bartels, GSU\u2019s interim president, said some of the speech circulating over the past 24 hours (including the original post) \u201chas resulted in a call for disciplinary action against the speaker.\u201d\n\nShe said GSU takes threats very seriously and \u201cwill not tolerate behavior that is in violation with our Student Code of Conduct,\u201d but she added that the school is a public institution and as such is \u201cnot permitted to restrict speech that is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nFollowing Ms. Faz\u2019s post, the GSU NAACP staged a \u201cBlack Out, Walk Out\u201d on Tuesday and issued demands to the school. Those demands included hiring more black professors and expanding the African Studies program.\n\nNAACP 2nd Vice President Jamar Boyd said the walkout wasn\u2019t a direct response to the post, but it was about starting an important conversation.\n\n\u201cThis is not necessarily in response to the comments the young lady made its to show that the black student population does matter,\u201d Mr. Boyd told a local ABC affiliate.\n\nKeyAnna Tate, a participant in the walk out, told the Statesboro Herald that the line between freedom of speech and threatening speech has become more blurred for white people.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to know the difference between freedom of speech and a threat, and it seems like when it comes from a white student at this school, that sometimes the line is being blurred because of who it comes from,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A student at Georgia Southern University was reportedly fired from her job after dozens of her classmates called to complain about a Facebook post she wrote criticizing some protesters at the University of Missouri and Black Lives Matter activists.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A student at Georgia Southern University was reportedly fired from her job after dozens of her classmates called to complain about a Facebook post she wrote criticizing some protesters at the University of Missouri and Black Lives Matter activists.", "title": "Emily Faz, Georgia student, fired from her job after criticizing Mizzou, Black Lives Matter online", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/19/emily-faz-georgia-student-fired-from-her-job-after/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/19/EMILY.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/19/EMILY.jpg", "description": "A student at Georgia Southern University was reportedly fired from her job after dozens of her classmates called to complain about a Facebook post she wrote criticizing some protesters at the Universi", "card": "summary", "title": "Emily Faz, Georgia student, fired from her job after criticizing Mizzo"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Georgia Southern University, Emily Faz"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSomebody should\u2019ve warned this #EmilyFaz chick \u2026 dont come for Black GSU unless we send for you,\u201d one GSU student tweeted.\nShe continued, \u201cThe whole black lives matter movement is misguided and out of hand.\nMs. Faz shared the story on Facebook and wrote above the link, \u201cI swear if I see this B.S.\nAccording to Everything Georgia, Ms. Faz lost her job.\nA student at Georgia Southern University was reportedly fired from her job after dozens of her classmates called to complain about a Facebook post she wrote criticizing some protesters at the University of Missouri and Black Lives Matter activists."}
