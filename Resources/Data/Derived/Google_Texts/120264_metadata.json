The fact-checking website Politifact gave the health-insurer claim the 2013 \u201clie of the year\u201d award.\n\nClinton Library\n\nAlso scribbled in the notes were mentions of the administration\u2019s support for the individual mandate, which requires Americans to buy insurance or pay a penalty if they don\u2019t. \u201cOnly way to achieve [universal health care] is via mandates,\u201d the Clinton staffer wrote. \u201cNot because our idea; or because we\u2019re stubborn but because it\u2019s good for ordinary working people.\u201d A page later, the staffer wrote: \u201cWe\u2019re against doing this via taxes.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the health-care law is constitutional because the individual mandate can be considered a tax. Mr. Obama has since maintained that it isn\u2019t a tax, and his administration vehemently refuted that notion in the lead-up to the law\u2019s passage.\n\nAlso written on the sheet is: \u201cFreedom to choose doctor, plan.\u201d\n\nDocuments outlining the administration\u2019s media strategy for selling the health care bill in the summer of 1994 showed their primary targets were Congress and \u201cWashington elite/media.\u201d \u201cOf secondary importance is touching a broader, national audience on choice and quality,\u201d read one document detailing media appearances for the administration in the following week.\n\nThe Clinton health plan ultimately died in Congress in late 1994.\n\nThe documents were part of a trove of documents from the Clinton administration released by the William J. Clinton Library this week. Unlike past document releases, these were not posted online. The notes were part of a folder containing the documents of Noa Meyer, a speechwriter for then-first lady Hillary Clinton, but the author of the notes is not clearly identified.\n\nMs. Meyer\u2019s records also contained notes from a 1995 meeting with Democratic pollster Celinda Lake that identified the president and first lady\u2019s demographic strengths and weaknesses. Mr. Clinton was \u201cvery popular with women,\u201d a staffer wrote. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, was popular with college-educated and older Americans, as well as those below the age of 30. Her point of weakness was among Americans aged 30-60 who had not graduated from college, the staffer wrote. The meeting focused on how to sell the administration\u2019s initiatives, including universal health care, to the public.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Notes from a 1994 meeting of Clinton administration officials reveal that some of the language and phrases they mulled for selling their universal health care plan were similar to the words the Obama administration employed nearly two decades later.", "title": "Clinton-Era Memo: \u2018If You Like Blue Cross, You Can Keep Your Blue Cross\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/04/10/clinton-era-memo-if-you-like-your-blue-cross-you-can-keep-your-blue-cross/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HV271_Clinto_P_20150410131505.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Clinton-Era Memo: \u2018If You Like Blue Cross, You Can Keep Your Blue Cross\u2019", "description": "Notes from a 1994 meeting of Clinton administration officials reveal that some of the language and phrases they mulled for selling their universal health care plan were similar to the words the Obama administration employed nearly two decades later.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Notes from a 1994 meeting of Clinton administration officials reveal that some of the language and phrases they mulled for selling their universal health care plan were similar to the words the Obama administration employed nearly two decades later.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-10T17:19:20-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/04/10/clinton-era-memo-if-you-like-your-blue-cross-you-can-keep-your-blue-cross/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-54442", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Notes from a 1994 meeting of Clinton administration officials reveal that some of the language and phrases they mulled for selling their universal health care plan were similar to the words the Obama administration employed nearly two decades later.", "title": "Clinton-Era Memo: \u2018If You Like Blue Cross, You Can Keep Your Blue Cross\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/04/10/clinton-era-memo-if-you-like-your-blue-cross-you-can-keep-your-blue-cross/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HV271_Clinto_P_20150410131505.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-54442", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-10T17:21:30-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a26\"", "article_summary": "The meeting focused on how to sell the administration\u2019s initiatives, including universal health care, to the public.\nHer point of weakness was among Americans aged 30-60 who had not graduated from college, the staffer wrote.\nThe documents were part of a trove of documents from the Clinton administration released by the William J.
