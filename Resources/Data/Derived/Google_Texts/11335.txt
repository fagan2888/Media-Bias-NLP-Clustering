Parkland Memorial Hospital, the main medical provider for uninsured Dallas County residents, kicked off private insurance enrollment for its patients Tuesday under the federal Affordable Care Act.

At an afternoon rally, hospital officials announced that dozens of Parkland employees had been trained to guide patients who want to sign up for private health insurance.

By 2 p.m., about 30 patients had completed the process.

Nearly 200 patients, however, found that they did not qualify for insurance coverage because their incomes fell below the federal poverty level. While they would have qualified for an expanded Medicaid program, Texas officials have refused to participate in that effort.

Parkland estimated that 180,000 of its low-income patients would qualify for Medicaid if the Texas program were allowed to grow. An additional 50,000 patients will qualify for private insurance coverage, many using tax credits to cover a portion of their monthly premium costs.

“It’s a great day,” said Sharon Phillips, Parkland’s interim chief operating officer for ambulatory and behavioral health.

County Judge Clay Jenkins also called the start of the six-month-long enrollment effort an “historic day.”

“This is about real people getting real help for real problems,” he said during the hour-long informational session at the hospital.

Phillips said Parkland has set up a phone bank and computer terminals to assist patients who want to explore their insurance options. The county hospital has trained more than 40 application counselors to answer questions about the new law.

“We will guide them and help them select the plan and program that is right for them,” she said. “It gives me goose bumps.”
