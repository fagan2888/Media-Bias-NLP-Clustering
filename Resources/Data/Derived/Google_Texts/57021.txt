PARMA, OH-– A house decorated for Halloween is getting a lot of attention, but not all of it is good.

Vicki Barrett tells FOX8, “This is the third year that we’ve done it, but for some reason this year we’re getting a lot of media over it.”

The display includes dummies covered in blood, wrapped in bags, impaled by posts, and crucified.

Some people think the display is too much, especially since the Barrett home is just down the street from an Elementary school.

Neighbors say if they don’t take it down, they should at least tone it down.

City officials say the display is not breaking any laws, and is considered protected under “freedom of expression.”

Barrett says said not taking it down, “When we put up the display, I don’t think we even considered that there was a school there.” She said. “I think as parents, if my kids were going to that school or if I was someone in the neighborhood, I would just teach my children that this is a Halloween display and I thought other parents would have done the same.”
