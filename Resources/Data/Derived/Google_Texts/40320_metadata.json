UN Security Council reaches Syrian arms resolution\n\nOn Thursday, the United Nations Security Council agreed on a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons. Compromising to attain the support of Russia, the final version did not include automatic penalties, such as military action or economic sanctions, if Syria fails to comply, nor does it ascribe specific blame for the Aug. 21 attack that asphyxiated hundreds of Syrians near Damascus. Nevertheless, the resolution marks the most important diplomatic initiative to date over the Syrian civil war. In another landmark act of diplomacy at the UN on Thursday, high-level officials from the United States and Iran sat down together to talk for the first time in more than 30 years.
