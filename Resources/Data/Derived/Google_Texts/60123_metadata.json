We have Godwin\u2019s Law (as an online discussion goes on, the probability of a Nazi comparison approaches 1) and its corollaries (the first person to make a Hitler comparison in an argument should automatically lose it), but no one enforces them. Nazi comparisons don\u2019t automatically end the discussion. They just embolden you to make more Nazi comparisons.\n\nOnline and off, everyone\u2019s a Nazi, so no one\u2019s a Nazi. We have grammar Nazis and soup Nazis. Nazis show up in our Broadway musicals as a matter of course (\u201cCabaret,\u201d \u201cThe Producers,\u201d and, of course, \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d because nothing says \u201cChristmas\u201d like \u201cNazis.\u201d) We can\u2019t even agree on killing Baby Hitler.\n\nThe reason Nazi analogies are so tempting is that everyone can agree the Nazis were bad. They were a unique historical evil with very few shades of gray. This is what makes them so perfect to invoke in arguments. Nazi: bad. Fascist: bad. On this we can agree, regardless of how the rest of the argument was going. If you are acting like the Nazis, you are definitely on the wrong side of history.\n\nBut this loses force when you wheel them out for every argument, as Kurt Eichenwald noted back in 2014. You know who else imposed gun control? HITLER. (Ben Carson) You know what the fight against Obamacare is like? Like fighting the NAZIS! (Ted Cruz, Ted Nugent). Political correctness? \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany. . . . We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d (Ben Carson, again.)\n\nBut last week the Internet found itself in the position of the boy who cried wolf. Accustomed, in the course of comments-sections arguments, to comparing anyone with whom we disagree to Hitler (\u201cYou know who ELSE didn\u2019t think \u2018Hello\u2019 was the GREATEST VIDEO OF ALL TIME?\u201d), we are now without a way of indicating that someone is actually advocating policies embraced by the Nazi regime.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, this Muslim registry you said you supported is an actual Nazi policy,\u201d we say. But everyone who hears just shrugs, even Trump.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d they say, \u201cright there with putting Oxford commas at the end of sentences.\u201d\n\nWhen reporters tried to press this point with Trump of how this would DIFFER from Nazi Germany, he replied. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump retweeted fake statistics from Neonazis! Actual neo-Nazis!\n\nSo now what do we do? What analogies are we left with? All our reckless flouting of Godwin\u2019s Law means that we now have no way of indicating when something is literally a Nazi policy. \u201cLiterally\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much these days, either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We should have listened to Godwin's Law.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alexandra-Petri/142169029150103", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "We should have listened to Godwin's Law.", "title": "We have a \u2018Nazi\u2019 analogy problem", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/11/23/we-have-a-nazi-analogy-problem/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/22/National-Enterprise/Images/RTRA2U0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@petridishes"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/11/23/we-have-a-nazi-analogy-problem/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "nazis; nazi comparisons; nazi trump; donald trump; donald trump muslim registry; nazi inflation; adolf hitler; hitler;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alexandra-Petri/142169029150103"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "nazis; nazi comparisons; nazi trump; donald trump; donald trump muslim registry; nazi inflation; adolf hitler; hitler;"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Man In The High Castle.\u201d (David Berg/Amazon)We have a Nazi analogy problem.\nOnline and off, everyone\u2019s a Nazi, so no one\u2019s a Nazi.\nThe reason Nazi analogies are so tempting is that everyone can agree the Nazis were bad.\n\u201cDonald Trump, this Muslim registry you said you supported is an actual Nazi policy,\u201d we say.\n\u201cNazi,\u201d in an argument, doesn\u2019t buy quite as much as it used to."}
