It is an extraordinary opportunity to support the growth of the Native American student community, while learning about our nation\u2019s robust indigenous heritage and its contemporary expression. And several times each day, the audience will be welcomed to the circle for the All Nations dance.\n\nRooted in traditional Native cultures, Dance for Mother Earth was founded by a small group of University of Michigan Native American students and community members to celebrate and honor the sacred relationships between the people and the planet.\n\nThe planning for the event was led by U of M\u2019s Native American Student Association (NASA) in collaboration with university administrators and backing from local pow wow veterans. The 2015 pow wow provides a uniquely valuable opportunity for NASA to collaborate with the Native American Student Organization at Eastern Michigan University.\n\nThe head staff expected to attend, includes:\n\nHead Veteran: George Martin\n\nMaster of Ceremonies: Jason Whitehouse\n\nArena Director: Dave Shananaquet\n\nHead Drum Judge: Wesley Cleland\n\nHead Male Dance Judge: Robert J Smith\n\nHead Female Dance Judge: Netawn Kiogima\n\nHead Male Dancers: Russel Harjo, Zack Antoine-Jackson, TBD\n\nHead Female Dancers: Leya Hale, Alexis Syrette, TBD\n\nDrums in Attendance\n\nHost: Wisconsin Dells (Prairie Du Sac, Wisconsin)\n\nCo-Host: Crazy Spirit (Mt.
