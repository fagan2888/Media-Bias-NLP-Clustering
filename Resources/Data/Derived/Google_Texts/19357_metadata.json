Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined 44 Democrats and 1 independent in opposing the measure. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, did not vote.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have blocked some 61 previous Republican attempts aimed at rolling back the landmark 2010 legislation designed to provide health care for millions of uninsured Americans. Senate Democrats have enough votes to shoot down a veto override, meaning that the vote was largely symbolic.\n\nBut the vote also lays the groundwork for repealing Obamacare should the GOP take the presidential election next year, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are carefully constructing a legislative strategy, based on Senate rules and precedents, to make it easier to unravel the health law in 2017 if a Republican wins the White House,\u201d the website reported. \u201cUnder the special rules of reconciliation, the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian has to determine whether each provision complies with the Senate\u2019s rules. Those rulings are based in part on precedent. So once the parliamentarian determines that this legislation complies, it makes it hard to argue that a similar repeal bid doesn\u2019t in January 2017 \u2013 when a new president might sign it into law.\u201d\n\nThe medical device tax, a 2.3% levy on all U.S. sales of prescribed medical devices, went into effect at the start of 2013. But the medtech tax has been a target since it was 1st proposed as part of the ACA back in 2009, and a number of measures in both the House and Senate that would repeal it have been introduced on Capitol Hill over the years.\n\nIn June, 46 Democrats joined the vote to approve H.R. 160, the \u201cProtect Medical Innovation Act of 2015; last month, the House passed the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which included the Protect Medical Innovation Act\u2019s provision to eliminate the levy.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s corresponding repeal bid, sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is S. 149 or the \u201cMedical Device Access & Innovation Protection Act.\u201d The Hatch measure has 39 co-sponsors, including Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Ben Casey of Pennsylvania, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken.\n\nA pair of Democrat-led bills would also repeal the tax, but unlike the Hatch and Paulsen measures, those bills would replace the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes for the energy industry.\n\nA bill by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), S. 844 or the \u201cNo Taxation on Device Innovation Act,\u201d has no co-sponsors. Its counterpart in the House, H.R. 1533 or the \u201cMedical Device Tax Elimination Act\u201d sponsored by Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.), has 10 co-sponsors, all Democrats.\n\nMaterial from Reuters was used in this report.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "description": "The U.S. Senate yesterday passed a bill that would gut key provisions of the Affordable Care Act and do away with the medical device tax, but the measure faces certain death as soon as it hits President Barack Obama\u2019s desk.
