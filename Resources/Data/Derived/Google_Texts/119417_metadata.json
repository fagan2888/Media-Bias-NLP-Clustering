It\u2019s a logical bet given the rise of younger employees in the workforce, many of whom demand well-designed apps that are both functional and easy to use.\n\nThe company is pushing a message of simplification at all levels of the business, and has acknowledged a need to improve the user experience. Now the question remains whether that push will give SAP a legitimate competitive advantage against newer and more nimble startups.\n\nSteven Norton / WSJ Pat Bakey, SAP\u2019s global GM for retail\n\nThe company has been around for a long time, and \u201cevery year we get a lot older,\u201d says Pat Bakey, global general manager for SAP Retail. \u201cSo we\u2019re very aggressively pursuing Millennial hires across all dimensions of our business.\u201d Bringing in younger talent can help the firm spot new technology trends, build apps using the latest development tools and sell to customers in new ways.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is we deal with C-suites, and they don\u2019t like to see a 23-year-old coming in and telling them how to run things,\u201d Mr. Bakey says. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different business, and it\u2019s the high end of the spectrum.\u201d To prepare new recruits, SAP runs a specialized training program to \u201cget them as smart as possible on this complex business of ours and mentor them and turn them loose.\u201d\n\nMr. Bakey says building deeper relationships with the developer community underscores SAP\u2019s understanding that it needs to focus not just on applications, but also supporting its broader platform and ecosystem. In the retail sector specifically, SAP is working with more than 200 startups focused on how to build apps using SAP\u2019s HANA platform.\n\nA longstanding gripe for SAP customers is that while the software does what it is supposed to do, the user experience is less than stellar. In February, the company\u2019s chairman and co-founder Hasso Plattner said the firm has \u201cto be a little more like Google.\u201d As one CIO noted, SAP may also benefit from taking a page out of Apple Inc.\u2019s design book.\n\nCEO Bill McDermott acknowledged as much when he spoke with CIO Journal in June. \u201cIf you can take beautiful business software and make it easy to consume on a device like an iPad, you can change the game.\u201d\n\nUsability isn\u2019t an issue to be downplayed. Last year, Avon Products pulled the plug on a $125 million software system rollout after a test of the system in Canada drove away representatives the company relied on to drive sales.\n\nSAP should be given credit for its strong push to change its culture, and its significant foothold in the marketplace will give it an advantage, said Robert Hetu, an analyst at Gartner Inc. who covers retail. Still, the company must overcome its reputation for being an end-to-end solution with a somewhat cumbersome implementation. \u201cRetailers are less concerned about buying everything from SAP or Oracle, and more interested in best of breed,\u201d he said. \u201cSAP is going to have to prove they\u2019ve got the same level of capability and quick development and being really cutting edge and being leaders in some of these specific sectors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "SAP is hiring more Millennials and deepening ties with startups as part of its push to simplify its offerings and address concerns about usability, the business software giant\u2019s global retail chief tells CIO Journal.", "title": "SAP\u2019s \u2018More Like Google\u2019 Campaign Leads to Millennials, Startups", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/08/06/saps-more-like-google-campaign-leads-to-millennials-startups/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DZ835_0806_c_P_20140806182952.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "SAP\u2019s \u2018More Like Google\u2019 Campaign Leads to Millennials, Startups", "description": "SAP is hiring more Millennials and deepening ties with startups as part of its push to simplify its offerings and address concerns about usability, the business software giant\u2019s global retail chief tells CIO Journal.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Norton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
