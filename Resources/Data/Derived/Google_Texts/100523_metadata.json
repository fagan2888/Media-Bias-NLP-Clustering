Nov. 22 at the Marriott Marquis. A black-tie audience of more than 1,000, which included more than 300 financial reporters, enjoyed not only the show and a night of networking but an after-party in the hotel\u2019s duplex penthouse hosted by Vapor Corp., marketer of nicotine-delivering electronic cigarets, cigars and hookah sticks.\n\nRetired New York Times financial reporter and former NYFWA president Leonard Sloane performs in the 'Follies.'\n\n\n\nPhoto: Steve Govoni Contributing to the joyous atmosphere is that the stock market is at an all-time high as measured by both the Dow Jones and Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. About half of the well-dressed gathering were women, some in floor-length gowns. The \u201cFollies\u201d night was for males only during its early years. The 14-member chorus serenaded Bezos as follows: \u201cOh my God this dweeb is brilliant He\u2019s worth 27 billion Even though he\u2019s crocodilian We just wanna be Jeff Bezos\u201d The tune of \u201cSea Cruise\u201d was used for Cruz: \u201cCome on, sailors, let\u2019s make some news Defund Obamacare, the socialist ooze Now hop on board, lose your Tea Party blues Won\u2019t ya let me take you on a Ted Cruise?\u201d Bloomberg Ribbed About Bikes, Sodas Bloomberg took a ribbing for providing thousands of bikes to city residents, defending stop-and-frisk, and trying to eliminate 20-ounce sodas. The chorus sang, to the tune of \u201cThank You Herbert Hoover\u201d from \u201cAnnie\u201d: \u201cToday the city is a dandy Today the real estate\u2019s a steal Today we\u2019re flying down the bike lanes It\u2019s damn near ideal We used to smoke with wild abandon We\u2019d chug a 20-ounce or four We used to care about the homeless We don\u2019t any more\u201d SAC Capital Advisors, headed by Steven Cohen, which paid $1.2 billion in fines in November on insider trading charges, was one of the targets. Chorus sang, to the tune of \u201cJet Song\u201d from West Side Story: \u201cWhen you\u2019re with SAC, you\u2019re with SAC all the way From your first inside trade to your last dying day When you\u2019re with Steven A. Cohen\u2019s hedge fund\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t take any risks, the deal always gets done\u201d 50-Year-Man Sloane Honored Leonard Sloane, retired New York Times financial reporter and former NYFWA president, was honored for being a \u201cFollies\u201d cast member for 50 years.
