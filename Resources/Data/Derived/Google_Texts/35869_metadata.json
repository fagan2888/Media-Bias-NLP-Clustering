John Kasich\u2019s budget plan released Monday reasserts his commitment to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and the resulting new federal spending.\n\nWith enrollment climbing every month, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost federal taxpayers more than $2.1 billion in its first year. The expansion has cost so much more than Kasich projected that an appropriation to pay for it through June 30 will likely run out this month.\n\nEven if Obamacare\u2019s federal Medicaid expansion funding is not cut, state taxpayers will be on the hook for 10 percent of benefit costs by 2020 \u2014 not an inconsequential sum with claims already exceeding $300 million per month.\n\nUnless overturned by the Ohio General Assembly, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion will likely cost more than $7 billion during the next two fiscal years.\n\nMedicaid is the largest program in the Republican governor\u2019s \u201cBlueprint for a New Ohio\u201d executive budget for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Kasich is calling for $55.6 billion in Medicaid spending from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2017.\n\nAssuming 100 percent of Medicaid expansion benefits are paid for by the federal government through 2016 as Obamacare promises, any cost-cutting measures in Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program through Dec. 31, 2016 will have to target traditional Medicaid recipients.\n\nSeveral proposals included in Kasich\u2019s budget do just that, undermining the governor\u2019s claims he embraced the Obamacare expansion out of concern for Ohio\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nOhio women with income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line are currently eligible for Medicaid if they are pregnant or need breast or cervical cancer treatments. Kasich\u2019s budget calls for cutting off this coverage at 138 percent of the poverty line, the ceiling for the Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cCurrently, individuals in these groups are eligible for Medicaid up to 200 percent of poverty, but those levels were set when the federal exchange did not exist and the only alternative to Medicaid was to be uninsured,\u201d a budget document from the governor\u2019s office explains.\n\nThis recommendation comes despite Kasich\u2019s insistence his Obamacare expansion, which covers no children and no pregnant women, has reduced infant mortality.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich\u2019s proposed budget makes welfare for able-bodied adults a higher priority than care for the truly needy,\u201d Jonathan Ingram, research director at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s already pushed tens of thousands of children and adults with developmental disabilities on Medicaid waiting lists to the back of the line to make room for his ObamaCare expansion. He\u2019s already targeted pediatric hospitals for funding cuts,\u201d Ingram continued.\n\n\u201cNow he\u2019s proposing to eliminate coverage for some groups of pregnant women and women receiving treatment for breast or cervical cancer,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cWhen the ObamaCare bill comes due, who else will he put on the chopping block?\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s budget plan also reduces spending by cutting Medicaid managed care payments to the lowest rate permitted by the federal government. Nearly 80 percent of Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries are covered by a managed care plan.\n\nAccess to care is a problem for Medicaid recipients because the program\u2019s reimbursement rates are so low. A 2014 survey found 40 percent of doctors in the Ohio State Medical Association planned to see fewer Medicaid patients when a temporary reimbursement increase expired at the end of the year.\n\nThe governor\u2019s budget includes slight increases to primary care, pediatric physician and dentist payment rates, but pays for these increases by reimbursing doctors at lower Medicaid rates for patients enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nKasich unilaterally expanded Medicaid in 2013 after line-item vetoing the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s prohibition of the Obamacare expansion. Kasich then pressed the quasi-legislative Ohio Controlling Board to appropriate $2.56 billion in Obamacare money, warning the Ohio Medicaid program would go bankrupt without it.\n\nBased on 2014 expenditures, the first 18 months of Obamacare expansion benefits will cost at least $1 billion more than Kasich anticipated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
