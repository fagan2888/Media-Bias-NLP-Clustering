You can use that on any plan,\u201d says Pollitz, adding that you could then take that tax credit and buy a bronze plan, which in some cases might drive the premium of a bronze plan down to zero.\n\n\u201cOr you could spend it on a benchmark silver plan, in which case you would pay exactly the amount that you are required to pay under the premium sliding scale schedule.\u201d\n\nThe tax credit can also go toward signing up for a more expensive plan.\n\nAnother option: Apply it to a more expensive gold or platinum plan, and then you\u2019d pay the difference between the premium and the tax credit, according to Pollitz.\n\nUnder the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act, every marketplace health plan must offer the same basic services, no matter the metal tier. The biggest difference between a bronze, silver, gold or platinum plan, says Pollitz, is \u201chow much more you\u2019re going to pay at the pump.\u201d\n\nOn average, providers of a platinum plan pay 90% of your insurance costs, gold pays 80%, silver 70% and bronze 60%. That leaves the insured to pay the remaining percentage of the costs.\n\n\u201cGenerally, bronze plans will have lower premiums, but if you do end up in the emergency room or get sick, you\u2019re going to pay a lot more of the bill yourself before the insurance starts to pay,\u201d Pollitz explains.\n\nThis is because the lower monthly premiums of the bronze plan are paired with the highest out-of-pocket costs of any of the metal levels offered through the marketplace.\n\nConversely, the platinum plan has the highest premiums but lowest out-of-pocket costs, which include deductibles, copays and coinsurance.\n\n\u201cThe tiers really just designate different levels of cost sharing,\u201d Pollitz says.\n\nWhen it comes to picking a metal level, the majority of New Yorkers settle on a silver plan, which has a moderate premium and moderate out-of-pocket costs. The mid-range expenses associated with a silver plan make it perennially appealing; however, its popularity most likely has to do with the fact that it\u2019s where the most financial aid options are found.\n\nLast year, nearly three-quarters of people enrolled in the marketplace plans qualifed for financial assistance. (Zoonar RF/Getty Images/Zoonar RF)\n\n\u201cA reason why a lot of people will look at the silver plans,\u201d says Pollitz, \u201cis because those are the plans where you can find the cost-sharing subsidies.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the premium tax credit, people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty line are eligible for cost-sharing reductions, which reduce out-of-pocket costs and lower the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n\u201cTo get those,\u201d Pollitz says, \u201cyou need to go to New York State of Health and fill out your income information. If you qualify, you can get a silver plan \u2014 it\u2019ll still be called silver; it\u2019ll cost what a silver plan costs, but it will be modified to be more comprehensive. Depending on your income, it might be as comprehensive as a gold policy or even a platinum policy.\u201d\n\nThe Essential Plan, a new health coverage option being introduced in New York State for 2016, will replace two of the three cost-sharing reduction plans previously offered through the Marketplace.\n\nNew Yorkers whose annual household income is 138% to 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible to apply for the Essential Plan, which offers the same basic coverage as any other plan in the marketplace.\n\nEssential Plan enrollees, however, will not have to pay a deductible and their monthly premium will either be $0 or $20 depending on their income. Plan participants will also receive free preventative care services.\n\nEnrollment in an Essential Plan is ongoing, but the deadline for open enrollment in all other plans is Jan. 31 for coverage in 2016.\n\nFor more information about insurance options or for help enrolling in a Marketplace health plan, visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Jordan Galloway", "twitter": {"description": "The majority of New Yorkers enrolled in the state's marketplace health plan qualify for financial assistance.", "title": "Many New Yorkers qualify for aid in marketplace health care", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-yorkers-qualify-aid-marketplace-health-care-article-1.2491803", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491801.1452471136!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/female-doctor-examining-x-ray-image-young-couple.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "new york state of health, department of health, state marketplace healthcare, healthcare financial assistance ny state,", "parsely-author": "Jordan Galloway", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "new york state of health, department of health, state marketplace healthcare, healthcare financial assistance ny state,", "nydn_tags": "new york public health", "news_keywords": "new york state of health, department of health, state marketplace healthcare, healthcare financial assistance ny state,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-yorkers-qualify-aid-marketplace-health-care-article-1.2491803", "parsely-title": "Many New Yorkers qualify for aid in marketplace health care", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-10T19:36:13-0500", "sailthru.title": "Many New Yorkers qualify for aid in marketplace health care", "nydn_section": "Health", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-11T00:36:13", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491801.1452471136!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/female-doctor-examining-x-ray-image-young-couple.jpg", "description": "The majority of New Yorkers enrolled in the state's marketplace health plan qualify for financial assistance.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The majority of New Yorkers enrolled in the state's marketplace health plan qualify for financial assistance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Health", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The majority of New Yorkers enrolled in the state's marketplace health plan qualify for financial assistance.", "title": "Many New Yorkers qualify for aid in marketplace health care", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-yorkers-qualify-aid-marketplace-health-care-article-1.2491803", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491801.1452471136!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/female-doctor-examining-x-ray-image-young-couple.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "new york public health", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Jordan Galloway", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491801.1452471136!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/female-doctor-examining-x-ray-image-young-couple.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act, every marketplace health plan must offer the same basic services, no matter the metal tier.\nIf you qualify, you can get a silver plan \u2014 it\u2019ll still be called silver; it\u2019ll cost what a silver plan costs, but it will be modified to be more comprehensive.\nFor more information about insurance options or for help enrolling in a Marketplace health plan, visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov.\nLast year, New Yorkers received an average tax credit of $220, and that number is projected to increase in 2016, according to the Department of Health.\nThe mid-range expenses associated with a silver plan make it perennially appealing; however, its popularity most likely has to do with the fact that it\u2019s where the most financial aid options are found."}
