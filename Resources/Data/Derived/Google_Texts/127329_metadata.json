Good morning, I\u2019m Clay Masters. Co-Opportunity Health - the Iowa health insurer set up with federal loans under the Affordable Care Act may soon be liquidated. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have extended 146 million dollars since it was set up but did NOT extend them money they were expecting\u2026. Now the state has taken it over. Iowa\u2019s Senior US Senator Republican Chuck Grassley wants to know more and he\u2019s with me from his office in Washington. Good morning, Sen. Grassley.\n\nCG: Good morning, I\u2019m glad to be with you. And my involvement is this as a member of the Senate finance committee and jurisdiction over this program which is part of the healthcare reform act I want to know how our taxpayer\u2019s money is being handled. In this particular case we loan money that\u2019s never going to get back. Not the fault of Co-Opportunity. But the fault of CMS probably not following through until this organization was mature\n\nCM: In a written statement from a CMS spokesman to Iowa Public Radio\u2026 the explanation they provide is that the total funding requests from these co-ops in the fall exceeded the amounts of funds available to make loan awards. So \u2013 limited funding \u2013 they said they prioritized\u2026 and Iowa wasn\u2019t one of them. That explanation is not sufficient?\n\nCG: It\u2019s funny\u2026 first of all you\u2019ve gotten some language from CMS that I have not. I have not had an answer to my letter yet. I\u2019m a little surprised they would give you some information that they don\u2019t give me. But let me suggest this in answer to your question that it\u2019s not satisfactory because this is a beginning organization and I\u2019ve seen CMS and HHS divert a lot of money from one part of healthcare reform to another and I wouldn\u2019t take that explanation as a satisfactory expiation for me.\n\nCM: Now these co-ops were set up to create competition in places where there wasn\u2019t much. Early on many thought Wellmark would sign up to be a part of the exchange. Do you think things would have played out differently had the pool been spread out more?\n\nCG: The answer is yes.\n\nCM: Are you hoping to take this further \u2013 hold congressional hearings once you get an answer from them?\n\nCG: Well, It depends on what that answer is and it also depends upon what Chairman Hatch who took over chairmanship for me because I\u2019m chairman of the judiciary committee, what he would decide to do. But my policy when I was chairman of finance or any chairmanship is hearings are always a last resort but they\u2019re also a shotgun behind the door, so that if you don\u2019t get the cooperation you want from your letters and from every phone calls and every other way you try to get information from the administration. Yes, I would suggest hearings to Senator Hatch. But right now I\u2019m going to reserve judgment\n\nNow you didn\u2019t ask me but let me say the purpose of our interest in this doesn\u2019t deal just with Co-Opportunity because I think it\u2019s fair to assume that there\u2019s no Co-Opportunity anymore. But there\u2019s 30 to 35 other co-ops around the country and these co-ops including Co-Opportunity got loans from the federal government to get started. And those loans were going to be repaid. So our interest is how is CMS handling this with Co-Opportunity so that we know that we don\u2019t run into the same situation with the other 30 to 35 co-ops around the country because we were to run into the same situation with them that we do with Co-Opportunity then there\u2019s no chance of ever getting the loans paid back. In other words the loans are based upon the cash flow of the co-ops and that\u2019s how we get the taxpayer\u2019s money back. So I\u2019m interested preserving the records with Co-Opportunity. I\u2019m asking the state of Iowa, asking CMS to preserve the records so we can find out what went wrong with Co-Opportunity. Because they thought they were going to get some further help from the department. They didn\u2019t get it. They go under. We lose the taxpayer\u2019s money. We\u2019re interested to find out what went wrong to make sure the thing doesn\u2019t go wrong with the other co-ops and so we get our money back.\n\nCM: Taking a step back and looking at more \u201cbig picture\u201d items within the Affordable Care Act \u2013 what do you think will happen the Supreme Court Case that could potentially invalidate tax credits in three dozen states where the feds run the program?\n\nCG: Well, I\u2019m going to talk in what common sense would tell me. I\u2019m not sure that the Supreme Court uses just common sense. But it\u2019s very clear the way the language was written that exchanges that were federal in a state, and that\u2019s about I don\u2019t know 35 states or so I think, that the subsidy does not go to federal exchanges, just to states that set up their exchange. And that was very intentional by the Democrats that wrote Obamacare. They thought it would force states to set up state exchanges. So it seems to me the clear reading of the law is that the subsidy does not go, not only does it affect the subsidy but it affects the individual mandate. So you ask me what happens if the Supreme Court as I suggest that they should rule it opens up for negotiations between the president and the Congress how you\u2019re going to take care of the subsidy for the states that have exchanges and what else other changes should be made to Obamacare because even the president has made very clear that Obamacare isn\u2019t the perfect piece of legislation that he thought it was because he\u2019s made 38 changes in it by executive order. Some of them probably illegal or unconstitutional. But probably some of them he had the authority to do.\n\nCM: So with the new Republican majority congress what do you see as some of the key things to do in chipping away at the Affordable Care Act?\n\nCG: Well, it\u2019s a case of going back to what was our intent when it was written and passed even for those of us that voted against it. Some of these changes the president made like delaying the corporate mandate for two years as an example. The law clearly said it was supposed to go into effect January 1st 2014 \u2013 he delayed it. Those are changes that need to be made.\n\nWe should review the individual mandate as well. Because this is the first time in the history of the country that the federal government said, I\u2019m saying federal government not state government because it\u2019s different in the case of state government, this is the first time that the federal government has said you gotta buy something. They may\u2019ve always said there\u2019s things you can\u2019t do but this is the first time they\u2019ve said you gotta do something you maybe don\u2019t want to do.\n\nCM: Do you think it should be repealed?\n\nCG: We\u2019re going to vote for repeal but the president\u2019s going to veto it. So we\u2019re not going to pass it over his veto so there\u2019s not going to be any repeal of it. But we\u2019re going to vote to repeal because that\u2019s what we promised the people in the election. And if you win an election you ought to carry out your promises. So then you get back to the more realistic things that can be done if the president agrees that some changes need to be made and we feel when the subsidy for federal exchanges goes away under court decision then that\u2019s an opportunity to make these changes. Hopefully our intention is to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\nCM: Senator Chuck Grassley. Thanks as always for talking with us this morning.\n\nCG: Yeah, thank you very much.
