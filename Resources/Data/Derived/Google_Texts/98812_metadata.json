And in 2,043 of those cases \u2014 91 percent of the time \u2014 they succeeded. There are about 700,000 people on the watch-list \u2014 a point that civil libertarians have made to underscore that many on the list may be family members or acquaintances of people with potential terrorist connections.\n\nNot a single gun buyer on the terror watch list was turned away because they posed a threat to America as a suspected terrorist. Instead, reasons for their rejections included \u201cfelony conviction, under indictment, adjudicated mental health, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence conviction, fugitive from justice and controlled substance abuse,\u201d according to the GAO. In fact, in 2013 and 2014, the number of successful gun buyers from the terror watch list rose to 94 percent \u2014 with 455 suspects purchasing firearms and just 30 being denied.\n\nOf course, the NRA has forcefully opposed any legislation to close this loophole since 2007, citing \u201ca concern that the FBI might watchlist a person as a \u2018suspected terrorist\u2019 on dubious grounds.\u201d Granted, 700,000 does appear to be a rather inflated amount of suspected terrorists living among us, but as the Post notes, even a full 71 percent of NRA members support prohibiting people on the terror watchlist from buying guns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government has no authority to block firearm sales to terror suspects and the NRA wants to keep it that way VIDEO", "title": "NRA fail: More than 2,000 people on terror watch list have legally purchased guns in the last 10 years", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The government has no authority to block firearm sales to terror suspects and the NRA wants to keep it that way VIDEO", "title": "NRA fail: More than 2,000 people on terror watch list have legally purchased guns in the last 10 years", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/18/nra_fail_more_than_2000_people_on_terror_watch_list_have_legally_purchased_guns_in_the_last_10_years/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/wayne_lapierre_guns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The government has no authority to block firearm sales to terror suspects and the NRA wants to keep it that way VIDEO", "title": "NRA fail: More than 2,000 people on terror watch list have legally purchased guns in the last 10 years", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/wayne_lapierre_guns.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, FBI, GAO, Gun Control, Guns, Paris Attacks, Second Amendment, terror watch list, Terrorism, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b97\"", "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, FBI, GAO, Gun Control, Guns, Paris Attacks, Second Amendment, terror watch list, Terrorism, Video, News, Politics NewsWell, wouldn\u2019t you know it?\nNot a single gun buyer on the terror watch list was turned away because they posed a threat to America as a suspected terrorist.\nIn fact, in 2013 and 2014, the number of successful gun buyers from the terror watch list rose to 94 percent \u2014 with 455 suspects purchasing firearms and just 30 being denied.\nThe Washington Post highlighted the findings of the GAO\u2019s March report in light of Friday\u2019s terror attacks in Paris:Between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists attempted to purchase guns from American dealers at least 2,233 times.\n\u201cMembership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law,\u201d according to the Government Accountability Office and now a report from the federal agency finds that over 2,000 individuals on the FBI\u2019s terrorist watch list have indeed successfully and legally purchased a firearm from 2004 to 2014."}
