Paul LePage and his allies in the Legislature have repeatedly opposed expansion as a handout to \u201cable-bodied\u201d people who\u2019d rather get government assistance than work. Now that they have evidence that their intransigence is affecting some of the state\u2019s biggest employers, they should re-think their position and support expansion as a way to keep Maine\u2019s health systems healthy.\n\nThe layoffs at the Franklin health system \u2014 which runs Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington \u2014 are part of a cost-reduction plan that includes the elimination of 40 full-time positions. Chief Financial Officer Wayne Bennett explained in the Morning Sentinel this week how the failure to expand Medicaid has cost the system money. For one thing, it\u2019s caused a slight rise in the number of uninsured patients who need charity care. For another, it\u2019s driving up the number of people who don\u2019t seek care at all, reducing the number of patients the system would see.\n\nFranklin and other Maine hospitals are also losing out on Medicare revenue because of the rejection of Medicaid expansion. That\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act assumes that states will approve expansion, providing hospitals with more paying patients and reducing charity care expenses. This is supposed to protect the facilities from the costs of Medicare reimbursement cuts, which are also part of the law.\n\nOperating under the ACA without Medicaid expansion is \u201cclearly a factor (in) the financial hardships of hospitals,\u201d Maine Hospital Association lobbyist Jeff Austin told the Sentinel, noting that about 40 percent of hospitals in Maine are currently operating at a deficit.\n\nHealth care facilities in other states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid \u2014 such as Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee \u2014 have also had to lay off staff or even close their doors. This is what happens when lawmakers decide health-related issues purely on their political merits.\n\nMaine state Sen. Tom Saviello, a Republican whose district includes the Farmington area, sponsored expansion legislation this session, but it never made it to a vote. He plans to reintroduce the bill next session \u2014 which should give expansion\u2019s critics in Augusta time to study the mounting evidence against their stance and come down on the side of what\u2019s best for their constituents and those who care for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Failure to expand MaineCare was one factor in the loss of jobs at Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Failure to expand MaineCare was one factor in the loss of jobs at Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington.", "title": "Our Opinion: Expansion rejection hurting Maine hospitals - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/514061_163703-20160503-franklin-2.jpg", "height": 459}, "updated_time": "2016-05-05T18:24:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2016/05/06/our-opinion-expansion-rejection-hurting-maine-hospitals/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/514061_163703-20160503-franklin-2.jpg", "description": "Failure to expand MaineCare was one factor in the loss of jobs at Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Our Opinion: Expansion rejection hurting Maine hospitals - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2016-05-06T04:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T18:24:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Franklin and other Maine hospitals are also losing out on Medicare revenue because of the rejection of Medicaid expansion.\nOperating under the ACA without Medicaid expansion is \u201cclearly a factor (in) the financial hardships of hospitals,\u201d Maine Hospital Association lobbyist Jeff Austin told the Sentinel, noting that about 40 percent of hospitals in Maine are currently operating at a deficit.\nThat\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act assumes that states will approve expansion, providing hospitals with more paying patients and reducing charity care expenses.\nThe layoffs at the Franklin health system \u2014 which runs Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington \u2014 are part of a cost-reduction plan that includes the elimination of 40 full-time positions.\nMaine state Sen.
