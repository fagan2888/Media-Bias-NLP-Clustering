But Democrats and the White House say they do not want to respond to the shutdown in a piecemeal, service-by-service fashion.\n\nA defiant House Speaker John Boehner has insisted that President Obama must negotiate on changes to the Affordable Care Act and spending cuts if he wants to end the shutdown and avert a default.\n\nSource: APTN", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"player": {"width": 560, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/player.swf?keepEmbedCode=true&autoplay=1&embedCode=RrbzBqZjqNo_FsAYmYX5wfp09Y1Tx--a&adSetCode=b20883587d124da4a8f29205f8be38ea", "height": 315}, "image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02695/obama_2695328a.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "player"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Home;World_News;North_America;USA;News_Video;Barack_Obama;US_Politics_Video;US_Politics", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/barackobama", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Video", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "US government shutdown: This is no way to do business, Obama tells Republicans", "section-id": 4411, "GSAGenre": "barackobama", "tmgads.pagetype": "video", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-barackobama", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/barackobama", "GSAArticleType": "Video", "article-id": 10362378, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "US President Barack Obama speaks out on the continuing government shutdown \n  during an unannounced visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n  headquarters.", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-07", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-barack_obama", "last-modified": "2013-10-07", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "video", "section": "World", "wordcount": 256, "embedcount": 0, "tag": "US Politics", "subsection": "Barack Obama", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 6, "imagecount": 0, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10362378, "tmgads.articleid": 10362378, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "US President Barack Obama speaks out on the continuing government shutdown   during an unannounced visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency   headquarters.", "title": "US government shutdown: This is no way to do business, Obama tells Republicans", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10362378/US-government-shutdown-This-is-no-way-to-do-business-Obama-tells-Republicans.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02695/obama_2695328a.jpg", "type": "video.other"}, "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"US government shutdown: This is no way to do business, Obama tells Republicans \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10362378/US-government-shutdown-This-is-no-way-to-do-business-Obama-tells-Republicans.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02695/obama_2695328a.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10362378\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-07T20:26:13Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"TMG\"],\"tags\": [\"Video\",\"Home\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"News Video\",\"Barack Obama\",\"US Politics Video\",\"US Politics\"]}", "tmgads.videosrc": "tmg", "DCSext.Genre": "barackobama", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.barackobama", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-07 21:26"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4c5\"", "article_summary": "But Democrats and the White House say they do not want to respond to the shutdown in a piecemeal, service-by-service fashion.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representativies last week passed legislation that would continue to direct money to FEMA during the shutdown.\n\"That's no way of doing business,\" he said during a speech at the agency.\nTo prepare for the storm, FEMA recalled 200 workers who had been sent home on unpaid leave last week following Congress' failure to reach an agreement over the federal budget.\nMr Obama said that now that the storm has weakened, at least 100 of those workers will have to return to what is known as furloughed status."}
