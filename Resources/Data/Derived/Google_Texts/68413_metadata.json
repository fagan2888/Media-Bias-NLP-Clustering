They will replace the NJASK in grades 3-8 and HSPA in high school.\n\nRight out of the gate, the new test has become the target of the powerful New Jersey Education Association, which has launched what has to be an expensive media blitz that says the exam will divert valuable teaching time to preparing for the test, siphon off resources and put more stress on already frazzled children.\n\nThe anti-PARCC sentiment also has been amplified by some parents who are opting not to have their children take the required tests that will be administered on computers instead of with the traditional paper and No. 2 pencils.\n\nOne parent who took the practice version of the test complained that it was too difficult for her let alone for her third-grader.\n\nAll this negative feedback is reminiscent of the debut of the website for the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare in 2014, when a series of glitches made the launch a nightmare.\n\nSome state lawmakers now want to put the PARCC exams on hold. Last week, the Assembly passed a bill that would put a moratorium on using the results of the tests to make decisions affecting students and teachers, including student placement and teacher evaluation. The legislation still awaits action in the Senate.\n\nDespite all the angst the new exam has generated, there is a definite need for a way to measure student and teacher performance. A standardized test would also indicate how well tax dollars are being invested in our school districts.\n\nThere has been a chorus of supporters for the new online exams. They say the tests focus more on critical thinking rather than rote learning of facts. It also would be a factor in the evaluation of teachers, much to the chagrin of the NJEA.\n\nNo testing system is perfect, and PARCC has its problems, but it should be given a chance.\n\nPrinceton Superintendent Stephen Cochrane put it all in perspective in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \"Good instruction leads to good test results. We don't emphasize test prep. We emphasize critical thinking and good writing, and that leads to good results on PARCC or any assessment.\"\n\n\n\nFollow The Times of Trenton on Twitter @TimesofTrenton.
