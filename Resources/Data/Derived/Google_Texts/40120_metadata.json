On a recent sunny weekday afternoon, she was trying to figure out if she still qualifies for Medicaid coverage.\n\nShe had been eligible since the federal Affordable Care Act launched last year. But her Medicaid coverage came through the nonprofit Kentucky Health Cooperative, which announced this month that it will close.\n\n\u201cHopefully, I will qualify for Medicaid again,\u201d she said.\n\nNazarenko isn\u2019t alone. There are about 51,000 people in Kentucky who are also insured under Kentucky Health Cooperative who will now have to find other options.\n\nOpen enrollment for 2016 begins Sunday.\n\nThe co-op and others like it across the U.S. found themselves in a difficult position: offering affordable options to consumers on one end, and not getting the federal support their leaders had anticipated on the other. The Kentucky Health Cooperative drew many high-risk consumers, leading to higher claims, said Carrie Banahan, executive director of Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange, Kynect.\n\n\u201cThey were really the lowest-cost option on Kynect in 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated Story Health Plan Closure Not Unique To Kentucky\n\nThese smaller insurance providers can\u2019t afford to stay in business for long if they\u2019re operating at a loss, said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cThese co-ops or sort of start-up insurance companies, they don\u2019t have a lot of capital to work with, so as an insurance company they\u2019re less able to withstand losing a lot of money in one year,\u201d Cox said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Kentucky co-op requested its second straight rate increase of more than 20 percent. The co-op expected to receive $77 million from the federal government to cover financial losses from insuring higher-than-average usage among members. But the government awards loans to co-ops based on the ability to become financially viable, and it gave Kentucky Health Cooperative only about 12 percent of what the company expected.\n\nHence the shutdown.\n\nSeveral other co-ops have or are planning to shutdown, in states ranging from Louisiana to New York to Utah. But people insured through providers that close should be able to switch to a comparable plan for about the same cost, Cox said.\n\n\u201cIf you had one of the lowest-cost plans last year and you\u2019re willing to switch into whatever the lower-cost plans are in 2016 then \u2014 assuming everything else in your family and income is the same \u2014 you\u2019d probably pay about the same that you did in 2015,\u201d Cox said.\n\nNazarenko is a waitress and part-time English teacher. Without Medicaid coverage, she couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, she said.\n\nAt Heine Brothers\u2019, Nazarenko hit a wall while looking online for another insurance plan. She decides to call Kynect\u2019s help center. The rep tells Nazarenko she\u2019ll be insured through the end of the year under her current plan, via Humana Caresource. She should be able to maintain her coverage through Medicaid in 2016, she is told.\n\nThe rep also tells her she will receive a letter in the mail when it\u2019s almost time to re-enroll. Nazarenko is relieved.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to hear that they\u2019re going to let me know for sure when I need to reapply and that Medicaid at least isn\u2019t affected,\u201d Nazarenko said.\n\nLast week, the Kentucky Department of Insurance filed a petition to place Kentucky Health Cooperative into rehabilitation. This means the department will oversee daily operations of the health insurance company to protect providers and consumers like Nazarenko.\n\nKentuckians who\u2019ll be looking for new insurance on Kynect starting Sunday will need to select a new plan by Dec. 15 to secure a Jan. 1, 2016, effective date, Banahan said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be plenty of choices on Kynect,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might find more affordable options through Kynect, and I would just recommend that they just look at their options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Julia Nazarenko sat outside Heine Brothers' Coffee, peering into her laptop screen and trying to figure out if she still qualifies for Medicaid.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Julia Nazarenko sat outside Heine Brothers' Coffee, peering into her laptop screen and trying to figure out if she still qualifies for Medicaid.", "title": "After Co-Op Closure, One Kentuckian's Health Care Search", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1735, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151022_152428-e1446231414943.jpg", "height": 588}, "updated_time": "2015-11-02T09:24:27-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/looking-for-health-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Julia Nazarenko sat outside Heine Brothers' Coffee, peering into her laptop screen and trying to figure out if she still qualifies for Medicaid.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151022_152428-e1446231414943.jpg", "title": "After Co-Op Closure, One Kentuckian's Health Care Search", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-11-01T07:55:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T09:24:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Kentucky Health Cooperative drew many high-risk consumers, leading to higher claims, said Carrie Banahan, executive director of Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange, Kynect.\nThere are about 51,000 people in Kentucky who are also insured under Kentucky Health Cooperative who will now have to find other options.\nBut her Medicaid coverage came through the nonprofit Kentucky Health Cooperative, which announced this month that it will close.\nLast week, the Kentucky Department of Insurance filed a petition to place Kentucky Health Cooperative into rehabilitation.\nThis means the department will oversee daily operations of the health insurance company to protect providers and consumers like Nazarenko."}
