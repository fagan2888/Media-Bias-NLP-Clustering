[It] was validated using data from multiple controlled studies in people.\"\n\nIf you want to calculate your calorie and weight loss goals, head over to the website and plug in your information \u2014 the planner will guide you every step of the way. And if you're a little more experienced, there's even a detailed Expert Mode.\n\nAs an example, a 25-year-old, 5'5\" woman weighing 150 pounds who leads a moderately active lifestyle would need to add some light running to her exercise regimen and reduce her diet to a little over 2,000 calories in order to reach her goal weight of 132 pounds in half a year.\n\nOK, that was certainly a lot to take in. We'd encourage you to give the planner a try yourself \u2014 there are quite a few knobs and gears to turn. Now, there are a lot of calorie and fitness trackers \u2014 with plenty of knobs and gears \u2014 on the market. So what makes this one any different?\n\nTIME points out the Body Weight Planner is unique because of its detailed calculations. \"Adding in a routine of light running isn't the same as starting intense swimming, and in a distinctive feature, the calculator doesn\u2019t weigh all physical activity equally.\"\n\nThe planner actually asks how, when and what kind of exercise you'll incorporate into your daily life to reach your goal weight, all while giving you a timeline for that goal \u2014 180 days for our aforementioned example.\n\nAfter you've figured out your calorie count and exercise plan, the site encourages you to sign up for the USDA's SuperTracker. SuperTracker gives you a detailed meal plan and help you stay on track with your physical activity goals.\n\nA USDA executive explains how the two work together: \"The NIH Body Weight Planner helps consumers make a plan to reach their goals on their timeline, and SuperTracker helps them achieve it.\"\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, more than two-thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. Tools like the USDA's SuperTracker and the NIH's Body Weight Planner can help us achieve, and then maintain, a healthy weight.
