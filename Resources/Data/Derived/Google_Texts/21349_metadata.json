Seeking an boost of $30 million, the BBG\u2019s budget soared to $751.5 million.\n\nThat was, evidently, not enough money. President Obama\u2019s newly proposed budget for fiscal year 2017 proposes another massive increase in spending for the BBG. If granted, the agency will receive nearly $778 million, a roughly $27 million increase.\n\nThat sum is even more surprising given that the US repeatedly accuses Russia of spending vast sums on a \u201cpropaganda war\u201d against the West through news outlets like RT and Sputnik. Yet the BBG\u2019s budget is approximately twice that of Russia\u2019s foreign media budget.\n\nMIA Rossiya Segodnya, the parent company of Sputnik News, operates on a budget of $75 million, including both domestic and foreign media \u2014 10 times less than the BBG.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nRT, a publicly-funded, autonomous non-profit organization whose popularity is incomparable to VOA and Radio Free Europe, has an annual budget of slightly more than $300 million. That money \u2014 also significantly less than the sum allocated to the BBG \u2014 is used operate a number of satellite TV channels in multiple languages, a much costlier endeavor than the radio programs produced by the BBG\u2019s outlets.\n\nTaken together, both RT and Rossiya Segodnya\u2019s budgets are a far cry from the BBG\u2019s coffers, and while the agency claims to pursue objective journalism, this is hardly the case.\n\n\u201c[The BBG wants] to promote points of view that conform to American foreign and domestic policy,\u201d political cartoonist Ted Rall told Sputnik.\n\n\u201cObjectivity does not exist in journalism. It\u2019s impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cThe best that a viewer, listener or reader can hope for when she or he consumes journalism is to understand the bias or biases of the relevant news outlet so that she or he can consider that point of view while consuming the news.\u201d\n\nThe BBG, it seems, is especially unconcerned with objectivity. Last March, US Assistant Secretary of European Affairs Victoria Nuland told Congress that the BBG was specifically committing $23.2 million to \u201cRussian-language programming,\u201d adding that \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s pervasive propaganda campaign is poisoning minds across Russia, Russia\u2019s periphery, and across Europe.\u201d\n\nThe real reason for the budget increase has less to do with concerns of objectivity, and is actually about Washington\u2019s concern that channels like RT are actually doing their job effectively, presenting audiences with a viewpoint that challenges those presented by the mainstream press.\n\nDespite its relatively meager budget, RT has an international audience of millions. In the US alone, 2.8 million people in major cities watch RT weekly, according to 2014 Neilsen ratings. In the United Kingdom, RT viewership tops American behemoth Fox News. Across the Middle East, RT Arabic is watched by 6.7 million people every day.\n\nWith that kind of reach, it should come as no surprise that the US government is concerned enough to beef up its foreign media arm. Last April, Helle Dale, Senior Fellow for Public Diplomacy at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out that Voice of America ranks 3,828 in Russia, while RT ranks 61.\n\n\u201c[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]\u2019s presence and reputation in Russia, it must be added, took a beating in 2012,\u201d Dale admitted, citing poor management and the lack of qualified journalists. She also noted that RT is \u201cflourishing.\u201d\n\nThis lack of popularity could be directly proportional to its credibility.\n\n\u201cIf the topic is something embarrassing to the United States, such as Julian Assange or Edward Snowden,\u201d Rall told Sputnik, \u201cI would trust Russian media more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Western governments routinely sound the alarm over Russian \"propaganda.\" But President Obama\u2019s new budget calls for a drastic increase in spending to America\u2019s own foreign media arm, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which already spends millions more than its Russian counterpart., Broadcasting Board of Governors, propaganda, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, Voice of America,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sputnik News", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Western governments routinely sound the alarm over Russian \"propaganda.\" But President Obama\u2019s new budget calls for a drastic increase in spending to America\u2019s own foreign media arm, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which already spends millions more than its Russian counterpart., Broadcasting Board of Governors, propaganda, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, Voice of America,", "title": "US Seeks Massive Expansion To Propaganda Budget", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/213693-2/213693/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Salvage_Scrap_propaganda_poster_crop2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-12T16:20:54-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Western governments routinely sound the alarm over Russian \"propaganda.\" But President Obama\u2019s new budget calls for a drastic increase in spending to America\u2019s own foreign media arm, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which already spends millions more than its Russian counterpart., Broadcasting Board of Governors, propaganda, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, Voice of America,", "title": "US Seeks Massive Expansion To Propaganda Budget", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Salvage_Scrap_propaganda_poster_crop2.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Voice of America", "published_time": "2016-02-13T05:00:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T16:20:54-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Yet the BBG\u2019s budget is approximately twice that of Russia\u2019s foreign media budget.\nUS Seeks Massive Expansion To Propaganda BudgetWestern governments routinely sound the alarm over Russian \"propaganda.\"\nSeeking an boost of $30 million, the BBG\u2019s budget soared to $751.5 million.\nDespite its relatively meager budget, RT has an international audience of millions.\nIf granted, the agency will receive nearly $778 million, a roughly $27 million increase."}
