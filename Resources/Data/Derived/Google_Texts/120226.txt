When my son fell ill at school in January of 2015, I was awestruck to learn that his school, Bruce Drysdale Elementary School in Hendersonville, had an on-site School Based Health Clinic (SBHC). The SBHCs Physicianâ€™s Assistant called to alert me he was unwell, and requested permission to evaluate him and subsequently treat him, if needed. I happily agreed. Until then, I had only a vague memory of submitting health insurance information to the school, but did not read the accompanying information about the SBHC being available to him. When I received the insurance co-pay bill from the SBHC, I happily submitted.

There are four SBHCs in Henderson County Schools that serve children during school hours. The premise of SBHCs in Henderson County, and other SBHCs across the US, is to provide ready access to quality healthcare to children, thereby eliminating any barriers or delay of treatment. SBHCs provide a range of services and are typically supported by a combination of private donations and various government agencies, funds and grants. While implementation of Affordable Care Act [P.L. 111-148] will help SBHCs funding, financial challenges will continue. Therefore, public awareness of SBHCs is key to their establishment and continuity.
