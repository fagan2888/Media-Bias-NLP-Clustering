All had lived in the Granite Bay area.\n\nFrom 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday, patrons made donations while the establishment contributed all revenue generated during those hours to support the cause.\n\nFamilies of all three victims were present.\n\nThe event, promoted by Chick-fil-A employees and on Facebook, garnered hundreds of customers, as drive-through and cash register lines wrapped around the establishment and throughout the shopping center parking lot.\n\nLocal businesses have agreed to make donations, with at least one agreeing to match the amount generated by the fundraiser.\n\nGage Bergstrom, shift manager at Chick-fil-A, had followed and reported a 2006 Chrysler 300, the driver of which was later found to be 24-year-old Roseville resident Aaron Jordon Caudillo.\n\nBergstrom called to report Caudillo as a suspected drunken driver. The California Highway Patrol has stated that police suspect that drugs and/or alcohol were involved, but no test results have been made public. Caudillo was hospitalized after the accident with major injuries.\n\n\u201cI came in the next day and said, \u2018We need to do this (fundraiser),\u2019 mostly because I reported the driver,\u201d Bergstrom said. \u201cI saw them that night before it happened, and I saw the accident after it happened. \u2026 It was a weird day.\u201d\n\nNearly every staff member at the Granite Bay Chick-fil-A location had known Azar. Several had met Langham through her sister, who also worked for Chick-fil-A.\n\n\u201cMy friendship was with Matt Azar, because he used to work here,\u201d said Timmy James, kitchen director. \u201cI knew him really well and able to get to know him more outside of work, too. Kendra I had met a few times from her sister.\u201d\n\nJames said that each of the families had spoken with Chick-fil-A staff members, expressing that they \u201creally appreciated\u201d them organizing the fundraiser.\n\n\u201cWe had to get permission from all three families first,\u201d Bergstrom explained. \u201cWe called each family. We had to hunt down Matt Azar\u2019s mom\u2019s number, but once we did that, we got it going.\u201d\n\nBergstrom said there was no trepidation on the organization\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cEach store is run by its one owner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be careful what we put Chick-fil-A\u2019s logo on. \u2026 Right now, this is a good thing. We\u2019re helping support a community family and that\u2019s what Chick-fil-A is all about, so it was no problem getting Chick-fil-A\u2019s name on it.\u201d\n\nChick-fil-A did not disclose how many patrons it served or how much money it raised, but the Roseville location on Pleasant Grove Boulevard shared numbers from a similar event with Granite Bay staff.\n\n\u201cPleasant Grove told us they did this once before and that was just for one family,\u201d Bergstrom said. \u201cThey had, in one hour, $3,000 come in; the second hour, $4,000; and one after that, $3,000.\u201d\n\nBergstrom said that a typical weekday evening hour would generate about $800 in revenue.\n\n\u201cThe event was short, but in that short period of time, so many people were able to come, see the families and pay their respects,\u201d said franchise owner Wade Roepke. \u201cIt was really, really cool to be able to see the community come out and support the families like that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
