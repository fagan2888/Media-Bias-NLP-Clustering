Only about a dozen Republicans are leaning in favor.\n\nThere's obviously a bit of hypocrisy on both sides in this affair, but I have to say that watching Republican pols and conservative pundits get on their high horses about Syria has been pretty nauseating. These are guys who mostly have never met a war they didn't like, and until a few months ago were practically baying at the moon to demand that that President Obama stop diddling around and get serious about aiding the rebels and taking out the monstrous Bashar al-Assad. But now? Butter wouldn't melt in their mouths as they talk piously about the value of multilateral support; the need to give diplomacy a chance; the perils of regional blowback; the lessons of Iraq; and the fear of escalation if Assad retaliates. You'd think they'd all just returned from a Save the Whales conference in Marin County.\n\nThere are some Republicans who are perfectly serious about their desire not to get entangled in yet another Middle Eastern conflict. But most of them couldn't care less. Obama is for it, so they're against it. It's pretty hard to take.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Obama is for it, so they're against it.", "title": "Gosh, I wonder what suddenly turned Republicans into such peaceniks?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/republicans-house-syria-against", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/elephant.630.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Gosh, I wonder what suddenly turned Republicans into such peaceniks?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/republicans-house-syria-against", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/elephant.630.jpeg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/elephant.630.jpeg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "International,Military,The+Right,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d60\"", "article_summary": "There are some Republicans who are perfectly serious about their desire not to get entangled in yet another Middle Eastern conflict.\nOnly about a dozen Republicans are leaning in favor.\nJudd Legum reports that the latest vote estimate in the House on Syria has about 200 leaning against and 50 leaning in favor.\nYou'd think they'd all just returned from a Save the Whales conference in Marin County.\nIt's pretty hard to take."}
