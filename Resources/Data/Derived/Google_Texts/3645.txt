The Halloween spirit isn't just for kids. Saturday afternoon, dogs got into the Halloween fun too.

The first "Bark-O-Ween" was at Al Helms Dog Park in Panama City.

The event was co-hosted by the Leisure Services of Panama City and the Women's Club of Panama City.

NewsChannel 7's Neysa Wilkins sang the National Anthem and Carly Hildyard was one of the emcees for the event.

And former WJHG Anchor, Joe Moore was one of the judges for the costume contest.

There were several vendors offering food, and crafts for both pets and kids.

"The people and the dogs that are out here today are wonderful. The dogs are so cute dressed up in their Halloween costumes. We even have activities out here for children because of course you got dogs, you got children, so we've planned activities for the children as well," Stephanie Cantrell, from the Women's Club of Panama City said.

Cantrell said the first Bark-O-Ween was a success and the sponsors are looking forward to doing this event again next year.
