Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked legislation aimed to reverse some of the effects of last month’s Supreme Court ruling that companies with religious objections do not have to provide contraception coverage.

The 56-43 vote fell short of the 60 needed to advance the measure. Three Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- voted yes.

The bill was aimed at reversing the Court’s high-profile Hobby Lobby ruling that closely held companies with religious objections could opt-out of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to provide female employees with contraception coverage.

Unacceptable that partisan obstruction blocked even debating my #NotMyBossBusiness Act. Coloradans deserve better than inaction. — Mark Udall (@MarkUdall) July 16, 2014
