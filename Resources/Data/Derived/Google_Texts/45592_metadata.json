The new government had been expected to seek to renegotiate some contracts.\n\nSince assuming office in May, Buhari has sought to overhaul the NNPC by removing its board of directors and appointing Kachiwu to lead the corporation. He vowed to stop rampant oil theft that has cost Nigeria billions of dollars.\n\nKachiwu\u2019s statement didn\u2019t say which contracts would be renegotiated. Shell, Agip and Chevron are some of the oil majors operating in Nigeria. Shell spokesman Precious Okolobo in Nigeria declined an offer to comment.\n\nKachikwu said some of the contracts were negotiated over 20 years ago and \u201cthey have since been overtaken by new realities in the industry.\u201d He also said that the NNPC would ensure that the review didn\u2019t create an \u201canti-investment atmosphere that may be counterproductive to the industry.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari began a three-day official visit to France on Monday at the invitation of French President Francois Hollande.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.", "title": "Nigeria Plans to Renegotiate Existing Oil-Production Contracts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/16/nigeria-plans-to-renegotiate-existing-oil-production-contracts/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Nigeria Plans to Renegotiate Existing Oil-Production Contracts", "description": "Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Obafemi Oredein", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-16T19:39:18-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/16/nigeria-plans-to-renegotiate-existing-oil-production-contracts/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-2214", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.", "title": "Nigeria Plans to Renegotiate Existing Oil-Production Contracts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/16/nigeria-plans-to-renegotiate-existing-oil-production-contracts/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-2214", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-17T16:20:04-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf0a\"", "article_summary": "The new government had been expected to seek to renegotiate some contracts.\nIBADAN, Nigeria\u2013Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.\n\u201cIn the weeks and months ahead, the corporation will be renegotiating the contracts to extract as much benefits as possible for Nigeria,\u201d said NNPC chief Ibe Kachikwu, according to a statement.\nShell, Agip and Chevron are some of the oil majors operating in Nigeria.\nHe vowed to stop rampant oil theft that has cost Nigeria billions of dollars."}
