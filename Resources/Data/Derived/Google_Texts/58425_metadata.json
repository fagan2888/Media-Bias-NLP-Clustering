Christopher Arciniegas, spokesman for the police department.\n\nOfficers Thomas Thornton, Steve Martin and Walt Sanford immediately observed several bags of heroin and a needle in plain view, Arciniegas said.\n\nThe officers administered first aid and deployed Narcan, also known by its generic name naloxone.\n\nWithin five minutes, the woman regained consciousness and was transported to an area hospital by the Great Bay Regional Ambulance Service for further treatment, Arciniegas said.\n\nMore: See what\u2019s behind drop in heroin deaths at Jersey Shore\n\nThe woman was not identified by police.\n\nNarcan was used 129 times in Ocean County last year, when it was put into service under a countywide program established by Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato. All but eight people who received the drug were revived. In Monmouth County, which later initiated its own program, Narcan was administered 97 times, with success in all but 11 cases.\n\nMore: Heroin purity high in New Jersey, cops say\n\nAs a result of Narcan, overdose deaths \u2014 almost all involving heroin or other opiates \u2014 have fallen by nearly a third in Ocean County, from 121 in 2013 to 86 in 2014.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1BNkuM8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A 39-year-old woman owes her life to three Little Egg Harbor Township police officers who found her unconscious at a Wild Oaks Court home, after an apparent heroin overdose on Sunday morning.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A 39-year-old woman owes her life to three Little Egg Harbor Township police officers who found her unconscious at a Wild Oaks Court home, after an apparent heroin overdose on Sunday morning.", "title": "Little Egg cops save woman\u2019s life with Narcan", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2015/02/01/little-egg-cops-save-womans-life-narcan/22705525/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 39-year-old woman owes her life to three Little Egg Harbor Township police officers who found her unconscious at a Wild Oaks Court home, after an apparent heroin overdose on Sunday morning.", "title": "Little Egg cops save life with Narcan", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc82445ff51b954022b1736c43cce809e6b5b857/c=365-0-2635-2270&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/02/01/B9316085925Z.1_20150201182004_002_GII9R6LUJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Narcan, Little Egg Harbor Township Police, heroin overdose, opiate abuse, woman revived with Narcan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb26\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Gannett file)Buy PhotoThe heroin antidote, Narcan, has saved another life in Ocean County.\nBuy Photo The opiate-receptor antagonist, Narcan, also known by its generic name naloxone, saved another life this weekend in Ocean County, where opiate addiction remains an epidemic.\nNarcan was used 129 times in Ocean County last year, when it was put into service under a countywide program established by Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D.
