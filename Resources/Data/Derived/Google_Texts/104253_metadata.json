Her Los Angeles home was in foreclosure, and her car had been repossessed. She had $13 in the bank.\n\nSix years later, Kieling is the CEO of PackIt, a $15 million company that sold the first foldable, freezable bag designed to keep food and drinks cold for up to ten hours.\n\nHappy Mother's Day to our CEO Melissa Kieling, to all the Team PackIt moms and all of moms out there who have supported PackIt. We appreciate you. Posted by PackIt on Sunday, May 10, 2015\n\n\u201c[2009] was a tragic time for my family and me,\u201d Kieling told Yahoo! Parenting, reflecting on the early days of PackIt. \u201cI was doing small jobs [here and there] to keep the lights on and put food on the table.\u201d\n\nIn her spare time, she began crafting a fix for her child and his blueberry dilemma.\n\nShe researched gel-cooling technology, and found a way to keep her kids (now 11, 16, and 18) happy, their food still cold when lunchtime rolled around.\n\nKieling built the first PackIt prototype with a shower curtain and ice packs. She had a dry cleaner stitch the creation together.\n\nShe soon realized she was on to something, and began developing a business plan to sell her invention.\n\n\u201cI felt so strongly that it had to work that I wasn\u2019t willing to detract from that and go the safety route and get a safe, conservative, reasonable job,\u201d Kieling told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI just tightened the belt everywhere and kept going.\u201d\n\nShe recruited a friend to be her business partner, and with some money from family and friends, Kieling set out to trade shows with an initial order of 5,000 PackIt bags.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to see people getting excited about it,\u201d Kieling said. \u201cWhen you put something out there that you\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into, you don\u2019t know how the consumer is going to respond to it.\u201d\n\nTarget saw the product in 2010, and liked it, but chose not to buy.\n\n\u201cThe secret sauce really isn\u2019t apparent to the consumer right off the bat in a glance when they see it on the shelf,\u201d Kieling said. \u201cSo we had a lot of educating to do for our customers.\u201d\n\nA 2011 PackIt infomercial, of all things, proved to be a pivotal moment for the company.\n\nSince the spot aired, PackIt has seen tremendous sales, and growth. The product line expanded include insulated sandwich and grocery bags.\n\nProducts range in price from $11.99-$29.99.\n\nKieling\u2019s PackIt products are now distributed worldwide in more than 70 countries, and can be found in Target, Whole Foods, and Bed, Bath, & Beyond.\n\nLast year, Inc. magazine named PackIt one of the fastest-growing privately held companies.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have earned my seat at the table,\u201d Kieling, who has neither career experience outside the home nor a college degree, also told the LA Times. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t come in the form of an MBA from Harvard. It came truly in the form of trial and error.\u201d\n\nGIVEAWAY! Want $100 to spend at PackIt.com AND a $100 Target gift card?

Parenting. \u201cYou navigate unfamiliar territories \u2026 similar to having your first child.\u201d\n\nKieling cites asking for help, and advice from others, as the key to her success.\n\n\u201cHad I not allowed myself to be vulnerable enough to ask,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have succeeded.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Single mom Melissa Kieling is the CEO of PackIt, a $15 million company she started 6 years ago after a dilemma she had with her child's lunch.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Single mom Melissa Kieling is the CEO of PackIt, a $15 million company she started 6 years ago after a dilemma she had with her child's lunch.", "title": "Single Mom Goes From $13 in the Bank to CEO in Five Years", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_Packit-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-06T10:23:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UoNkxU"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Single mom Melissa Kieling is the CEO of PackIt, a $15 million company she started 6 years ago after a dilemma she had with her child's lunch.", "title": "Single Mom Goes From $13 in the Bank to CEO in Five Years", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_Packit-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-08-06T10:22:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T10:23:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07f6\"", "article_summary": "Posted by PackIt on Sunday, May 10, 2015\u201c[2009] was a tragic time for my family and me,\u201d Kieling told Yahoo!\nHappy Mother's Day to our CEO Melissa Kieling, to all the Team PackIt moms and all of moms out there who have supported PackIt.\nShe had $13 in the bank.\nMore specifically, with blueberries that Melissa Kieling\u2019s young son refused to take to school because they were always warm and mushy by noon.\nShe soon realized she was on to something, and began developing a business plan to sell her invention."}
