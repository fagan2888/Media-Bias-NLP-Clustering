Unfortunately, there continues to be some confusion about CLOs - misconceptions that we can only think come from a conflation with CDOs (debt obligations). But in this case, the letter \u201cL\u201d makes all the difference.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCLOs are not some risky, arcane financial engineering tool - they provide nearly one-quarter of the funded loans to U.S. non-investment grade companies, like American Airlines, Dunkin Donuts, Heinz and countless other household names. And while some of this financing supports leveraged buyouts (LBOs), much does not. In fact, according to S&P/LCD, only 20 percent of such loans financed LBOs in the first half of 2014; a whopping 80 percent did not.\n\nThe evidence contradicts the view that CLOs are too risky. According study by Standard & Poor\u2019s released in January 2014, the 20-year default rate for CLOs is a miniscule 0.41 percent - far below the default rate in almost any other asset class. Moreover, banks don\u2019t buy \u201crisky tranches\u201d of CLOs - far from it. They invest almost exclusively in AAA tranches, and according to the S&P study, there has never been a default in the CLO AAA tranches.\n\nBecause CLOs have performed so well, including through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, banks have continued to buy AAA tranches in good faith over the past several years. But when the Volcker Rule was issued at the end of 2013, it became clear that because these AAA notes had some creditor protective rights, the Volcker Rule treated them like equity \u2013 and would force the banks to sell their investments in very short order. This was a major problem because selling CLO investments quickly would be - in effect - a fire sale.\n\nBanks stood to lose billions of dollars - even though every single investment was structurally sound. And this is not simply industry speculation. A cost-benefit analysis released by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency estimated banks could suffer a $3 billion loss through the forced sale. It was completely reasonable that banks that purchased these AAA notes in good faith wanted to avert this unfortunate \u2013 and completely avoidable \u2013 outcome. To do so, banks agreed with the regulators that they would only buy CLOs comprised solely of loans in the future. But they also asked to not be forced to sell the AAA notes of CLOs that were made up of at least 90 percent loans.\n\nHowever, the regulators took another approach. Instead, the Federal Reserve suggested that the conformance period \u2013 the time in which banks had to sell the notes \u2013 be extended until July 2017 for CLO notes owned by banks as of the end of 2013. While this provided some relief, it does not go far enough and would still lead to significant, unnecessary losses.\n\nFirst, there will be more than $100 billion of \u2013 perfectly performing but non-Volcker compliant \u2013 CLOs outstanding in July 2017. Second, because only CLO notes that were owned by banks at the end of 2013 are covered, the second a bank sells a CLO note \u2013 as it must to meet the rules \u2013 the extended conformance period disappears. This will dramatically reduce liquidity \u2013 and thus reduce the pool of potential buyers. In effect, the rule says, \u201cyou must sell your notes, but we have taken away the buyers\u201d.\n\nAnd this is where Congress appropriately stepped in. The provisions related to CLOs in H.R. 5461 - which were reported out of the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-3 with overwhelming bipartisan support - states that the conformance extension should be permitted for CLO notes issued (not owned) by January 2014. Banks still need to fix - or (more likely) sell - these notes by July 2017. This fix simply allows banks to so do without facing a completely illiquid market.\n\nSmith is the executive director of the Loan Syndications & Trading Association (LSTA).
