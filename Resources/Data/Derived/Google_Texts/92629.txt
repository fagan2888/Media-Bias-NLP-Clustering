Among the problems and solutions cited in the fact sheet:

Very low income American families spend 55 percent of their household budget on transportation costs, and the average household spends more than $8,000 a year on automobile costs. (Revitalized places made walkable and accessible to transit can reduce these expenses, which makes the community more accessible to and supportive of all people.)
