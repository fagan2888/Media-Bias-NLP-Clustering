Needleman\n\nDonna Baker of Adrian, Mich., owns an accounting firm, payroll company and retail store. Her husband, Kim, is the sixth generation owner of a dairy farm.\n\nWhile the four businesses are separate entities, they count as one employer under the health-care law due to a technicality \u2014 Mrs. Baker is a minority stakeholder in the 1,800-acre property that her husband\u2019s farm sits on, plus she helps out with some of the farm\u2019s bookkeeping.\n\nRod Lamkey Jr. Stephen Bienko, a College Hunks Hauling Junk franchisee\n\nAs a result, the Bakers are subject to aggregation rules in the U.S. tax code, which means they would be required to offer health-insurance benefits to their combined full-time staff \u2014 if it reaches 50 employees \u2014 starting in 2015, or pay a penalty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just an investor in the farm,\u201d says Mrs. Baker, who testified on the issue during a Congressional hearing Wednesday before the House Small Business Committee. \u201cI am not running the day-to-day operations.\u201d\n\nThe Bakers collectively employ just shy of 50 full-time workers, the threshold in which employers must provide health-care benefits to comply with the law. If they expand their headcounts in the coming year to 50 or more people, they would be subject to the mandate.\n\nBut while Mrs. Baker, 51 years old, says her payroll business is young and growing, she is hesitant to hire more staff. She says she\u2019s already struggling to afford health benefits for existing employees at two of her firms and that having to start covering her husband\u2019s eight full-time farm workers and future full-time recruits to any of their businesses would be too costly.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing also included testimony from business experts such as Debbie Walker, an accountant for more than 35 years in Washington, D.C. She says it\u2019s likely that many entrepreneurs won\u2019t realize they are subject to the law\u2019s aggregation rules \u2013 which apply mainly to entrepreneurs who own assets or have financial stakes in multiple businesses \u2013 until it\u2019s too late. \u201cThe rules are just too complicated,\u201d she says.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: Ms. Walker says if a mother buys a stake in her son\u2019s dog-grooming business and then she invests in her neighbor\u2019s hair salon, the two entities could be considered one employer under the law, depending on the amount she invested in each. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the mother isn\u2019t involved in running either entity, or even if the two entrepreneurs have nothing else in common but her investment, she adds.\n\n\u201cThe calculations are complex and many small businesses will be caught unaware,\u201d said Todd McCracken, president and CEO of the National Small Business Association, via email. Other business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, International Franchise Association and the National Federation of Independent Business, have also expressed concern over how the aggregation rules apply the health law.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury declined to comment. During the hearing, Congresswoman Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez (D., N.Y.) said the aggregation rules are meant to prevent businesses from \u201cskirting the law.\u201d\n\nOne set of small-business owners most likely to be affected are franchisees such as Stephen Bienko of Allamuchy, N.J.\n\nThe 36-year-old entrepreneur owns four junk-hauling and moving franchises along the East Coast, each with about 25 employees. But come 2015, the businesses will be considered one employer under the health law, making them all subject to the employer mandate.\n\nMr. Bienko, who currently offers health benefits to only staffers who work more than 40 hours a week, says he estimates it will cost him an extra $125,000 a year, if all those newly eligible for employer coverage by law elect to take it.\n\nThe employer mandate defines full-time employees as those who work more than 30 hours a week, so Mr. Bienko says he\u2019s planning to cut his staff\u2019s hours in the year ahead, as well as hire only part-timers going forward, to try and avoid going over the threshold. Still, he\u2019s not sure the strategy will work because the law, when calculating the 50 employee threshold, counts two employees whose combined weekly hours exceed 30 as a full-time equivalent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just so darn scared,\u201d says the College Hunks Hauling Junk franchisee. \u201cI don\u2019t have a team of analysts who can assist in calculating my company\u2019s health-care costs. I\u2019m afraid of making a clerical error that could have catastrophic financial implications.\u201d\n\nDavid Barr, the owner of 23 Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Georgia and Alabama, is also concerned about how the law\u2019s aggregation rules will affect his bottom line. All together, the businesses employ 450 workers and only 32 salaried managers are currently eligible for company health benefits.\n\nMr. Barr says he expects to have cover about 80 more employees in order to comply with the law in 2015, which could cost an extra $50,000 to $350,000 in annual premiums, depending on how many of those staffers sign up for coverage.\n\nHe says he\u2019ll have no choice but to absorb the cost and may need to raise deductibles for his employees in order to reduce premiums, and adds that he thinks the new expense will put his businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\u201cThe law applies to me,\u201d says Mr. Barr, \u201cbut not the guy across the street who has just one restaurant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Donna Baker of Adrian, Mich., owns an accounting firm, payroll company and retail store.
