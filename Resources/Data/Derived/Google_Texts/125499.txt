A large house fire destroyed an unoccupied home in Castle Rock early Saturday morning, authorities say.

By the time firefighters from four departments responded the home was fully engulfed, said Kerri Anne Mukhopadhyay, a spokeswoman for the Castle Rock Fire and Rescue Department.

An emergency call was made around 7 a.m. about the blaze near Wolfensburger Road and Prairie Hawk Drive.

Firefighters from South Metro, Franktown and Larksburg fire departments assisted, Mukhopadhyay said. Fire that spread to grass around the home was quickly contained, she said.

It took 1 Â½ hours to extinguish the blaze, she said. By then the house was a total loss with only smoldering remains.

No firemen were hurt. The cause of the fire is under investigation, Mukhopadhyay said.
