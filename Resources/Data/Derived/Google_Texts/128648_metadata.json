Pauley.\n\nA win in the case would have implications for all church interactions with the state on issues such as school choice, faith-based initiatives, and funding programs, Erik Stanley, another senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cWhen they took this case, the justices signaled that they are willing to think carefully and deeply about this issue,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe are hopeful that their consideration will result in a reversal of Locke v. Davey, and clarity for church interactions with the state.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court held in Locke v. Davey that Washington state didn\u2019t violate the \u201cfree exercise\u201d clause of the First Amendment when it prohibited the use of a state scholarship to fund \u201cdevotional theology degrees.\u201d It said this exclusion was not a criminal or civil sanction against religion, but the state\u2019s choice \u201cnot to fund a distinct category of instruction.\u201d\n\nHowever, the American Civil Liberties Union sees it differently.\n\n\u201cState taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be forced to subsidize religious activities and institutions,\u201d Daniel Mach, director of the group\u2019s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said in a statement to The Daily Signal. He said the ACLU is hopeful the high court \u201cwill affirm the state\u2019s longstanding ability to provide its citizens with robust religious liberty safeguards.\u201d\n\nRoger Severino, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, said he views Missouri\u2019s constitutional prohibition not as a \u201crobust religious liberty safeguard,\u201d but as a \u201crelic of anti-Catholic hostility\u201d used to discriminate against people of faith.\n\nDenying schoolkids funding for a safer playground simply because they happen to go to a religious school is a step too far, he says.\n\nSeverino added: \u201cThe U.S. Constitution prevents state governments from committing this kind of gross discrimination and the Supreme Court now has the opportunity to remind everyone of this fact.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on the case by the end of June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lawyer for a Lutheran church says denial of a state grant to improve its preschool playground showed \"hostility\" based on religion.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A lawyer for a Lutheran church says denial of a state grant to improve its preschool playground showed \"hostility\" based on religion.", "title": "Christian School Takes Playground Plea to Supreme Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_TrinityLutheran_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-26T21:30:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/23kTV1I"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A lawyer for a Lutheran church says denial of a state grant to improve its preschool playground showed \"hostility\" based on religion.", "title": "Christian School Takes Playground Plea to Supreme Court", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_TrinityLutheran_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2016-01-25T19:29:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T21:30:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Trinity Lutheran, Supreme Court, First Amendment, Safe Playground, playground, preschool, Missouri, Department of Natural Resources"}, "article_summary": "\u2026 In our view, only the Supreme Court can make that leap.\nSeverino added: \u201cThe U.S. Constitution prevents state governments from committing this kind of gross discrimination and the Supreme Court now has the opportunity to remind everyone of this fact.\u201dThe Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on the case by the end of June.\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court took the first step towards such a leap when it agreed to hear the case, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v.
