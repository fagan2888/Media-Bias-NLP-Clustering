But Obama is not fighting tangible events that the White House can frame and shape with rhetoric and gestures. Instead, the White House is battling perception \u2014 a far more abstract phenomenon. And voters\u2019 perceptions of Obama\u2019s presidency are not good.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmid continued pessimism about the economy and direction of the country, 59 percent of Americans say they are disappointed in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency (including 37 percent who are very disappointed),\u201d CBS News reported on Wednesday. The latest CBS News/New York Times poll found that only 41 percent of American adults approve of the job the president is doing in office, down from the 46 percent approval CBS registered in mid-January.\n\nThe bad news continued for the president further down that poll. 42 percent of registered voters in that survey say they will back a Republican candidate for federal office in November. Only 39 percent said they would head to the polls to vote for the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe New York Times is perplexed. \u201cRepublicans are in a stronger position than Democrats for this year\u2019s midterm elections, benefiting from the support of self-described independents, even though the party itself is deeply divided and most Americans agree more with Democratic policy positions,\u201d read the lead paragraph in their write up of that troubling poll.\n\nThe Republicans are set to maintain control the House and make big gains in the Senate in November. How big? While the Senate is in play in the coming election cycle, some analysts are beginning to entertain the prospect that Republicans may make gains large enough to allow them to keep control through the 2016 cycle \u2013 a presidential year when the GOP must defend the seats it gained amid a pro-Republican wave in 2010.\n\nUniversity of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics analyst Alan Abramowitz painted a dismal picture for Democrats on Thursday. \u201cEven if Democrats have a 10-point lead in generic ballot polling in early September, Republicans would still be expected to gain between three and four Senate seats because of the GOP advantage on the seat exposure and midterm party variables,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A] Republican lead of five or more points would almost ensure a GOP majority in next year\u2019s Senate.\u201d\n\nRealClearPolitics analyst Sean Trende took a less conventional approach to estimating potential GOP Senate gains. Last Thursday, Trende published a post in which he said that Republican gains in the Senate will track closely with President Obama\u2019s job disapproval rating. He wrote that, at Obama\u2019s present 41 percent rating, gains of between 10 and 11 seats in the upper chamber of Congress are not out of the question.\n\nAn 11 seat gain would mean the GOP would hold 56 seats in that chamber of Congress \u2013 a feat the party has not duplicated since the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928.\n\nIt\u2019s that bad, and Obama apparently knows it. This week, the President of the United States began to tout his plans for the post-presidency. Amid a contentious election year in which the fate of his signature policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, hangs in the balance, Obama has set his sights on the impact he can make once he vacates the Oval Office.\n\nOn Thursday, White House advisors mounted a press blitz in which they said that Obama will expand his \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative, a program which will bring together non-profit foundations and private enterprises to test programs designed to help young minority men to graduate from high school, train for a good job, and avoid juvenile detention centers or prison.

News\u2019 Liz Goodwin and Garance Franke-Ruta reported on Wednesday. \u201cObama, who wrote a best-selling memoir probing questions of race, identity and his own fatherlessness, is plotting a return to the issues that have been central to his own life and will continue to shape generations of young black men after he leaves the White House.\u201d\n\nThis is a critical cause, and the president\u2019s influence will be valuable to helping minority youth to navigate the challenges posed by growing up in troubled neighborhoods. Obama\u2019s post-presidency already seems bright. So bright, in fact, that the president apparently cannot wait to get started.\n\nGiven the dip in his approval rating and the increasing likelihood that the final two years of the Obama administration will be unproductive due to the potential for a Republican dominated Congress, Obama is already embracing his lame duck status.\n\nObama\u2019s embattled congressional allies must be deeply concerned about the president\u2019s focus on life after elected office. Many of them should probably being to consider following his lead.\n\n[Photo via AP Photo/Susan Walsh]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama\u2019s embattled Congressional allies must be deeply concerned about the president\u2019s focus on life after elected office.
