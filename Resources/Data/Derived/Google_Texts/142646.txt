Had No Health Insurance for Some or All of 2014

Tip --> You’ll need IRS Form 8965.

You may have to pay a penalty (a fee) if you didn’t have health insurance for some or all of 2014. The penalty this year is $95 or 1 percent of your income above $10,150 ($20,300 for couples filing jointly)—whichever is higher—but in no case will you pay more than what it would cost to buy a bronze plan in the Health Insurance Marketplace.
