The Office of Personnel Management, the organization that handles government security clearances and federal employee records, housed the compromised data.\n\nWhile various American authorities have blamed China for the attacks, the Chinese Embassy has warned the U.S. not to jump to conclusions.\n\nSteven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at The Heritage Foundation, emphasized that while there could be evidence that China is responsible, the White House has not articulated that.\n\nEven if the Chinese were behind the attacks, it would still be unclear whether it was the government directly, a band of criminals, or a combination of the two. When it comes to a cyber attack, Bucci explained, \u201cAttribution is one of the hardest things to do, and with China it\u2019s even harder.\u201d\n\nThough Bucci does not believe this data hack will have any implications on Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s scheduled visit to the White House in September, he does think there could be other ramifications in Chinese-American relations.\n\nLawrence Husick, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and co-chair of the Center for the Study of Terrorism, agrees with Bucci.\n\nHusick remarked, \u201cIn general, U.S.-China relations will suffer. However, it\u2019s very difficult to predict any particular way in which they will be worse because there are always trade-offs.\u201d\n\nIn terms of how this data breach will affect the millions of federal employees whose information was compromised, Bucci said these Americans should be very concerned.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management houses very sensitive material, according to Bucci.\n\nHackers now have access to Social Security numbers, job histories, pay scales, and possibly, even full security clearance information.\n\nThat means hackers can spoof federal employees, which Bucci explained is like \u201chigh-speed identity theft.\u201d\n\nAlso, from a security standpoint, hackers can use the information to compel employees in certain ways.\n\nOnce hackers know the information in a security clearance file\u2014information that spans a person\u2019s lifetime\u2014the cyber attackers can use it to influence people\u2019s actions.\n\nWhile this will not happen to four million Americans, the people responsible could certainly use this tactic on the most significant people in the database.\n\nHusick, on the other hand, believes federal employees affected by this cyber attack have no compelling reason to be alarmed.\n\nHusick said, \u201cIf I were a federal employee, I would be no more concerned by this breach than I would be if my information were stolen from a retailer like Target.\u201d\n\nAs cyber attacks are becoming more common, many Americans are expressing concern over how to prevent their occurrences.\n\nThe problem, Bucci said, is that \u201ccyber security is such a dynamic field; it\u2019s changing constantly.\u201d\n\nTo achieve true protections from these types of breaches, Bucci advised that experts in technology fields, government officials, and security specialists all work together to determine the best practices.\n\nBucci warned, \u201cWe\u2019re not done. This is like fighting terrorism. It isn\u2019t going to go away. It\u2019s going to constantly evolve and change and we need to understand that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration says the private records of as many as four million current and former federal employees could be in the hands of foreign hackers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration says the private records of as many as four million current and former federal employees could be in the hands of foreign hackers.", "title": "Why the Latest Data Hack Against the US Government Matters", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Computerhack.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-05T18:41:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KSePxr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration says the private records of as many as four million current and former federal employees could be in the hands of foreign hackers.", "title": "Why the Latest Data Hack Against the US Government Matters", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Computerhack.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2015-06-05T17:31:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T18:41:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "data breach, china, cyber security, hack, Xi Jinping"}, "article_summary": "The Office of Personnel Management, the organization that handles government security clearances and federal employee records, housed the compromised data.\nHusick, on the other hand, believes federal employees affected by this cyber attack have no compelling reason to be alarmed.\nThe Obama administration announced yesterday that the private records of as many as four million current and former federal employees could be in the hands of foreign hackers.\nHackers now have access to Social Security numbers, job histories, pay scales, and possibly, even full security clearance information.\nWhile various American authorities have blamed China for the attacks, the Chinese Embassy has warned the U.S. not to jump to conclusions."}
