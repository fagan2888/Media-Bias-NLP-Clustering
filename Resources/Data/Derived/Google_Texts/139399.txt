CANNES, France (AP) — Just what film directors Joel and Ethan Coen are thinking is a question that has long bedeviled moviegoers. Now they have the Cannes Film Festival on pins and needles, too.

The 68th Cannes Film Festival wraps up with an awards ceremony Sunday night that will bestow the coveted Palme d’Or on one of 19 films in competition. The decision is left up a jury, headed this year by the Coen brothers, who themselves won the Palme d’Or in 1991 for “Barton Fink.”

Among the favorites to capture Cannes’ top honor this year are the Hungarian Holocaust drama “Son of Saul” by first-time director Laszlo Nemes; Paolo Sorrentino’s wry mediation on aging in “Youth;” Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s lavish martial arts drama “The Assassin;” and Todd Haynes’ ’50s lesbian romance “Carol.”
