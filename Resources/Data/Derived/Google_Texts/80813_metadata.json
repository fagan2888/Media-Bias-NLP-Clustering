Then all the other idiots just ran with it, thinking Palin really said it.\n\nAs for attacking John McCain for picking Palin as his vice presidential running mate, and the fact that she would have been second-in-command, do you really think the joker who is in second-in-command now is a better choice?\n\nHe had a Senate seat for all those years and accomplished practically nothing. And he makes more gaffes than anyone I can remember \u2014 for example, telling a man in a wheelchair to stand up. Between Joe Biden and President Obama \u2014 who, by the way, thought there were 57 states \u2014 they couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Palin. Lorraine Shaw\n\nFare is fair\n\nManhattan: It is commendable that the bodega and supermarket associations have contributed funds for the funeral and burial of the murdered Angel Rojas, and that Catholic Charities is receiving donations for the family (\u201cGroup aids bus shoot vic\u2019s family,\u201d March 24). But what happens after this money runs out? The late Mr. Rojas was shot to death on a city bus. The MTA must undertake to ensure that the Rojas family continues to have the funds to pay for its apartment, food bills, medical care and the future education of his children. If no law exists to compel them to do this, one should be passed immediately. Aviva Cantor\n\nRace to the top\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Henry Ramos: You are 100% correct. The FDNY deputy commissioners and chiefs are appointed by current acting Commissioner Sal Cassano. They are overwhelming white Italian or Irish males. Hopefully, when Mayor de Blasio announces our new FDNY commissioner, qualified females and people of other races will finally get selected. Sandra Klein\n\nCommissioner corrections\n\nBelle Harbor: Just to let misinformed Voicer Henry Ramos know, there is a test to become a battalion and deputy chief of the New York City Fire Department. These tests are quite difficult, taking years of reading and studying to pass. The fire commissioner is appointed by the mayor. There are also deputy commissioners, and I believe \u2014 if Ramos does his homework \u2014 he will find that quite a few minorities hold or have held those positions. If you are going to add your two cents, at least have your facts straight. Palmer Doyle\n\nCold at heart\n\nNorth Syracuse, N.Y.: Republicans in Congress are obsessed with repealing Obamacare. They can\u2019t wait to take away the health coverage of millions of Americans. They are supported by the billionaire Koch brothers who never have to worry about their own health care. The worst part is that Republicans have no plan to replace Obamacare. They figure that if you can\u2019t afford to have health insurance, you should just suffer and die. I guess this is what they call compassionate conservatism. Linda Wyatt\n\nRoad responsibility\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Jason C.M. Atkins: As both a pedestrian and a driver, I think cyclists should be held to the same standards as drivers, including observing the rules of the road. Both myself and my sister have been hit by cyclists running red lights and had to pay all the medical bills, since cyclists aren\u2019t required to carry insurance. If you\u2019re riding in traffic, follow the rules of the road. Judith Bent\n\nJumping the gun\n\nEast Meadow, L.I.: Did the Daily News\u2019 front page on March 24 label someone who has not been accused of a crime a mass murderer just because he won a gun? And then derisively call him a gun nut without knowing anything about this man? While I understand The News has no respect for gun-owning, law-abiding citizens who have never committed crimes, this kind of hype used to be beneath you. Obviously, not anymore. Cathy Mervyn\n\nProud alumnus\n\nBriarcliff Manor, N.Y.: I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Powers\u2019 detailed and informative piece on George Kaftan, Bob Cousy and the 1947 NCAA champions, the Holy Cross Crusaders (\u201cGarden crusade,\u201d March 25). I graduated from the college in 1962, and my wife and I have been to more than 800 games over the last 50-plus years. Powers touched on the scholar-athlete emphasis at the Cross, noting that Kaftan became a dentist. Holy Cross, a difficult academic institution, graduates 100% of its players. You not only have to be a good player but a good student as well. Larry Lombardi\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nPatchogue, L.I.: Something smells at the New York State Lottery. On March 20, there were 29 top-five winners in the Take 5 drawing. There are usually zero, one or two. The numbers (03-04-31-33-35) don\u2019t appear to have significant meaning. Do you think it was fortune cookies? Joan Tallman\n\nStep aside\n\nHoward Beach: Let me be the first to applaud Mayor de Blasio for his mission to have \u201ca government that looks like New York City.\u201d If he believes what he says, he should take it one step further and resign, so that Public Advocate Letitia James, the next in line, can succeed him. After all, the city has never had a female mayor and only one black one. That does not look like NYC to me. Come on, Bill, turn your words into action. Robert McGuire\n\nNo suit for you\n\nShaftsbury, Vt.: Justin Green sounds a lot like another lawyer trying to get rich quick (\u201cFire might have KO\u2019d pilots,\u201d March 25). His opinion that Malaysian Airlines Flight 370\u2019s disappearance was due to a \u201cmechanical issue\u201d is exactly what lawyers want. They can then sue the airline for negligence and collect millions. This is when everybody else is saying that human intervention was responsible for shutting down the transponders and flying the plane off course. Either way, there\u2019s no real proof \u2014 families of passengers will have to settle for the $5,000 being offered. Sorry, lawyers are out of the money on this one! Tom King\n\nA national shame\n\nWoodstock, Ga.: Why don\u2019t your reporters go out on the streets of NYC, interview homeless American veterans where they sleep and find out why they are there \u2014 that is, if your reporters are not afraid. Is it because the VA takes one-to-two years to process a disability claim? Is it because they have PTSD and can\u2019t get help? Is it because in the service they got hooked on drugs and drinking? Or is it because nobody cares about them? What happened to standing up for those who stood up for us? Bob Eldridge\n\nU.S.A.F., retired\n\nFalse solution\n\nManhattan: Re \u201cBuild a better future\u201d (editorial, March 24): According to a recent study by the Real Estate Board of New York, less than 4% of New York City is under any sort of municipal landmark regulation. Those seriously concerned about affordable housing should be looking at what is blocking the construction of affordable housing in the other 96% of the city. Clearly, when it come to the lack of affordable housing, the preservation of New York\u2019s historic neighborhoods is not the culprit. Anthony C. Wood\n\nThe content of our character\n\nEast Islip, L.I.: To Voicer Anthony Johnson Sr.: You\u2019re a good person who doesn\u2019t use the bad things that happen to all of us in life as excuses. God bless your mother for being an exemplary model for all mothers. I don\u2019t know you personally, but the respect you show for your mother says it all. The fact that you state strongly that you are not a victim and take charge of your own destiny speaks volumes for all of us, no matter what our race or circumstances we saw as children, or what we must endure as adults. Daniel A. Hesse\n\nJob well done\n\nHoward Beach: Thank you, Voicer Anthony Johnson Sr., for one of the most intelligent letters I have read. Your mother should be very proud. Patricia Guglielmo\n\nDebt paid in full\n\nNorth Brunswick, N.J.: What Michael Vick did was a truly terrible thing. He served his time, he spoke to groups about the right way to treat animals and his behavior has been exemplary since that time. That is what the law is all about. To those who moan about him being a Jet, you are phonies. You don\u2019t mind players who have long rap sheets, carry illegal weapons and actually kill people. Vick did his time.
