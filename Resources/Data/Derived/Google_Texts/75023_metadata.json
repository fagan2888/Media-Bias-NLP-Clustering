Stephanie Takis, an Aurora Democrat known for her mischievous twinkle, great laugh and mentorship to several Adams County politicians.\n\nTakis, who was 69, died Aug. 5 at home. She was born in Salt Lake City and had worked as a financial analyst for the federal government and as a congressional liaison. Takis served on the Aurora City Council from 1989 to 1993 and in the legislature from 1997 to 2008.\n\nHer memorial service is scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday at Moorhead Park, 2390 Havana St.\n\n\u201cStephanie Takis knew who she was, what she believed and delivered it with her one-of-a-kind voice,\u201d said Senate President Morgan Carroll, D-Aurora. \u201cI loved being around her. She was grounded, no drama, warm, but behind that smile everyone knew \u2014 don\u2019t mess with Adams County women!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what some friends, lawmakers and lobbyists had to say about Takis:\n\nFriend Carolyn Boller:\n\nWhen something struck Steph as funny she could let out the biggest laugh and her whole being went into the laugh. I can still hear it.\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Alice Madden, D-Boulder:\n\nStephanie Takis knew exactly why she went into public service and she never for one moment forgot that she wanted to represent those who would otherwise not have a voice. She had a core moral center from which she never swayed. A public servant must know themselves and Stephanie knew herself and her constituents; that is a rare quality in today\u2019s \u201cwhere does the wind blow me\u201d political positions. I admired her greatly and I truly hope she is not a vanishing breed. Go with God my friend.\n\nLobbyist Greg Romberg:\n\nStephanie had the remarkable ability to take every aspect of her work very seriously while at the same time being able to be completely irreverent about what was going on. You knew you were in for a treat whenever you saw that mischievous look on her face that preceded an insight that was always both spot on and completely hilarious.\n\nFriend Lois Claggett\n\nStephanie and I met while working as management analysts at Fitzsimons Medical Center about 30 years ago. We became immediate friends and the wonderful ride began. Shortly after I met her she introduced me to her family: her sister, Andrea, her brother-in-law, Jerry, and her nephew, Andrew. We started to spend holidays together, especially Greek Easter where I acquired my love for Greek food.\n\nMy husband said to us one time that he was surprised that we worked together as we never talked shop. Stephanie and I looked at each other and said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nOne morning I took a break at work and went into Stephanie\u2019s office to chat. She was reading the paper and we started to talk. All of a sudden she said that we needed to become more active in the community. That was not on my radar but she was reading the Aurora newspaper and there was a listing of vacancies for several of the commissions. I told her that I didn\u2019t think I knew much about any of them and she said probably no one else did either. So we both applied for two and within a few months we both were accepted. She went on the Budget Advisory commission and I went on the Aurora Historic Preservation Commission. The rest is history now \u2014 and all from a morning break chat.\n\nFormer Rep. Judy Solano, D-Brighton:\n\nStephanie was a \u201cnumbers person.\u201d When I was a new legislator, I could count on Sen. Takis to give me the details about the state budget. She was also an expert on transportation issues and I respected her advice. Sen. Takis was an exemplary public servant, serving in a humble, yet strong manner. Her wisdom and presence will be missed.\n\nSen. Lois Tochtrop, D-Westminster:\n\nStephanie was my mentor when I was first elected to the House in 1999. She taught me a lot, especially the three things I followed during my service as a legislator. 1. Remember who brought you to the dance. 2. Vote your district and 3. Your word is everything, never lie.\n\nStephanie was a great legislator and one of the Adams County women who embodied the saying, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with the Adams\n\nCounty women.\u201d She will be missed by the Adams County Democrats and many others whose lives she touched.\n\nFormer Rep. Edward Casso, D-Commerce City\n\nStephanie would share a happening and when I laughed, she would say, \u201cYou liked that, did you?\u201d And then she would laugh her special \u201cStephanie laugh.\u201d\n\nShe and I served together in 2007 and 2008. Whenever a major vote was taken in the House or a major debate had occurred, she would call for me in the House. She would send a Senate sargent to have me go to the Senate floor.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t approve of my action, she gave me an earful \u2014 which happened once or twice. But if she did approve, she didn\u2019t congratulate me or discuss the event. She would simply just give me an approving wink of the eye through those big glasses. I think that captures who she was, and how sweet and endearing she was too.\n\nLaura Huerta, Adams County Democrat\n\nStephanie would share a happening and when I laughed, she would say, \u201cYou liked that, did you?\u201d And then she would laugh her special \u201cStephanie laugh.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what the Aurora Sentinel had to say when she ran for reelection: \u201cTakis is a consistent advocate for elderly, poor and middle-class residents who have big needs and few paid lobbyists under the gold dome. In a district that has some of the most gritty urban and quiet rural parts of the state, Takis has been able to strike a fair balance in the message she conveys to fellow lawmakers at the Capitol.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Adams County Democrats,Alice Madden,Edward Casso,Judy Solano,Lois Tochtrop,memorial service,Morgan Carroll,Stephanie Takis", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Former Sen.
