CentroMed, CommuniCare awarded federal funds for primary care

SAN ANTONIO — Two San Antonio community health clinic systems will receive federal funds to expand primary care services, health officials said Friday.

CentroMed was awarded $512,102 in Affordable Care Act funding — the biggest disbursement to any community health clinic network in Texas. Another San Antonio provider, CommuniCare Health Centers, was awarded $374,982.

The funds — part of more than $16 million awarded to 64 health centers across Texas — will help providers boost their primary care by hiring new staff, staying open for longer hours or offering new services, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. Federal health officials hope the funds help those health centers reach new patients.

Other providers in the area that will receive funds are Atascosa Health Center in Pleasanton, which was awarded $254,492, and South Texas Rural Health Services in Cotulla, which was awarded $220,234.
