The strains themselves don’t taste like lemon or raspberry, but their popsicle doppelgangers might. San Francisco artist Wei Li has designed a line of so-called “Dangerous Popsicles” that give new life to the hazardous bacteria, which normally infect our bodies, not delight our taste buds.

Li’s project of magnifying bacteria and viruses like HIV, E. Coli (Escherichia coli), MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), influenza, and chicken pox stems from her desire to bring a fun sense of familiarity to an otherwise gross and off-putting subject. “The idea was to explore how our preexisting knowledge of something will influence our perception of something else,” Li told the NY Daily News. Popsicles are inviting, but at the same time, your brain also knows you’re licking a deadly virus.

The frozen creations are simply made of sugar water, their molds cast from a 3D printer. Li says she had visions of making the project a unique tactile experience, which she invites people to recreate on their own with the help of some modeling software and silicone molds. The popsicles aren’t for sale, though Li’s focus group of coworkers already seems to be onboard with the project.

“The idea is a little bit disturbing, but I do want the experience to be delightful and intriguing,” she said. “The general response I got from people was more on the delight side.”
