We promote wellness nationally and globally, and we sponsor smoking cessation plans for our own employees.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Chamber regularly urges governments to protect intellectual property and comply with their international commitments, and we\u2019ve done so for a wide variety of industries. Measures that violate these standards and single out one industry for discriminatory treatment can easily spread, which is why dozens of other business and agricultural organizations have expressed the same concerns.\n\nTHOMAS J.
