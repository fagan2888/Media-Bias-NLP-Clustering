The hospital can send but the health partner might not be able to receive.\n\nThat means even though a hospital has gotten the technology right, it can't qualify for the incentives.\n\n\"It's an all-or-nothing approach and an all-or-nothing approach is not very fruitful when you are pushing the bounds of technology,\" said Susan Van Meter, vice president of federal relations for HANYS.\n\nMeaningful Use is a product of the 2009 federal stimulus program. It offered incentive payments through 2015 to those hospitals and other health care providers that could prove they were correctly using certified technology, which was meant to improve patient safety and be more cost-effecient.\n\nAt the same time, it penalized noncompliant hospitals beginning in 2015.\n\nEveryone agrees that the law has spurred a revolution in health-information technology with hospitals across the country converting to electronic records, and making progress toward a goal touted by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Some of this was basic, such as putting paper records online, which experts have long said reduces waste and duplication while improving patient safety. Some of it was much more complicated, such as ensuring that records from a hospital in New York be easily transmittable to a nursing home in Florida.\n\nC.M.S., in an effort to measure performance, decided to roll out a new \"stage\" of the Meaningful Use program every couple years. Federal regulators assumed this would be a way to push progress, and, as the name suggests, ensure that the new technology was being used in a meaningful way.\n\nBut Stage 2 has become a nightmare because hospitals can meet most, but not all federal requirements, meaning hospitals lose out on the federal incentive payments because of issues, hospital administrators say, are not their fault.\n\n\u201cWhat can be controlled within the hospitals' four walls, they seem like they're doing well on. But when you need to coordinate with an external party, that's where they're behind,\" Julia Adler-Milstein, University of Michigan professor and co-author of the Health Affairs study, told Modern Healthcare.\n\nSt. Barnabas in the Bronx had the right technology earlier this spring but local community providers were not ready, said Dr. Jitendra Barmecha, the hospital's chief information officer.\n\n\"Even if the technology is there, it is dependent on the community providers,\" he said.\n\nThe hospital has also had problems meeting the requirements surrounding the patient portal. The idea here is simple: Federal regulators want to see patients having access to their health data. The problem is the hospital can build a portal, but if the population it serves has limited internet access, then it can't meet the standard because the patients don't have access to the health portal.\n\nThe problem of interoperability\u2014the ability to communicate information across systems\u2014has caught the attention of Congress, and federal officials are trying to find a workaround.\n\nIn May, C.M.S. proposed a rule that would allow hospitals and health systems to attest again to Stage 1 and provide a longer window to attest to Stage 2, a not-so-tacit acknowledgement that doctors and hospitals are unable to meet the goals.\n\nHANYS supported the proposed rule during the public comment period, writing that the \"proposed flexibility afforded to providers in how they attest for meaningful use in 2014 should allow providers that otherwise may not have able to successfully attest in 2014 to do so.\"\n\nBut, HANYS wrote, a few more months is unlikely to solve the longer-term problem.\n\n\"We are disappointed that the rule does not go far enough to address the deeply embedded complications and challenges facing providers seeking to achieve or maintain meaningful use status,\" HANYS wrote. \"The rule is limited by providing flexibility to how meaningful use is met only in 2014, it fails to modify the nature of programmatic objectives incongruent with the current state of HIT-enableness, it does not recognize 2015 as a year of transition, and it sets forth a pathway to establish a Stage 3 rule before any significant analysis of Stage 2 could be done.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/08/8550400/explaining-hospitals-dismal-hit-rate-electronic-records", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20StBarnabasHospital_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Explaining hospitals' dismal hit rate on electronic records"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u00a0announced this week\u00a0that only 78 hospitals had met Electronic Health Records Stage 2 reporting requirements"}, "article_summary": "That isn't always possible, particularly for hospitals in communities where the nursing home or primary care doctor doesn't use the same system.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced this week that only 78 hospitals across the nation had met Electronic Health Records Stage 2 reporting requirements, part of the government's Meaningful Use program.\nFor example, hospitals need to attest that they have sent an electronic summary of a care record to a follow-up care provider for at least 10 percent of all discharges.\nEveryone agrees that the law has spurred a revolution in health-information technology with hospitals across the country converting to electronic records, and making progress toward a goal touted by Presidents George W.
