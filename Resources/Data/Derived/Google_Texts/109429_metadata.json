The victim has now been identified as 35-year-old Timothy Brown, of Fort Myers.\n\nHe was unconscious and not breathing. Officers were able to revive him while waiting for EMS. He was taken to Lee Memorial Hospital and is in stable condition.\n\n\"We saw he was unresponsive, not breathing; so it was time to do CPR, start chest compressions,\" Louissaint said.\n\nInstincts took over for him and Cates. Minutes later Brown was alive and breathing again.\n\n\"As soon as he started breathing again, I gave a sigh of relief and was like, \u2018Ok, now I can start assessing other things, how bad are the wounds.'\" Cates said.\n\nBrown is in the hospital now in stable condition. A friend tells us he is a good guy who grew up in Fort Myers.\n\nWe discovered the 35-year-old has spent a lot of time in the Lee County Jail. He's been booked 28 times from 1998 to 2013 for things like trespassing, cocaine possession and grand theft.\n\n\"They just don't care; don't care about nothing these days, nothing. I care, I care. I pray for a better life,\" said neighbor Georgia Thomas.\n\nSaturday's shooting happened just beyond her front porch and behind Franklin Park Elementary School.\n\nPolice aren't telling us a motive. Thomas says she sees people doing drugs in the area. Now the shooting has her on edge.\n\n\"You could be walking out and you don't know where the bullet's going to go,\" Thomas explains. \"I could be sitting outside late at night, people are walking all behind the bushes and you don't know what's going on around you now.\"\n\nThis case is still open and under investigation. No arrests have been made.\n\nPolice say the public isn't in any danger, although the gunman is still on the loose.\n\n\"From here, the most important thing is to get a statement from the victim when he is released from the doctor's care. Get a statement from him and find out exactly what transpired. And find out who did this and put them in jail,\" said Detective Sgt. Brian O'Reilly with the Fort Myers Police Department.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Detective Matt Sellers at (239) 321-7700, Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS or text message C-R-I-M-E-S (274637) Keyword FMPD. Tipsters can remain anonymous. No further information is available at this time.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Fort Myers Police Department is investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Saturday.", "author": "Andrea Hubbell, Ty Russell", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/25173458/fort-myers-police-searching-for-shooting-suspect", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Fort Myers Police Department is investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Saturday.", "title": "Fort Myers police searching for shooting suspect"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wbbh.images.worldnow.com/images/25173458_SA.jpg", "creator": "https://twitter.com/andreahubbell", "description": "The Fort Myers Police Department is investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fort Myers police searching for shooting suspect"}, "wnreadableurl": "fort-myers-police-searching-for-shooting-suspect", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/04/05", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "owner": "WBBH", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc3d\"", "article_summary": "\"They just don't care; don't care about nothing these days, nothing.\nThe Fort Myers Police Department is investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Saturday.\nThe victim has now been identified as 35-year-old Timothy Brown, of Fort Myers.\nWhen he and Officer Curtis Cates got to Ford and Thomas Streets Saturday evening things didn't look good.\nA friend tells us he is a good guy who grew up in Fort Myers."}
