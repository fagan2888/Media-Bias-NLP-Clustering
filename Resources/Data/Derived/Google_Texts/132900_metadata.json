People who do not provide the information risk losing their subsidized coverage and may have to repay subsidies next April.\n\nFederal subsidies for the purchase of private insurance are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. More than eight out of 10 people who selected health plans through the exchanges from October through mid-April were eligible for subsidies, including income tax credits. So far this year the federal government has paid out $4.7 billion in subsidies, and the amount is expected to total $900 billion over 10 years.\n\nSince June 1, the government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that \u201cthe information in your application doesn\u2019t match what we found in other records.\u201d Accordingly, the notice says, \u201cyou need to follow up as soon as possible and provide more documents to make sure the marketplace has the correct information.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t send the needed documents,\u201d it says, \u201cyou risk losing your marketplace coverage or help you may be receiving to pay for such coverage.\u201d\n\nThe government has a long list of documents that consumers can use to establish their eligibility. These include copies of birth certificates, Social Security cards, high school diplomas, driver\u2019s licenses, pay stubs and voter registration cards.\n\n\u201cThe law requires us to double- and triple-check this data,\u201d said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so \u201cwe\u2019re reaching out to consumers \u2014 via mail, email and phone calls \u2014 to encourage them to provide supporting documentation.\u201d\n\nMara Youdelman, a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for low-income people, said: \u201cIn some cases, consumers say they already sent the documents to the federal marketplace. They don\u2019t understand why they are being asked to send them in again.\u201d\n\nEven though consumers have sent documents to Serco\u2019s office in London, Ky., the government cannot always link the documents to applications for coverage filed months earlier. In addition, some consumers report persistent problems when they try to upload documents through HealthCare.gov.\n\nFor months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.\n\nThe government enrolled people \u201cbefore the systems were in place to accurately confirm eligibility,\u201d said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee.\n\nIn some cases, the government told consumers that they had been found eligible for subsidized insurance and could enroll right away. But to keep the coverage, it said, they had to \u201csend the marketplace more information\u201d to verify their eligibility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, said \u201cmany Americans are going to find out that they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service because their premium tax credits were paid incorrectly.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said such remarks showed the Republicans\u2019 \u201cunending zeal to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, supporters of the health care law worry that some of its chief beneficiaries will be upset if they find next spring that their tax liability is greater than they expected.\n\nRonald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said he believed that the government would not find major discrepancies in the amounts most consumers should receive in premium tax credits. But he said, \u201cWe share concerns that the longer the process of verifying and resolving inconsistencies takes, the more some consumers will owe when they reconcile their tax returns.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that subsidies this year will average $4,400 for each person who receives a subsidy. Federal law generally limits the amount that lower- and moderate-income people may be required to repay. A family of four with an annual income of $80,000 could be required to repay as much as $2,500.\n\nExecutives at Serco, the federal contractor, said that technical problems with HealthCare.gov had limited their ability to investigate discrepancies.\n\nUntil late May, a Serco executive said, the company had to rely on \u201cmanual processes\u201d to resolve conflicts between information provided by consumers and information in government databases.\n\nThe government was supposed to develop a system to scan documents and transfer information automatically into electronic files, but the system was not developed, so Serco employees had to type in the information. Serco said it took an hour to perform tasks that were expected to take just five minutes.\n\nSubsidies depend on household income and the number of people in a family seeking assistance. But internal memorandums from the Department of Health and Human Services say that the insurance exchanges had no way to verify family size.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe government has also had difficulty checking information about employer-sponsored insurance. The Obama administration delayed until 2015 a requirement for employers to inform the government of insurance that they provide. Workers are generally ineligible for subsidies if they have access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage that meets basic federal standards.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140615201606, "twitter": {"description": "The government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that information provided for subsidized health insurance did not match other federal documents and they may risk losing their subsidies.", "title": "Thousands to Be Questioned on Eligibility for Health Insurance Subsidies", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/us/thousands-to-be-questioned-on-eligibility-for-health-insurance-subsidies.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002941966"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/us/thousands-to-be-questioned-on-eligibility-for-health-insurance-subsidies.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002941966", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/us/thousands-to-be-questioned-on-eligibility-for-health-insurance-subsidies.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Serco Group PLC", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Serco Group PLC,Obama  Barack", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that information provided for subsidized health insurance did not match other federal documents and they may risk losing their subsidies.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that information provided for subsidized health insurance did not match other federal documents and they may risk losing their subsidies.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-06-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2014-06-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "16health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140616133014, "hdl_p": "Thousands to Be Questioned on Eligibility for Health Insurance Subsidies", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/us/thousands-to-be-questioned-on-eligibility-for-health-insurance-subsidies.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that information provided for subsidized health insurance did not match other federal documents and they may risk losing their subsidies.", "title": "Thousands to Be Questioned on Eligibility for Health Insurance Subsidies"}, "pdate": 20140615, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002941966, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Thousands to Be Questioned on Eligibility for Health Insurance Subsidies", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "For months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.\nFederal subsidies for the purchase of private insurance are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is contacting hundreds of thousands of people with subsidized health insurance to resolve questions about their eligibility, as consumer advocates express concern that many will be required to repay some or all of the subsidies.\nPeople who do not provide the information risk losing their subsidized coverage and may have to repay subsidies next April.\nMore than eight out of 10 people who selected health plans through the exchanges from October through mid-April were eligible for subsidies, including income tax credits."}
