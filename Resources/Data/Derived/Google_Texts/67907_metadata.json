But is it too late for Issa, the richest member of Congress and a champion of open government, to learn to get out of his own way?\n\nBy Eric Wolff\n\nDarrell Issa, October 9, 2013, Washington, D.C. | \u00a9 All rights reserved by Congressman Darrell Issa\n\nTo anyone paying only casual attention to Congress, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican from Vista, has been a Congressional terrier to the Obama Administration\u2019s postal courier, dogging the President from the moment Issa became chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2010. Issa has spent four years holding hearings on everything from an IRS training fiesta at Disneyland to an attack at the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans died. But while his committee could have delivered the kind of partisan red meat the Republican base craved, he developed a reputation for brash behavior and dramatic remarks that overshadowed his own hearings, blunting the impact of the revelations he was delivering. His term as chairman ended in December, and, by some reports, Congressional leadership was happy to see him go.\n\nBut when he isn\u2019t chastising the executive branch and making headlines, another Issa emerges, a forceful advocate for government transparency, capable of working with Democrats and negotiating with the administration to pass open government legislation and whistleblower protections. In May, President Barack Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, a law that will expose federal spending in an online database, allowing Americans to know, for the first time, exactly how the federal government spends its money. Amid one of the least legislatively active Congresses of the last 60 years, Issa has advanced bills that will improve protections for whistleblowers, expand the Freedom of Information Act, and increase access for inspectors general. For a man who characterizes himself as ideologically close to the libertarian Cato Institute, and who said, \u201cCongress has passed enough laws,\u201d Issa is an impressive legislator.\n\nAn entire wall of Issa\u2019s Capitol Hill office is dedicated to framed certificates of patents he has received, a legacy of his past in the electronics business. He is the richest member of Congress, having made his fortune selling car alarms to major automakers. Outside of politics, he may be best known as the recorded voice of Viper car alarms that orders would-be car thieves to \u201cPlease step away from the car.\u201d\n\nHe launched himself into politics in 1998 when he ran in the Republican primary for California Senator. That bid was torpedoed by allegations of a shadowy past including an arrest, an indictment, and insinuations that he burned down one of his businesses for the insurance money. In 1999 he helped fund the recall of Governor Gray Davis. In 2000, he easily won election to Congress representing parts of San Diego, Orange, and Riverside counties. He has served seven terms in Congress and has never won by less than a double-digit spread.\n\nWhen he arrived, he expected to serve on committees related to his business, like Energy and Commerce. \u201cIt never occurred to me to get on Government Oversight,\u201d Issa says.\n\nIn 2003, retired Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the chairman at the time, recruited Issa to the committee. That year, Republicans held both the House of Representatives and the White House. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were already under way, and President George W. Bush\u2019s popularity was surging. Issa believes the committee did some good oversight, but he also conceded there were plenty of stones left unturned in deference to a same-party president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s legitimate criticism, because in the two years Henry Waxman [D-Calif.] was chairman during the Bush administration [2007\u201309], time and time again he came up with areas we hadn\u2019t pushed on that had merit,\u201d Issa says. \u201cThe ground was pretty fertile. You had six years in which it wasn\u2019t as aggressive as it could have been, and I think we all have to learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Obama took office and Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., now retired, took over chairmanship.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have an aggressive bone in his body,\u201d Issa says. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nHe planned to change all that.\n\n\u201cThe Oversight Committee exists to secure two fundamental principles,\u201d Issa intones from the dais at the start of every hearing. \u201cFirst, Americans have a right to know that the money Washington takes from them is well spent. And second, Americans deserve an efficient, effective government that works for them. Our duty on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is to protect these rights.\u201d\n\nRep. Issa opens a new Orange County office in Dana Point, September 3, 2013 | \u00a9 All rights reserved by Congressman Darrell Issa\n\nIssa began reciting this Law & Order-esque litany when he took over the chairmanship after the Republican wave election of 2010 as a way to give the committee direction. While other Congressional committees have oversight and budgetary authority over particular executive branch agencies, the Oversight Committee can issue subpoenas and launch investigations into nearly any subject, restricted only by the energy of its chairman and a willingness to fight turf battles with other committees. This broad mandate usually means that when different parties control the House and the presidency, the committee chairman is expected by his party leadership to score points on the administration.\n\nIn his time as chairman, Issa held 128 hearings (though he held more in the lame-duck session that started after Election Day). Of those, he dedicated 30 to government waste, while 14 were dedicated to the Affordable Care Act; 13 to the EPA; seven to the Fast & Furious scandal, in which the Justice Department allowed criminals to buy guns in the hopes of tracking them; 11 to the IRS; four to Benghazi; and three to Solyndra, a failed solar company backed by federal loan guarantees. Issa does not lack for aggressive bones.\n\nIssa\u2019s staff members point out the successes: Hearings on a sweetheart loan program for important personages led to an ethics investigation into loans received by four members of the House (three Republicans, one Democrat); the hearings on Fast & Furious led to a (largely partisan) House vote censuring Attorney General Eric Holder, the first censure against a sitting member of the cabinet. Revelations of partying by the IRS revealed no fraud, but motivated the IRS to cut spending on training by 80 percent, an inspector general report said. And hearings on whether the IRS office in Cincinnati targeted Tea Party groups for further scrutiny led to the resignation of Lois Lerner, an IRS official responsible for exempt organizations.\n\nYet for all the sound and fury, a common critique of Issa from the D.C. political class is that he hasn\u2019t wounded the President in a significant way, or that he has taken the focus off the issues and turned it to himself.\n\n\u201cIssa tends to get in the way of issues that could really energize the base,\u201d says Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIn February 2012, as Obama labored toward re-election amidst a struggling economy and weak poll numbers, Issa seized an opportunity to galvanize the Republican base with a hearing on whether Obamacare mandates related to birth control infringed on religious liberty. Of 11 witnesses called by the committee, nine were men, including the first panel heard. The move helped the Democrats paint Republicans as anti-woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to have that one back. That was bad optics,\u201d says Davis, the former committee chairman.\n\nIn March, Issa became the center of attention when he abruptly adjourned a hearing on the IRS targeting scandal. Lois Lerner, the IRS official, opted to take the Fifth Amendment in the midst of questioning by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee. Issa abruptly rose and adjourned the hearing, ordering staff to turn off the audio. The visual impression of a tall white man silencing an older black man was not lost on the Congressional Black Caucus. It demanded that House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, strip Issa of his chairmanship and require Issa to publicly apologize.\n\n\u201cMr. Issa is a disgrace and should not be allowed to continue in a leadership role,\u201d Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chair of the caucus, wrote in a letter to Boehner.\n\nIssa did apologize to Cummings, and the House never took up the censure. Cummings would later offer his own retort in the form of a minority report accusing Issa of using the same tactics as those used by Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWhen asked to describe his present relationship with Issa, Cummings, who had once had a productive legislative relationship with Issa, issued a statement more notable for what it didn\u2019t say: \u201cThe Oversight Committee has tremendous potential to improve the everyday lives of Americans, and I sincerely hope that whoever holds the chairman\u2019s gavel\u2014Republican or Democrat\u2014will work on a bipartisan basis to develop constructive reforms.\u201d\n\nThe mistakes and distractions have led some observers to think Republican leadership was growing frustrated with Issa. Last spring and summer, stories from Politico, Roll Call, and Breitbart.com all reported friction between Issa and House leadership, though none contained direct quotes offering an outright criticism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to leadership staff; they\u2019re frustrated with him,\u201d Ornstein says.\n\nIn May, Speaker Boehner announced there would be a special committee to investigate the deaths of Americans at Benghazi on September 11, 2012, adding fuel to the idea that Issa had lost the confidence of top Republican leaders. On November 21, the House Select Committee on Intelligence produced a report saying, in essence, there was no \u201cthere there.\u201d It cleared CIA officers working in Libya of any wrongdoing and said their \u201cactions saved lives.\u201d A spokesman for the Select Committee on Benghazi said the committee would review the report.\n\nA common critique of Issa is that he has taken the focus off the issues and turned it to himself.\n\nIssa says he has a solid relationship with House leadership, calling Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., a dear friend. He said the move on Benghazi was simply the resolution of a turf battle between himself and other committee chairmen who wanted control of the hearings. He cast the move as a victory for his view that Benghazi had been an administrative failure.\n\n\u201cThe select committee ultimately is a huge win for a determination that there really is a there there,\u201d Issa says.\n\nIn November, as Congress prepared to go back into session after five weeks spent running for office, Issa managed to get back in the headlines twice just days before he ran one of his last Oversight hearings as chairman of the committee.\n\nAt a November 6 book party for former reporter Sharyl Attkisson, Issa said his committee relied on driven journalists to get word of the committee\u2019s investigations out to the larger public. Without them, his committee \u201cis a desert island.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen an administration says \u2018no,\u2019 it\u2019s no different than when Andrew Jackson marched Indians down the Trail of Tears, to their death,\u201d Issa says, according to reports in Politico and Bloomberg Politics. \u201cThe fact is, the government will obey the administration\u2019s orders, if there isn\u2019t somebody to say \u2018Hold it, stop!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe titters and outrage from that gaffe had hardly diminished before Issa again became the center of attention, thanks to a social media stunt gone awry. Issa, or whichever staffer runs his Twitter account, offered to retweet pictures of family members who served in the military in honor of Veterans Day, according to the Daily Dot. The bait proved too sweet for trolls to resist, and Issa\u2019s account soon retweeted images of Heinrich Himmler, described as \u201cmy late grandfather,\u201d and Lee Harvey Oswald, described as \u201cUncle Lee,\u201d among other\n\nvillains of history.\n\nIssa\u2019s then-upcoming hearing on abuse of telework by officials at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had become an afterthought.\n\nHudson Hollister, now the executive director of the nonprofit Data Transparency Coalition, had just resigned his job at the Securities and Exchange Commission on the day in 2009 that he marched into Issa\u2019s office, resume in hand, to ask for a new gig. At the SEC, he\u2019d been laboring to persuade his superiors to standardize and digitize their data collection activities to improve transparency, but to little avail. He told Issa he thought the whole government should make its information available online. Issa hired him.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to move the government from documents to data,\u201d Hollister says.\n\nWhile switched-off microphones and accusations of sexism and government fraud make for the kind of melodrama that attracts attention from the press and the public, they are also the kind of white noise that tends to fade over the long history of Presidential\u2013Congressional relations. Issa\u2019s most lasting legacy will likely be shepherding through Congress laws intended to improve government oversight.\n\nHollister knew Issa had a technical background that might make him receptive to a digitization pitch. Issa knew computers. He said he learned to program both COBOL and FORTRAN, and in an interview he tossed off a programming joke about \u201cDo Loops.\u201d He realized the potential of digitizing government spending data after witnessing the success of Recovery.gov, a website that tracked spending from the stimulus appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nHaircut in the Senate Barber Shop on April 24, 2013 | \u00a9 All rights reserved by Congressman Darrell Issa Haircut in the Senate Barber Shop on April 24, 2013 | \u00a9 All rights reserved by Congressman Darrell Issa\n\nAfter taking over the Oversight Committee, Issa had a platform from which to push the issue. In consultation with now-ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. (\u201cA dear friend, I miss him\u201d), Issa proposed a bill that would standardize and digitize all government documents. But with Democrats in control of both the Senate and the presidency, he would need collaborators to get it done.\n\nTo help the bill in the Senate, he linked up with Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a fellow former businessman and the wealthiest man in the upper chamber, and he later pulled in Republican Rob Portman from Ohio. The heaviest opposition, though, came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which until this bill, was one of the few organizations that actually possessed spending data.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of palace intrigue within the Administration in the years-long fight over the DATA Act\u2014not ideological, not Republican versus Democrat\u2014but deeply entrenched figures in the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and other places that had been there before the Obama Administration and will be there after they leave,\u201d Issa says.\n\nMoving the bill would require numerous modifications, including lowering its sights from all government documents to just its spending, but in May President Obama signed the DATA Act into law.\n\nThe DATA Act does not stand alone among Issa\u2019s legislative achievements. Issa views whistleblowers, people deep in the operations of a business or federal bureaucracy who spot wrongdoing, as an essential element of transparency. He guided through Congress the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, a bill that expanded protections for federal talebearers, particularly those in the national security or intelligence communities.\n\nIn 2013, Issa attached an amendment to a House operations appropriation bill that would require the chamber to publish bulk data on the legislative process in an easily accessible format, a long-held desire of open government groups. He later withdrew the amendment, but House leadership changed operations and began publishing the data.\n\n\u201cMy view is that to eliminate the big problems in government in the way of waste and fraud and abuse of power is to give the most federal transparency to the entire world,\u201d Issa says.\n\nHollister would later leave Issa\u2019s employ to start his own nonprofit explicitly to provide outside pressure for the DATA Act\u2019s passage and implementation. While many congressional staffers leave government for high-paying private sector jobs, Hollister and two others of Issa\u2019s recent staff have founded nonprofits dedicated to government transparency.\n\nRepublicans limit their members to six years as senior representative on any given committee. Issa spent two years as the Ranking Member of the Oversight Committee, and then four years as its chairman. He expects to hold a senior role on the Judiciary committee, but it\u2019s not clear what the future is for his Congressional career. When Cantor lost his primary election earlier this year, Issa was not part of the conversation for the newly freed-up leadership roles.\n\nNow that his time running the committee has ended, Issa is less focused on what he did or did not accomplish than he is on finishing the work he started: Implementation of the DATA Act and getting the Senate to pass a reform to government information technology spending and improvements to the Freedom of Information Act, among others.\n\nHis passion for opening up government remains.\n\n\u201cEvery generation has to have people who do the job that I\u2019ve been honored to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThe moment government can sweep things under the rug, the first thing they sweep under the rug is a waste of your money; eventually what they\u2019re sweeping under the rug is an NSA project that\u2019s controlling everything, including elections.\u201d\n\nHe adds later: \u201cSince our founding, unnecessary secrets have caused the American people to be cheated by their government, out of their liberty and out of their money. That is the transparency that is most important to me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Darrell Issa, the richest member of Congress and a champion of open government, is no longer running the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.", "og": {"url": "http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/January-2015/The-Other-Darrell-Issa/", "image": "http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/January-2015/The-Other-Darrell-Issa/darrell-issa-congressman-san-diego.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Darrell Issa is no longer running the Committee on \r\nOversight and Government Reform.
