(Reuters) \u2013 Life-size sculptures of slave children haunt the clapboard church on the grounds of the old sugar cane plantation, where ceramic heads of black men will soon sway on pikes in the Louisiana breeze.\n\nUnlike other plantation museums along the Great River Road between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the newly opened and under-construction Whitney Plantation focuses squarely on the plight of slaves.\n\nWhile nearby sites highlight their antebellum architecture and the lifestyles of the white people who lived there, only 11 minutes of the roughly two-hour Whitney Plantation tour are devoted to the grand house where the German-American masters resided.\n\nMore time is spent with the granite slabs bearing the names of thousands of Louisiana slaves, interspersed with painful snippets of their narratives.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to have people with this color skin be educated,\u201d said John Cummings, the museum\u2019s 77-year-old founder, pointing to his own white arm. \u201cWhen you leave here you will be different.\u201d\n\nCummings, a retired trial attorney from New Orleans who made much of his fortune litigating mass disasters from deadly hotel fires to a sugar refinery explosion, has put more than $7.5 million, along with his advocate\u2019s zeal, into the plantation, which he bought 17 years ago from an oil company that planned to redevelop it.\n\nSome scenes from the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d were shot on and around the sprawling property, which was opened to the public as a museum last month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of great passion and he wants to share it with other people,\u201d said Norman Marmillion, who owns the nearby Laura Plantation museum, which unlike most others nearby does not shy from slavery but has Creole cultural history as its emphasis. \u201cHe just can\u2019t hold it in.\u201d\n\nIn one exhibit set to open later this year, 60 ceramic sculptures of black men\u2019s heads on pikes will commemorate a nearby 1811 slave revolt, often credited as the largest in U.S. history, which ended in mass beheadings.\n\nIn an old church donated by a black congregation stand or sit some 30 terra cotta sculptures of slave children, all of them without eyes, in the style of death masks.\n\nA bust of Pope Nicholas V, whose 15th century edicts sanctioned the Portuguese to enslave Africans, peers over them.\n\nSeven wooden slave shacks, two of them original to the property and all of them without the extravagance of a chair to sit on, line a trail to the rear of the main house.\n\nSuch displays \u201chelp the whites understand how blacks might carry anger and resentment with them,\u201d said Ferdinand Gaines Jr., pastor of First Antioch Baptist Church, which donated its old church building to the plantation.\n\nCummings\u2019 efforts, he added, also help remind black people that \u201cwe did come out of slavery but it wasn\u2019t all because of black power and black ingenuity. There were whites even back then who were supportive of liberating black people.\u201d\n\nCummings is also in the process of creating an on-site institute to further the study of slavery, and plans to restore a cluster of guest houses for visiting scholars.\n\nWhile the museum is fixated on the past, its mission is equally about the future.\n\nStanding in line at a Home Depot store recently, Cummings recalled, he began describing the plantation and its purpose to a young black construction worker, who responded that he hopes it will work, because when he is around white people, he always senses their thinking that he has done something wrong.\n\n\u201cWhat is that about?\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd what do we have to do to overcome that?\u201d\n\n(Editing by Jill Serjeant and Eric Walsh)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_242290513-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Louisiana plantation museum to focus on harsh realities of slavery"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Unlike other plantation museums along the Great River Road between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the newly opened and under-construction Whitney Plantation focuses squarely on the plight of slaves.\nAn African American runaway slave named Gordon entered the Union Army lines at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nSuch displays \u201chelp the whites understand how blacks might carry anger and resentment with them,\u201d said Ferdinand Gaines Jr., pastor of First Antioch Baptist Church, which donated its old church building to the plantation.\n(Reuters) \u2013 Life-size sculptures of slave children haunt the clapboard church on the grounds of the old sugar cane plantation, where ceramic heads of black men will soon sway on pikes in the Louisiana breeze.\nMore time is spent with the granite slabs bearing the names of thousands of Louisiana slaves, interspersed with painful snippets of their narratives."}
