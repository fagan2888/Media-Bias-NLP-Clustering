Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-Texas) decision to join Mercury One\u2019s border relief effort because the media is already starting to play \u201cpresidential games.\u201d\n\nMercury One, the charity Glenn Beck founded, will be in McAllen, Texas, on Saturday, passing out roughly $2 million in food, water, clothing and toys to illegal immigrant children. Beck and a number of volunteers will be there to help.\n\nBut as Beck said, while many news outlets, including MSNBC, have reported on the relief effort, few have said anything about Cruz\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cWhy is nobody covering this?\u201d Beck asked on his radio program Friday. \u201cThis came out yesterday. This is a big deal. Why is no one covering that Ted Cruz is going down to the border for a relief program?\u201d\n\nBeck said Cruz\u2019s involvement is scarcely being mentioned because the left has to paint the senator as a \u201chater,\u201d and some on the right don\u2019t want to help a conservative that is not part of the Republican \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey cannot cover Ted Cruz going down to the border,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThis gives Ted Cruz the ammo to be tough on immigration, to be tough on justice. Once you have mercy established, you have credibility to talk about justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush] were going down, I guarantee you Fox News would be covering it,\u201d Beck added. \u201cNBC would have cameras there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd the lack of coverage should tell you everything you need to know: We are already playing presidential games. We\u2019re already playing presidential games. Can\u2019t we not play games?\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
