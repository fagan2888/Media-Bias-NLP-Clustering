You know that Republican in your family who always tries to get into a political debate with you over Thanksgiving dinner? This year, they can argue with me instead. Chip in $3 or more now to be entered to win a call from me to your most conservative relative, on Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\nRemember, I\u2019ve spent my entire career arguing with top Republicans (and winning). I have graduate degrees from Harvard in public policy and law. Your Obamacare-hating, Fox-News-watching, anti-union uncle (or your aunt, brother, brother-in-law, I don\u2019t discriminate against right-wing nut jobs) doesn\u2019t stand a chance against me.\"\n\nFighting over the table with distant relatives about whether Obamacare is a sign of the pending apocalypse is a time-honored Thanksgiving tradition. Sometimes you're winning, and other times you maybe thinking, \"I wish U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson was here to help me stymie this conservative current.\"For all those Democrats with Republican relatives out there, Grayson has read your mind and for a few dollars could call your most conservative relative and debate them for you.From the horse's mouth, or in this case, his Tumblr page Grayson is currently running for Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio's seat against fellow Democrat U.S. Rep.
