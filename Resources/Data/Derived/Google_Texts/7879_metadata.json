The U.S. economy grew at a rollicking 5 percent rate in the third quarter. Oh, and it added 320,000 jobs in November, the best of its unprecedented 57 straight months of private-sector employment growth. Just in time for Christmas, the Dow just hit an all-time high and the uninsured rate is approaching an all-time low. Consumer confidence is soaring, inflation is low, gas prices are plunging, and the budget deficit is shrinking. You no longer hear much about the Ebola crisis that dominated the headlines in the fall, much less the border crisis that dominated the headlines over the summer. As Fox News host Andrea Tantaros proclaimed earlier this month: \u201cThe United States is awesome! We are awesome!\u201d\n\nOK, she was talking about the Senate torture report, not the state of the union, but things in the U.S. do look rather awesome. Mitt Romney promised to bring unemployment down to 6 percent in his first term; it\u2019s already down to 5.8 percent, half the struggling eurozone\u2019s rate. Newt Gingrich promised $2.50 gas; it\u2019s down to $2.38. Crime, abortion, teen pregnancy and oil imports are also way down, while renewable power is way up and the American auto industry is booming again. You don\u2019t have to give credit to President Barack Obama for \u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence,\u201d as he has started calling it, but there\u2019s overwhelming evidence the resurgence is real. The Chicken Littles who predicted a double-dip recession, runaway interest rates, Zimbabwe-style inflation, a Greece-style debt crisis, skyrocketing energy prices, health insurance \u201cdeath spirals\u201d and other horrors have been reliably wrong.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCome to think of it, the 62 percent of Americans who described the economy as \u201cpoor\u201d in a CNN poll a week before the Republican landslide in the midterm elections were also wrong. I guess that sounds elitist. Second-guessing the wisdom of the public may be the last bastion of political correctness; if ordinary people don\u2019t feel good about the economy, then the recovery isn\u2019t supposed to be real. But aren\u2019t the 11 million Americans who have landed new jobs since 2010 and the 10 million Americans who have gotten health insurance since 2013 ordinary Americans? It\u2019s true that wage growth has remained slow, but the overall economic trends don\u2019t jibe with the public\u2019s lousy mood. And the public definitely does get stuff wrong. A Bloomberg poll this month found that 73 percent of Americans think the deficit is getting bigger, while 21 percent think it\u2019s getting smaller and 6 percent aren\u2019t sure. In fact, the deficit has dwindled from about $1.2 trillion in 2009 to less than $500 billion in 2014. My favorite part is the mere 6 percent who admitted ignorance; 73 percent are definitely sure the shrinking deficit is actually growing.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that the midterm election\u2019s discontent was illegitimate. The point is that Americans should cheer up! Six years ago, the economy was contracting at an 8 percent annual rate and shedding 800,000 jobs a month. Those were Great Depression-type numbers. The government was pouring billions of dollars into busted banks, and experts like MIT\u2019s Simon Johnson were predicting that the bailouts would cost taxpayers as much as $2 trillion. In reality, the bailouts not only quelled the worst financial panic since the Depression, they made money for taxpayers. Nevertheless, last week, after the government sold its stake in Ally Bank, its last major holding in a financial institution, Johnson complained to The New York Times about the \u201cunfortunate and inappropriate message\u201d being sent by people pointing out the bailouts were actually profitable. In this holiday season, can\u2019t we be a little bit happy we didn\u2019t have to waste the $2 trillion he thought we were going to waste?\n\nThis bah-humbug brand of moral superiority has flourished since the crisis: How dare you celebrate this or that piece of economic data when so many Americans are still hurting? It\u2019s awkward to argue with that view, since many Americans are indeed still hurting. But the economic data keep showing that fewer Americans are hurting every month. No one is satisfied with 5.8 percent unemployment, but it\u2019s way better than the 10 percent we had in 2010 or the 11 percent Europe has today. Declining child poverty and household debt and personal bankruptcies are also worth celebrating. Better is better than worse. Whether or not you think Obamacare had anything to do with the slowdown in medical cost growth, it\u2019s a good thing that Medicare\u2019s finances have improved dramatically, extending the solvency of its trust fund by an estimated 13 years. It\u2019s a good thing that U.S. wind power has tripled and solar power has increased tenfold in five years. And while it\u2019s true that the meteoric rise of the stock market since 2009 has produced windfalls for Wall Street, it has also replenished state pension funds and 401(k) retirement plans and labor union coffers. It definitely beats the alternative.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: The press has a problem reporting good news. Two Americans died of Ebola and cable TV flipped out; now we\u2019re Ebola-free and no one seems to care. The same thing happened with the flood of migrant children across the Mexican border, which was a horrific crisis until it suddenly wasn\u2019t. Nobody\u2019s going to win a Pulitzer Prize for recognizing that we\u2019re smoking less, driving less, wasting less electricity and committing less crime. Police are killing fewer civilians, and fewer police are getting killed, but understandably, after the tragedies in Ferguson and Brooklyn, nobody\u2019s thinking about that these days. The media keep us in a perpetual state of panic about spectacular threats to our safety \u2014 Ebola, sharks, terrorism \u2014 but we\u2019re much likelier to die in a car accident. Although, it ought to be said, much less likely than we used to be; highway fatalities are down 25 percent in a decade.\n\nThe other problem in acknowledging good news, not just for the press but for the public, is that it has come to feel partisan, like an endorsement of whoever occupies the White House. Republican leaders have exacerbated this problem by describing everything Obama has done \u2014 his 2009 stimulus package, his 2010 Wall Street reforms, his 2013 tax hikes on high earners, his various anti-pollution regulations aimed at coal-fired power plants, and most of all Obamacare \u2014 as \u201cjob-killing\u201d catastrophes that would obliterate the economy. It\u2019s hard to point out that the economy is humming along nicely without making those doom-and-gloom predictions sound ill-advised and over-the-top. Because they were. Liberals who predicted disaster when Obama refused to nationalize the banking system during the financial crisis and when Republicans insisted on the harsh budget cuts in the 2013 \u201csequester\u201d were wrong, too. Disaster hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nAs ideologically inconvenient as that may be for chronic complainers on the left and right \u2014 and for pundit types invested in their bad-year-for-Obama narrative \u2014 it\u2019s wonderful for the country. You don\u2019t have to endorse Obama\u2019s economic philosophy to realize that it hasn\u2019t wreaked short-term havoc, just as you don\u2019t have to endorse the Obama or George W. Bush anti-terror philosophies to acknowledge that America hasn\u2019t endured a rash of terror attacks since 2001. Last week, polls finally found a majority of Americans recognizing that the economy is improving, which is to say a majority of Americans are recognizing reality. It\u2019s probably time for politicians to discover a new Ebola to scream about.\n\nThere is no shortage of candidates in this less-than-perfect union. The U.S. is still plagued by inadequate public schools, crumbling infrastructure, soaring college tuition costs, stark inequality. Many Americans want accountability for reckless bankers, torturers and fatal choke-holders. Washington is still almost as dysfunctional as everyone says it is. Congress this session really was the second least productive ever. And even though Obama is winding down the U.S. involvement in overseas wars, the world remains a scary place. There\u2019s still plenty to worry about.\n\nBut for now be merry! And may the new year be as awesome as this year.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Well, not everything.
