State Capitol – The Illinois Senate is taking steps to eliminate the states “pink tax”.

Lawmakers voted to exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax. The plan now heads to the Illinois House as part of a nationwide effort to eliminate the pink tax in each state.

The average statewide sales tax is 6.25%.

House lawmakers approved a plan that would make it easier and more affordable for women to access birth control on a 61-52 vote. The measure would put the state in line with provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
