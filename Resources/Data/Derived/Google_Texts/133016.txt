President Obama appointed former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon Wednesday to head a new federal commission to enhance U.S. cybersecurity.

The president also appointed former IBM CEO Sam Palmisano to be vice chair of the commission, which was created Feb. 9 to come up with recommendations for protecting government and private-sector data from hacking after a series of embarrassing cyberattacks.

Mr. Obama is meeting with both men later Wednesday in the Oval Office. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the commission will “set the country on a path of ensuring cybersecurity over the next decade.”

The panel is to give Mr. Obama its recommendations for action by the end of this year.
