No real estate agents, no repairs \u2014 heck, you might not even have to sweep the floor.\n\nIf San Francisco start-up OpenDoor.com has its way, that'll be the future of real estate.\n\n\"A house is the largest asset that many people have, but selling it is a stressful, painful process that's been largely untouched by technology. We think we can change that,\" says Eric Wu of OpenDoor, which aims to buy homes practically sight unseen.\n\nOpenDoor, which began operations recently in its first market (Phoenix, Ariz.), allows sellers to enter some basic information over the Web, then runs some quick analytics on a property and comes back with a purchase offer \u2014 usually within minutes.\n\nRead More: Should You Pull Your House Off the Market Till Spring?\n\nIf you accept, the company can close the sale in as little as three days, although OpenDoor might do an on-site inspection to verify the home's condition.
