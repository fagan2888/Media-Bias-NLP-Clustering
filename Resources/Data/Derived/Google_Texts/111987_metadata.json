But it did direct the Air Force to keep 171 jets ready for combat, an acknowledgement of the fiscal 2015 joint defense policy legislation that allowed the service to shift up to 36 Warthogs into back-up status and shuffle crews from the A-10 to the F-35 program.\n\nThe House and Senate Appropriations panels followed suit, setting aside millions in their respective spending bills to keep the A-10 flying next fiscal year.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers have hit some roadblocks in trying to conference together their defense policy roadmaps, but the language protecting the A-10 from retirement is expected to survive.\n\nAnd while the defense spending bills are stuck in limbo, many in Washington predict the Air Force will once again try to scrap the A-10 when the Pentagon rolls out its fiscal year 2017 spending request early next year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Air Force didn\u2019t help its long-standing argument that the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet should be retired when the service announced this week it would deploy some of the aircraft to Europe this fall.", "title": "Eyeing Russia, the Air Force Sends More A-10 Warthogs to Europe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Eyeing-Russia-Air-Force-Sends-More-10-Warthogs-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/a10-warthog.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Eyeing-Russia-Air-Force-Sends-More-10-Warthogs-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/a10-warthog.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Air Force didn\u2019t help its long-standing argument that the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet should be retired when the service announced this week it would deploy some of the aircraft to Europe this fall.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bcd\"", "article_summary": "In March, the Air Force deployed a dozen A-10s from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona to Romania and the Czech Republic.\nThe Air Force has waged a years-long campaign to scrap its A-10 fleet in a bid to save roughly $4 billion.\nThe Air Force didn\u2019t help its long-standing argument that the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet should be retired when the service announced this week it would deploy more of the aircraft to Europe this fall.\nHouse and Senate lawmakers have hit some roadblocks in trying to conference together their defense policy roadmaps, but the language protecting the A-10 from retirement is expected to survive.\nAnd while the defense spending bills are stuck in limbo, many in Washington predict the Air Force will once again try to scrap the A-10 when the Pentagon rolls out its fiscal year 2017 spending request early next year."}
