Sam Johnson (R-TX), the chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee overseeing the SSA, ordered the Social Security Inspector General Pat O\u2019Carroll to review the agency\u2019s management practices, adding that it should be the IG\u2019s number one priority.\n\n\u201cLeave no stone unturned,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFind out how this could happen and what Social Security can do to stop it. The rip-off of taxpayers by professional fraudsters has to end, and it must end now.\u201d\n\nRelated: New Evidence That Disability Fraud Costs Billions\n\nThe hearing comes just one week after 106 people were indicted for allegedly attempting to defraud the government by collecting more than $23 million in Social Security Disability benefits for which they did not actually qualify. The investigation into the fraud scheme revealed that some of the people indicted were retired New York police officers or firefighters who falsely reported a mental illness stemming from responding to the tragic events of the Sept 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in order to obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in benefits.\n\n\"The exploitation by many of the defendants in this case of the tragic events of September 11, 2001 is nothing short of infuriating,\u201d the inspector general said. \u201cTo do so makes a mockery of the lives lost that day and the heroism and integrity of the NYPD and Fire Department of New York City (FDNY) personnel who were there during and after the attacks.\u201d\n\nThis was only the latest fraud scheme that has bilked the agency out of millions of dollars.\n\nLast August more than 70 people were indicted in Puerto Rico after a two-year investigation into Social Security disability payments. According to The New York Times, three doctors and a former SSA employee were charged with helping people falsify their applications in order to qualify for the benefits.\n\n\u201cThe public is fast losing faith in Social Security, and I don\u2019t blame them, because I have too. And while I fully recognize that there will always be bad apples, what is going on these days is very different,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThis is a program plagued by fraud conspiracies.\u201d\n\nRelated: $600 Million Paid to Dead Federal Workers\n\nThe SSA is responsible for administering hundreds of billions in benefits each year to the disabled as well as older Americans. In 2013, nearly 58 million Americans received $816 billion in Social Security benefits, according to the agency\u2019s website.\n\nDespite media coverage surrounding the high profile fraud schemes, SSA officials say fraud at the agency is rare. Testifying before the committee, SSA\u2019s Acting Commissioner Carolyn Colvin, told lawmakers that her agency is doing a sufficient job of preventing fraud, but said SSA has been severely hampered by budget cuts and would need more funding.\n\n\u201cIf we are to keep the incidence of fraud in the disability program low, we need support from both the public and Congress,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cContinued success also requires a sustained commitment of resources to ensure the integrity of the disability program.\u201d Colvin noted that in the last two years, Congress appropriated $421 million less for \u201cprogram integrity reviews\u201d than was authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nRelated: Massive Benefit Scams Rip Millions from Taxpayers\n\n\u201cThe net effect has been the loss of nearly 11,000 employees at Social Security\u2014that means drastically fewer people standing watch for the next attempted theft and drastically fewer people available to serve those who truly need us,\u201d Colvin said.\n\nHowever, she added that the current omnibus bill that Congress is poised to pass shortly includes full funding of the program integrity reviews, which would help the review process and potentially save \u201cbillions of taxpayer\u2019s dollars.\u201d\n\nFor now, the committee has instructed Colvin\u2019s office to report to Congress within 30 days detailing what the SSA is doing to prevent further crimes from occurring, as well as to include any recommendations for legislation that might help mitigate more fraud.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just tell us about what you did. It\u2019s clearly not been enough,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd do not just say you need more money when the fact is that Social Security has utterly failed to protect taxpayer dollars in the first place. Social Security must first regain the trust of the American taxpayer before it can credibly argue for more money.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress is demanding a \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d investigation into the Social Security Adminis", "title": "Social Security Cheats Bilk Taxpayers in the Billions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/17/Social-Security-Cheats-Bilk-Taxpayers-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06012011_SocialSecurity_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/17/Social-Security-Cheats-Bilk-Taxpayers-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06012011_SocialSecurity_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Congress is demanding a \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d investigation into the Social Security Adminis", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2e8\"", "article_summary": "Last August more than 70 people were indicted in Puerto Rico after a two-year investigation into Social Security disability payments.\n\u201cFind out how this could happen and what Social Security can do to stop it.\n\u201cThe public is fast losing faith in Social Security, and I don\u2019t blame them, because I have too.\nSocial Security must first regain the trust of the American taxpayer before it can credibly argue for more money.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nIn 2013, nearly 58 million Americans received $816 billion in Social Security benefits, according to the agency\u2019s website."}
