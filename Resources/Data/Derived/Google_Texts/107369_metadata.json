Specifically, the justices asked on March 29 for both parties to suggest different procedures in whih the religious nonprofit would not be involved in providing birth control.\n\nAt the oral arguments, a key question was the role that the nonprofit plays in facilitating birth control coverage. Petitioners for the nonprofits referred to forms the nonprofits had to fill out to facilitate coverage. Regulations require employers to notify the federal government that they want the accommodation.\n\nThe Obama administration said the accommodation requires some form of \"written self-certification, but do not mandate any particular form.\"\n\nThe government is open to a different type of \"written certification.\" However, the administration was concerned about how such an approach would work for self-insured plans.\n\nIf an employer has a self-insured plan, the obligation to provide contraception coverage falls only on the plan since there is no insurer with a pre-existing duty to provide coverage.\n\nThe nonprofits, meanwhile, said in their filing that the federal government can provide birth control to employees without \"requiring petitioners to surrender their health plans to serve as vehicles for the provision of contraceptive coverage.\"\n\nA decision by the Supreme Court is expected in June.\n\nCurrently, there are only eight justices on the court, after the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIf the court votes 4-4, the lower court's ruling would stand. Nine courts have ruled on the birth control cases, eight of which went for the government and one for the nonprofits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government gave some leeway in its response to the Supreme Court in a case challenging Obamacare's birth control mandate.\nThe court is weighing whether a compromise called an accommodation violates the religious beliefs of religious nonprofits such as charities and universities.
