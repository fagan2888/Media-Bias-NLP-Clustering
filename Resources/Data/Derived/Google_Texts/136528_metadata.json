Here it is, and in just a few short weeks, it'll be all mine.\"\n\nBut the vision Russell had reached far beyond his own \"Funtown Mountain.\"\n\n\"We are making efforts to brand Cave City as the \"Roadside Attraction Capital of America, and it really does work.\"\n\nRussell cited the close proximity of the businesses as one reason he felt the branding efforts would succeed, but that was far from the only reason.\n\nHe felt strongly that families already viewed Cave City as an affordable and family-fun environment, and he said having the interstate nearby didn't hurt, either.\n\n\"I-65 is one of the most heavily trafficked arteries in the country, and we know that 2 million visitors go to Mammoth Cave annually. About a quarter of those will get off at Exit 53 here in Cave City, and go through Cave City.\"\n\nIt was obvious that Russell had done his research, and he said he had plenty of time to think everything over. Though his life was full of excitement on Saturday, he hadn't always been so fortunate.\n\n\"You know, my life has been very interesting. In the 90s I was homeless for a period, got into a lot of trouble. I kind of straightened up my act, went back to school, got a degree and then started working.\"\n\nSaturday, there were no signs of those struggles written across his face.\n\n\"I think that you would have a hard time arguing that I am not the luckiest man in Kentucky.\"\n\nRussell was set to officially close on the property on Wednesday, May 27, and the park had an opening date of June 19.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will Russell said he had always wanted to own a roadside attraction, and Funtown Mountain was going to make that dream come true.", "language": "english", "author": "Whitney Davis", "og": {"url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Fun-Town-Mountain-A-Lifelong-Dream-For-New-Owner-304824001.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/cave_city_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Will Russell said he had always wanted to own a roadside attraction, and Funtown Mountain was going to make that dream come true.", "title": "\"Funtown Mountain\" A Lifelong Dream For New Owner"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will Russell said he had always wanted to own a roadside attraction, and Funtown Mountain was going to make that dream come true.", "creator": "@wbkotv", "url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Fun-Town-Mountain-A-Lifelong-Dream-For-New-Owner-304824001.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/cave_city_logo.jpg", "site": "@wbkotv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 127798975567, "pages": 63322919917}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "JEsUJ-apax7vWIA6vgCv7Vo4tJmOvw3rjQlzmYfV01M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Funtown Mountain A Lifelong Dream"}, "article_summary": "About a quarter of those will get off at Exit 53 here in Cave City, and go through Cave City.\"\n\"We are making efforts to brand Cave City as the \"Roadside Attraction Capital of America, and it really does work.\"\nBut the vision Russell had reached far beyond his own \"Funtown Mountain.\"\nHe felt strongly that families already viewed Cave City as an affordable and family-fun environment, and he said having the interstate nearby didn't hurt, either.\n\"It's always been my dream to have a roadside attraction of my very own."}
