He threw mostly fastballs and changeups, with a few curveballs at the end of the session.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ahead of where they expected me to be, throwing-wise, so that\u2019s always good,\u201d Chatwood said. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to set a schedule, but the plan is to come back this season.\u201d\n\nChatwood\u2019s first Tommy John surgery came when he was 16 and playing for Redlands East Valley High School in Southern California.\n\n\u201cI feel like that surgery went smoothly, and this has gone ever better,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel better and I\u2019m more confident. I\u2019m doing rehab every day, so that\u2019s a lot different than high school.\u201d\n\nChatwood has been traveling with the team because it helps him stay connected.\n\n\u201cThe mental part is sometimes the toughest part, so it\u2019s good to be around the guys,\u201d he said.\n\nManager Walt Weiss said Chatwood is ahead of schedule, \u201cbut still a ways out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been ahead of schedule all along,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut with his history and this being his second (surgery), we are going to take our time and make sure he\u2019s ready to go out and compete.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thinks Chatwood can return to the big leagues this season, Weiss deferred, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s such a ways out, I don\u2019t want to put expectations on Tyler right now. He\u2019s coming back from a tough injury and it\u2019s been a pretty tough road for him. But he\u2019s doing very well.\u201d\n\nIn 70 big-league games (61) starts, Chatwood is 20-22 with a 4.34 ERA.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tyler Chatwood,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Rockies right-hander Tyler Chatwood, who underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time last July, threw a 40-pitch bullpen session on Sunday.", "title": "Rockies' Tyler Chatwood ahead of schedule after Tommy John", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/05/24/rockies-tyler-chatwood-ahead-of-schedule-after-tommy-john-surgery/20141/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/06/tyler-chatwood-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rockies right-hander Tyler Chatwood, who underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time last July, threw a 40-pitch bullpen session on Sunday.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Tyler Chatwood ahead of schedule after Tommy John surgery", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/05/24/rockies-tyler-chatwood-ahead-of-schedule-after-tommy-john-surgery/20141/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/06/tyler-chatwood-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rockies right-hander Tyler Chatwood, who underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time last July, threw a 40-pitch bullpen session on Sunday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c66\"", "article_summary": "Manager Walt Weiss said Chatwood is ahead of schedule, \u201cbut still a ways out.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s been ahead of schedule all along,\u201d Weiss said.\nTyler Chatwood has tunnel vision.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ahead of where they expected me to be, throwing-wise, so that\u2019s always good,\u201d Chatwood said.\nThe 25-year-old right-hander, who underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time last July, threw a 40-pitch bullpen on Sunday.\nBut he\u2019s doing very well.\u201dIn 70 big-league games (61) starts, Chatwood is 20-22 with a 4.34 ERA."}
