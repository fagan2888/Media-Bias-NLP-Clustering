Dr. Cheryl Whitaker has started another health care business.

The medical doctor and businesswoman, who counts President Barack Obama among her friends, this week announced the launch of NextLevel Health Illinois, which will work with the state to provide care to black and Latino men and others under the poverty line who are now eligible for Medicaid.

Dr. Whitaker, 47, is chairman and CEO of NextLevel Health, which has been approved by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services to help administer programming to Cook County residents. Illinois is among 26 states that said yes to expanding Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act.

“This is taxpayer money. We want to be vigilant about controlling costs, but it's also about providing quality care and getting to the outcomes we want for people's health,” Dr. Whitaker told me.

The work fits right into her professional background. Dr. Whitaker has a master's in public health from the Harvard School of Public Health and got her medical degree from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

“I consider this a culmination of a lifetime of work,” she said.

Dr. Whitaker remains a partner in Whitaker Kinne Group LLC, a company she helped found a year ago that advises companies on health care and Medicaid issues.

Her husband, who's also in the same field, isn't part of the new company but is “part of the brain trust,” she said.

Dr. Eric Whitaker is a physician-turned-businessman who is a development consultant at Grosvenor Capital Management LP.
