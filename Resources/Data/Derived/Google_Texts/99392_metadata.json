You may have left with more than butterflies. According to Dutch researchers, the average 10-second french kiss can result in the exchange of around 80 million pieces of bacteria.\n\nAnd they have the data to prove it.\n\nTwenty-one couples recently volunteered to kiss for science. This all went down at the Amsterdam Royal Artis Zoo in 2012. The Dutch researchers studying bacteria surveyed the kissing habits of each partner in each couple with questions like, \u201cHow often do you kiss? and \u201cWhen did you last kiss?\u201d Researchers then swabbed each partner\u2019s tongues for \u201csalivary microbiota,\u201d before and after a \u201ccontrolled kissing experiment\u201d (read: a tightly timed 10 seconds).\n\nThen there was a second kiss. One member of the couple was asked to swig some probiotic yogurt beforehand. This made it easier to look at the bacteria from the yogurt both on the tongue of the person who drank it \u2014 and the tongue of the person who didn\u2019t.\n\nSo what do we learn?\n\nTurns out shared microbiota can actually survive on another person\u2019s tongue. Samples of oral flora from the partner were more similar than those drawn from randomly selected passersby.\n\nBut despite this robust sharing of bacteria, not all of it is there to stay. Professor Remco Kort of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the group that conducted the study, told the BBC that \u201conly some bacteria transferred from a kiss seemed to take hold on the tongue.\u201d\n\nKort explained that in the end, kissing may be the least important factor. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter whether the couples said they french kissed nine times a day or nine times a year. Obviously, there are other important factors involved such as sharing the same diet or using the same toothpaste for example.\u201d Nevertheless \u201cthese types of investigations may help us design future bacterial therapies and help people with troublesome bacterial problems.\u201d\n\nNow this knowledge can be yours. The researchers partnered with Micropia, the world\u2019s first microbe museum, to create an exhibit called the \u201cKiss-O-Meter\u201d which allows couples to take a look at their own shared bacteria.\n\nHow romantic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That kiss last night?
