(KSN) \u2013 Republicans flocked to Century II in Wichita Saturday to caucus for the GOP\u2019s field of presidential hopefuls.\n\nTwo of those candidates, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, were on hand to encourage those attending to support them.\n\nDuring a rally, Cruz told his supporters he was there for something more important than politics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because our country is in crisis,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cWe\u2019re here because we love our kids and grandkids, and we love freedom and our constitution, and we want our country back.\u201d\n\nCruz also spoke about his plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his plans to launch a federal investigation of Planned Parenthood. He also promised to protect Second Amendment rights.\n\nAlso before the GOP Caucus, Donald Trump held a rally that was attended by thousands of people. During the rally, Trump took shots at President Obama, Mitt Romney and his three remaining opponents.\n\nHe also said that he made the stop in Kansas because he felt it was important to do so.\n\n\u201cI wanted in Kansas, I wanted to be here so badly, so I was headed in another direction I told the pilot, \u2018We\u2019re going to Kansas\u2019,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time this morning because in a few minutes we have to go over and Caucus. Who\u2019s ready to vote? Who\u2019s got the right to vote raise your hand? Good, good.\u201d\n\nOne of those who also took the stage was Kansas Fourth District Congressman Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cYou see all the cameras out here today?\u201d asked Pompeo. \u201cYou see all the attention we\u2019re getting here in Kansas?\u201d\n\nKansas politics was hot this weekend, but not everyone at the GOP caucus appreciated the long lines.\n\nErin Winfrey and Bailey Pankraft said they had both been waiting in line a couple of hours to caucus.\n\nCarol Fry also had to wait two hours to caucus for her candidate. But, she said despite the long line she was pleased with the turnout.\n\n\u201cThrilled to death, it\u2019s wonderful that people care and are really wanting to do something about it,\u201d said Fry.\n\nThe lines were so long there was some concern that people waiting wouldn\u2019t be able to cast their votes before the caucus ended at 2 p.m. HOwever, GOP officials made sure everyone who was in line at two o\u2019clock got to vote.\n\nThe Trump Rally before the GOP Caucus wasn\u2019t peaceful for some.\n\nThere were several outbursts and some protesters in the crowd. A small group of people wearing a yellow Star of David with the word \u201cMuslim\u201d written it were removed from the Donald Trump event. They were escorted out by law enforcement after they shouted, \u201cMuslims are Americans, too\u201d in protest of Trump\u2019s being on the record as saying the government needs to keep track of Muslims in America.\n\nAs the group was being escorted out, some in the audience shouted at them to go back to their country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for people to understand that I was born and raised here,\u201d said Jennifer Frahet one of the protester. \u201cI\u2019ve known no other home, this is my home, this is my country\u2026 It\u2019s just kind of sad that we don\u2019t belong in our own home. No one likes that feeling.\u201d\n\nTrump never missed a beat, mentioning them briefly in his speech, and said they were not loud enough to be a problem.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Wichita State University campus Democrats held their own caucus. It began inside the Campus Activity Center, but was moved outdoors due to the large number of people who showed up.\n\nAt one point, the line to enter the caucus wrapped around the CAC. Officials at the event said they would not turn anyone away because of the long lines.\n\nOne of those caucusing for Bernie Sanders was Miranda Conley. She thought the caucus got a late start.\n\n\u201cIt should have been done a little earlier so not as many people had left, but I think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Conley. \u201cYou can see a little bit more of how many people are on each side and it\u2019s not so crowded. And it\u2019s a nice day, so that\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nOne Hillary Clinton supporter said moving the caucus outside was a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot of people there. So there\u2019s not are not a lot of accommodation in there. So moving outside is easier.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Caucus expects to post its results later tonight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WICHITA, Kan.
