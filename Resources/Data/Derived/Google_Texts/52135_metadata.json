The Tea Party movement had sprung up a year earlier. The Democrats had absolute control over the House and the Senate and they had the White House.\n\nThe Tea Party movement brought to the national spotlight the call of the American people for less government. The American people said in no uncertain terms, they wanted Washington out of their lives. The stunning 2010 election victories by the Republicans were based on not only displeasure with the Democrats but also on the promises of the Republicans to restore small government.\n\nIn 2010 and in 2014, Republican after Republican came and bowed before the altar of small government. From now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to House Speaker John Boehner and down the ranks, almost every Republican promised to shrink government. They promised to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Obamacare exchange has imploded, despite $205 million in federal funding. Even the very blue state of Hawaii realizes this is a disaster and the state will not appropriate $28 million to help bail the exchange out.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court may well strike a death blow to Obamacare but the Republicans are already planning subsidies to last until 2017 for those who lose them. But as everyone knows, once a subsidy is created in Washington, it never ends.\n\nNow a Republican doctor who is a member of Congress is trying to protect doctors from their screw-ups and imposing a massive big government solution. Rep. Tom Price from Georgia, a Republican who claims he supports smaller government, has introduced something called the \u201cEmpowering Patients First Act.\u201d Among other things, Mr. Price wants to federalize medical malpractice cases. According to Mr. Price\u2019s bill, in all medical malpractice cases, states will be forced to use medical guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMedical malpractice cases are traditionally the domain of the states. The Tenth Amendment specifically states that all powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states.\n\nAs bad as Obamacare is, another big one size fits all solution from the government in Washington is just as bad. Perhaps it is even worse that this solution is coming from a Republican who allegedly believes in small government.\n\nIn 2010, medical mistakes killed 120,000 people in the United States. That same year, 31,000 Americans died from gunfire.\n\nOn average doctors kill four times as many people in a year than guns do.\n\nWhen doctors are sued for malpractice, they have insurance that covers the bill and except in extraordinary circumstances, the doctor is not even disciplined.\n\nThe civil jury trial is the one remedy the average citizen has against a doctor gone bad. Doctors and their insurance carriers have done a good job of demonizing victims of medical malpractice and lawyers who represent people who die or are injured at the hands of doctors.\n\nAmerica\u2019s founding fathers thought so highly of the jury trial, it is the only right specifically protected in the Bill of Rights twice. Cronyists like Mr. Price are only interested in protecting bad doctors and big insurance companies. America does not need more big government from Washington.\n\nAmerica needs more Republicans who believe in the U.S. Constitution and smaller government, and who are willing to say no to the cronyists in D.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years ago, a movement began sweeping the nation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Five years ago, a movement began sweeping the nation.", "title": "JUDSON PHILLIPS: Republicans, like Dems, smooch with big government", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/15/judson-phillips-republicans-like-dems-smooch-with-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/11/27/B3_Knight_GG_3WEB_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/11/27/B3_Knight_GG_3WEB_1.jpg", "description": "Five years ago, a movement began sweeping the nation.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "JUDSON PHILLIPS: Republicans, like Dems, smooch with big government"}, "Author": "Judson Phillips", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Health Medical Pharma, Washington, Tom Price"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8aa\"", "article_summary": "Cronyists like Mr. Price are only interested in protecting bad doctors and big insurance companies.\nAs bad as Obamacare is, another big one size fits all solution from the government in Washington is just as bad.\nIn 2010 and in 2014, Republican after Republican came and bowed before the altar of small government.\nAccording to Mr. Price\u2019s bill, in all medical malpractice cases, states will be forced to use medical guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.\nMedical malpractice cases are traditionally the domain of the states."}
