(Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights Understanding trends in health and wellness helps us focus our resources and attention.\n\nToo many adults in Tennessee still smoke, are inactive or obese.\n\nIn an annual checkup of our nation\u2019s health, Tennessee ranked 43rd among all 50 states in 2015. As a state, we made incremental progress but still need to improve in the areas of tobacco use, level of physical activity, obesity, diabetes, immunizations for children and infant mortality. Those findings come from United Health Foundation\u2019s America\u2019s Health Rankings Annual Report, which has been measuring national and state health for just over a quarter of a century.\n\nAs a physician and medical director for UnitedHealthcare in Tennessee, I always look forward to the America\u2019s Health Rankings Annual Report because it offers an overview of where we stand in health, both as a nation and relative to our peer states. The report provides a reflection of Tennessee\u2019s health that is at once sobering and encouraging. While Tennessee performs well compared with other states in its low prevalence of excessive drinking, too many adults still smoke, are inactive or obese.\n\nUnitedHealthcare actively supports Healthier Tennessee, an initiative of the Governor\u2019s Foundation for Health and Wellness. Healthier Tennessee aims to improve the state\u2019s health by increasing residents\u2019 physical activity, encouraging healthier diets and reducing tobacco use.\n\nAnother program making a difference in Tennessee is UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Baby Blocks, a proven mobile, interactive incentive program to encourage pregnant women and new parents to make and keep doctor appointments during pregnancy and the first 15 months of their baby\u2019s life. Women who enroll can earn rewards for completing prenatal, postpartum and healthy-baby appointments; receive appointment alerts and wellness-related text messages; and connect directly with maternity nurses. Rewards include gift cards to retail outlets and maternity-related items such as teething rings, diaper bags and thermometers.\n\nMeasuring and monitoring our nation\u2019s health has never been more important, and the results of this year\u2019s America\u2019s Health Rankings Annual Report show how far we\u2019ve come in the last 26 years \u2014 and how far we still have to go as a country.\n\nUnderstanding trends in health and wellness helps us focus our resources and attention. This year\u2019s data show that as a nation, Americans are smoking less and living less sedentary lifestyles; however, our country is facing complex health challenges that threaten Americans\u2019 health and quality of life. Obesity and diabetes are at all-time highs, and rates of drug deaths \u2014 including illegal and prescription drug abuse \u2014 and children living in poverty are on the rise.\n\nIn 2016, America\u2019s Health Rankings will publish new reports that will enable us to track these challenges more closely, so that they can be addressed more effectively. These include new reports on the health of select populations, such as mothers and children and our nation\u2019s veterans, as well as \u201cspotlight\u201d reports on key public health topics. The goal is to offer more information to help improve public health.\n\nWhen it comes to the future of Tennessee\u2019s and America\u2019s health, we are all in it together. Let\u2019s commit now to making the changes necessary to ensure that we build a healthier tomorrow today.\n\nKaren Cassidy, M.D., is market medical director for UnitedHealthcare of Tennessee.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1RI00BA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our country faces complex health challenges that threaten our health and quality of life.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Our country faces complex health challenges that threaten our health and quality of life.", "title": "Building a healthier Tennessee takes commitment", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/01/25/building-healthier-tennessee-takes-commitment/79189086/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our country faces complex health challenges that threaten our health and quality of life.", "title": "Building a healthier Tennessee takes commitment", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07f2b931b8acaf9aa923540c60cdb24a6bde2dbe/c=179-0-1715-1536&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Obesity", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Obesity", "title": "Building a healthier Tennessee takes commitment", "author": "Karen Cassidy", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7fe46b67c01cae4b1b0b433cfa4b3d351fb8282/c=329-0-1481-1536/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0783192e71cfa63cccc2aeebe288389dab2e084c/c=179-0-1715-1536/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab9a79c377d675f10f80155208fdb22d6b90536e/c=0-0-2048-1536/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b61c280edbaee02837188b65ef5559626206a8a7/c=142-142-1650-994&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-24T23:04:06.080000-06:00", "shorthed": "Let\u2019s build a healthier Tennessee", "articleid": 79189086, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43a0caf1664656a70e6e861cfe6ccceb79038bff/c=142-142-1650-994/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6db364786a007e57b7e204091a96e9af01bfb794/c=456-0-1316-1536/local/-/media/2016/01/22/Nashville/B9320623014Z.1_20160122162429_000_GHQD81ALV.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Healthier Tennessee aims to improve the state\u2019s health by increasing residents\u2019 physical activity, encouraging healthier diets and reducing tobacco use.\nUnitedHealthcare actively supports Healthier Tennessee, an initiative of the Governor\u2019s Foundation for Health and Wellness.\nThose findings come from United Health Foundation\u2019s America\u2019s Health Rankings Annual Report, which has been measuring national and state health for just over a quarter of a century.\nIn an annual checkup of our nation\u2019s health, Tennessee ranked 43rd among all 50 states in 2015.\nWhen it comes to the future of Tennessee\u2019s and America\u2019s health, we are all in it together."}
