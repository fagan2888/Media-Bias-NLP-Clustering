We remember it, mostly, because of how the GOP more or less avoided all of the policy advice (example, paraphrased: \u201cdon\u2019t be so nativist\u2026 please?\u201d) and still won a hundred billion seats everywhere in 2014. That may come back to haunt the GOP in 2016, when there\u2019s a completely different electorate, but at least it gave the RNC a hollow opportunity to declare its post-2012 revamping \u201csuccessful\u201d and continue raising funds.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the DNC to do the same thing. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who for some mind-blowing reason still chairs the DNC following November\u2019s shit show, has commissioned her own \u201cDemocratic Victory Task Force\u201d to produce a report. Its initial findings will be presented in February with final recommendations due mid-year. \u201cThis diverse group of Democratic Party officials, strategists and advocates,\u201d Wasserman Schultz announced, \u201cwill each bring with them expertise from their fields to collaborate on a holistic review of the Party\u2019s past performance and present actionable areas for improvement moving forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficials, strategists, and advocates.\u201d Look at the list and determine which area of expertise the task force tilts toward:\n\nThe committee is made up of Democratic fundraiser Naomi Aberly, Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, DNC Vice-Chair Donna Brazile, political operative Maria Cardona, party lawyer Marc Elias, former Obama digital guru Teddy Goff, marketing and event planning veteran Maneesh Goyal, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio, AFSCME President Lee Saunders and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt.\n\nDon\u2019t know about you, but I see basically two (2) policy-ish people on that list: a labor leader and a governor. Otherwise we have a explicit fundraiser \u2014 they\u2019re all fundraisers, in one way or another \u2014 a lawyer, an operative, a \u201cdigital guru,\u201d an event planner(???), a state party operative, and Donna Brazile, who is cool, but also a campaign operative by training.
