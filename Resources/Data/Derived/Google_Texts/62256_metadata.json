Often they appear one after the other across the media circuit, bobbing from celebrity television pundit to erudite newspaper outlet.\n\nA few years ago, BBC Newsnight proudly hosted a \u201cdebate\u201d between Maajid Nawaz, director of counter-extremism think-tank, the Quilliam Foundation, and Anjem Choudary, head of the banned Islamist group formerly known as al-Muhajiroun, which has, since its proscription, repeatedly reincarnated itself. One of its more well-known recent incarnations was \u201cIslam4UK\u201d.\n\nBoth Nawaz and Choudary have received huge mainstream media attention, generating press headlines, and contributing to major TV news and current affairs shows. But unbeknown to most, they have one thing in common: Britain\u2019s security services. And believe it or not, that bizarre fact explains why the Islamic State\u2019s (IS) celebrity beheader, former west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi \u2013 aka \u201cJihadi John\u201d \u2013 got to where he is now.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nA tale of two extremists\n\nAfter renouncing his affiliation with the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), Maajid Nawaz co-founded the Quilliam Foundation with his fellow ex-Hizb member, Ed Husain.\n\nThe Quilliam Foundation was set-up by Husain and Nawaz in 2008 with significant British government financial support. Its establishment received a massive PR boost from the release of Ed Husain\u2019s memoirs, The Islamist, which rapidly became an international bestseller, generating hundreds of reviews, interviews and articles.\n\nIn Ed Husain\u2019s book \u2013 much like Maajid Nawaz\u2019s tome Radical released more recently to similar fanfare \u2013 Husain recounts his journey from aggrieved young Muslim into Islamist activist, and eventually his total rejection of Islamist ideology.\n\nBoth accounts of their journeys of transformation offer provocative and genuine insights. But the British government has played a much more direct role in crafting those accounts than either they, or the government, officially admit.\n\nGovernment ghostwriters\n\nIn late 2013, I interviewed a former senior researcher at the Home Office who revealed that Husain\u2019s The Islamist was \u201ceffectively ghostwritten in Whitehall\u201d.\n\nThe official told me that in 2006, he was informed by a government colleague \u201cwith close ties\u201d to Jack Straw and Gordon Brown that \u201cthe draft was written by Ed but then \u2018peppered\u2019 by government input\u201d. The civil servant told him \u201che had seen \u2018at least five drafts of the book, and the last one was dramatically different from the first.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe draft had, the source said, been manipulated in an explicitly political, pro-government manner. The committee that had input into Ed Husain\u2019s manuscript prior to its official publication included senior government officials from No. 10 Downing Street, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the intelligence services, Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Home Office.\n\nWhen I put the question, repeatedly, to Ed Husain as to the veracity of these allegations, he did not respond. I also asked Nawaz whether he was aware of the government\u2019s role in \u201cghostwriting\u201d Husain\u2019s prose, and whether he underwent a similar experience in the production of Radical. He did not respond either.\n\nWhile Husain was liaising with British government and intelligence officials over The Islamist from 2006 until the book\u2019s publication in May 2007, his friend Nawaz was at first in prison in Egypt. Nawaz was eventually released in March 2006, declaring his departure from HT just a month before the publication of Husain\u2019s book. Husain took credit for being the prime influence on Nawaz\u2019s decision, and by November 2007, had joined with him becoming Quilliam\u2019s director with Husain as his deputy.\n\nYet according to Husain, Nawaz played a role in determining parts of the text of The Islamist in the same year it was being edited by government officials. \u201cBefore publication, I discussed with my friend and brother-in-faith Maajid the passages in the book,\u201d wrote Husain about the need to verify details of their time in HT.\n\nThis is where the chronology of Husain\u2019s and Nawaz\u2019s accounts begin to break down. In Radical, and repeatedly in interviews about his own deradicalisation process, Nawaz says that he firmly and decisively rejected HT\u2019s Islamist ideology while in prison in Egypt. Yet upon his release and return to Britain, Nawaz showed no sign of having reached that decision. Instead, he did the opposite. In April 2006, Nawaz told Sarah Montague on BBC Hardtalk that his detention in Egypt had \u201cconvinced [him] even more\u2026 that there is a need to establish this Caliphate as soon as possible.\u201d From then on, Nawaz, who was now on HT\u2019s executive committee, participated in dozens of talks and interviews in which he vehemently promoted the Hizb.\n\nI first met Nawaz at a conference on 2 December 2006 organised by the Campaign Against Criminalising Communities (CAMPACC) on the theme of \u201creclaiming our rights\u201d. I had spoken on a panel about the findings of my book, The London Bombings: An Independent Inquiry, on how British state collusion with Islamist extremists had facilitated the 7/7 attacks. Nawaz had attended the event as an audience member with two other senior HT activists, and in our brief conversation, he spoke of his ongoing work with HT in glowing terms.\n\nBy January 2007, Nawaz was at the front of a HT protest at the US embassy in London, condemning US military operations in Iraq and Somalia. He delivered a rousing speech at the protest, demanding an end to \u201ccolonial intervention in the Muslim world,\u201d and calling for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate to stand up to such imperialism and end Western support for dictators.\n\nYet by his own account, throughout this very public agitation on behalf of HT from mid-2006 onwards, Nawaz had in fact rejected the very ideology he was preaching so adamantly. Indeed, in the same period, he was liaising with his friend, Ed Husain \u2013 who at that time was still in Jeddah \u2013 and helping him with the text of his anti-HT manifesto, The Islamist, which was also being vetted at the highest levels of government.\n\nThe British government\u2019s intimate, and secret, relationship with Husain in the year before the publication of his book in 2007 shows that, contrary to his official biography, the Quilliam Foundation founder was embedded in Whitehall long before he was on the public radar. How did he establish connections at this level?\n\nRead More at Middle Easty Eye", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jihadi John was able to join IS for one simple reason: from Quilliam to al-Muhajiroun, Britain\u2019s loudest extremists have been groomed by the security services.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Nafeez Ahmed", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Jihadi John was able to join IS for one simple reason: from Quilliam to al-Muhajiroun, Britain\u2019s loudest extremists have been groomed by the security services.", "title": "MI5's Jihadi John: How British Intelligence Primed Both Sides Of The Terror War", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/m15s-jihadi-john-how-british-intelligence-primed-both-sides-of-the-terror-war/202632/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/syrian-artist-youssef-abdelki.gif", "updated_time": "2015-03-04T07:03:38-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jihadi John was able to join IS for one simple reason: from Quilliam to al-Muhajiroun, Britain\u2019s loudest extremists have been groomed by the security services.", "creator": "@nafeezahmed", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/syrian-artist-youssef-abdelki.gif", "title": "MI5's Jihadi John: How British Intelligence Primed Both Sides Of The Terror War", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "published_time": "2015-02-28T05:00:13-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/DrNafeezAhmed", "section": "Editors Picks", "modified_time": "2015-03-04T07:03:38-05:00", "tag": "war on terror"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce775\"", "article_summary": "When I put the question, repeatedly, to Ed Husain as to the veracity of these allegations, he did not respond.\nThe committee that had input into Ed Husain\u2019s manuscript prior to its official publication included senior government officials from No.\nMI5\u2019s Jihadi John: How British Intelligence Primed Both Sides Of The Terror War\u2018Jihadi John\u2019 was able to join IS for one simple reason: from Quilliam to al-Muhajiroun, Britain\u2019s loudest extremists have been groomed by the security services.\nThe Quilliam Foundation was set-up by Husain and Nawaz in 2008 with significant British government financial support.\nNawaz was eventually released in March 2006, declaring his departure from HT just a month before the publication of Husain\u2019s book."}
