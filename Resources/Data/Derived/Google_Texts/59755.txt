Aaron Schmidt, aide to the Washington Democrat, is poised to tie the knot with Justin Zielke on Saturday at Gibson Island, Md.

“I am a little nervous, since this is the first wedding ceremony I will perform,” DelBene tells ITK, “but I’m sure everything will go well, and that it will be an amazing day for the happy couple and all of their friends and family who are coming to celebrate.”

Zielke and Schmidt met at a bar in the District more than eight years ago while waiting in line for the restroom. Schmidt was supposed to be on a date that night, according to a wedding announcement, but the date ended up canceling at the last minute.

“I believe all loving couples deserve equal rights under the law, which is why I was honored when Aaron asked me to officiate his and Justin’s wedding,” DelBene says.

“Not many people ask their boss to officiate their wedding,” the two wrote in an announcement, “but we are honored [to] have Aaron’s boss … officiate our wedding.”
