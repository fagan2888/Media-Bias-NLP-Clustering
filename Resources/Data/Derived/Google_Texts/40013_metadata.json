It was more comforting for people to feel as if disinterested technicians, not party hacks, were going to be running the show.\n\nAnd, for a while at least, the rhetoric helped firm up the legitimacy of the growing state. Nor did it hurt that the mobilization for World War II provided one of the great demonstrations of government prowess in human history\u2014and that, after the war, even centrist Republicans paid obeisance to the accomplishments of the New Deal. In 1964, the government registered its highest popularity in the polls. That was followed by two of the most fecund years in the history of social policy: Both Medicare and Medicaid were born then. (Wilbur Cohen, the social scientist who engineered Medicare, liked to quip that his work was \u201cone percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent implementation\u201d\u2014an aphorism worth tacking on the doors to the West Wing.) This moment evaporated quickly and faith in government soon began a long downward slide in the polls. Vietnam and Watergate hardly reflected well on Washington, stagflation seemed the product of incompetent economic management, and the rising racial resentments of the white working class created an ungenerous mood.\n\nThe more people lost faith in the power of the state, the more the party of government suffered. A generation of Democratic electoral losses spurred a cottage industry of makeover artists who urged liberals to try on new ideological suits. Of course, the most successful of these was Bill Clinton.\n\nOn its surface, his Third Way seemed a rejection of the old technocratic impulse. He talked endlessly about personal responsibility and his aides emphasized their deep respect for markets. This opened the president to criticism from the left, which believed he had coldly abandoned the basic tenets of liberalism. That wasn\u2019t quite right. Despite \u201cending welfare as we know it,\u201d Clinton still believed in activist, redistributionist government. It\u2019s just that the political landscape had changed too much for him to be direct about it. The only way he believed he could help the working poor was through unorthodox measures\u2014tax credits, partnership with the private sector\u2014all of which unintentionally increased the complexity of the state and made it hard to know when the government was actually working on the citizens\u2019 behalf.\n\nBefore he became president, Barack Obama professed to disdain this style. He removed his name from a list of Democratic Leadership Council supporters. Ronald Reagan, he later told a Nevada newspaper, had changed \u201cthe trajectory of America . . . [in] a way that Bill Clinton did not.\u201d But his allergy to the Third Way turned out to be more of a talking point than a governing reality.\n\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act has transformational potential, the guts of the legislation contain as much Bill Clinton as Lyndon Johnson. A two-page bill could have extended Medicare and provided universal coverage, but by relying so heavily on the private market, and straining to avoid the taint of Big Government, the Affordable Care Act is the Russian novel of social policy, now totaling 20,202 pages. Loopholes and exemptions abound. As Ezra Klein has grimly warned, \u201cFar from introducing innovation and efficiency into the system, the decision to build a complex, 50-state public-private hybrid has introduced towering complexity into the project, and seems, potentially, to be beyond the government\u2019s capacity to do well.\u201d\n\nLiberals rallied around the Affordable Care Act because it was the best bill that could clear the Senate. But they also took comfort in the history of social policy. In the winter of 2009, Paul Krugman wrote: \u201cHighly imperfect insurance reforms, like Social Security and Medicare in their initial incarnations, have gotten more comprehensive over time. This suggests that the priority is to get something passed.\u201d Success was supposed to beget success, demonstrating the efficacy of reform and building support for future expansion.\n\nBut even in the absence of immediate results, liberals were once able to tolerate a bungled policy\u2014so long as it was done in the name of accumulating governmental know-how. Louis Brandeis urged testing programs in \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d Franklin Roosevelt bragged about his \u201cbold, persistent experimentation.\u201d Fortunately for the New Deal, Twitter didn\u2019t broadcast every farmer\u2019s sad encounter with the Agriculture Adjustment Act. But the culture of modern Washington, with its hyperventilating media and legislative saboteurs, takes pornographic pleasure in magnifying failures\u2014which in turn erodes the public\u2019s willingness to give liberalism another shot.\n\nThis means the earliest days of a policy\u2019s existence have acquired even greater significance. Just as Clinton had to tweak the traditional liberal formula to advance progressive aims, so will whoever follows Obama. Her challenge will be to ensure that her biggest legislative achievements\u2014curbing carbon emissions perhaps, or expanding the Affordable Care Act\u2014are impeccably implemented with the precision that her ancestors celebrated. She must contend with the new expectations that technology has set, with all of those devices that arrive in our hands seemingly glitch free. That\u2019s what the Obama administration somehow failed to grasp and what liberalism requires if it ever wants to replicate its greatest victories.\n\n\n\nFranklin Foer is the editor of The New Republic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "There\u2019s a term of art that the Obama White House uses to describe its neurotic supporters who instantly race to the worst-case scenario: They are known as \u201cbed-wetters.\u201d Two months into the dysfunctional life of healthcare.gov, however, that seems a perfectly appropriate physiological reaction.Liberalism has spent the better part of the past century attempting to prove that it could competently an...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "There\u2019s a term of art that the Obama White House uses to describe its neurotic supporters who instantly race to the worst-case scenario: They are known as \u201cbed-wetters.\u201d Two months into the dysfunctional life of healthcare.gov, however, that seems a perfectly appropriate physiological reaction.Liberalism has spent the better part of the past century attempting to prove that it could competently an...", "title": "Obamacare's Threat to Liberalism", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1aedd6a1ec736d59b912ccb45b8b5516f5784467.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/115695/obamacare-failure-threat-liberalism", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1aedd6a1ec736d59b912ccb45b8b5516f5784467.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Obamacare's Threat to Liberalism", "description": "There\u2019s a term of art that the Obama White House uses to describe its neurotic supporters who instantly race to the worst-case scenario: They are known as \u201cbed-wetters.\u201d Two months into the dysfunctional life of healthcare.gov, however, that seems a perfectly appropriate physiological reaction.Liberalism has spent the better part of the past century attempting to prove that it could competently an...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/1aedd6a1ec736d59b912ccb45b8b5516f5784467.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare's Threat to Liberalism\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/115695/obamacare-failure-threat-liberalism\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-24T23:30:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":115695,\"author\":\"Franklin Foer\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"Liberalism\",\"New Deal\",\"Progressive\",\"Liberal\",\"Government\",\"Healthcare\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2013-11-24"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafae\"", "article_summary": "Although the Affordable Care Act has transformational potential, the guts of the legislation contain as much Bill Clinton as Lyndon Johnson.\nOf course, the most successful of these was Bill Clinton.\nHer challenge will be to ensure that her biggest legislative achievements\u2014curbing carbon emissions perhaps, or expanding the Affordable Care Act\u2014are impeccably implemented with the precision that her ancestors celebrated.\nThis opened the president to criticism from the left, which believed he had coldly abandoned the basic tenets of liberalism.\nThat\u2019s what the Obama administration somehow failed to grasp and what liberalism requires if it ever wants to replicate its greatest victories."}
