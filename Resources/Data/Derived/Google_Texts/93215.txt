"Things are out of whack in our country," writes Krist Novoselic, the bassist for Nirvana and an activist in Washington state politics. In a response to a piece by Nick Gillespie, Novoselic explains why he broke with the Democratic Party, supports the Citizens United decision, and is hopeful about the future of politics.

There is too much money in politics, resulting in too much monied influence in Congress and statehouses. If we want to restore, at least, some balance, people need to come together.

And people are coming together like never before in this Information Age. The trick is...finding the sweet spot between political association and social networking.
