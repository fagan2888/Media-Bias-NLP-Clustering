McCarthy\n\nEncounter Books, $23.99, 234 pages\n\nAs assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Andrew McCarthy earned a reputation as a well-prepared, effective prosecutor. He is best known for prosecuting \u2014 and putting in prison \u2014 Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 others for the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center. He retired in 2003 and is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\n\nHis latest project is this carefully researched and perceptive book about the possibility of impeaching President Obama.\n\nIn recent days, various Democratic fundraising arms have been touting impeachment as a means of arousing their base and raising money. So far, it has worked. At the other end of the spectrum, Sarah Palin has been all over talk radio pushing impeachment. When asked by host Michael Medved where the 67 Senate votes would come from to ensure a conviction, she had no answer other than a lame statement about senators deciding to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d Pressed for names of Senate Democrats who might vote for it, she had none.\n\nTherein lies the problem, according to Mr. McCarthy. He points out that many people consider the process to be an arcane legal one. He says it is true one needs to construct a clear and provable legal case. Nevertheless, he writes, \u201cimpeachment is not about what the law allows. Impeachment is a matter of political will.\u201d\n\nYou would expect the author, given his background, to construct the legal case, and he does. First, he states his conclusion: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that President Obama ought to be impeached and removed from office.\u201d Making it happen is another matter. He writes, \u201cThe legal case \u2026 is very strong. The political case lags far behind \u2014 and it is the only case that matters.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution offers two methods for curbing presidential overreach: the power of the purse and the impeachment process. In the late years of the Vietnam War, Congress, controlled by Democrats, used the power of the purse to stop funds requested by Republican presidents for the war. Considering the divided nature of the current Congress, this course of action is not available.\n\nMr. McCarthy points out that it is the president\u2019s duty \u201cto take care that the laws be faithfully executed, which includes those with which he disagrees on policy grounds.\u201d In his oath of office, Mr. Obama vowed, \u201cto best of my ability, to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States\u201d He cites a number of cases in which the president did not \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d laws.\n\nAmong these are the \u201cwaivers\u201d and rewritings by Mr. Obama of Obamacare. Another was his 2012 executive order to grant de facto \u201camnesty\u201d to illegal aliens who had come to the United States under age 18. While many laud the concept, actively doing it by fiat, in the face of existing law, constitutes a failure to execute the laws of the nation, according to the author. He concludes, \u201cThe failure to execute the laws faithfully is a high crime and misdemeanor. Systematic faithlessness in this regard imperils our system and our liberties.\u201d\n\nImpeachment by the House of Representatives is, in effect, a statement of charges. If it is voted for by a majority of members, it then goes to the Senate, where a trial is conducted, with the chief justice of the Supreme Court presiding. In order for the House\u2019s case to prevail and the president removed from office, two-thirds of the members of the Senate \u2014 67 \u2014 must vote in favor of it. In the two cases so far, Presidents Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, there were not enough votes to convict. That is the case today also, Mr. McCarthy points out.\n\nAs Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, \u201cYou have to win the argument before you can hope to win the vote.\u201d Mr. McCarthy adds, \u201cAn argument cannot be won if it is never made.\u201d He makes it clearly. Nevertheless, 67 votes seems a long way off. Meanwhile, there is an election to be won and a House lawsuit against the president over the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers to be won.\n\nPeter Hannaford\u2019s most recent book is \u201cPresidential Retreats\u201d (Threshold Editions).", "article_metadata": {"description": "As assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Andrew McCarthy earned a reputation as a well-prepared, effective prosecutor.
