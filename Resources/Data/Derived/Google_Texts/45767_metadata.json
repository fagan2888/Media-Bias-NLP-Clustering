Politics and politicians have ruined it all. Nobody in the world respects us. Trump says what is on people\u2019s minds and can get things done. He\u2019s a businessman who knows how to help business.\u201d\n\nShe was echoing the famous line that The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson, shouts in the 1989 movie \u201cBatman.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country needs an enema; This WORLD needs an enema!\u201d she declared to me as she headed into a Trump rally at a convention center in North Charleston Friday night.\n\nKelly Raucci, a 38-year-old private investigator and Donald Trump supporter from Charleston, S.C., gave me the best (if crudest) explanation I\u2019ve heard yet for the political rise of the authoritarian, xenophobic New York billionaire.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two women, members of what President Richard Nixon used to call \u201cThe Silent Majority,\u201d symbolize the earthquake that is American politics in 2016.\n\nSo: Bernie as Robin Hood, taking from a Sherwood Forest of Wall Street billionaires, and giving to struggling Americans. Even though he lost in Nevada, and could well lose next week in South Carolina, he's pushed Hillary Clinton to the left and has the money and support to fight to the bitter end.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to raise taxes but I want the billionaires to pay their REAL fair share, which is what Bernie says. I need help on my loans and on health care and on my son\u2019s education. I can\u2019t be a single mother and a provider without it. And no other politician has the guts to say what Bernie is saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a college degree and the only work I can get is as a waitress at a restaurant downtown,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut I\u2019ve still got a lot of college loans, which I can\u2019t afford; I\u2019ve got crappy health care and I\u2019m trying to pay for my son to go to public university and it is $30,000 a year! I really need the kind of help that Bernie is talking about.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, at the Palace Theater in downtown Manchester, New Hampshire, a 44-year-old Bernie Sanders supporter named Darlene gave me the best explanation I\u2019ve heard yet for the rise of a rare type in American politics: a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d and a 74-year-old one at that.\n\nA \u201cstrongman\u201d right and the professorial left are pulling the taffy of American politics very thin in the business-as-usual center, where the likes of the Bush and Clinton families, and the entire political system as we knew it, reside.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a situation like this in American politics in a 100 years,\u201d said historian and political scientist Norman Ornstein. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen polarization like this since then. It\u2019s troubling, and you can\u2019t tell where it is going.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking stock of how we got here. Here\u2019s a list of 15 factors:\n\nGlobal Economics\n\nThe Donald and The Bern agree on a couple of things, one of which is that global trade is depressing manufacturing wages in the U.S. and sending those jobs abroad. Both cite the recent announcement by Carrier that it is moving its air conditioner operation to Mexico.\n\nThe Bush-Clinton Economic Consensus Is Dead\n\nSince the 1980s, presidents of both parties have been operating on the theory that government and business are economic allies at home and abroad. Bill Clinton rose in a conservative time by being the \u201cbusiness-friendly\u201d Democrat and got the big donations that went with it. The two Bushes pursued the same theory. It is now under assault from both wings. Clintonism and the Chamber of Commerce are both politically spent forces at the moment.\n\nIncome Stagnation\n\nAmericans, for the most part and most of the time, do not mind rich people -- they want to become just like them. But when \u201cwealth inequality\u201d is coupled with income stagnation, the ground can shake. President Barack Obama came to power offering hope, but the real income of the average American family hasn\u2019t increased in his two terms -- and it really hasn\u2019t increased in a quarter of a century.\n\nWhat Do You Mean, My Kids Won't Be Better Off??\n\nThe phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d didn\u2019t gain currency until the 1930s, but it has come to stand for the proposition that every generation will do better economically than the last one. Most Americans believe that that is no longer true, and they desperately want that to change.\n\nTerror Attacks\n\nDonald Trump himself credits his rise to the events in Paris and San Bernardino, and other commentators agree with him. \u201cI came in talking about borders and immigration, but wasn\u2019t taking off until the attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, boom, I rocket to the top.\u201d Obama\u2019s measured responses seemed tepid, especially to Republican voters. He and they (and other GOP candidates) gave themselves license to amp up anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that would have been considered out-of-bounds by earlier standards of discourse.\n\nImmigration\n\nEven though many Mexicans have returned home, and even though Obama has stepped up deportations, the percentage of persons in the country who are not native-born is higher than it has been in more than 100 years. The U.S. was built on immigration, but goes through paroxysms of fear and resentment when the waves are so large.\n\nNo Soviet Union\n\nSure, the U.S. faces a threat from terrorists, but it is nothing like the annihilation we faced at the hands of the old Soviet Union. The outside threat always united Americans, or pushed them toward the center of politics for the most part. There is no such binding force today.\n\nWealth Disparity\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Americans don\u2019t hate the rich as a general matter, the disparity today is greater than it has been since the Roaring Twenties. A Sanders speech is an infuriating litany of percentages, about how the \u201c1 percent\u201d control more wealth than the other 99. It plays -- big time -- in Democratic crowds tired of gradualism.\n\nThe Big Sort\n\nBill Clinton is fond of referring to a book of that name, which explains how Americans are geographically segregating themselves politically. That\u2019s a matter of demographics, but the machinery of politics is doing the same thing. State legislatures, mostly controlled by Republicans these days, draw congressional district lines designed to segregate Democrats and Republicans into \u201csafe\u201d districts. The nominating rules of both parties give more power to states that tend to support them in presidential elections, accentuating the divide further.\n\nNews Aimed Just At You\n\nIt used to be possible for a TV anchor to end a broadcast by saying \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is\u201d -- and just about the whole country believed him. Now each segment of the electorate has its own favorite outlets, and voters live in a warm bath of media affirmation of their own biases.\n\nSocial Media Just For You\n\nIt makes \u201creality\u201d a purely political construct specifically designed by each campaign. No wonder Ted Cruz thinks he can get away with Photoshopping Marco Rubio into a fake Obama handshake. Cruz\u2019s supporters -- the only people he is talking to on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter -- WANT to believe their own hermetic reality. And they do.\n\nBig Money In Politics\n\nEverybody in both parties hates it. Trump's answer is to self-fund; Bernie's is to crowdsource. Those are powerful appeals to their respective audiences.\n\nCelebrity\n\nIt trumps substance. The Donald may be a successful businessman, but he is famous primarily for being famous, and his brilliant sense of how to maintain that fame through controversy is what powers his campaign. Obama had some of that same stardust. Bernie doesn\u2019t, but his campaign has been brilliant about turning him into a meme of America.\n\nMillennials\n\nThis young generation is larger than the Baby Boom, and they want to shake things up as much as their grandparents did in the Sixties.\n\nParties And Endorsements Matter Less Than Ever\n\nThe parties in a way are more powerful than ever -- at preventing things from happening. But they are despised in general, and their leaders have even less clout in an era of direct social-media communication with voters.\n\nEditor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist,misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump won South Carolina, and Sanders held strong in Nevada.
