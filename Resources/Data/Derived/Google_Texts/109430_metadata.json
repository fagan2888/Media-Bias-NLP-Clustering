Among them: He became a father to four children with his wife, Lily Hudson Hope; he lost his own father, Andy Hope III, quite quickly to cancer; and he re-connected himself with his indigenous heritage (Tlingit on his father\u2019s side and I\u00f1upiaq on his mother\u2019s) after a period of detachment, making the study of traditional knowledge a central part of his life.\n\nThe impact of those personal experiences on his poetry can be glimpsed from the title page alone: \u201cTo Our Daughter Taliiraq And Our Baby On The Way,\u201d \u201dIn Memory of Andrew Hope III,\u201d \u201dLet the Clan Houses Stand Once More\u201d and \u201cBothering the Dauenhauers,\u201d to name just a few. Hope said arriving at the final poems in the book was in many ways a long process of discovering his heart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say an essential discovery that I\u2019ve made in writing this first book is finding my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd \u2026 when you find that center, it gives you much greater ability to create.\u201d\n\nBut although many of Hope\u2019s poems are personal in theme or inspiration, he said to him they don\u2019t gain their own life and resonance until they reach beyond the personal to connect with something bigger, something beyond his control.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s only in the realm of lyric poetry, which is about human-to-human psychology, personal relationships, and the self\u2019s relationship to the self, it starts to collapse in on itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so even if the content can have that personal theme, it\u2019s dead in the water unless there is something in it that drives it that\u2019s outside of what I can control. If it has \u2014 intuitively to me \u2014 a sense of life, then I feel like it\u2019s whole, it\u2019s something I feel solid about that can go out into the world.\u201d\n\nHope\u2019s 43 poems officially went out into the world last weekend.\n\nHope said the hard-to-define quality he refers to as a \u201csense of life\u201d can be found in the work of poets he admires, such as 8th century Chinese poets Du Fu and Li Bai, Pablo Neruda and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, though each of them approaches it in a different way.\n\n\u201cTwo of my biggest influences in poetry are Du Fu and Li Bai,\u201d Hope said. \u201cI feel like they illuminate everyday life with some sort of awareness of what Robert Bringhurst would call \u2018what is,\u2019 of being and even nothingness, just the raw experience of being alive, which Bringhurst also called \u2018the shock of the real.\u2019\u201d\n\nHope said he\u2019s learned a great deal from Bringhurst, a writer whose in-depth study of Haida stories and culture deeply informed his own life and work. Bringhurst\u2019s approach is constantly reinforced in Hope\u2019s own experiences with Tlingit and I\u00f1upiaq culture, which have in recent years included transcribing traditional stories told by Tlingit elders for Sealaska Heritage Institute. Since 2008, Hope has also been learning to speak Tlingit himself.\n\n\u201cI try to study my culture, study Tlingit language, spend time with elders, and learn mythology. Learn Tlingit history, Tlingit stories, I\u00f1upiaq stories \u2014 that is the most direct connection, especially when it\u2019s in the language, to ancestors and to land. To meet that element that Bringhurst talks about \u2026 that\u2019s where I go, to the ancestors; to the land.\u201d\n\nIn his poem \u201cTides,\u201d Hope writes:\n\nThis world is alive, made of song,\n\nmade of singing, made as it goes,\n\nmade of fern fronds, lily bulbs,\n\nbullkelp and lichen,\n\nmade of thing\n\nwe could barely hear.\n\nHope said for him, good poetry is a form of \u201ccall and response,\u201d whether that response is to the natural world, a person or another poem.\n\n\u201cSometimes what will inspire a poem is reading a great poem, and then I just need to respond by writing a poem,\u201d he said, \u201cnot something that\u2019s derivative necessarily, but the energy that springs up from the poem, I\u2019ll need to respond to it.\u201d\n\nHope has been surrounded by poetry his whole life. Both his parents were poets; his mother, Elizabeth Freda \u201cSister\u201d Goodwin, wrote what is believed to be the first book of poetry published by an Inuit writer, \u201cA Lagoon in My Backyard,\u201d which was released through Ishmael Reed Publishing Company in 1984.\n\nHis father, Andy Hope III, left behind a collection of poems when he died in 2008 that Ishmael Hope is now working to publish through Reed Publishing, which will be releasing his own collection as well.\n\nIshmael Reed, a prominent black writer and literature professor from the Bay Area, was a friend of Hope\u2019s parents, and the man for whom he was named. Reed, whose book of poetry \u201cConjure\u201d was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, is also the founder of the Before Columbus Foundation, which promotes multicultural American writing.\n\nIn addition to introducing him to poetry, Hope\u2019s parents also laid the foundation for his identity as Alaska Native, though it took him some time to fully embrace it.\n\n\u201cMy mom gave me so much of my internalized experience of being I\u00f1upiaq, being indigenous \u2026 and directly taught me of her culture,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my dad exposed me to Tlingit elders, and what it\u2019s like to be inside the Alaska Native Brotherhood Hall, when the elders are together intentionally creating an environment of being Tlingit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of embedded cultural knowledge was there with me since I was a baby. But I shied away from it for most of my teen years. Finally after I graduated from high school, I committed to learning, to really learning. What was neat was there was a lot of internalized knowledge that was there, and this was about eliciting it, bringing it out and being Tlingit, being I\u00f1upiaq.\u201d\n\nHope has since had an opportunity to pass Native knowledge and traditions on to his own children, who get to hear stories as much as their patience allows, he said. In addition to welcoming a baby this year, Hope and his wife Lily, a Chilkat weaver, also brought his niece\u2019s daughter, Mary, into their home, joining daughter Elizabeth and son Louis to bring their family unit to a very busy six.\n\nThough family remains top priority, Hope is involved in many different projects in addition to his poetry and work at Sealaska Heritage Institute. Recent projects include \u201cNever Alone,\u201d a video game based on traditional knowledge, for which Hope was a lead writer, and \u201cThe Reincarnation of Stories,\u201d a play he wrote and performed in 2011 for Perseverance Theater, with whom he has a long history. He is also an established storyteller who has traveled all around the country. (For more, see alaskanativestoryteller.com/)\n\nCurrently Hope is working on a play about Tlingit civil rights hero William Paul, and is part of a team working on a book of Raven stories gathered and transcribed by Richard and Nora Dauenhauer. The book is due to be released next year by SHI and the University of Washington Press.\n\nThe Dauenhauers, widely regarded as preeminent scholars of Tlingit literature, have been very influential on Hope\u2019s work, and both have inspired their own poems in his collection. Though Richard Dauenhauer died in August, he had a chance to review Hope\u2019s new book, and his words are included on the back cover. A highly regarded poet himself, Dauenhauer wrote that Hope \u201cexplores and reminds us how each of us is central in a multigenerational relationship involving ancestry, self, and descendants; heritage, contemporary culture, and legacy; an unbroken chain of storytellers, daily life, and dreams, always negotiating, in the words of T. S. Eliot, between tradition and the individual talent.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Juneau (Alaska) Empire, http://www.juneauempire.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ishmael Hope spent six years putting together his first collection of poetry, \"Courtesans of Flounder Hill,\" a period of time in which the manuscript went through many changes - as did Hope himself.
