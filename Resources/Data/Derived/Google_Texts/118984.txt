In what was a decidedly uncivil display, two sitting members of Congress engaged in a war between the states Monday night.

The row began over a discussion on whether the House should prepare a bill to repeal ObamaCare.

Republicans in the hearing had railed against Democrats for the unique, parliamentary methods used to pass ObamaCare five years ago. Democrats, however, countered that the current legislation to repeal ObamaCare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, hasn't been through a hearing or markup, the part of the process where they write the bill, in the new Congress.

That's when the ruckus began between Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., and Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas.

"I think what the American people would think is they don't want this (debate)," Hastings said. "I believe in your state ... which I believe is crazy to begin with --"

That remark prompted a banging of the gavel from Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., who was chairing the meeting of the House Rules Committee, telling Hastings that Burgess would be allowed to respond.

"I reclaimed my time," Hastings protested. "The time is mine."

Burgess interjected.

"He made a statement about my state," said the normally reserved congressman. "I will not sit here and listen to it."

Refusing to look at Hastings, Burgess demanded an apology -- but the Florida representative refused and said the Texas congressman would have to wait for "hell to freeze over."

Foxx tried to regain order.

"We owe to our colleagues a great deal of civility," she said. "I have a lot of concern about words that are on the edge which are impugning the integrity of others."

Burgess said there was "no reason" to insult his state, though Hastings refused to back down.
