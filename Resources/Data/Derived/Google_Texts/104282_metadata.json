(AP) \u2014 The body of a black man found hanging in a tree in Mississippi has been sent from a state crime lab to a funeral home, but the FBI said it will be days before autopsy results are complete. Until then, investigators are holding off on saying whether Otis Byrd was killed or took his own life, and they\u2019re urging people to be patient.\n\n\u201cThe community deserves answers. Specifically, the family deserves answers,\u201d Don Alway, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson, told a crowd Friday outside the Claiborne County Courthouse in Port Gibson. He said preliminary information about the cause of death is expected next week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to be transparent, to talk about what\u2019s going on so far,\u201d Alway said. \u201cBut we want to reiterate that individual, single pieces of information and bits of rumors, we\u2019re going to hold off on speaking to those until we can collectively come to a conclusion and get you the truth that everybody deserves.\u201d\n\nThe county coroner confirmed that the man found hanging from a white sheet Thursday was Byrd, a 54-year-old ex-convict who was reported missing by his family more than two weeks ago. Byrd lived just 200 yards from the spot where his body was found, in woods behind his house.\n\nAlway said investigators are interviewing Byrd\u2019s family and friends and searching his rental home and a storage unit for clues.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to paint a picture of Byrd\u2019s life. We are trying to find out what was going on with him personally and professionally,\u201d he said.\n\nClaiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas Sr. told The Associated Press earlier Friday that Byrd did not appear to have stepped off of anything in the area where he was found hanging by a sheet from a tree limb about 12 feet high. His feet were dangling about 2 feet off the ground, and his hands were not bound, Lucas said.\n\n\u201cLife matters,\u201d Lucas told the crowd at the courthouse where he appeared with Alway. \u201cI commit to you, as the sheriff of Claiborne County, that I will not allow the shadows of the past to cast a shadow on the future.\u201d\n\nByrd\u2019s body was released on Friday to a Port Gibson funeral home, said Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain. An employee at Rollins Funeral Home said funeral arrangements will be made early next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "title": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "title": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/fbi_autopsy_report_days_away_in_hanging_of_mississippi_man/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/hanging-death-mississippi.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "title": "FBI: Autopsy report days away in hanging of Mississippi man", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/hanging-death-mississippi.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Johnny Clark and Jeff Amy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e36\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLife matters,\u201d Lucas told the crowd at the courthouse where he appeared with Alway.\n(AP) \u2014 The body of a black man found hanging in a tree in Mississippi has been sent from a state crime lab to a funeral home, but the FBI said it will be days before autopsy results are complete.\nAn employee at Rollins Funeral Home said funeral arrangements will be made early next week.\nHis feet were dangling about 2 feet off the ground, and his hands were not bound, Lucas said.\nAlway said investigators are interviewing Byrd\u2019s family and friends and searching his rental home and a storage unit for clues."}
