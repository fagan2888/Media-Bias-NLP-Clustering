(REUTERS/Joe Skipper)\n\n4137618\n\nA health-care navigator with Colorado\u2019s state-run health-care exchange bluntly told a customer that she would pay substantially more in monthly premiums for her new insurance policy if she insisted on sticking with her long-time doctor.\n\nRebecca Ryan, shopping for a new insurance plan when her previous one was canceled for not conforming to the Affordable Care Act, recorded the phone call and shared it with Complete Colorado, which first reported on their conversation.\n\nIn it, Ryan wonders why the premiums for insurance options are so much higher than she paid before. Under her old plan, which was run by the state to provide insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, premiums were $375 per month. A new plan with similar coverage and deductibles would cost $515 per month if she kept her doctor.\n\nChoosing a new plan with a different doctor would be cheaper \u2014 $360 per month.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re going to penalize me because I want to keep my doctor?\u201d she asks the Connect for Health Colorado representative at one point in the conversation.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the person answers, suggesting that she remove her doctor\u2019s name from the list of options in order to see less expensive plans.\n\nPresident Obama and other supporters of the Affordable Care Act have often said patients won\u2019t be forced to choose new health-care providers under the new health-care law. That\u2019s true in Ryan\u2019s case, but only if she is willing to pay a higher premium, as the navigator explained.\n\n\u201c[W]hat if I want to keep [my doctor]?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been with her a long time, and I don\u2019t want a different doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to keep her then you\u2019re looking to pay the $515 a month,\u201d the representative replied.\n\nAt another point in the conversation, Ryan says her doctor is a general practitioner, not a specialist whose services might be expected to cost more.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a special lady and I would like to keep her as my doctor forever because of this,\u201d Ryan told Complete Colorado. \u201cA successful doctor-patient relationship takes a tremendous amount of trust. That is built over time. If I am forced to just take any doctor they choose, that trust relationship will be gone.\u201d\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
