JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - One Spark, the world's crowdfunding festival, announced Thursday the formation of the Creator Academy.

The One Spark Creator Academy kicked off with "Project Launch: Masters of the Pitch" at the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville with over 125 artists and entrepreneurs in attendance.

One Spark designed the Creator Academy for 2015 to help creators identify how to utilize One Spark to achieve business goals and increase successful outcomes.

The Creator Academy will offer training from festival experts, business leaders and entrepreneurs to help creators accelerate their success and be part of a collaborative community.

The One Spark Creator Academy curriculum is designed to support creators in all categories and at all stages of development prepare for One Spark events. It will be a blend of free live workshops and online training and more advanced, in-depth paid courses.

"One Spark is really looking at this as something that we're not looking to make money on. This is something that we absolutely want to provide to the creators as a resource to find success at the world's crowdfunding festival," said Joe Sampson, executive director of One Spark. "It can be really tough to turn your idea into a reality. Headed into the third year in Jacksonville we think it's time to bring this to life and see how it works out."
