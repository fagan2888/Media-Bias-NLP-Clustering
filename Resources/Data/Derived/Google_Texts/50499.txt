Wausau â€” A rural Wausau man accused of killing his wife was in critical condition Saturday after authorities said he tried to kill himself in jail.

Dispatchers received an emergency call at 8 a.m. Saturday about an unresponsive inmate, identified as 62-year-old Mark Sturm, according to the Marathon County Sheriff's Office.

Corrections staff provided medical care to Sturm until emergency workers arrived.

Sturm pleaded not guilty Wednesday to first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Patricia. She was found dead of a gunshot wound in the couple's Town of Berlin home.

Investigators say Mark Sturm called 911 on Feb. 28 and told the dispatcher his wife had a seizure and had died.
