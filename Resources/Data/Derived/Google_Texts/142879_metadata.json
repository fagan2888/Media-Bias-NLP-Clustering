The clock is ticking on this administration, and Mr. Obama knows it.\n\nIn 2007 he said, \u201cI have no desire to be one of those Presidents who are just on the list\u2014you see their pictures lined up on the wall. I really want to be a President who makes a difference.\u201d He has made a difference, but often his critics on the right and on the left have trouble recognizing it. Conservatives tend to taunt him both as a tyro who is in way over his head, and as an Alinskyite master who is rapidly subverting the republic. They don\u2019t seem to notice the contradictions in those indictments.\n\nWhat Obama has accomplished is to move American politics as far leftward as he could, wrecking\u2014or more politely, transforming\u2014American health care, foreign policy, and constitutional norms in ways that will be difficult to reverse. He\u2019s in no danger of barely making \u201cthe list.\u201d If it\u2019s not overturned, for example, the Affordable Care Act assures him fame, however grudging. Most of his impatient critics on the left, now busily denouncing Obamacare as a sellout, will sing its praises when, as eventually will happen, conservatives return to power. And if the monstrosity is overturned, it assures him infamy, which is better than what he fears most, namely, obscurity.\n\nIn 2011 Obama boasted to 60 Minutes, \u201cI would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president\u2014with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln.\u201d The \u201cpossible exceptions,\u201d he allowed. When he speaks of \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d it\u2019s these presidents\u2019 achievements he has in mind. He aspires to be a great man among great men.\n\nBut the subsequent years have not been kind to his ambition, and he admits disappointment. So he has turned philosophical, with almost two-and-a-half years left in his second term. What went wrong? Between the long pauses, as the clock ticks, he makes basically three points.\n\nFirst, and most important, it\u2019s not his fault. Search the tens of thousands of words he has shared with journalists in the past year, and you will not find him admitting a single serious mistake. The Obamacare rollout? That was a fiasco, granted, and as chief executive the responsibility for it ultimately falls to him\u2014but not the blame. His intentions were thoughtful and pure, you see, and he\u2019s searched his conscience to be sure of it. Corruption at the IRS? If it had occurred, he would have done something about it. He didn\u2019t. Q.E.D., it never happened. As Valerie Jarrett, his consigliere, says, \u201cThe President always takes the long view.\u201d Conveniently, that view confirms that his good intentions will sooner or later be vindicated. Taking care that the laws be faithfully executed is commendable, but being on the right side of history is priceless.\n\nSecond, the Republicans. Who knew they would be so intractable? Back in the 2004 speech in Boston that launched his national political career, Obama proclaimed, to great applause, \u201cthere is not a liberal America and a conservative America\u2014there is the United States of America.\u201d It sounded post-partisan and it was, though not in the sense most Americans thought. He meant that with a sufficiently big victory by the coalition for change (i.e., the Democrats), the GOP would have to adapt\u2014would become a me-too party. But the Republicans refused to evolve, to say farewell to (their) partisanship. They didn\u2019t take the long view.\n\nOne reason they didn\u2019t is that, electorally speaking, Obama and the Democrats peaked in 2008 and have gone downhill ever since, a decline that seems likely to continue in November. Unlike the presidents he admires so much, Obama has not won resounding victories at the polls that swelled his party\u2019s ranks, \u00e0 la 1932 or 1964. Hence his third plea in extenuation, that the times are not favorable.\n\nBen Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor, observed, \u201cThe President subscribes less to a great man theory of history and more to a great movement theory of history\u2014that change happens when people force it or circumstances do.\u201d Obama later corrected his aide. \u201cI believe in both,\u201d he said. A cynic might think, the great man theory for when things go right, and the great movement theory for when they don\u2019t. But aren\u2019t great men supposed to overcome, to transform unfavorable circumstances? The president who came into office exclaiming \u201cYes, we can!\u201d dreads leaving it explaining, \u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his most recent colloquy with the president, David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker, noted that in the Oval Office \u201cyou could hear, between every long pause that Obama took, the ticking of...", "title": "Mount Rushmore Expansion Plans on Hold | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/09/02/mount_rushmore_expansion_plans_on_hold_123830.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "description": "In his most recent colloquy with the president, David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker, noted that in the Oval Office \u201cyou could hear, between every long pause that Obama took, the ticking of...", "title": "Mount Rushmore Expansion Plans on Hold | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Mount Rushmore Expansion Plans on Hold | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Democratic Party,Election 2014,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "A cynic might think, the great man theory for when things go right, and the great movement theory for when they don\u2019t.\nHe aspires to be a great man among great men.\nWhen he speaks of \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d it\u2019s these presidents\u2019 achievements he has in mind.\nAnd if the monstrosity is overturned, it assures him infamy, which is better than what he fears most, namely, obscurity.\nTaking care that the laws be faithfully executed is commendable, but being on the right side of history is priceless."}
