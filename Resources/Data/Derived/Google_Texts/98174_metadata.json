People who wanted photos with her were not entirely out of luck, however: a life-sized cardboard cutout of the former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and secretary of state was on hand.\n\nMary Rutherford Jennings, Clinton\u2019s Arkansas press secretary, declined to say how many paid staff people the campaign has in Arkansas but said that \u201cwe\u2019ve got hundreds and hundreds of volunteers\u201d across the state. The campaign will announce the members of its Arkansas committee later this week, she said.\n\nThe campaign opened the office a week after Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucus, which saw Clinton defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by less that one percentage point. Recent polling has shown Sanders leading in New Hampshire, a neighbor to his home state.\n\nClinton appeared at a Democratic Party fundraiser in North Little Rock in July and at a rally at Philander Smith College in Little Rock in September. Jennings said she did not have any information on upcoming appearances in the state.\n\nElected officials who attended the office\u2019s opening included state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, who said he favors Clinton over Sanders because of her experience and her support for preserving the Affordable Care Act. Sanders favors a single-payer, universal health-care system he calls \u201cMedicaid for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s build on what we have, the model that President Obama has for health care,\u201d Love said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign opened an office in downtown Little Rock on Monday, a week before early voting begins for Arkansas\u2019 March 1 primary election.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign opened an office in downtown Little Rock on Monday, a week before early voting begins for Arkansas\u2019 March 1 primary election.", "title": "Clinton campaign opens Little Rock office", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/clinton-campaign-opens-little-rock-office", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_clinton-cutout_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/clinton-campaign-opens-little-rock-office", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_clinton-cutout_0.jpg"}, "title": "Clinton campaign opens Little Rock office", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-08T19:24:14-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Clinton appeared at a Democratic Party fundraiser in North Little Rock in July and at a rally at Philander Smith College in Little Rock in September.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign opened an office in downtown Little Rock on Monday, a week before early voting begins for Arkansas\u2019 March 1 primary election.\nThe campaign opened the office a week after Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucus, which saw Clinton defeat Vermont Sen.
