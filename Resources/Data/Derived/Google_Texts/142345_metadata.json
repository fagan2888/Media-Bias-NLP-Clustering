Mark Kakkuri looks back at six recent victories for the gun rights movement for the November issue of Townhall Magazine.\n\nAcross the nation, Second Amendment advocates and those involved in hunting and the shooting sports have enjoyed a stream of victories affirming the rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, not just for ownership, hobbies, sports, and hunting, but also for personal defense. Credit goes in part to the many pro-gun rights organizations, conservative legislators, and a myriad of everyday citizens for what many consider an unprecedented forward movement in protecting, affirming and expanding gun rights. In some sense, however, credit also goes to the anti-gun rights crowd for not only failing to make any headway for their misguided cause but also for reversing any semblance of \"progress\" for its anti-gun rights agenda.\n\nAlthough the failures of the anti\u00ad-gun rights movement are many,six will suffice to make the point.\n\nFAIL #1:TWO ANTI-GUN COLORADO SENATORS RECALLED BY GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT\n\nOn Sept.10, 2013, Colorado voters recalled, for the first time in the state's history, two senators who played a role in enacting restrictive gun legislation in the state.

Additionally,just getting there call on the ballot required signatures totaling at least 25 percent of the number of votes from the district's previous election.\n\nWhile pro-gunrights organizations focused on energizing a grassroots movement to oust the senators, the anti-gun rights crowd went over the top to keep the senators in place, spending almost $3 million of the approximately $3.5 million total spent on the election. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad together contributed $600,000 to oppose the recall.\n\nThe catalyst for the recall, according to a statement by the Newtown, Conn.-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), was \"the passage of a series of highly restricted gun control laws that will do nothing to improve public safety but that did reflect the wishes of national anti-gun organizations.''\n\nIn other words, \"The legislators failed to represent the beliefs of their constituents,\" said the NSSF, and so the voters fired them.\n\n...continue reading in Townhall's November issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The gun rights movement is stronger than ever.
