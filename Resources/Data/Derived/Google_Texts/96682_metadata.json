Dispatchers still monitor most trains from 24-hour underground \u201ctowers,\u201d and they still put pencil to paper to track their progress.\n\nThat eight-decade-old system is slowly being replaced by 21st-century digital technology that allows up to twice as many trains to safely travel closer together. But there\u2019s a big caveat: It could take at least 20 years for the city\u2019s 700 miles of tracks to be fully computerized.\n\nOf the subway system\u2019s almost two dozen major lines, just one, the L linking Manhattan and Brooklyn, currently operates on new, computerized, automated signals. And the modernization of the No. 7 line from Manhattan to Queens has begun, to be completed by 2017.\n\nSo, for at least the foreseeable future, New York subway riders can expect the snags, weekend shutdowns and overcrowding they have become accustomed to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the physical limits of what the original technology can carry,\u201d acknowledges Adam Lisberg, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the New York City Transit\u2019s subways.\n\nBut he says safety is not being sacrificed.\n\n\u201cThis stuff is old, but it works \u2014 it works really well,\u201d he says, his voice rising above the roar of a 400-ton train passing through a Greenwich Village station.\n\nMuch of New York\u2019s subways continue to operate with the equipment from the 1930s, kept running by a maintenance team that\u2019s forced to fabricate replacement parts long out of production.\n\nWynton Habersham, the MTA\u2019s chief of signals and track operations, recently led an Associated Press reporter and photographer on a walking tour through some of the 22 control \u201ctowers\u201d \u2014 as the dispatcher spaces are called, though they\u2019re buried deep beneath the streets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "author": "Verena Dobnik", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "title": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/21/nyc_subways_slowly_upgrading_from_1930s_era_technology/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/high-tech-subways.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/high-tech-subways.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "NYC subways slowly upgrading from 1930s-era technology", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11a1\"", "article_summary": "So, for at least the foreseeable future, New York subway riders can expect the snags, weekend shutdowns and overcrowding they have become accustomed to.\nThat eight-decade-old system is slowly being replaced by 21st-century digital technology that allows up to twice as many trains to safely travel closer together.\nDispatchers still monitor most trains from 24-hour underground \u201ctowers,\u201d and they still put pencil to paper to track their progress.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the physical limits of what the original technology can carry,\u201d acknowledges Adam Lisberg, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the New York City Transit\u2019s subways.\n\u201cThis stuff is old, but it works \u2014 it works really well,\u201d he says, his voice rising above the roar of a 400-ton train passing through a Greenwich Village station."}
