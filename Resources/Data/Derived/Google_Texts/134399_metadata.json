Analysts on average were expecting sales of $537.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe medical device maker reported revenue of $611 million a year earlier.\n\nRevenue from da Vinci Surgical Systems fell nearly 59 percent to about $106 million in the first quarter of 2014, Intuitive said on Tuesday.\n\nThe device maker sold 87 systems in the quarter, compared to 164 a year earlier. U.S. sales fell to 45 from 115.\n\nThe company cited lower procedural volumes, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and expectations of a new version of the robot system for lower U.S. shipments.\n\nThe company said the revenue estimate included a $26 million deferral related to trade-in of da Vinci 'Si' systems for the upgraded version.\n\nIntuitive Surgical said it would also record a $67 million pre-tax charge to reflect estimated costs of settling a number of claims related to its surgical robot system.\n\nThe company's shares closed at $489.84 on the Nasdaq.\n\n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Natalie Grover", "Author": "Natalie Grover", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG.O) estimated first-quarter revenue well below analysts' average expectation mainly due to a 60 percent drop in sales of its flagship da Vinci robot system.", "title": "Intuitive Surgical expects revenue below estimates as da Vinci sales fall", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, INTUITIVESURGICAL, RESULTS, PRELIMINARY", "sailthru.title": "Intuitive Surgical expects revenue below estimates as da Vinci sales fall", "keywords": "US,INTUITIVESURGICAL,RESULTS,PRELIMINARY,United States,Healthcare Services (TRBC),Performance / Results / Earnings,Equities Markets,Company News,Commercial Services and Supplies (TRBC),Industrials (TRBC),Business Support Services (TRBC),Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC),Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks,Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC),Business : Public Services (Legacy),Corporate Events,General News,Health / Medicine,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Medical Equipment : Supplies and Distribution (TRBC),Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Industrial Services (TRBC),Americas", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;INTUITIVESURGICAL;RESULTS;PRELIMINARY;United States;Healthcare Services (TRBC);Performance / Results / Earnings;Equities Markets;Company News;Commercial Services and Supplies (TRBC);Industrials (TRBC);Business Support Services (TRBC);Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC);Healthcare (TRBC);Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks;Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC);Business : Public Services (Legacy);Corporate Events;General News;Health / Medicine;Results Forecasts / Warnings;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Medical Equipment : Supplies and Distribution (TRBC);Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);Industrial Services (TRBC);Americas", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
