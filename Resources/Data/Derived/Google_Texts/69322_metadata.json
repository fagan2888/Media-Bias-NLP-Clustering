They have a lot of information on us already from the Internet or from pieces of information that they\u2019ve found here or there, so we just get into this very conversational mode with the person on the other end and we end up giving away more information than we think we are,\u201d said Amy Schram.\n\nSchram suggests letting unknown numbers on your caller I.D. go straight to voicemail as scammers are less likely to leave a message.\n\nShe also recommends calling your credit card company or bank back in the event you find the call suspicious.\n\nShe says you should contact the Attorney General\u2019s office if you believe you\u2019re being scammed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thomas College and the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce held their business breakfast this morning in Waterville.
