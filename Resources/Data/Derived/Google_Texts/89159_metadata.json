(Photo: File/AP )\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. will make a much bigger play on the nation\u2019s health insurance exchanges this fall.\n\nOn Friday, UnitedHealth announced the 23 states where it plans to compete for health exchange business, which started Saturday \u2014 a roster that\u2019s up significantly from the four states where the insurer was competing this year.\n\nEven with the expansion, Minnesota isn\u2019t on the list because of a noncompete agreement with Minnetonka-based Medica, which hires United for claims processing and certain back-office functions.\n\nFor the first time, UnitedHealth will offer products through the exchange operating in Wisconsin, but not in the counties closest to the Twin Cities, said Heather Kane, vice president of exchange strategy at the company\u2019s UnitedHealthcare division. Insurers can select the counties in a state where they want to compete for exchange business.\n\n\u201cThe markets that we\u2019re entering are where we already had a presence, often in the individual (market) space and certainly in the group (market) space,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we are typically operating within the footprint that we already operated in from a commercial group perspective.\u201d\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act called for the creation of health insurance exchanges for all 50 states starting last year. Some states, including Minnesota, opted to create their own online marketplaces to comply with the law. Most states, including Wisconsin, are covered by the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov insurance exchange.\n\nThe marketplaces are the only place where people buying individual policies can receive federal tax credits that discount premium costs. So, the exchanges are expected to be a source of new business for insurance companies, since many uninsured people likely will use the marketplaces to comply with the federal health law\u2019s mandate for most individuals to have coverage.\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance will increase next year. Most of those without coverage will pay a fine that\u2019s the higher of two amounts \u2014 either 2 percent of yearly household income, or $325 per adult in a household plus $162.50 per child.\n\nMore than 7 million Americans signed up for 2014 policies through the exchanges and the government had been expecting the figure to grow to 13 million by the end of next year. But earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office scaled back growth projections, saying total enrollment next year likely would grow to just under 10 million.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really speculate on that,\u201d Kane said when asked about the new forecast. \u201cIt\u2019s such a new marketplace.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1qTPFAV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "For the first time, UnitedHealth will offer products in Wisconsin.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "For the first time, UnitedHealth will offer products in Wisconsin.", "title": "UnitedHealth to compete for health exchange business", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/money/2014/11/18/unitedhealth-compete-health-exchange-business/19245677/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time, UnitedHealth will offer products in Wisconsin.", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7af0206bf40c3180e6c9c8e22e315648cc03f5f/c=681-0-3267-2586&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/11/18/unitedhealthgroup.jpg", "title": "UnitedHealth to compete for health exchange business", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cda\"", "article_summary": "The UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s campus in Minnetonka, Minn.
