Such a move would prevent millions of people from losing their policies in the critical weeks and months before the 2014 election. But it would also allow people on the individual market to keep non-compliant plans beyond the risk corridor\u2019s 2016 expiration date, leaving health insurance companies serving the exchange vulnerable to financial losses as the more healthy customers continue to stay out of the exchanges. Health insurance companies are looking for something in exchange for the three-year extension, which will make it much harder for them to sign up healthier and younger customers. Extending the risk corridor program is part of that conversation with the White House, industry sources said.\n\nRemember back in November when Obama was eating truckloads of crap for breaking his \u201cif you like your plan\u201d promise? His solution was to let insurers \u201cun-cancel\u201d canceled plans \u2014 but lost in the hubbub at the time was the fact that he said he\u2019d allow it for just one year. The obvious problem with that timeline is that it means this issue will bubble up again this fall, just in time for the midterms. New solution, then: Quietly allow insurers to keep un-canceled plans in effect past the midterms, for another three years. That\u2019s how Obama just \u201csolved\u201d his little electoral problem with the employer mandate, isn\u2019t it? Three-year extensions across the board, to minimize the damage to Democrats from his pet boondoggle in November. The problem is, because the old un-canceled plans are typically cheaper than expensive new \u201ccomprehensive\u201d ObamaCare exchange plans, the extension means insurers are suddenly looking at less revenue than they counted on all the way through 2017. That\u2019s where the \u201crisk corridors\u201d come in. Assuming the Examiner\u2019s report is true, the White House is going to make this worth the industry\u2019s while by extending the timeline for the bailout program too. Any losses they suffer in 2017 would, presumably, be partly offset by Uncle Sam even though the \u201crisk corridor\u201d is supposed to have terminated by then. Your tax dollars will buy insurers\u2019 complicity in yet another illegal extension.\n\nBob Laszewski kinda sorta saw this coming, by the way. Last month he published a post arguing that, for all its faults, ObamaCare won\u2019t cause a death spiral in the insurance industry anytime soon. The reason: The \u201crisk corridor\u201d program. Since Uncle Sam\u2019s on the hook for any heavy losses in the industry, insurers are under no immediate pressure to raise premiums, the potential trigger of a death spiral. They can keep premiums artificially low \u2014 at least for a few years, until the \u201crisk corridor\u201d sunsets. Laszewski figured insurers would give the White House one more chance next year to get their act together on implementation and to start signing up the uninsured en masse; if they failed, he said, he expected companies to start parachuting out of the exchanges in 2016 before the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program expires. Which is to say, it\u2019s very much in the White House\u2019s interest to keep the program in effect, if it can, to keep insurers from abandoning the exchanges, especially if HHS has reason to think the risk pools they\u2019re projecting will be less young and healthy than they had hoped. (And they do have such a reason at the moment.) The last thing Democrats need in a presidential election year is \u201cInsurers give up on ObamaCare\u201d headlines. Promise them some more sugar and you can avoid that. Maybe.\n\nIt seems naive at this point to ask whether the White House could extend the \u201crisk corridor\u201d unilaterally or whether that would be illegal. If they want to do it, they\u2019ll do it regardless. O\u2019s theory in issuing periodic delays or extensions for ObamaCare\u2019s provisions is that, during the law\u2019s transitional phase, he has some latitude legally to tweak implementation to make it go more smoothly. Extending the \u201crisk corridors\u201d past 2016, though, would mean the \u201ctransitional\u201d phase had lasted past the end of his own presidency. It\u2019s dubious, but it\u2019s also in character. Here\u2019s a question, though: Why would insurers leak this info now, when Marco Rubio\u2019s trying to build support within the GOP for a bill to repeal the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program? He\u2019s had little luck getting it on the leadership\u2019s radar but his luck could change now that rumors are swirling that the bailout provisions might be extended into 2017 and beyond. The recent CBO numbers that found that the \u201crisk corridor\u201d could actually make money for taxpayers is a problem for the GOP, but (a) CBO\u2019s numbers can be challenged and (b) CBO assumed that the \u201crisk corridor\u201d would be gone by 2016. Even if O decides to unilaterally extend the program, a new Republican Senate next year could join forces with some red-state Dems and Boehner\u2019s House majority to repeal it, forcing Obama to either acquiesce in the repeal or to veto it and be seen as singlehandedly defending indefinite bailouts for insurers. Very strange that insurance industry sources, who stand to benefit, would be blabbing about this now.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Money.", "title": "White House weighing plan to extend ObamaCare\u2019s \u201crisk corridor,\u201d i.e. bailout, program beyond 2016?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/18/white-house-weighing-plan-to-extend-obamacares-risk-corridor-i-e-bailout-program-beyond-2016/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18T21:41:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-18T19:55:51+00:00"}, "keywords": "adverse selection, bailout, insurance, insurers, laszewski, ObamaCare, risk corridor, risk pool,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd948d\"", "article_summary": "Extending the risk corridor program is part of that conversation with the White House, industry sources said.\nWhite House weighing plan to extend ObamaCare\u2019s \u201crisk corridor,\u201d i.e.\nIt seems naive at this point to ask whether the White House could extend the \u201crisk corridor\u201d unilaterally or whether that would be illegal.\nThe reason: The \u201crisk corridor\u201d program.\nThey can keep premiums artificially low \u2014 at least for a few years, until the \u201crisk corridor\u201d sunsets."}
