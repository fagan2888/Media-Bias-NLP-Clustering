If this had happened three months ago, that news that would have been taken with a shrug, followed by a quick turn to the sports page.\n\nSheldon is a competent administrator who served as deputy attorney general under Bob Butterworth. Still, not long ago the likelihood incumbent Pam Bondi would receive a serious challenge to her re-election next year seemed as remote as Greg Schiano winning NFL Coach of the Year.\n\nShe took the lead in the state\u2019s fight against the Affordable Care Act (see Care, Obama), which rocketed her into the national spotlight. However you feel about that, it did get her high-profile face time at the Republican National Convention. She was raising oodles of cash to squash any would-be challenger.\n\nYep, the hometown girl from Tampa was on her way.\n\nBut that was before her ethically challenged move of asking for an execution to be postponed so she could attend a fund-raiser.\n\nShe apologized, but the evening did net close to $140,000 in Bondi bucks.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times then reported there are also questions about her campaign\u2019s relationship with Donald Trump. The Donald is under fire from the New York state attorney general for his association with \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d seminars and \u201csham\u201d for-profit colleges. Some of the allegations have connections in Florida, and Bondi said she was reviewing the case.\n\nWell, others are reviewing the $25,000 one of Trump\u2019s foundations made to And Justice For All, a political committee with Bondi\u2019s re-election in mind.\n\nAn attorney general, of all people, can\u2019t afford even the hint of impropriety. That doesn\u2019t mean her campaign is doomed, though.\n\nWhile the execution move twas a gaffe of the highest order, and I think you\u2019ll be seeing it about 10,000 times in campaign ads before November 2014, any challenger to Bondi faces long odds.\n\nThat may be especially true for Sheldon, who resigned his post with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to run for this job.\n\nHe lost to Charlie Crist by 7 percent in 2000 to be the state\u2019s education commissioner. He got smoked in a Democratic primary for attorney general in 2002.\n\n\u201cTaking on predatory lenders, human traffickers, and those who engage in deceptive practices is the job of the Attorney General \u2026 not working full time trying to deny health insurance to children and anyone with preexisting conditions,\u201d Sheldon said in his campaign announcement on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThis race is about character. Who has the experience and character to use the office of attorney general for general good rather than as a personal, political, partisan platform.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Bondi has been aggressive against some of the banks that helped create the housing crisis. She has tried to raise awareness of human trafficking as an issue.\n\nShe also left the door open to a challenge.\n\nTo find the reason why a race that should be a breeze might turn into a battle, she doesn\u2019t have to ask a lot of questions. A glance in the mirror will do.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Democrat George Sheldon announced Monday his candidacy to be Florida\u2019s attorney general in 2014.
