The problem is, sometimes you have to take that dreaded leap of faith before your side income grows big enough to support you.\n\nAnd those who plan to leave 9-to-5 jobs to start a small business should be worried; only about half of small businesses survive five years or more, according to the Small Business Administration. If you are counting on self-employment or a small business for a paycheck, that means the stakes are rather high.\n\n\n\nBut, are they too high? Before you walk away from your 9-to-5, you should make sure you\u2019re prepared financially for what lies ahead. Here are five questions that should weigh heavily on your mind before you take the plunge:\n\nDo I have an adequate emergency fund?\n\nHaving an emergency fund is crucial if you plan to walk away from the security of your day job. Not only will you need it for any true \u201cemergencies,\u201d but you may also need it as a buffer if your plans begin to unravel \u2013 or worst case scenario \u2013 your new situation doesn\u2019t work out at all. Most experts suggest you have three to six months of expenses stashed away in an emergency fund, but those who plan to strike out on their own may need even more. Regardless, make sure you\u2019re covered before you take the leap. Because once you do, it will be far, far too late.\n\nDo I have health insurance?\n\nOpen enrollment for 2015 is over, but Obamacare allows for a special enrollment period if you\u2019ve moved out of state, had a baby or experienced a job change. Since quitting your job is certainly a change that qualifies, you can still enroll in a new Affordable Care Act-approved plan and avoid the penalty for not having health insurance. If your spouse is covered, also see how much it might cost to add you to his or her plan. Compare your options and choose which one makes the most sense. Just make sure you\u2019re covered.\n\nDo I have a backup plan?\n\nStarting your own business may sound grand at first, but if you\u2019re in that 50 percent that doesn\u2019t make it for the long haul, you might be back to your job search sooner than you think. If you\u2019re currently licensed to work in a specific field, plan on keeping up your license while you make sure your new career is working out. This may require continued education, attending career seminars or simply staying on top of changes in your field. If you-know-what hits the fan, you\u2019ll be glad you put in the effort.\n\nWill I still be able to save?\n\nSaving for the future is easier when your retirement contributions are deducted via payroll and your company is kind enough to make a 401(k) match. But when you\u2019re on your own, not so much. Before you quit your 9-to-5 job, it is essential to start planning how you will save for retirement and for the future without any help from an employer. Consider opening up your own SEP IRA or Solo 401(k) with a quality brokerage firm and make your contributions automatic \u2013 or else you might forget.\n\nHow will I cover my fixed expenses?\n\nYour regular career may be on hold, but that doesn\u2019t mean your monthly bills will stop rolling in. Before you quit, ask yourself if you have a realistic plan to pay things such as your mortgage, utilities and transportation expenses. The last thing you need when starting a new business is a ton of unpaid bills hanging over your head, so create a plan ahead of time that will cover your monthly expenses while you grow your income.\n\nStarting your own business might be the best thing you\u2019ve ever done \u2013 or it could be a complete nightmare. Either way, you\u2019ll have much better chances at success if you are adequately prepared and realistic about your financial situation.\n\nBecause, job or not, life goes on \u2026 and so will your bills.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_Millennials\",\"text\":\"More than 60 percent of millennials don\u2019t have a credit card.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Are you financially prepared to walk out that door?", "zone": "blogs/my-money/blogentries", "author": "Holly Johnson", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Are you financially prepared to walk out that door?", "title": "5 Things to Consider Before Leaving Your 9 to 5", "url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2015/02/27/5-things-to-consider-before-leaving-your-9-to-5", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/8d/b7/27e7302b43d3a8f89ccf5c123392/140722-leavingoffice-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "5 Things to Consider Before Leaving Your 9 to 5 - US News", "description": "Are you financially prepared to walk out that door?", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "keywords": "personal finance,money,careers,income,business,401(k)s,savings,personal budgets,health insurance,Holly Johnson", "published_at": "2015-02-27", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z75nd1", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-02-27"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/995948f/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F8d%2Fb7%2F27e7302b43d3a8f89ccf5c123392%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140722-leavingoffice-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "If you are counting on self-employment or a small business for a paycheck, that means the stakes are rather high.\nBefore you walk away from your 9-to-5, you should make sure you\u2019re prepared financially for what lies ahead.\nAnd those who plan to leave 9-to-5 jobs to start a small business should be worried; only about half of small businesses survive five years or more, according to the Small Business Administration.\nRegardless, make sure you\u2019re covered before you take the leap.\nJust make sure you\u2019re covered."}
