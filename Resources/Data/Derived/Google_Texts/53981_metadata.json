U.S. News, perhaps the most consumer focused of the lists, uses patient experience metrics and other stats like nursing levels, survival rates and patient volume.\n\n[Also: U.S. News ranks nation's best hospitals.]\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services uses answers to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys, a purely patient-experience metric, to assign its star rankings.\n\nHealthgrades runs two lists, one based on HCAHPS scores and another based on clinical outcomes and then combines them to come up with its Top 100. Truven also runs a Top 100, but adds financial performance stats to its measure of clinical results.\n\nLeapfrog bases its rankings on patient safety.\n\nWhile in comparison, no hospital on the U.S. News Honor Roll flat-out failed in other rankings, in many cases they received only average scores or didn't show up at all.\n\nHere's the comparison.
