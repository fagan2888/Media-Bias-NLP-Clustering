Grimes emptied his pockets of $31 worth of candy before police arrived to arrest him. Grimes was charged with a felony, which could immediately mean up to two years in prison. However, because Grimes had been convicted of five thefts in the past, he is subject to Louisiana\u2019s unique and particularly harsh habitual offender laws. As such, it is entirely possible Grimes will face at least 20 years behind bars, and may even spend the rest of his life there.\n\nThe lawyers representing Grimes say he\u2019s pleaded guilty in the past to thefts of less than $500 at Blockbuster Video, Rite-Aid, Save-A-Center and Rouses. Grimes last spent four years in prison after shoplifting socks and pants from a Dollar General store. This time, however, Grimes has pleaded not guilty in the hopes of being spared Louisiana\u2019s habitual offender sentencing laws.\n\nThe judge who heard Grimes\u2019 not guilty plea did not shy away from criticizing the very real possibility of a 20 year sentence. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a little over the top,\u201d Judge Franz Zibilich asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not even funny.\u201d Why, if even the judge overseeing Grimes\u2019 arraignment can see the lunacy of imprisoning someone over $31 of candy, is this likely to be Grimes\u2019 fate?\n\nIn the 1970s, the federal government and many states adopted mandatory minimum sentencing laws. At the outset, the intention was to discourage sentencing discrepancies that might result from a bias. The mandatory minimum sentencing fad turned out to be more than a passing notion \u2014 such laws still exist all over the U.S.\n\nUnfortunately, despite well-meaning intentions, minimum sentencing laws have prompted the rise of the legal monsters sometimes referred to as habitual offender laws. Both have taken much power out of judges\u2019 hands \u2014 all too often, judges merely read from a law during sentencing, rather than providing any input.\n\nSome states have taken steps to limit or end this type of legislation, among the most common being the \u201cthree strike\u201d laws, as in California. Louisiana, though, has taken the opposite approach, arguably playing host to some of the U.S.\u2019s most draconian and baffling habitual offender laws. RS 15:529.1 details in convoluted legalese the way in which, using a calculus, repeat offenders are sentenced, distinctly different from \u201cthree strike\u201d laws.\n\nNot all repeat offenders in Louisiana are tried under these laws; it\u2019s up to the prosecutor\u2019s discretion, either way. If habitual offender laws are applied, then that\u2019s called getting \u201cmulti-billed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Minden Press-Herald, Webster District Attorney Schuyler Marvin explains this process. After being sentenced \u201cyou have to have another trial to prove he is who you say he is, and that these prior convictions are for (the person) charged. So you would call (to the stand) a fingerprint expert or a probation officer to say \u2018I know for a fact that he\u2019s guilty of possession of cocaine or possession of Schedule III, and I know that because I was his probation officer, and I supervised him for those offenses.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce this is done, the prior sentence is often expanded, depending on the number and type of prior convictions. Even second-time convictions can result in sentences being doubled. Because of the highly undesirable nature of that type of outcome, the threat of getting multi-billed will almost always land the prosecutor a guilty plea deal.\n\nIn Jacobia Grimes\u2019 current case, Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro chose to push for multi-billing. In 2010, Cannizaaro was responsible for serving Grimes a four-year sentence after also pursuing multi-billing for Grimes\u2019 second offense.\n\nWithin the U.S., Louisiana has the special distinction of being the undisputed king of incarceration rates: Nearly nine in every 1,000 Louisianans are doing at least one year in state prison. (Compared that to the national rate of less than five per 1,000.) In 2011, the state\u2019s prisons were holding almost 40,000 inmates. Given Louisiana\u2019s heavy-handed habitual offender laws, this should come as little surprise.\n\nThe rationale behind habitual offender laws centers on the thought that some people will simply continue to commit crimes regardless, so the best thing is to lock them up. Unfortunately, this more often than not becomes a first, not a last resort. Lawyers for Grimes say he has problems with drug use and has only a ninth-grade education.\n\nIt should seem obvious to anyone looking at Grimes\u2019 situation, he needs help, not punishment. Someone who steals $31 worth of candy or a pair of pants is not a danger to society; he is someone who needs to find a reason to stop doing those things. If he were getting rehabilitated and educated in employable skills, would Grimes be filling his pockets with candy bars?\n\nIt will cost Louisiana $18,800 every year \u2014 that\u2019s $376,000 over two decades \u2014 to keep Grimes in prison. Does that seem like a rational use of taxpayer money and a human life?\n\nPhoto Credit: sakhorn38 / Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana is prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to punish a man for filling his pockets with candy.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3174/3173649.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "louisiana,mandatory minimums,habitual offender laws,three strikes laws,prison reform,new orleans", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, despite well-meaning intentions, minimum sentencing laws have prompted the rise of the legal monsters sometimes referred to as habitual offender laws.\nThis time, however, Grimes has pleaded not guilty in the hopes of being spared Louisiana\u2019s habitual offender sentencing laws.\nIf habitual offender laws are applied, then that\u2019s called getting \u201cmulti-billed.\u201dSpeaking to the Minden Press-Herald, Webster District Attorney Schuyler Marvin explains this process.\nGiven Louisiana\u2019s heavy-handed habitual offender laws, this should come as little surprise.\nIn the 1970s, the federal government and many states adopted mandatory minimum sentencing laws."}
