This is not true,\" he explained. \u201cWe know from several other studies that some high-dose dietary supplements \u2014 that is, supplements that provide far more than the daily recommended intakes of micronutrients \u2014 increase cancer risk.\n\n\u201cWe knew this based on randomized, controlled, double-blinded studies for folate and beta carotene, and now we know it for vitamin E and selenium,\u201d he added.\n\nThe study, which is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, analyzed data gathered by the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) \u2014 a large-scale survey that, ironically, sought to determine whether high doses of vitamin E or selenium could help reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Kristal and colleagues found that, two years after the study was shut down, those who had been given a high daily dose of vitamin E had increased their risk of prostate cancer by 17 percent.\n\nIn addition, men who entered the trial with high baseline levels of selenium nearly doubled their risk of high-grade cancer if they were given a high daily dose of selenium. \"These supplements are popular \u2014 especially vitamin E \u2014 although so far no large, well-designed and well-conducted study has shown any benefits for preventing major chronic disease,\" Kristal told reporters. \"Men using these supplements should stop, period. Neither selenium nor vitamin E supplementation confers any known benefits \u2014 only risks.\u201d\n\nSupplements and Prostate Cancer\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that prostate cancer kills about 30,000 Americans annually, with nearly 200,000 new cases each year. Besides skin cancer, it is the most common cancer in American males. Although few sufferers report early symptoms, signs of nascent prostate cancer include difficulties urinating and back pain.\n\nThe current study is the latest in a growing series of inquiries into supplement use in the U.S. With the public spending about $28 billion each year on multivitamins and supplements, more and more experts are charging that most of these products are a waste of money \u2014 and, possibly harmful in large doses.\n\n\u201cTaking a broad view of the recent scientific studies there is an emerging consistency about how we think about optimal intake of micronutrients,\" Kristal said. \"There are optimal levels, and these are often the levels obtained from a healthful diet, but either below or above the levels there are risks.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vitamin e, selenium, supplements, prostate cancer, multivitamins", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vitamin E and selenium supplements are associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer risk, a new study finds.", "title": "Men Taking Vitamin E, Selenium Should Stop Immediately, Experts Say", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vitamin-e-selenium-shown-increase-risk-prostate-cancer-men-using-supplements-should-stop-immediately", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/vitamins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vitamin E and selenium supplements are associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer risk, a new study finds.", "title": "Men Taking Vitamin E, Selenium Should Stop Immediately, Experts Say", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vitamin-e-selenium-shown-increase-risk-prostate-cancer-men-using-supplements-should-stop-immediately", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/vitamins.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/vitamins.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-21T16:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T16:01:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vitamin E and selenium supplements are associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer risk, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37d0\"", "article_summary": "Although few sufferers report early symptoms, signs of nascent prostate cancer include difficulties urinating and back pain.\n\u201cWe know from several other studies that some high-dose dietary supplements \u2014 that is, supplements that provide far more than the daily recommended intakes of micronutrients \u2014 increase cancer risk.\nNew research shows that dietary supplements containing high levels of vitamin E and selenium may increase the risk of prostate cancer, illuminating a new risk factor of the disease that kills thousands of U.S. men each year.\nIn addition, men who entered the trial with high baseline levels of selenium nearly doubled their risk of high-grade cancer if they were given a high daily dose of selenium.\nNeither selenium nor vitamin E supplementation confers any known benefits \u2014 only risks.\u201dSupplements and Prostate CancerThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that prostate cancer kills about 30,000 Americans annually, with nearly 200,000 new cases each year."}
