National Institute on Drug Abuse\n\nKids still aren\u2019t learning about the potential harms they risk from using synthetic marijuana products such as spice. New Hampshire\u2019s Governor Maggie Hassan declared a state of emergency on Thursday following the overdoses of at least 44 people living in Manchester who had used a synthetic marijuana product called Smacked, which was sold as potpourri.\n\n\u201cThese products pose a serious threat to public health, especially to young people, and it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to combat the recent rash of overdoses,\u201d Hassan said in a statement. Although there had been 41 cases by the time Hassan released the statement, an additional three cases were reported within the past 24 hours, according to CBS Boston. The synthetic cannabinoid caused \u201cserious medical reactions,\u201d including elevated heart rates and seizures, in all reported cases, with at least 20 people taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nBy declaring a state of emergency, police have the go-ahead to investigate, quarantine, and destroy the Smacked products, of which they\u2019re targeting the bubblegum flavor specifically. Although the legal products are labeled as \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d and sold as incense or potpourri, they\u2019re sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in marijuana. They\u2019re also sold in colorful packaging, and given names that would attract people looking to get high, such as Crazy Monkey and Green Giant.\n\nSpeaking to CBS Boston, police chief David Mara said that a \u201cbad batch\u201d of Smacked may have made its way to stores. He warned about the effects of smoking these man-made products, whose chemical makeups change regularly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting, there\u2019s no FDA check, and it\u2019s sold under the pretense of being potpourri,\u201d he said. Three stores have already been shut down after not cooperating with the investigation.\n\nSynthetic marijuana has become an increasingly difficult issue to tackle for the U.S. government and drug enforcement agencies. In 2012, 11.3 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana, according to White House data. Although authorities have made efforts to ban the products, it only takes a slight chemical alteration to create a new product that is legally sellable. Because of this, there were 51 new synthetic cannabinoids identified in 2012, compared to two in 2009.\n\nBesides the product packaging, its price and availability, as well as the fact that it can\u2019t be detected in standard drug tests makes it an attractive alternative to teens who might be on their school\u2019s sports teams, or who want to try \u201cweed\u201d without going the illegal route. However, the drug\u2019s unpredictability has caused people to experience hallucinations, seizures, vomiting, paranoia, and sometimes comas or death.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "44, overdoses, synthetic, weed, spice, spur, state, emergency, new, hampshire, why, are, teens", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "At least 44 people have overdosed on synthetic weed in New Hampshire, forcing its governor, Maggie Hassan, to declare a state of emergency.", "title": "New Hampshire Declares State Of Emergency Due To Synthetic Weed Overdoses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/44-overdoses-synthetic-weed-spice-spur-state-emergency-new-hampshire-why-are-teens-smoking-298262", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/k2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least 44 people have overdosed on synthetic weed in New Hampshire, forcing its governor, Maggie Hassan, to declare a state of emergency.", "title": "New Hampshire Declares State Of Emergency Due To Synthetic Weed Overdoses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/44-overdoses-synthetic-weed-spice-spur-state-emergency-new-hampshire-why-are-teens-smoking-298262", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/k2.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/k2.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-15T13:03:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T13:03:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "At least 44 people have overdosed on synthetic weed in New Hampshire, forcing its governor, Maggie Hassan, to declare a state of emergency."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93a2\"", "article_summary": "National Institute on Drug AbuseKids still aren\u2019t learning about the potential harms they risk from using synthetic marijuana products such as spice.\nSynthetic marijuana has become an increasingly difficult issue to tackle for the U.S. government and drug enforcement agencies.\nAt least 44 people have overdosed on synthetic weed in New Hampshire, forcing its governor, Maggie Hassan, to declare a state of emergency.\nIn 2012, 11.3 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana, according to White House data.\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Governor Maggie Hassan declared a state of emergency on Thursday following the overdoses of at least 44 people living in Manchester who had used a synthetic marijuana product called Smacked, which was sold as potpourri."}
