The Senate sought to draw a distinction between its plan and a straight expansion of the Medicaid program.\n\nBut the House and Gov. Rick Scott adamantly opposed the plan, arguing that the federal government couldn't be trusted and that Florida could get saddled with the expansion costs in the future. They frequently called Medicaid \"a broken system.\"\n\nWhile senators have focused heavily on access, the House and Scott have pushed for health-care changes that include reducing or eliminating some longstanding regulations. They contend that such ideas would create more competition and lower health-care costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gardiner said there were other ways to offer uninsured Floridians a safety net than the Senate insurance plan.\n\n\"If the desire in the state of Florida is not to necessarily look at a free-market option for the uninsured --- and that is a debate for another day --- I would encourage you to talk about models like \u2026 the free and charitable clinics,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Industries of Florida backed the Senate expansion plan, as did the summit's keynote speaker, Cindy Mann, a former top official at the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nMann said that while Medicaid has been easy to criticize for political purposes, \"that really is outdated thinking. \u2026 By 2016, it has become, literally, the largest single health-insurance program in the country.\"\n\nMann said states that expanded Medicaid coverage had seen lower private-sector premiums than the states that did not, along with a roughly 30 percent growth in health-care and social-service jobs.\n\nShe also indicated Florida should reconsider the terms of a key Medicaid \"waiver\" that expires next year. She said the state now operates much of its Medicaid program on the waiver, which includes enrolling most Medicaid beneficiaries in managed-care plans.\n\nSpeaker Lars Houmann, president and CEO of the Florida Division of Adventist Health System, also pointed to the opportunity to reconfigure the waiver. He said it could take \"a very different approach to covering health care for the poor and in fact increasing the availability of health care to that population.\"\n\nHowever, Houmann also was critical of Medicaid.\n\n\"Our Medicaid program is really not designed to succeed, for the beneficiaries and certainly not for the providers,\" he said. \"I could not put my heart into the term 'expanding Medicaid' when we were talking about the Affordable Care Act. I could put my heart into bringing the money that the Affordable Care Act made available for Florida into expanding coverage for a category of people.\"\n\nHe said he believed the federal government would have approved last year's Senate proposal, \"but we couldn't get that done. \u2026 But we have another chance now.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "Speakers at a health-care \"summit\" said Tuesday that expanding access to care for more Floridians could save the state money.The two-day Florida Health", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/expanding-access-called-key-addressing-health-issues", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201308/stock_doctor_and_patient.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Speakers at a health-care \"summit\" said Tuesday that expanding access to care for more Floridians could save the state money.The two-day Florida Health", "title": "Expanding Access Called Key In Addressing Health Issues"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Margie Menzel of The News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 680, "dc": {"title": "Expanding Access Called Key In Addressing Health Issues"}, "nid": 14438, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "story_id": 475866083, "keywords": "Florida Health Care Affordability Summit, expanding access to health care, Associated Industries of Florida, free clinics, charitable clinics, uninsured residents, Florida Legislature", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb488\"", "article_summary": "He said it could take \"a very different approach to covering health care for the poor and in fact increasing the availability of health care to that population.\"\nSpeakers at a health-care \"summit\" said Tuesday that expanding access to care for more Floridians could save the state money.\nThe two-day Florida Health Care Affordability Summit, sponsored by the business group Associated Industries of Florida, included lawmakers and experts addressing topics ranging from controlling drug costs to expanding treatment options through technology.\n\"I could not put my heart into the term 'expanding Medicaid' when we were talking about the Affordable Care Act.\n\"I would just encourage you, while you're doing that, to also talk about access --- and access for all individuals,\" Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said to the audience gathered in Orlando."}
