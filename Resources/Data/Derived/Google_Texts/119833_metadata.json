That compromise will likely also open the \u201cnonessential\u201d parts of government, which have been shuttered since Oct. 1, under a separate partial government shutdown.\n\nReid called Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday afternoon, but serious differences remain in their approach to raise the debt ceiling and open the government. McConnell believes the current funding levels set by sequestration should stay in place, which would cut $21 billion in mid-January from the $986 billion budget. Reid prefers to extend sequester funding only through mid-November. Senate Democrats, led by Budget Committee chairwoman Patty Murray \u2014 the Democrat from Washington \u2014 hope the short-term extension will allow long-term budget negotiations where they seek $1.058 trillion for 2014.\n\nMcConnell embraced a plan by Senator Susan Collins \u2014 the Republican from Maine \u2014 on Sunday, which would raise the debt limit through January and fund the government through the end of March, while delaying for two years Obamacare\u2019s medical-device tax and require income verification in order to qualify for Obamacare subsidies. The plan is a far cry from what House Republicans asked for two weeks ago \u2014 which would have kept the government running at the same level, but also defund for a year the entire Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith polls showing steeper declines for Republicans, who kicked off the current brinkmanship by refusing to fund the government, Democratic leaders in Congress and the White House continue to believe they have a clear advantage as the negotiations enter the final days before the debt-limit deadline. Most Senate Democrats and many rank-and-file House Republicans rejected the Collins plan on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere is a bipartisan plan in place that has the support of Democrat and Republican Senators,\u201d wrote McConnell in a public statement released on Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt would reopen the government, prevent a default, provide the opportunity for additional budget negotiations around Washington\u2019s long-term debt, and maintain the commitment that Congress made to reduce Washington spending through the Budget Control Act \u2014 the law of the land. It does all this while maintaining our commitments to reduce spending, cutting an Obamacare tax and improving antifraud provisions in the law. It\u2019s time for Democrat leaders to take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer.\u201d\n\nFive of the Senate Democrats most likely to support the Collins plan \u2014 Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2014 as well as independent Maine Senator Angus King, countered McConnell\u2019s charge. \u201cWe have been involved in productive, bipartisan discussions with Senator Collins and other Republican Senators, but we do not support the proposal in its current form,\u201d they wrote in a public statement. \u201cThere are negotiations, but there is no agreement.\u201d\n\nWhile the House leadership is in close contact with McConnell\u2019s office, it is unclear what Speaker John Boehner thinks of the Collins plan. \u201cI believe the Senate majority leader rejected Senator Collins\u2019 plan yesterday,\u201d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel wrote in an e-mail to TIME. \u201cSo that is moot.\u201d\n\nDuring the debt-ceiling negotiations of 2011 and the fiscal-cliff negotiations of 2012, Vice President Joe Biden and McConnell were the main players in brokering the deal. This weekend, McConnell and Reid finally began negotiations while Biden left town for Camp David. \u201cMaybe we need to get Joe Biden out of the witness-protection program,\u201d Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona quipped on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cI hope the President will become engaged,\u201d he added. President Obama welcomed both the House and Senate Republican conferences to the White House this week.\n\nReid has expressed concern about Biden\u2019s involvement in the current round of negotiations because he believes Biden gave up too much in the 2011 and 2012 battles. Biden\u2019s absence, and Reid\u2019s unwavering position over the past two weeks, implies that the Democrats won\u2019t yield much in the final negotiations. Reid, for his part, is perfectly happy filling the role as the lead Democrat negotiator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion to the issues before this country today,\u201d said Reid on the Senate floor on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The weekend was not long enough to get the job done.
