However, aluminum loses its strength faster than steel at high temperatures. The GAO states that while the Navy has identified the flaw and conducted tests, the service lacks enough data on how fire or underwater explosions might affect the ship\u2019s hull, and won\u2019t have the information until 2018.\n\n\"The vulnerability of the ship\u2019s hull to various sea conditions also remains unknown,\" the report said. \"Due to the dynamic nature of waves, the Navy cannot rely on modeling and simulation alone to provide an accurate assessment of a ship\u2019s performance in rough seas.\"\n\nThe two deficiencies led the GAO to recommend the service hold off on spending the $1.4 billion it requested for fiscal 2016 to buy three more ships.\n\nThe Navy was expected to spend around $37 billion on the LCS program. But that was before Defense Secretary Ash Carter sent a letter to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus earlier this month instructing him to cut the service\u2019s projected purchase from 52 to 40 vessels; \u201cdownselect\u201d to one ship model by fiscal 2019, rather than continue with the two designs that exist today; and put the savings toward upgrading other ships and buying more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.\n\nRelated: The Navy\u2019s New $362 Million Ship Needs a Tow to Get Home\n\nThe directive leaves the total cost in flux, especially since Capitol Hill lawmakers haven\u2019t had a chance to scrutinize Carter\u2019s proposed plan yet. Already the congressional delegations from Wisconsin and Alabama, where the vessels are built, have vowed to fight the move.\n\nThe GAO report, a classified version of which was completed in July, likely influenced Carter\u2019s thinking on the fate of the troubled LCS effort. The program has been besieged with cost overruns and schedule delays.\n\nDaniel Gour\u00e9, a national security and military analyst with the Lexington Institute, wrote that Carter\u2019s instruction \u201cmay have been to encourage the other service secretaries as well as the leadership of the services to get with the program which is, to use current jargon, capability over capacity.\u201d\n\nPut another way: stick with weapons and equipment that already exist or are within reach and can be used by the maximum number of people, rather than pursue costly efforts that could lead to painful cuts elsewhere.\n\nRelated: Congress Showers the F-35 Program with Cash\n\nGour\u00e9 said the three military branches are \u201cfalling behind when it comes to the qualitative arms race with a range of opponents. For the Navy, the Army and perhaps even the other services, this means sacrificing quantity in order to bolster quality.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "Has the Navy Wasted Billions on Its New Combat Ship?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Has-Navy-Wasted-Billions-Its-New-Combat-Ship", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12222015_Littoral_Combat_Ship.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Has-Navy-Wasted-Billions-Its-New-Combat-Ship", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12222015_Littoral_Combat_Ship.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Why the Pentagon Is Cutting Back on Its New Combat ShipThe LCS uses an aluminum alloy that\u2019s unlike any used in other Navy ships, cutting the ship\u2019s weight to increase its speed.\nThe Navy was expected to spend around $37 billion on the LCS program.\nThe U.S. Navy shouldn\u2019t spend any more money on the Littoral Combat Ship, a vessel designed to be small and speedy in shallow waters close to shore, because it\u2019s unclear if it has enough firepower or can even survive in combat, according to the government\u2019s top watchdog agency.\nFor the Navy, the Army and perhaps even the other services, this means sacrificing quantity in order to bolster quality.\u201d\n\"Due to the dynamic nature of waves, the Navy cannot rely on modeling and simulation alone to provide an accurate assessment of a ship\u2019s performance in rough seas.\""}
