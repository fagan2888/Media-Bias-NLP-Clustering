They call it a community hospital, or a micro-hospital.\n\nUnlike freestanding ERs, a micro-hospital must meet stricter standards since they\u2019ll provide inpatient care, which includes accepting Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThis concept though has inpatient beds and 24/7 call coverage and has the ability to move someone out of the emergency room and push them into observation or a short stay hospital environment without having to transfer them,\u201d said Darin Szilagyi, chief strategy and business development officer.\n\nThe hospital is significantly smaller compared to Mother Frances\u2019 larger facilities, with about 12 and 18 beds total, officials estimate.\n\nIt will be possible because of a joint agreement with Emerus, a physician-founded, for-profit company that makes investments in established hospital systems.\n\nThey\u2019ve had joint ventures with 15 hospitals in the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio areas. They\u2019ll soon open four hospitals in Colorado and are in discussions about others.\n\nRay Thompson, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics, said there has been growth in all of Mother Frances\u2019 emergency services, with 74,000 emergency department visits in a year at Mother Frances Hospital alone.\n\nThe new hospital will be at the northwest corner of Cumberland Road and Broadway Avenue. Thompson said the hospital bridges a gap of care that is needed in a highly populated area, also bringing some relief to the downtown flagship.\n\nThat area of Tyler has exploded in growth in recent years, and hospital administrators say it\u2019s an appropriate location in that it lacks \u201cease of access.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Emerus officials) felt that anything that was in that area close to Broadway would be a very good location to serve that growth in that part of town,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cIt was a very analytical approach used to make that determination.\u201d\n\nTHE BUSINESS MODEL\n\nAdministrators say it\u2019s time to consider new ways to deliver medicine as hospitals adjust to provisions in the Affordable Care Act and other changes in the industry.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re on the leading edge \u2014 considering unique and different ways to provide high quality care to people,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is a way to bring health care to people all over America in a fashion that\u2019s different from the past. In the future, there will be a lot more partnerships like this occurring. There will be a new model of health care.\u201d\n\nMother Frances administrators have mulled over the idea of a new facility for about two years.\n\nThe joint venture will create a new company, which is so far unnamed. The agreement is a 51/49 partnership, with Mother Frances leading. Thompson said while they are not committed right now, their partnership gives them the ability to build similar facilities in the area in the future.\n\nHospital officials haven\u2019t cited an estimated cost of construction yet but note the costs will be shared between Mother Frances and Emerus.\n\nSzilagyi said they were attracted to Emerus\u2019 attention to design, such as facilities that give staff the ability to wash their hands while facing the patient, and to its focus on reducing waiting times.\n\nEmerus\u2019 waiting areas are small, Szilgayi said, seating no more than about a dozen people.\u201cThey don\u2019t want the patients out waiting,\u201d Szilagyi said. They want to facilitate you back to a room as quickly as possible. Traditional hospitals think often about how do we keep people in a waiting room and move them back. That\u2019s an old way of thinking about tit. The Emerus model is if you\u2019re out there, you\u2019re not being seen.\u201d\n\nMother Frances Hospitals and Clinics\u2019 officials received input from its emergency room physicians and surgeons before setting their sights on an Emerus partnership.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that intrigued us is their patient satisfaction scores are high,\u201d Szilagyi said. \u201cThey have a model that\u2019s very much unlike traditional health care. It\u2019s built around speed back to the room. It\u2019s a patient-centric approach, customer service-oriented, almost like a retail industry.\u201d\n\nLance Lunsford, vice president of strategic communication at the Texas Hospital Association, said partnerships among health care groups would continue to be a trend for years to come.\n\n\u201cThese hospitals would be able to team up with someone who does this specialty of managing these types of facilities and expand their reach,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cThe trend is going to continue, and hospitals are going to be making investments to make sure they\u2019re able to provide services for the same patients that some of the freestanding emergency departments are attracting.\u201d\n\nWhether to visit an emergency room, stand alone ER, urgent care center or a community hospital may be tricky for patients who need treatment fast.\n\n\u201cThis is where people are getting confused,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cThe hospital of today is not like the hospital of the 50s or 60s. Not all hospitals are doing all things. In the past, hospitals worked as large, all-servicing monoliths. Today a hospital will develop, based on the needs of a certain population.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cA micro hospital or mini hospital makes a ton of sense, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll go there and get everything you need, and that\u2019s by design. However, they\u2019ll have a referral system and will service patients in one way, shape or form.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "By the end of 2016, Tyler residents will have another option for quick access to health care whe...", "title": "New Mother Frances 'micro-hospital' to offer emergency, inpatient care - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/219858/new-mother-frances-microhospital-to-offer-emergency-inpatient-care", "image": "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/e1/pd/2322069287001/2322069287001_4225366376001_4225105363001-th.jpg?pubId=2322069287001", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Ray Thompson, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics, said there has been growth in all of Mother Frances\u2019 emergency services, with 74,000 emergency department visits in a year at Mother Frances Hospital alone.\nIn talking about the new venture, Mother Frances administrators note it is much more than a stand-alone emergency department.\nThe hospital is significantly smaller compared to Mother Frances\u2019 larger facilities, with about 12 and 18 beds total, officials estimate.\nBy the end of 2016, Tyler residents will have another option for quick access to health care when something goes wrong.\nMother Frances Hospitals and Clinics' newest health care offering will differ from urgent care centers in that most are designed only to handle simple, non-life-threatening medical complaints, often during regular or extended business hours."}
