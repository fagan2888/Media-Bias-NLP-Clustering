As Turner sees it, policy makers and economic thinkers across the globe remain in thrall to the belief that only unfettered financial markets deliver the best for societies. The resulting bias favors fixed rules and mathematical models often wildly out of touch with real world conditions. Turner calls for a reality check \u2014 the recognition that circumstances change, that the future is uncertain, and that we need flexible approaches to shifting market circumstances at a time of inequality and instability. He warns that taboos against printing money and disproportionate fears of fiscal deficits are keeping central banks from taking crucial measures to stimulate economies. These taboos and fears also make us blind to the threat of out-of-control private debt and credit wasted on real estate and speculation rather than growth that lifts everyone. For Turner, thinking radically is the most practical way forward. *This post was originally published on the blog of the Institute for New Economic Thinking.\n\nLynn Parramore: You\u2019ve noted that economies have become dangerously focused on credit in recent decades and that rising inequality is connected to this trend. Can you explain the link?\n\nAdair Turner: If you look back at the story of advanced economies over the 20 years before 2007, you see an interesting pattern. During that period, the total value of national income \u2014 what economists call \u201cnominal GDP,\u201d meaning income unadjusted for inflation \u2014grew at about 5 percent per year in a reasonably steady fashion. The central banks patted themselves on the back and said: This is great! Things are running smoothly. We\u2019ve got the \u201cGreat Moderation.\u201d\n\nYet during all of that time, the value of all credit, unadjusted for inflation, grew at about 10 to15 percent per year. At the time, it seemed like we needed that pace of credit growth, but when you think about it, if your credit is going to grow at 10-15 percent per year in order to get your 5 percent GDP growth per year, eventually you\u2019re going to have a problem. This isn\u2019t a stable system. In my view, one of the reasons that it seemed that credit had to grow faster than total income was rising inequality.\n\nLP: Why are people borrowing more when inequality is rising?\n\nAT: The richer people, when they get another $100,000, or another million, or 10 million, don\u2019t tend to spend it as much as the poorer people would if they got another $100 or $1,000 or $5,000. All the empirical evidence suggests that the rich tend to consume a lower proportion of income than middle and lower-income people. So rising inequality can lead to a major problem with the demand for goods and services. The rich aren\u2019t spending their additional money, so overall, more money gets taken out of the economy. Unless the richer people decide to invest their money, there would be a slowdown in the economy. This idea goes back to economists like John Maynard Keynes and Alvin Hansen.\n\nBut before 2007, we didn\u2019t have a slowdown. Instead, the savings of the rich ended up going through the financial system and being lent to middle and lower-income people, who had 30 years of no real income increase whatsoever. The figures for the U.S. are really quite startling. If you look at the bottom 20 or 25 percent of the population, their real wages haven\u2019t gone up for about 35 years! Meanwhile, the incomes of the top 1 percent have gone up 200 percent. This is a dramatic increase. The savings at the top have to go somewhere. At the bottom, there is a group of people who don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re participating in the growing prosperity, so they become very vulnerable to the delusion that if they borrow the money and buy a house, they\u2019ll make up for their lack of real wages by house prices always going up.\n\nLP: For a while, it seemed to work. People felt like their house was the ticket to prosperity.\n\nAT: Yes, for the decade leading up to 2007, a whole lot of people who weren\u2019t getting raises felt that they were doing ok because they managed to buy a house that was going up in price. But it all came to an end, a catastrophic end. Rising inequality can create a more highly leveraged economy, and it can then make the economy vulnerable to a crash like 2008. And in that crash, the really malign thing is that the crash itself tends to further increase inequality because it tends to be the people at the lower end of the wealth distribution who were highly leveraged and had to borrow lots of money to buy their house. In the downswing, they lose all the wealth they\u2019ve got.\n\nThere\u2019s a wonderful illustration of this by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in their book, House of Debt. They show that the process of debt-fueled booms and busts is a very effective way of periodically redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich.\n\nLP: What can we do about this? Are we making any progress in stabilizing the financial system and getting all this private debt and inequality under control?\n\nAT: I do think that we need far more radical policies than we\u2019ve had so far. I spent 4 \u00bd years of my life from September, 2008 to March, 2013 deeply involved in all of the details of the re-regulation of the global financial system. I was the chair of the main policy committee of the international Financial Stability Board and deeply involved with designing Basel III, which overhauled rules on banking. I was knee-deep in the nitty-gritty. I would defend what we\u2019ve done and I think that the job we did has helped make the financial system itself more stable, and therefore less likely to cause a rapidly-developing crisis of the sort that developed in 2007-8.\n\nThat is the good news, but I think we\u2019ve made almost no progress at all in dealing with the fundamental drivers of economies that are too reliant on debt. We have not dealt with the fundamental fragilities that arise from inequality, from the bias of the lending system towards real estate, and from global imbalances. I think we are still stuck in a post-crisis malaise \u2014 you see it less in the U.S. but you can clearly see it in Europe or Japan. Even in the U.S., the pace of job creation has picked up, but employment rates are still well below what they were in 2007. Real wages have not gone up. The capitalist system is not delivering those decade-after-decade increases it promised. We\u2019re not where we should be in terms of our national economies. We don\u2019t know how to get out of this malaise and I think we now have to consider more radical policies. That\u2019s key to moving forward, particularly in Europe and Japan.\n\nWe need more radical policies so that we don\u2019t just repeat the debt-fueled booms all over again and do another blow-up in 2025 or 2035.\n\nLP: If you could wave a magic wand and put one of these radical policies into action, which would you choose?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Between Debt and the Devil\" author Adair Turner on how our fears of fiscal deficit are holding us back and more", "title": "Economic radicalism is the only answer: The most practical way to fix our broken economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Between Debt and the Devil\" author Adair Turner on how our fears of fiscal deficit are holding us back and more", "title": "Economic radicalism is the only answer: The most practical way to fix our broken economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/why_getting_radical_might_be_the_most_practical_way_to_fix_the_economy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bernie_sanders13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Between Debt and the Devil\" author Adair Turner on how our fears of fiscal deficit are holding us back and more", "title": "Economic radicalism is the only answer: The most practical way to fix our broken economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bernie_sanders13.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Stuart Parramore", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, aol_on, Debt, Fiscal Debt, Income inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Are we making any progress in stabilizing the financial system and getting all this private debt and inequality under control?\nI spent 4 \u00bd years of my life from September, 2008 to March, 2013 deeply involved in all of the details of the re-regulation of the global financial system.\nRising inequality can create a more highly leveraged economy, and it can then make the economy vulnerable to a crash like 2008.\nThe rich aren\u2019t spending their additional money, so overall, more money gets taken out of the economy.\nInstead, the savings of the rich ended up going through the financial system and being lent to middle and lower-income people, who had 30 years of no real income increase whatsoever."}
