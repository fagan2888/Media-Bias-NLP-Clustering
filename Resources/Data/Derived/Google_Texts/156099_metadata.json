However, the kickoff song from the band\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Tell a Soul\u201d is a classic Westerbergian tale about being an underdog infiltrating the cool kids club, a favorite Taylor topic\u2014and this vaguely twangy tune has Swift written all over it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Janet Jackson's \"Escapade\" to Elvis Costello's \"Veronica,\" these '89 tunes are asking for a Swiftian revamp VIDEO", "title": "10 songs from the year 1989 that Taylor Swift should cover", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Janet Jackson's \"Escapade\" to Elvis Costello's \"Veronica,\" these '89 tunes are asking for a Swiftian revamp VIDEO", "title": "10 songs from the year 1989 that Taylor Swift should cover", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/10_songs_from_the_year_1989_that_taylor_swift_should_cover/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/costello_swift.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Janet Jackson's \"Escapade\" to Elvis Costello's \"Veronica,\" these '89 tunes are asking for a Swiftian revamp VIDEO", "title": "10 songs from the year 1989 that Taylor Swift should cover", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/costello_swift.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Zaleski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1989, Editor's Picks, Music, Taylor Swift, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "1 hit \u201cToy Soldiers,\u201d a children\u2019s-choir-assisted ballad ready-made for Swift.\nTopics: 1989, Editor's Picks, Music, Taylor Swift, Video, Entertainment NewsTaylor Swift just released her highly anticipated new LP, \u201c1989.\u201d She\u2019s called it her \u201cfirst documented, official pop album,\u201d which is no hyperbole: From the perky \u201cShake It Off\u201d to the electronic-leaning, digitally processed \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d it\u2019s clear the singer-songwriter is striving for a higher echelon of pop stardom.\nHowever, the kickoff song from the band\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Tell a Soul\u201d is a classic Westerbergian tale about being an underdog infiltrating the cool kids club, a favorite Taylor topic\u2014and this vaguely twangy tune has Swift written all over it.\nMartika, \u201cToy Soldiers\u201dSwift\u2019s new song \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d resembles the airy electropop popularized by groups such as Chvrches\u2014music that is in turn inspired by \u201980s synthpop.\nWith this new direction, it seems appropriate to suggest 10 songs from the titular year of her album that she might want to cover\u2014especially considering the preponderance of classic glossy synthpop and dance jams from that year."}
