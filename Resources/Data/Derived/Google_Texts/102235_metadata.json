The average time spent in emergency departments before leaving the hospital is two hours, 26 minutes statewide and two hours, 22 minutes nationwide, according to data collected between July 1, 2014 and June 31, 2015 and released Wednesday by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s an issue in Northeastern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Ronald S. Strony, M.D., northeast regional director of the emergency medicine service line for Geisinger\u2019s northeast division. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a state and national issue. It\u2019s the hot topic of emergency medicine.\u201d\n\nCompared with hospitals in more populated communities, emergency room visits at rural hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania are dramatically quicker, the newspaper found.\n\nFor example, of nine hospitals in Lackawanna, Luzerne, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming counties, emergency room patients at Barnes-Kasson County Hospital in Susquehanna Depot were treated and left the hospital the fastest, on average in one hour, 19 minutes. Patients in Tunkhannock\u2019s Tyler Memorial Hospital emergency room left second-fastest, on average in one hour, 26 minutes.\n\nCMS also measures how long emergency room patients wait to see a health care professional \u2014 a physician, a physician\u2019s assistant, a nurse practitioner or a nurse midwife for pregnant women.\n\nHospital employees who first greet patients use national guidelines to determine who gets priority based on the severity of their injury or ailments, said Michael Consuelos, M.D., senior vice president of clinical integration with the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP). Those evidence-based protocols mean a patient having a heart attack may be seen before patients with sprained ankles and earaches.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re acutely sick, you\u2019re going to get in and get seen almost immediately,\u201d Strony said.\n\nPatients nationally and statewide waited about 25 minutes, on average, before their first contact with a health care professional.\n\nEmergency room patients waited the longest at Geisinger Wyoming Valley in Plains Township \u2014 54 minutes, more than double the state and national average. At Moses Taylor Hospital in Scranton, they waited 42 minutes and at Regional Hospital of Scranton, 46 minutes.\n\nThree area hospitals were below the national and state average: Barnes-Kasson, 15 minutes; Tyler Memorial at 11 minutes; and Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale, 24 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that we are below the state average, 24 minutes, when it comes to having patients seen by a health care professional,\u201d said Wayne Memorial\u2019s emergency department Medical Director Patrick Pugliese, M.D.\n\nWayne Memorial has made efficiency-minded improvements, he said, such as hiring an emergency room scribe to help keep patients\u2019 electronic health records.\n\n\u201cIt is an ongoing process and an issue that is never far from our minds,\u201d he said.\n\nWait times varied for hospitals in Pennsylvania\u2019s largest cities. Jefferson Regional Medical Center, UPMC Mercy Hospital and Magee Women\u2019s Hospital, all in Pittsburgh, came in with shorter-than-average times in most areas despite higher patient volume.\n\nIn Philadelphia, on the other hand, Pennsylvania Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center all had significantly longer wait times.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, emergency departments for decades have been looking at these types of measurements to improve patient flow,\u201d Consuelos said.\n\nIn search of the most expedient care, and depending on the severity of their medical needs, people could choose a hospital farther away if they believe they\u2019ll get faster care \u2014 and health systems know that.\n\nCommonwealth Health, which operates Moses Taylor, Regional Hospital, Tyler Memorial and Wilkes-Barre General, posts bright green billboards pledging patients will wait 30 minutes or less before being seen.\n\nSome digital billboards on area highways update the actual emergency room wait time for patients.\n\nDespite the pledge, patient volumes in emergency departments are rising, and strains on hospital staff and space availability mean they can\u2019t meet that pledge.\n\n\u201cWhile many patients are initially seen by a clinical professional within 30 minutes of their arrival, during some peak times when the number of patients and/or trauma situations exceeds the number of providers or beds, some patients are not initially seen within 30 minutes of their noted arrival,\u201d said Commonwealth vice president of marketing Annmarie Poslock in a prepared statement. Wilkes-Barre General\u2019s emergency department volume grew by 15 percent in 2015, she said.\n\nTimeliness is important, but quality can\u2019t be compromised, Poslock said.\n\n\u201cIt is not our objective now, nor will it ever be, to rush patients through the emergency department,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite provisions in the Affordable Care Act to lighten emergency room crowding, they remain the first stop for 30 to 50 percent of patients who later get admitted, Consuelos said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too early to say that the Affordable Care Act has failed in that way,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid copays for emergency room visits are going up to encourage patients to visit clinics or their regular doctors for care where the copay is less, he said.\n\nPeople have been slow to adopt alternatives like a 24-hour clinic, where they\u2019ll probably pay and wait less, or their primary care doctor. The typical emergency department model has consistency that people have come to expect \u2014 it\u2019s staffed, stocked and open all night and, under federal law, it has to let everyone in, Strony said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only place in medicine where no one can be turned away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfunded mandate, so we don\u2019t even have to make people pay.\u201d\n\njoconnell@timesshamrock.com, @jon_oc", "article_metadata": {"title": "At many area ERs, it\u2019s hurry up and wait", "author": "By Jon O'Connell", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Jon O'Connell", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2039848"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "At many area ERs, it\u2019s hurry up and wait"}, "article_summary": "Some digital billboards on area highways update the actual emergency room wait time for patients.\nCMS also measures how long emergency room patients wait to see a health care professional \u2014 a physician, a physician\u2019s assistant, a nurse practitioner or a nurse midwife for pregnant women.\nPatients in Tunkhannock\u2019s Tyler Memorial Hospital emergency room left second-fastest, on average in one hour, 26 minutes.\nEmergency room visits at several area hospitals can take on average at least three hours, significantly longer than state and national averages, a Sunday Times analysis found.\nEmergency room patients waited the longest at Geisinger Wyoming Valley in Plains Township \u2014 54 minutes, more than double the state and national average."}
