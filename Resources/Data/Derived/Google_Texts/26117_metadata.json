Tell us what you think.\n\nIt is generally assumed women in America are better off than women in other countries.\n\nIn some respects, that is true, but there is still quite a bit of gender inequality in this country, as a UN delegation discovered this month.\n\nThe delegation of human rights experts from Poland, the United Kingdom and Costa Rica spent 10 days this month touring the U.S. to prepare a report on the nation's overall treatment of women, Huffington Post reported. The three women, who lead a United Nations working group on discrimination against women, visited Alabama, Texas and Oregon to evaluate a wide range of U.S. policies and attitudes, as well as school, health and prison systems.\n\nThe delegates were appalled by the lack of gender equality in America, but perhaps the biggest surprise of their trip, they said, was learning women in this country don't seem to know what they're missing.\n\n\"So many people really believe that U.S. women are way better off with respect to rights than any woman in the world,\" delegate Frances Raday from the United Kingdom told Huffington Post. \"They would say, 'Prove it!'\"\n\nOK, let's do that. Here are five areas in which the U.S. is far behind international human rights standards when it comes to women:\n\nGender pay inequality\n\nThe World Economic Forum issued its annual Global Gender Gap report in November, which showed the gender pay gap is growing in the U.S., CNN Money reported.\n\nIn the U.S., the gap stands at 64 percent, meaning women earn about two-thirds of what men make for similar work. That's worse than it was last year, when the gap was 66 percent. The U.S. now ranks 74th in wage equality among 145 countries. Last year, it was 65th.\n\nIn not one country does a woman earn as much as a man for doing the same job, but in some nations, particularly poor countries, women make as much as 88 percent of what men make, CNN Money reported.\n\nThe WEF said the slow pace at which the global gender pay gap is narrowing means women are now earning what men did a decade ago, CNN Money reported. The WEF measures the pay gap by polling CEOs around the world about their employees' salaries.\n\nMaternity leave\n\nThe U.S. and Papua New Guinea are the only two countries in the world that do not ensure any paid time off for new moms, according to a report from the International Labor Organization. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, women working at companies with at least 50 employees must be allowed to take 12 weeks off work following the birth of their child, but that time does not have to be paid.\n\nCurrently, only 12 percent of American companies offer paid maternity or paternity leave, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\n\"After my first child was born, I had six months paid leave at Microsoft UK, and it was full pay,\" Claire Lee, head of startup banking at Silicon Valley Bank, told Business Insider. \"I moved to the U.S., the center of civilization, and when I had my son I was offered four weeks. Maternity policy in the U.S. is awful.\"\n\nAffordable child care\n\nLee told Business Insider greater flexibility and assistance would help more moms return to the workplace. \"I would like to see a pay packet in the U.S. that offers to cover the cost of childcare,\" she said.\n\nNations that offer government-supported child care and generous time off to care for family, such as the Nordic countries of Norway, Finland and Sweden, see less economic damage to women's overall earning power due to having children, USA Today reported.\n\nThe Global Gender Gap report ranks the top five most equal countries for women as Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Ireland. The U.S. ranks 28th.\n\n\"Our survey data shows very clearly that women are much more likely than men to experience major career interruptions related to family caregiving. And working mothers are much more likely than working fathers to say that being a working parent has made it harder for them to get ahead in their job or career,\" Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the non-partisan Pew Research Center in Washington D.C., told USA Today.\n\nWomen's reproductive rights\n\nState lawmakers introduced almost 400 bills to restrict women's access to abortion in 2015, according to Center for Reproductive Rights, an organization that advocates for access to abortion, in its report, \"2015 State of the States: Fighting Back by Pushing Forward.\" Of those bills, 47 became state law, The Independent reported.\n\n\"It seems painfully clear that lawmakers in 2015 still haven't gotten the message from the courts and their constituents: stop playing politics with women's health and focus on priorities that support our families and communities,\" CRR president Nancy Northup said in a press release on the report.\n\nIn most European countries, UN delegate Eleonora Zielinska of Poland told Huffington Post, abortions are performed at general doctors' offices and hospitals that offer all kinds of other health services. That is not the case in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973 in the Roe v. Wade decision. The same year as Roe v. Wade, U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms pushed through the Helms Amendment, which states, \"No foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\"\n\n\"I think a lot of people don't realize the U.S. is the largest donor to global health and one of the largest international family planning donors,\" Chloe Cooney, director of global advocacy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Refinery29, an American fashion and beauty website. \"You can't overstate how important the funding is. It really is the difference between life or death for so many people.\"\n\nBut as many countries have liberalized their abortion laws over the past 20 years, the U.S. still refuses to support any health programs that incorporate abortion care, Refinery29 reported.\n\nViolence against women\n\nA 2014 report from the Center for American Progress indicates women in the U.S. are 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than are women in other high-income countries.\n\nFrom 2001 through 2012, 6,410 women were murdered in the U.S. by an intimate partner using a gun \u2014more than the total number of U.S. troops killed in action during the entirety of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined, according to the report. Of all the women killed by intimate partners during this period, 55 percent were killed with guns.\n\nAnn Purvis scoffed at the UN delegates' findings in an op-ed on the conservative website The Blaze. \"That these are the concerns of the United Nations in a time when women in the Middle East can be stoned to death in honor killings is, frankly, astounding,\" Purvis wrote.\n\n\"This is the important work the gender equality experts at United Nations are doing? Perhaps their time could be better spent working to help women suffering at the hands of Sharia law \u2014 just a thought.\"\n\nNow, it's your turn to weigh in: Are women in other parts of the world treated more fairly than women in the U.S. are?", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "United States, International, abortion-rights, gender-inequality, gender-pay, maternity-leave, womens-rights, news", "title": "Five reasons why gender inequality is worse in U.S. than elsewhere in the world", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Five reasons why gender inequality is worse in U.S. than elsewhere in the world\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/five_reasons_why_gender_inequa.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/nationworld_impact/photo/19416282-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17668039\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-20T13:06:08Z\", \"author\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"abortion-rights\",\"gender-inequality\",\"gender-pay\",\"maternity-leave\",\"womens-rights\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/nationworld_impact/photo/19416282-standard.jpg", "description": "The three UN delegates were appalled by the lack of gender equality in America, but perhaps the biggest surprise of their trip, they said, was learning women in this country don't seem to know what they're missing.", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Five reasons why gender inequality is worse in U.S. than elsewhere in the world"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, December 20, 2015,  8:06 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Five reasons why gender inequality is worse in U.S. than rest ofworld\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/nationworld_impact/photo/obama-signs-equal-pay-orders-pair-of-executive-actions-target-us-contractors-04ae62cbf372d2ce.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rfjablon\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"1771\", \"source_blog_name\": \"National News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The three UN delegates were appalled by the lack of gender equality in America, but perhaps the biggest surprise of their trip, they said, was learning women in this country don't seem to know what they're missing.", "title": "Five reasons why gender inequality is worse in U.S. than elsewhere in the world", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/five_reasons_why_gender_inequa.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/nationworld_impact/photo/19416282-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010038038232"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, December 20, 2015,  8:00 AM", "article_author": "Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com", "Description": "The three UN delegates were appalled by the lack of gender equality in America, but perhaps the biggest surprise of their trip, they said, was learning women in this country don't seem to know what they're missing."}, "article_summary": "Do you believe gender inequality is worse in the U.S. than in other parts of the world?\nThe Global Gender Gap report ranks the top five most equal countries for women as Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Ireland.\nThe WEF measures the pay gap by polling CEOs around the world about their employees' salaries.\nHere are five areas in which the U.S. is far behind international human rights standards when it comes to women:Gender pay inequalityThe World Economic Forum issued its annual Global Gender Gap report in November, which showed the gender pay gap is growing in the U.S., CNN Money reported.\nThe WEF said the slow pace at which the global gender pay gap is narrowing means women are now earning what men did a decade ago, CNN Money reported."}
