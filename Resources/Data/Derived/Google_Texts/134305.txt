CLOVIS, N.M. (AP) - A San Francisco-based airlineâ€™s CEO says it plans to start flights between Clovis and Dallas-Fort Worth beginning in mid-July.

Boutique Air CEO Shawn Simpson says he expects his company will offer 18 round trips a week from Clovis, with more flights on weekdays than on weekends.

According to the Clovis News Journal (http://bit.ly/1l9dzIw ), the U.S. Department of Transportation has established a July 22 deadline for the start of service. The agency will provide Boutique a nearly $3.9 million subsidy over two years.

Simpson said trips from the eastern New Mexico city to Albuquerque also could be scheduled after the Dallas-Fort Worth service is launched.

Clovis has been without air service since January.
