Sioux Falls, SD

Sioux Falls Mayor Mike Huether says Thursday's storm was a monster.

Leaders from several departments addressed the public on Friday after rain flooded neighborhoods throughout Sioux Falls.

Public Works Director Mark Cotter said the city's infrastructure performed well on Thursday against the rain. Sioux Falls Airport saw 2.65 inches, but other parts of Sioux Falls received much more. More than 7 inches fell in the southwest portion of town, while other unconfirmed totals were higher.

Overall, law enforcement received about 1,600 calls on Thursday night. Officials said a typical night has around 600 calls. Sioux Falls Fire Rescue saw three structure fires as the band of thunderstorms rolled through the city. Huether said there were no reported injuries or deaths.

City officials said crews are pumping water out of holding ponds and cleaning debris off of roadways.

Sioux Falls Street Maintenance Manager Galynn Huber said water damaged and washed away road surfaces, along with gutters and shoulders, in several parts of town.

During Thursday's storm, floodwaters were washing barricades away from flooded intersections. Huber thanked a semi-truck driver who blocked the 41st Street and Louise Avenue intersection and prevented motorists from driving into floodwaters.

As the city was inundated with rain, vehicles were pushed by rushing water. A motorist in west Sioux Falls found his car moved more than 20 feet into a culvert Friday morning.

Witnesses said the driver wasn't in the vehicle when it was washed away, and is safe.
