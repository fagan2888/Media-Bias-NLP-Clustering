Pierre, SD

A South Dakota man has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after pleading guilty to a drug charge.



U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson says 49-year-old Rodney Hickey has also been sentenced to one year of supervised release. The Chamberlain man pleaded guilty to a possession of a controlled substance charge on Dec. 16.



Authorities say a South Dakota Highway Patrol trooper searched Hickey's vehicle after a traffic stop in January 2013 and found a pill bottle with 48 pills of various kinds, as well as two bags with a white powder that authorities later determined was methamphetamine.



Prosecutors say firearms, a scale, a glass pipe and several other items were also found in the car.



Hickey is under the custody of the U.S. Marshal's Service.
