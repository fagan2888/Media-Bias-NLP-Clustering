Barack Obama entered the stratosphere with his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, but eventually became just another polarizing politician. And when Scott Brown won the 2010 Massachusetts special election for Senate, he spent a brief moment as a post-partisan dreamboat before eventually turning into just another political hack in a barn jacket.\n\nBut, for Monica Wehby, the Republican candidate for Senate in Oregon, her moment of glory didn\u2019t even last a month. Wehby shot to success with a campaign ad at the end of the primary on May 20 that promoted her background as a career a pediatric neurosurgeon. But, in the run up to the vote, her campaign got into trouble when it was revealed that an ex-boyfriend had filed a police report against her calling Wehby \u201ca stalker.\u201d (Ironically, that ex-boyfriend, Andrew Miller, had also funded a superPAC on Wehby\u2019s behalf which spent six figures attacking one of her GOP primary opponents.\n\nThe news of the police report, which broke four days before primary day, didn\u2019t hurt Wehby in her quest for the GOP nomination \u2014 all votes are cast by mail in Oregon so it\u2019s likely few voters could have been swayed. Instead, it left the candidate scrambling and her campaign flat footed. Instead of taking a victory lap, she was was dodging reporters. But while Wehby has since sunk in the polls and fallen well behind first-term Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley, it doesn\u2019t mean the race is over yet, even in a state as blue as Oregon.\n\nWehby\u2019s race matters because in 2014, the key electoral battle is over control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans are hoping to pick up the six seats necessary to make Mitch McConnell majority leader and exercise veto power over the Obama administration's ability to appoint judges and officials. The goal for Republicans is to expand the battlefield as wide as possible to blue states like Oregon and stretch Democrats thin in the hope of beating enough incumbents to achieve their goal.\n\nFreedom Partners, an Arlington, Va.-based group affiliated with the Koch Brothers, is set to drop $3.6 million dollars in the race on her behalf against Merkley. \u201cOregonians deserve effective leadership and Freedom Partners will continue to hold Sen. Merkley accountable for his bad votes on issues like Obamacare, and his ineffective record,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for the group. But Freedom Partners\u2019 decision to enter the fray is not just about animus towards Merkley, who is simultaneously one of the more liberal and more obscure members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate. Instead, there\u2019s a hope that Wehby might actually win, albeit with difficulty.\n\nOne national GOP strategist described the race as one that has always been viewed \u201cas a bit of an uphill climb\u201d that could break their way with \u201cthe right candidate and the right circumstances.\u201d And part of the right circumstances may be a big investment by an outside group like Freedom Partners. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Daily Beast, \u201cclearly, the only chance Monica Wehby would have of making the race competitive would be if the Kochs were going to dump millions of dollars into the race and they must be trying it out to see if they can do that.\u201d\n\nMoney alone can\u2019t help a Republican win a race in a deep blue state, however, as failed GOP candidates like Linda McMahon and Carly Fiorina can attest. Instead, Republicans like Art Robinson, the chair of the Oregon Republican Party, say that Wehby\u2019s biography will help carry the day. Robinson says that if Wehby runs a strong campaign, she has \u201can excellent chance\u201d of winning. Her biography as someone \u201cwho succeeded in life at something difficult\u201d should sell well with voters, he added.\n\nNor are campaigns just about biography. There are issues and positions taken, too. While Robinson says Wehby isn\u2019t \u201csuper conservative\u201d and describes her \u201cas moderate enough to please the liberal wing\u201d of the Oregon GOP. National Republicans see her in the mold of moderates like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, but Democrats disagree. They harp on her opposition to equal pay legislation and support for conservative legislation that would slash the budget like Tea Party-backed \u201ccut, cap and balance\u201d bill. This bill, which passed the House but failed in the Senate, would have cut federal spending, capped future spending at a percentage of GDP and encouraged a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "GOP, u.s. poli, Oregon,United States, United States Senate", "publicationDate": 201408251700, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "GOP, US Politics, Oregon United States, United States Senate", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Koch Brothers Bail Out GOP Senate Hopeful in Oregon", "tags": "gop,topic:politics,entity:provinceorstate/oregon_united_states,entity:organization/united_states_senate", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The \u201cuphill battle\u201d facing Monica Wehby in the Oregon Senate race is seen by the national GOP as a testing ground for Koch money and a chance to take control of the upper chamber.", "title": "Koch Brothers Bail Out GOP Senate Hopeful in Oregon", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1408986605487.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The \u201cuphill battle\u201d facing Monica Wehby in the Oregon Senate race is seen by the national GOP as a testing ground for Koch money and a chance to take control of the upper chamber.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-08-25T17:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Koch Brothers Bail Out GOP Senate Hopeful in Oregon\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46966220.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/24/national-gop-bets-koch-cash-on-wehby-in-oregon-senate-race\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-25T17:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[\"gop\",\"politics\",\"oregon_united_states\",\"united_states_senate\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd782\"", "article_summary": "Uphill BattleThe \u201cuphill battle\u201d facing Monica Wehby in the Oregon Senate race is seen by the national GOP as a testing ground for Koch money and a chance to take control of the upper chamber.\nWhile Robinson says Wehby isn\u2019t \u201csuper conservative\u201d and describes her \u201cas moderate enough to please the liberal wing\u201d of the Oregon GOP.\nNational Republicans see her in the mold of moderates like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, but Democrats disagree.\nBut, for Monica Wehby, the Republican candidate for Senate in Oregon, her moment of glory didn\u2019t even last a month.\nInstead, Republicans like Art Robinson, the chair of the Oregon Republican Party, say that Wehby\u2019s biography will help carry the day."}
