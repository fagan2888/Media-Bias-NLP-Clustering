After all, here you are four years later in your graduation togs with your parents looking on, waiting to celebrate. The question is: Celebrate what exactly?\n\nIn possibly the last graduation speech of 2015, I know I should begin by praising your grit, your essential character, your determination to get this far. But today, it\u2019s money, not character, that\u2019s on my mind. For so many of you, I suspect, your education has been a classic scam and you\u2019re not even attending a \u201cfor profit\u201d college \u2014 an institution of higher learning, that is, officially set up to take you for a ride.\n\nMaybe this is the moment, then, to begin your actual education by looking back and asking yourself what you should really have learned on this campus and what you should expect in the scams \u2014 I mean, years \u2014 to come. Many of you \u2014 those whose parents didn\u2019t have money \u2014 undoubtedly entered these stately grounds four years ago in relatively straitened circumstances. In an America in which corporate profits have risen impressively, it\u2019s been springtime for billionaires, but when it comes to ordinary Americans, wages have been relatively stagnant, jobs (the good ones, anyway) generally in flight, and times not exactly of the best. Here was a figure that recently caught my eye, speaking of the world you\u2019re about to step into: in 2014, the average CEO received 373 times the compensation of the average worker. Three and a half decades ago, that number was a significant but not awe-inspiring 42 times.\n\nStill, you probably arrived here eager and not yet in debt. Today, we know that the class that preceded you was the most indebted in the history of higher education, and you\u2019ll surely break that \u201crecord.\u201d And no wonder, with college tuitions still rising wildly (up 1,120% since 1978). Judging by last year\u2019s numbers, about 70% of you had to take out loans simply to make it through here, to educate yourself. That figure was a more modest 45% two decades ago. On average, you will have rung up least $33,000 in debt and for some of you the numbers will be much higher. That, by the way, is more than double what it was those same two decades ago.\n\nWe have some sense of how this kind of debt plays out in the years to come and the news isn\u2019t good. Those of you with major school debts will be weighed down in all sorts of ways. You\u2019ll find yourselves using your credit cards more than graduates without such debt. You\u2019ll be less likely to buy a home in the future. A few decades from now, you\u2019ll have accumulated significantly less wealth than your unindebted peers. In other words, a striking percentage of you will leave this campus in the kind of financial hole that \u2014 given the job market of 2015 \u2014 you may have a problem making your way out of.\n\nFor those who took a foreign language in your college years, in translation you\u2019ve paid stunning sums you didn\u2019t have to leave yourself, like any foreclosed property, underwater. Worse yet, for those of you who dream of being future doctors, lawyers, financial wizards, architects, or English professors (if there are any of those anymore), that\u2019s only the beginning. You\u2019ll still have to pay exorbitantly for years of graduate school or professional training, which means ever more debt to come.\n\nDoes this really sound like an education to you or does it sound more like a Ponzi scheme, like you\u2019ve been scammed?\n\nDo I understand how all this works? No. I\u2019m no expert on the subject. What anyone should be able to see, however, is that the promise of higher education has, in this century, sunk low indeed and that what your generation has been learning how to endure while still in school is a form of peonage. I\u2019d binge drink, too, under the circumstances!\n\nNobody feels good when they\u2019ve been scammed, but at least you\u2019re not alone on this great campus in needing to reassess what higher education means. Many of your teachers turned out to be untenured part-timers, getting pitiful salaries. They, too, were being scammed. And even some of their esteemed tenured colleagues (as I know from friends of mine) are remarkably deep in the Ponzi pits. It turns out that, as government money flowing onto campus has dried up, the pressure on some of those eminent professors, particularly in graduate programs, to essentially raise their own salaries has only been rising \u2014 a very highbrow version of peonage. They increasingly need patrons, which generally means \u201cfriendly\u201d corporations. Talk about a scam!\n\nDemobilizing You\n\nMany of you undoubtedly think that your education is now over and it\u2019s time to enter the \u201creal world.\u201d I have news for you: you\u2019ve been in that world for the last four years, hence the debt you\u2019re dragging around behind you. So, on a day when the sun\u2019s in your eyes and it couldn\u2019t be more apparent that the world\u2019s not what you\u2019ve been told it was, maybe you should apply the principles of the scam artist to the world you\u2019re about to enter. Unless you do so, you\u2019ll simply be scammed again in the next phase of your life.\n\nLike the rest of us, presidents and politicians of every stripe have regularly told you that you belong to the one \u201cindispensible\u201d nation on the planet, a country \u201cexceptional\u201d in every way. As a college-educated American, you\u2019ve similarly been assured of how important you\u2019ll be to that exceptional land.\n\nGet over it. You\u2019re going to find yourself living in an ever greyer, grimmer country \u2014 if you don\u2019t believe me, check out the government\u2019s unwillingness to fund essential infrastructuremaintenance \u2014 to which you will be remarkably irrelevant. And if the political elite, the plutocratic class, and the national security state have anything to do with it, in the future you\u2019ll become ever more so. In other words, you are to be relegated to the sidelines of what now passes for American life.\n\nBehind this reality, there\u2019s a history. Since the Vietnam era, the urge to demobilize Americans, to put them out to pasture, to stop them from interfering in the running of \u201ctheir\u201d country has only grown stronger. When it comes to the military, for instance, the draft was sent to the trash bin of history in 1973 and most Americans were long ago demobilized by the arrival of an \u201call volunteer\u201d force. So, today, you have no obligation whatsoever to be part of that military, to serve in what is no longer, in the traditional sense, a citizen\u2019s army.\n\nIf that military isn\u2019t really yours, the wars it\u2019s been fighting since the dawn of the twenty-first century haven\u2019t been your wars either, nor \u2014 despite the responsibility the Constitution reserves to Congress for declaring war \u2014 have they been that body\u2019s. Congress still has to pony up sums so extravagant for what\u2019s charmingly called \u201cdefense\u201d that the military budgets of the next seven countries combined don\u2019t equal them. It has, however, little genuine say about what wars are fought. Even when, as with the Islamic State, it is offered the modest opportunity to pass a new authorization for a war already long underway, its representatives, like most Americans, now prefer to remain on the sidelines. In the meantime, the White House runs its own drone assassination campaigns via the CIA without anyone else\u2019s say-so, while secretive paramilitaries and a secret military \u2014 the Special Operations forces \u2014 cocooned inside the larger military and growing like mad have changed the face of American war and it\u2019s none of your business.\n\nYour role in all this is modest indeed: to pay as little attention as you want, endlessly thankthe troops for their \u201cservice\u201d when you run across them at airports or elsewhere, and leave it at that. Of course, given the sums, verging on a trillion dollars a year, that \u201cwe\u201d now put into the U.S. military and related national security outfits, and given our endless wars, conflicts, raids, and secret operations, that military does at least provide some job opportunities, though it has its own version of job flight \u2014 to so-called private contractors (once known as \u201cmercenaries\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you're graduating from a liberal arts college, you've been taken for a ride.
