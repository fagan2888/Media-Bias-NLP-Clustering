(Charlie Leight/Getty Images)\n\nA forum featuring two of the most liberal candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination was disrupted and taken over Saturday by liberal activists seeking to showcase their concerns for the plight of African Americans.\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made back-to-back appearances in a presidential town hall that was part of the four-day Netroots Nation conference here, an annual gathering of 3,000 progressive activists that Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton elected to skip.\n\n[In Iowa, the first face-off between Clinton, Sanders and other rivals]\n\nShortly into O\u2019Malley\u2019s allotted time, his discussion with a moderator was disrupted by more than 100 protesters that included members of Black Lives Matter, a group formed after teenager Trayvon Martin\u2019s shooting in Florida, and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration.\n\nAs chanting protesters streamed to the front of the room, O\u2019Malley looked stunned at first and then started clapping along.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is a Democratic contender for the White House in 2016. Here's his take on gay marriage, income inequality and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nClose to 10 minutes later, leaders of the protest were handed microphones and rattled off a number of their concerns, including deaths of African Americans in police custody, and demanded specific solutions from O\u2019Malley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we like shutting s--- down, but we have to,\u201d Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matters, told the crowd, saying the group\u2019s issues were an emergency.\n\nThe protest, however, did not appear aimed at O\u2019Malley. The protesters remained as Sanders appeared on stage, and he took a less patient approach.\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, let me talk about what I came to talk about for a minute,\u201d the senator said before launching into a riff on income inequality and steps to address it.\n\nThe Vermont senator faced chants and heckling as well, but Sanders continued talking. Asked what he had done in the Senate to benefit black Americans, he started to talk about the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford that!\u201d heckled Elle Hearns, a 28-year-old Ohio-based coordinator for the LGBT rights group GetEqual.\n\nO\u2019Malley made several starts at addressing the issues raised but was interrupted.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley speaks to guests at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Hall of Fame Dinner on Friday.\n\n\u201cI think that all of us as Americans have a responsibility to recognize the pain and grief throughout our country from all of the lives that have been lost to violence, whether that\u2019s violence at the hands of police, whether that\u2019s violence at the hands of civilians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cStop trying to generalize this s---!\u201d yelled Ashley Yates, a 30-year-old activist from Oakland, Calif.\n\nLater, O\u2019Malley drew boos as he said: \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d\n\nAfter his appearance, O\u2019Malley addressed those comments on a radio show being recorded at the convention hall.\n\n\u201cWhen I said those other two phrases, I meant no disrespect,\u201d O\u2019Malley told the online radio show \u201cThis Week in Blackness.\u201d \u201cI did not mean to be insensitive in any way.\u201d\n\nAs Baltimore\u2019s mayor, O\u2019Malley faced criticism of the city\u2019s aggressive policing policies, a topic that moderator Jose Antonio Vargas questioned him about at the outset of the forum. (Vargas, a journalist, filmmaker and activist who is an immigrant in the country illegally, previously worked as a reporter for The Washington Post.)\n\nSanders made several comments addressing the protesters\u2019 concerns, including: \u201cIn my view, maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s time to invest in jobs and education, not in jails and in incarceration.\u201d\n\nThat generated applause from a crowd where hundreds carried Sanders\u2019s campaign signs.\n\nVargas decided to cut the forum about 15 minutes short of its allotted time.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have to wrap it up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Sanders replied, before rising to exit.\n\nFollowing the event, Mary Rickles, a spokeswoman for Netroots Nation, said: \u201cWe wish the candidates had more time to respond to the issues. What happened today is reflective of an urgent moment that America is facing today.\u201d\n\nThe crowd was largely sympathetic to the protesters, but many said afterward that they wish they could have heard more from the candidates.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t disagree with the message,\u201d said Elizabeth Arledge, 50, of Alexandria, Va., an activist who focuses on civil justice. \u201cI was very supportive of it, and I also wanted the program to go on.\u201d\n\nLucas Hernon, 30, of Las Cruces, N.M., an undecided voter, said he thought O\u2019Malley handled the situation well except for when he said white lives also matter. \u201cAs a white person, we don\u2019t need to be reminded of that,\u201d Hernon said.\n\nSome in the audience suggested there could be fallout from the event for Sanders, whose challenges include expanding his appeal beyond liberal white voters.\n\nBethany Winkels, a 30-year-old activist from Minneapolis, said it was hypocritical for Sanders to call for more grass-roots organizing in one breath and then sound dismissive of the protesters in the next.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, and he needs to do better,\u201d Winkels said.\n\nJames Hohmann contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "martin o'malley, bernie sanders, netroots nation, 2016 democratic primaries", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Activists with \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 movement rattle Sanders, O\u2019Malley at Netroots Nation town hall.", "title": "O\u2019Malley booed as he points out: \u2018White lives matter.
