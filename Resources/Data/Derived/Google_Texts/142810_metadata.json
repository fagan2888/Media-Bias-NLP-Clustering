In an exclusive interview with WSJ Frontiers, Adesina said his top priorities would be energy (\u201cmy number one priority will be to power Africa, and to light up Africa\u201d), inequality (\u201cwe have to achieve shared prosperity\u201d) agriculture (\u201cwe could unlock new income for literally hundreds of millions of people\u201d), youth unemployment (\u201cAfrica\u2019s heartland is bleeding\u201d) and developing the continent\u2019s financial infrastructure (\u201cit\u2019s not just about making a few more loans.\u201d)\n\nAkinwumi Adesina. European Pressphoto Agency\n\nAdesina also promised to use the bank\u2019s balance sheet to create \u201crisk guarantees that will enable the private sector to deploy capital,\u201d and to help African countries cope with the impact of the China\u2019s slowing growth and the decline in global commodities prices.\n\nZambia is one of those countries. Its copper miners are struggling against a range of headwinds that have conspired to create the most difficult operating environment for a decade, writes the Journal\u2019s Nicholas Bariyo. Some complain that policy missteps from Zambia\u2019s government have dramatically increased the industry\u2019s vulnerability to the commodities rout and slowing Chinese demand. Whatever the reason, the impact is onerous: Up to 60% of the country\u2019s nearly 30,000 contract miners have been put on notice for possible layoffs, according to James Chansa, president of the National Union of Miners and Allied Workers.\n\nArgentina\u2018s fortunes appear to be changing. The WSJ\u2019s Taos Turner writes that its economy is improving and is less likely to slip into recession within the next six months, according to a new study by Torcuato Di Tella University. The study keeps track of 10 indicators, including industrial production and monthly economic output. Seven of the indicators rose in July.\n\nThe country also enjoyed a breakthrough in its dispute with creditors owed billions. A U.S. court ruled this week that creditors can\u2019t seize the assets of its central bank, Julie Wernau writes. The decision marks a key reversal of a district-court ruling that would have opened the sovereign nation\u2019s reserves to hedge funds who sought to declare Banco Central de la Republica Argentina (BCRA) an \u201calter ego\u201d of the South American nation.\n\nAs Myanmar\u2019s parliament goes on recess ahead of the upcoming general elections, crucial laws related to the economy are still stuck in limbo, writes Shibani Mahtani.\n\nYangon harbor, Myanmar iStock\n\nThere is now very little chance that key new laws that Myanmar investors and financial institutions have been waiting for\u2014including a new investment law, companies act and the banks and financial institutions law\u2014will be passed before a new government is formed early next year. One analyst summed up the problem: \u201cWhat is missing in the current government\u2019s approach to economic reform is commitment and follow through.\u201d\n\nIran is about to prove whether it can follow through on recent efforts to rejoin the global economy as the country\u2019s parliament decides whether to accept the landmark nuclear agreement forged with world powers in July, Jay Solomon writes. President Hassan Rouhani and his negotiators\u2014relative moderates within the ruling establishment\u2014have publicly fought against allowing the Iranian parliament, or Majlis, to hold a vote on the deal because of concerns that lawmakers could impose legal barriers to its implementation. But top leaders made clear the Majlis would play a central role.\n\nWhile the political maneuvering continues, businesses in the Gulf region are positioning themselves to capitalize on the anticipated lifting of sanctions on Iran, Rory Jones and Nicolas Parasie report. Such developments could begin to shift the region\u2019s center of economic gravity from Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, to Iran, home to an educated and burgeoning middle class, they note.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman was in Washington this week to emphasize the importance of the kingdom\u2019s ties to the U.S. At a forum timed to coincide with the visit, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Investment Authority, Abdullatif Al-Othman, announced a package of measures aimed at increasing his country\u2019s attractiveness as an investment destination.\n\nThe measures include simplifying investment applications, improving access to talent and streamlining visa processing for entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\nMorgan Stanley says lower oil prices and a failure to adjust their currencies rapidly enough have taken a toll on growth in Kazakhstan and Nigeria, the Journal\u2019s Chiara Albanese writes. The IMF, in a report after a visit to the country by its Middle East and Central Asia director, identified a few more problems that the country is facing, including the slowdown in Russia and China, its excessive reliance on oil and the spillover effects of global volatility.\n\nThe result? \u201cEconomic growth has decelerated sharply and financial conditions have tightened,\u201d the report says. Not entirely surprisingly, Kazakhstan\u2019s \u201cgrowth outlook has weakened.\u201d The IMF\u2019s prescription for returning the economy to health includes \u201cdecisive implementation of bold structural reforms\u201d in key areas such as the rule of law and financial intermediation, as well as improvements to the business climate and diversification of the economy.\n\nThe past year has been tough for frontier-market investors but Gustavo Galindo, senior portfolio manager of the Russell Frontier Markets Equity Fund, says promising investment opportunities are appearing. \u201cSome managers are now finding fresh opportunities in these riskier markets,\u201d Galindo says. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t yet translated into significant capital flows, but we think that long-term investors in this space have good chances to benefit over time.\u201d\n\nRussell also this week published a handy guide for investors considering putting money to work in frontier markets.\n\nKey Stories from
