The more customers who use the platform, the more information is added to the voter file, and the more useful the file becomes. So far, though, the platform remains in testing, and it is unclear how many state parties will agree to use it.\n\nOrganizing such data from many sources and sorting it into quickly accessible information \u201cis a pretty elite skill,\u201d Mr. Barkett said. In fact, he rejects 80 percent of employee prospects for lack of skill, not for insufficient ideological match. He finds prospects via friends, business networks, online job postings, professional recruiters \u2014 and talent scouts like Mr. Ginn.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need thousands of people; we need dozens,\u201d Mr. Barkett said. \u201cWe could do a lot of damage with 30 people. A lot. But they\u2019ve got to be real engineers.\u201d Of Mr. Ginn, he said: \u201cAaron gets that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Barkett added: \u201cWe get 20 or 30 of those people and, watch out. The Democrats will have a hard time keeping up with that.\u201d\n\nBut attracting even that many has proved elusive, even as Democratic groups have developed a deep talent bench. Catalist, a liberal data and analytics cooperative founded in 2006 \u2014 and the acknowledged model for Data Trust \u2014 has a thousand clients and a core staff of about 50. The Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties already have a standardized system for sharing voter information, while a generation of liberal and Democratic activists has come up through the ranks using a single data platform.\n\nThe Republican National Committee effort is also playing catch-up among allies on the right. The political and philanthropic network overseen by David and Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialists, has financed a separate voter data initiative, known as Themis, which has been up and running for more than four years, and, with its sister company i360, employs about 50 people.\n\nYet the biggest gap may be cultural. Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns were known in the tech world for giving data and analytics staff a prominent place in the campaign hierarchy. It didn\u2019t hurt that he enjoyed the personal support of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most admired executives: No less a tech luminary than Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, helped Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign recruit technical talent.\n\nMr. Barkett must draw talent to work on behalf of the party broadly, rather than for a single candidate. And the best engineers, he said, don\u2019t see the Republican Party as the most modern place to work. \u201cThe G.O.P. has no culture of technical skill or excellence,\u201d he said. But, he pitches recruits this way: \u201cWho has a more interesting and meaningful big data problem right now? You can change the culture. You can change who the president is.\u201d Mr. Barkett himself gave up stock options worth several million dollars at Facebook to join the Republican National Committee effort because he saw an opportunity to effect change.\n\nFinding talent has been harder than finding money. The party has provided about $17 million, a substantial amount, to spend from October 2013 through November 2014, and Data Trust, which is privately held, has a comparable budget. (Themis had about $10 million in revenue in 2012, according to its tax returns; Catalist takes in subscriber fees of $5 million to $9 million a year, it says, and devotes more than $6 million to new research and development.) But Mr. Barkett says he has hired only about 14 people for the Republican National Committee and 12 at Data Trust, half the number he hopes to have by spring.\n\nUnderscoring the urgency of the party\u2019s task, the Republican National Committee last week unveiled an initiative, Para Bellum Labs, intended to supercharge recruitment and innovation efforts. Para Bellum \u2014 Latin for \u201cprepare for war\u201d \u2014 is modeled on in-house incubators set up by some tech companies, including Facebook, to preserve a startup-style culture as they grow larger and less nimble. At the committee\u2019s headquarters, the effort puts the party\u2019s entire Beltway-based technology staff, from voter file programmers to digital-advertising specialists, under one roof. Mr. Barkett will report to Para Bellum.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking people who have worked in politics and trying to turn them into data analysts,\u201d said Chuck DeFeo, the Republican committee\u2019s deputy chief of staff and chief digital officer. \u201cWe are taking people with very specific skills sets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the recruits to Data Trust are Jason Chew, a software engineer who was Mr. Bartlett\u2019s roommate at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a colleague at Facebook, and Newton Der, 34, who until July worked at a mobile game company and heard about Mr. Barkett\u2019s efforts through the Corporate Asian American Employee Network. Mr. Der says that he\u2019s \u201cnot really into politics,\u201d but that he believes strongly in gun-owner rights.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Barkett says he isn\u2019t looking to hire ideologues. He describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social moderate \u2014 for instance, he says he doesn\u2019t oppose same-sex marriage. He figures that there are plenty like him. In fact, when he announced that he was leaving Facebook for the Republican National Committee, he learned to his surprise that he had been working with some Republicans all along.\n\n\u201cThey outed themselves to me,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to tell who is gay at Facebook than who is Republican.\u201d\n\nHacking for Republicans\n\nMr. Ginn grew up in Arlington, Tex., the son of a first-generation Chinese immigrant father and a mother from Arizona. His political awakening came in the 10th grade. \u201cI read two books that changed my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Bible, and \u2018The Terrible Truth About Liberals,\u2019 but the Bible much more, obviously.\u201d\n\nHe became a Southern Baptist, and he says the religion guides his beliefs, like his opposition to same-sex marriage \u2014 though he says he favors granting rights to gay domestic partners. But since moving to San Francisco in late 2011, he avoids talking about social issues to prospects because he doesn\u2019t want to be off-putting.\n\nAmong his fans, and someone sympathetic to his tactics, is Harmeet K. Dhillon, chairwoman of the Republican Party in San Francisco and vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party. When she ran for the State Assembly in 2008, she said, she didn\u2019t even put \u201cRepublican\u201d on her billboards or signs. \u201cIn the Bay Area,\u201d she said, \u201copening a conversation with \u2018I\u2019m a conservative\u2019 is an automatic loser.\u201d\n\nMr. Ginn learned that the hard way when anti-conservative sensibilities nearly scuttled Lincoln Labs\u2019 first event.\n\nLast June, Mr. Ginn organized a hackathon to be held at the offices of StumbleUpon, the media company where he works in downtown San Francisco. A few days before the event, several employees alerted StumbleUpon\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bartels, that the Charles Koch Institute had paid for the event. The employees wanted to know if StumbleUpon endorsed the Kochs\u2019 views.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bartels said the hackathon threatened to become a \u201cdistraction\u201d and asked Mr. Ginn to move it to another site. Mr. Ginn said Lincoln Labs now relies for a significant portion of its funding on a group called Generation Opportunity, which its website describes as a \u201cfreethinking, liberty-loving, national organization of young people.\u201d Generation Opportunity, in turn, receives most of its funding from Freedom Partners, a business league of conservative-leaning donors overseen by aides to the Kochs and former Koch employees.\n\nThe Charles Koch Institute is a major force in free-market philanthropy, but the Kochs \u2014 who also help finance an array of more overtly political conservative organizations and invested heavily in trying to defeat President Obama in 2012 \u2014 are controversial in many quarters. Mr. Ginn said Lincoln Labs did not accept Charles Koch Institute money for the Microsoft event, but added that the groups have a continuing relationship, and that such an alliance is natural, \u201cbecause they\u2019re so involved in libertarian issues; it\u2019s very difficult to not run across them.\u201d\n\nPolitics and Mexican Food\n\nThe Microsoft meeting was kicked off by Garrett Johnson, one of Mr. Ginn\u2019s two partners at Lincoln Labs. (The other is Chris Abrams, 26, who also works at StumbleUpon.) Mr. Johnson, a Rhodes scholar, is gregarious and has a commanding physical presence; he was an N.C.A.A. shot-put champion when he was at Florida State University. In his nonpartisan introduction, he told the 40 or so engineers about the goals of the contest and introduced Lincoln Labs as a group \u201cadvancing liberty with the use of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hacking teams broke up. They ate Mexican food. Mr. Ginn made his rounds, speaking to Mr. Vyas and then approaching another table where a team was working on a project aimed at helping readers of news articles quickly identify financial contributions to politicians.\n\nMr. Ginn suspected that the engineer who proposed the project was a Democrat, but wanted to find out. To test the proposition, he mentioned terms like \u201cBlackwater,\u201d which Mr. Ginn later described as liberal fodder.\n\nThe programmer, Ian Webster, 23, didn\u2019t seem much interested. So Mr. Ginn upped the ante by mentioning that he was involved in politics and had recently been elected in California to \u201cthe state party leadership.\u201d He didn\u2019t say which party.\n\nCool, Mr. Webster said. But the conversation stalled again, even after Mr. Ginn probed further by bringing up his opposition to N.S.A. surveillance.\n\nThen Mr. Ginn got an unexpected bite. Sitting at the same table, working on the same project, was Ronald Ning, 30, a computer scientist. He overheard the conversation and expressed sharp opposition to certain aspects of the N.S.A. surveillance effort. The two hit it off, and by the end of the conference, Mr. Ginn had Mr. Ning\u2019s contact information. Mr. Ginn said he saw Mr. Ning as someone who might not necessarily help a Republican candidate \u2014 Mr. Ning voted for President George W. Bush, but then twice for President Obama \u2014 but perhaps as someone who could work for conservative causes.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Ning said he liked Mr. Ginn\u2019s approach. \u201cI think he was actually nonpartisan,\u201d Mr. Ning said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem motivated much by politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Elections, House of Representatives,Elections, Senate", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20140208110848, "twitter": {"description": "In 2012, Democrats took a commanding lead in technological outreach to voters.
