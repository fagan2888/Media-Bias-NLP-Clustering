The reality of being a physician actually becomes apparent once interns enter their residency program – and it’s not always pretty.

The Gomer Blog, “Earth’s Finest Medical Satire News Site,” took the opportunity to poke fun of the potentially unrealistic expectations interns might have, especially after watching shows like “Scrubs” and “House M.D.” They provide insights from one (fictional) recent medical school graduate, Anita Campbell. Campbell was in for a rude awakening.

“None of these residency programs are anything like what I’ve seen on TV,” complains an exasperated Dr. Campbell. “We work all day, from dawn until dusk – rounding, writing notes, placing orders. It’s exhausting. Then I have to go home and read just to stay afloat. I barely have time to shower on a daily basis, so forget putting on makeup in the morning or dry-cleaning a cocktail dress to go out on the town with my fellow residents.”

Not only is residency not the most glamorous experience, many new doctors might be disappointed to find out that they don’t actually do any of major work, like brain surgery.

“This is the real kicker, right here. My patient develops a subdural, so, of course, I read an UpToDate article and discover he might need surgery. I’ve been caring for this guy for a week on the floors, so I’m ready. I ask my senior to cover my patients while I go perform the surgery, and she looks at me like I’m an idiot. It turns out, we don’t do brain-surgery in this medicine residency. The neurosurgeons do. This program sucks! I wanted to be like the docs on ‘House’, those guys do everything.”

Physicians can surely have a laugh about how “Anita” is reacting to her new position after spending so much time working through school. Good thing most doctors push through this process, otherwise we’d all be in trouble.
