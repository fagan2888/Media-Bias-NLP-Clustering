Marino, Horizon\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nNewark-based Horizon has 3.8 million members. It started its program \u2013 known as a patient-centered medical home \u2013 in 2011. And the program has grown to include about 750,000 of its members.\n\nThe shift comes as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has put pressure on the health care industry to improve the quality of care and lower the cost.\n\nBuy Photo The Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey blimp.

Ultimately, those patients will avoid illnesses down the road that can be expensive to treat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d said Erin Zielinski, practice manager for Dr. Marc Feingold, a primary care doctor in Manalapan. \u201cWe\u2019re tracking our patients a lot better with the program. We\u2019re able to make sure they\u2019re getting the screenings they need. As far as catching illness earlier, we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nAbout 70 percent of Feingold\u2019s patients participate in a patient-centered medical home program \u2013 either through private insurers or Medicare, Zielinski said.\n\nHorizon reviewed claims from 2014 and found members visiting doctors in its in its patient-centered medical home had a better outcome than traditional practice.\n\nIt included a:\n\n\u20229 percent lower cost of care.\n\n\u20228 percent lower rate in hospital admissions.\n\n\u20225 percent lower rate in emergency room visits.\n\n\u20226 percent higher rate of improved diabetes control.\n\n\u20227 percent higher rate in cholesterol management for diabetic patients.\n\nMichael L.
