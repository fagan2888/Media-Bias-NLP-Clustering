A new study out of Clemson University finds that people who aren\u2019t getting enough sleep have a higher risk of being impulsive and distracted, as well as making poor decisions.\n\n\u201cSelf-control is part of daily decision-making,\u201d June Pilcher, Clemson Alumni Distinguished Professor of psychology, said in the press release. \u201cOur study explored how sleep habits and self-control are interwoven and how sleep habits and self-control may work together to affect a person\u2019s daily functioning.\u201d\n\nWhen you go days of getting only four to five hours of sleep a night, you begin to feel and look like a zombie: Bags seem to appear under your eyes overnight, aging you several years. Your hair is somehow more disheveled than normal. Walking up the stairs is so much more exhausting than usual and your productivity at work or school plummets. You likely make up for the lost energy with extra calories, particularly carbs and sugar, which will only make you crash and feel worse later \u2014 or gain weight over time.\n\nSleep deprivation sounds a lot like being drunk and hungover \u2014 and that\u2019s because it is. Past research found that sleep-deprived people performed similarly on tests as individuals who had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level of 0.1 percent (which is equivalent to having several drinks). Consistent sleep deprivation impairs your cognitive ability and lowers your inhibitions, so you\u2019re essentially being a slightly drunk person when you don\u2019t get the right amount of rest.\n\nThe new study argues that sleep loss could have a wider impact than just your physical or mental health \u2014 it could negatively affect your work life and personal relationships, especially if it\u2019s impairing your self-control. \u201cExercising self-control allows one to make better choices when presented with conflicting desires and opportunities,\u201d Pilcher said in the press release. \u201cThat has far-reaching implications to a person\u2019s career and personal life.\u201d\n\nAside from maintaining sleep hygiene, or a consistent sleep schedule in which you go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time (averaging about seven to eight hours a night), a good way to reverse the negative effects of sleep deprivation is to take naps. A recent study found that taking naps could reduce impulsivity and frustration.\n\n\"Many aspects of our daily lives can be affected by better-managed sleep and self-control capacity,\" Pilcher said. \"Improved health and worker performance are two potential benefits, but societal issues such as addictions, excessive gambling, and overspending could also be more controllable when sleep deficiencies aren't interfering with one's decision making.\"\n\nSource: Pilcher J, Morris D, Donnelly J, Feigl H.
