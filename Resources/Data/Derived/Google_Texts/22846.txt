Sen. Chuck Grassley’s slipping ratings were dismissed this week by a spokesperson from his office, Beth Levine, who said the numbers were “[s]elective leaks from a partisan group with a partisan agenda… The White House and its paid political activists are trying to manufacture interest where it’s clearly not a defining issue.”

The poll was commissioned by the Constitutional Responsibility Project (CRP) and the League of Conservation Voters. CRP is a non-profit created this year by several high-level former aides to President Obama in order to lead a campaign pressuring Republicans for a nomination hearing.

CRP spokesperson Amy Brundage said her group “will continue to focus on exposing his [Grassley’s] failure to fulfill his constitutional responsibility until he gives Chief Judge Garland a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote.”

Levine added in her response: “[I]f polling actually made a difference to this White House, then Obamacare would be repealed by now.”
