Palmer/Hillary John\n\n202-434-2560 | @AARPMedia | media@aarp.org\n\n\n\nExperience Tech with a Personal Touch at AARP\u2019s Life @ 50+ National Event & Expo in Atlanta, October 3-5\n\nAARP TEK workshops will provide free technology and social media training for older community residents\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 September 17, 2013 \u2013 Everyone from technology novices to experts will gain technology education and knowledge at the AARP TEK Pavilion during the Life@50+ National Event & Expo held October 3-5, 2013 at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. AARP will introduce AARP TEK workshops, which stand for \u201cTechnology Education and Knowledge.\u201d\n\nAARP TEK offers a high-touch approach to high-tech including small group training with individual interaction with attendees. Free workshops offered at the AARP TEK Pavilion during Exhibit Hall hours will help attendees learn the basics or become more comfortable with mobile tablets and apps, connecting with family and friends online and using technology while on the go to access news, books and music. AARP TEK workshops will be offered also at the Word of Faith Family Worship Cathedral in Austell, Ga.\n\n\u201cTechnology can play a vital role in helping people live a better life. We believe there is a real hunger among people 50+ for understandable training on how to use personal technology, both at home and in the workplace,\u201d said Terry Bradwell, Chief Information Officer for AARP. \u201cOur members say they have trouble finding such services and we are exploring AARP\u2019s capability to fill that void. AARP TEK workshops and online content are two approaches being explored. We\u2019re particularly excited that young people will serve as volunteer tech advisors.\u201d\n\nAARP TEK\u2019s activities in Atlanta also will include youth volunteers known as \u201cTech Wizards\u201d from 4-H Clubs of America and local colleges and universities, who will help boomers and seniors learn technology basics and how it can enhance their lives day-to-day. AARP Foundation is supporting AARP TEK through its new effort, Mentor Up, which seeks to inspire and engage young people to give back to the older adults in their lives and communities through service and volunteerism. Throughout the course of the event, young \u201cTech Wizards\u201d will work with AARP TEK Advisors to provide a high-touch experience for members visiting the AARP TEK Pavilion.\n\nDuring the Life@50+ event, daily presentations by tech experts and speakers will take place in the AARP TEK Advisors Place.\n\nAnother part of the AARP TEK Pavilion will feature entrepreneurs showcasing health-related products and services they have developed for people 50+. It\u2019s part of the AARP Innovation@50+TM initiative, which aims to spark entrepreneurial activity across public and private sectors as part of AARP\u2019s mission to enhance the quality of life for all as we age.\n\nFor more information about AARP TEK, please visit www.aarp.org/aarptek.\n\nRegistration\n\nAdmission to Life@50+ for AARP members is $25, $35 for non-members.
