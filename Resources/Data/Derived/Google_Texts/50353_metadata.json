He wasted no time having an enormous impact on the Thunder\u2019s future. His big week for the evaluation period of Dec. 6-12 makes him The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, the UCLA product averaged 27.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 1.5 steals. He shot 52.6 percent from the field, and had a plus-9.0 rating. Led by Westbrook \u2014 and Kevin Durant \u2014 the Thunder won all four games.\n\nBackground: Staying on the court this season had been a struggle for Westbrook, who started the season having overcome a knee injury but then suffered a broken hand just minutes into the second game. A month later, he returned. Now he looks as strong, quick and explosive as the NBA has known him to be.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: One of the funnier moments of Oklahoma City\u2019s season occurred Thursday, before a game against Minnesota, when Thunder coach Scott Brooks was briefed on the comparisons of Westbrook and Timberwolves rookie Zach Lavine. \u201cI used to have to defend him,\u201d Brooks said of West- brook. \u201cNow, everyone wants to be Russell.\u201d Westbrook has been on fire since returning to the court. He has always been the ultimate blend of speed and size at point guard.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NBA,Russell Westbrook,spotlight,Thunder", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder's lineup after missing 14 games because of a hand injury.", "title": "Russell Westbrook: Spotlight on OKC Thunder guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/12/13/russell-westbrook-spotlight-oklahoma-city-thunders-guard/12263/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/12/Russell-Westbrook.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder's lineup after missing 14 games because of a hand injury.", "title": "Russell Westbrook: Spotlight on Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/12/13/russell-westbrook-spotlight-oklahoma-city-thunders-guard/12263/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/12/Russell-Westbrook.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder's lineup after missing 14 games because of a hand injury.
