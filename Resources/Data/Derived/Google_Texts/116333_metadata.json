Many said taxpayers should keep in mind the new tax rules relating to the Affordable Care Act and shared other tips to help taxpayers filing before the deadline.\n\nMichael Medina, Angela Hightower Tax office manager, said it\u2019s a trend each year to have business bustling at the beginning of tax season with people wanting their returns early, and people rushing in toward the end of the season to file their taxes.\n\n\u201cWe do see a group of people that will wait,\u201d Medina said. \u201cThere are some people that don\u2019t want to give the IRS any money before they have to. They prefer to wait until the very end so they can hold onto their money as long as possible.\u201d\n\nChris Vega, Liberty Tax Lubbock office manager, said with many people filing toward the end of the tax season the time it takes do a return is lengthy.\n\n\u201cIn the later part of the tax season it usually takes an hour to an hour and a half to actually do one return because of the complexity of the return,\u201d he said.\n\nVega said taxpayers should be as prepared as possible when the visit with their tax preparer and be patient.\n\n\u201cTry to make sure you have everything together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just helps a lot of tax places when you have everything organized. Organization is very key, especially this late in the season. Be extremely kind to your preparer because it does take them a while to get through a lot of the information.\u201d\n\nThe tax preparers said there are many tax credits and deductions they will make clients aware of. Medina said the top three that people tend to miss when filling are the retirement savings contribution credit, the educational credit and the childcare credit.\n\n\u201cThe retirement savings contribution credit is if you\u2019re putting money into your retirement either through work \u2014 you\u2019re eligible to receive a credit,\u201d Medina said. \u201cIf you were in post-secondary school a lot of people aren\u2019t aware the credits you can receive on that. Childcare is another big one. If you paid for your child to go to day-care you can deduct some of that on your taxes.\u201d\n\nVega said the best tip he can give taxpayers is to keep records of spending.\n\n\u201cA lot of advice that I usually give is keep records and logs of everything that you spend personally and for an out-of-pocket expense, say for work, because a lot of that stuff does help as a deduction,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t aware of that.\u201d\n\nDustin Nixon, Lubbock Tax Services owner, said one change in this year\u2019s tax season is the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is the Affordable Care Act that went into effect this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Obamacare has been a little shocking (for clients). You have some people come in and that\u2019s all they were worried about and you have some people come in and they have no clue what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nThis is the first tax season, since the Affordable Care Act passed five years ago, where taxpayers may have to pay a penalty for not having health insurance or may have to pay back part of a subsidy to offset the cost of monthly insurance premiums.\n\nVega said the Affordable Care Act has caused some confusion for taxpayers this tax season.\n\n\u201cSome people aren\u2019t aware that they were enrolled or weren\u2019t enrolled or anything like that,\u201d Vega said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a few of the older generation that weren\u2019t aware of someone enrolling them into health care. We\u2019ve had to go back in and make some changes. It\u2019s been a little bit of a hassle.\u201d\n\nMedina said taxpayers should research the exemptions from the Affordable Care Act before paying the penalty. For 2014, the penalty is the greater of $95 or 1 percent of income.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many exemptions out there that they\u2019re not aware that they can take,\u201d Medina said. \u201cSo before they pay the penalty make sure that they aren\u2019t covered by one of those exemptions.\u201d\n\ndenise.marquez@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8754\n\nFollow Denise on Twitter @DMarquezAJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, DENISE MARQUEZ", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Local tax service agents are deep in the heart of taxes with the April 15 tax deadline less than two weeks away.
