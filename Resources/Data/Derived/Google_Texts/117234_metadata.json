Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nThe digital age has been dubbed the \u201cage of distraction\u201d as more and more people have become attached to their cell phones. Cell phones have become one of the biggest sources of multitasking, providing access to games, text messages, emails, all while you\u2019re at work, driving, walking, shopping \u2014 and even in the bedroom. Now, a recent study published in the journal Social Psychology found the mere presence of a cell phone can distract you by diminishing your attention span and cognitive ability, even without using it.\n\nIt\u2019s human nature to get sucked into phone conversations, especially when you\u2019re not on your phone but overhearing someone else. The irresistibility of cell phones steals away your attention, and much more than an old-fashioned, face-to-face conversation due to \u201cconstant connectivity.\u201d A 2013 study published in the journal PLOS ONE found cell phone conversations are attention-grabbing more so than face-to-face conversations because bystanders do not have much control over the personal conversations they\u2019re exposed to, increasing their annoyance and frustration.\n\nOverhearing people\u2019s loud cell phone conversations could distract others to the point of reduced productivity. While seeing or hearing other people use their cell phones can diminish productivity, can the mere sight of a cell phone have the same effect?\n\nBill Thornton, lead author of the new study and psychologist at the University of Southern Maine, and his colleagues sought to unveil whether simply the presence of a cell phone and what it might represent \u2014 social connections, broader social network, etc. \u2014 can be similarly distracting and have negative consequences in social interaction. The researchers recruited students in two separate statistics classes to take part of the study, which involved two versions of the attention-testing tasks. One of the taks was simple, and the other was more challenging.\n\nIn both versions, the participants were presented with a page of 20 rows of single digit numbers singly spaced. The less challenging task was a simple \u201cdigit cancellation\u201d task. Each row of digits in this task was preceded by a \u201ctarget number\u201d that the subject had to circle and then proceed to cross off each occurrence of the number appearing in that row; then on the next row with a different target number such as 2: 382-162-75, according to NY Mag.\n\nThe more challenging task, the \u201cadditive cancellation\u201d task, involved participants to look at a row of digits that was preceded by a \"target number,\" which they would circle and then proceed to cross off any two adjacent numbers that \"added up\" to their target number. For example, 3: 32-1-6183-0-5.\n\nThe students were allowed to keep their phones on their desks while they worked on the cancellation tasks in one of the statistics classes. They were allowed to use their phone because one of the tasks would be asking about the type of cellphone they used. However, the other class was told to keep their phones out of sight.\n\nThe findings provided further evidence that the \u201cmere presence\u201d of a cell phone may be a sufficient distraction that leads to a reduced attention span and poor performance on tasks, especially those that require greater attention and cognitive abilities. Students who could not see their phones did better on both tasks, especially on the more challenging one. These students got an average of 26 correct compared to the other group\u2019s average of 21.\n\nThis supports the belief that constant connectivity throughout the day provides a continual source of interruptions and distractions even when you\u2019re not using your cell phone. It affects the ability to maintain attention and to concentrate deeply about other things. This continues to become more commonplace in society, as at least 85 percent of people in the U.S. have cell phones, while over 50 percent of these users now have smartphones, according to PewResearch Internet Project.\n\nA similar 2012 study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found even just the presence of a cell phone can influence the quality of face-to-face conversations. People who engaged in personal discussions when a phone was nearby, even if the couple wasn\u2019t using it, reported lower relationship quality and less trust from their partner. The participants believed their partner was less empathetic to their concerns.\n\nThe presence of a cell phone can make you more inclined to hear conversations, weaken your ability to connect with other people, especially if something meaningful is being discussed, and diminish attention span and cognitive ability. The will power to disconnect and put away the cell phone could be a simple case of self-control. It all comes down to whether you\u2019re able to deal with FOMO, the Fear Of Missing Out.\n\nSources: Faires A, Robbins M, Rollins E, and Thornton B.
