Joni Ernst\u2019s (R-IA) Roast and Ride \u2014 a GOP fundraiser held over the weekend \u2014 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida met with Iowa voters here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some issues that he\u2019s not probably as strong on as people would like,\u201d Richard Sucher, an Iowa voter told Breitbart News, highlighting foreign affairs. \u201cAnd the whole issue of defense. There are candidates that are much more knowledgeable and stronger on defense issues.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThat will be a critical issue \u2013 and running against the Democratic supposed entry \u2013 they\u2019re going to push the fact that their candidate is really really strong on foreign affairs,\u201d Sucher said.\n\nBreitbart News asked Sucher if Iowans think Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has any accomplishments to run on from her time as Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWe would say that she has done little or nothing. But obviously they\u2019ve been pretty successful over the years to spin nothing into \u2026 you know, they can turn manure into filet,\u201d he said about the Democratic Party.\n\nSucher also raised concerns expressed by many Iowa voters \u2013 that Rubio doesn\u2019t have enough experience yet to run for President of the United States.\n\nHe referenced President Obama\u2019s lack of international experience.\n\n\u201cSome people could say we shouldn\u2019t do it again, because look at what he\u2019s gotten us into,\u201d Sucher said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of good people leave the military. The sequestration has been a terrible thing and that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said, adding that his son-in-law is in the military.\n\nRubio did touch on the military during his speech, saying America is going to \u201crebuild our military once again.\u201d\n\nAnd as president, Rubio said he would make sure \u201cIsrael survives and prospers as a Jewish state.\u201d\n\nSucher recently retired after owning a small business for 35 years and he said the current administration has put forward too many burdensome regulations that hurt small business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived that experience,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what it takes to create your own business to be successful in this environment. There\u2019s a lot of what I perceive to be anti-business sentiment, and really, really doesn\u2019t speak to the efforts it takes to be successful.\u201d\n\nRubio touched on the struggles of small businesses by saying it\u2019s time to make America the best place in the world to start a business.\n\nHe said as president he wants to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare before it continues to repeal and replace small businesses.\u201d\n\nYounger Iowa voters say Rubio is a favorite thus far out of all the GOP campaigns.\n\nIowa voter Justin Choate recently graduate college and is living in Des Moines, attending law school at Drake University.\n\nHe said that Rubio is his favorite so far, but that he\u2019s been hearing some buzz \u201cabout Rick Perry and Ted Cruz, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more or less interested in how he\u2019s going to connect with my generation \u2013 the younger generations. I feel like there\u2019s a disconnect between young voters and the Republican Party right now,\u201d Choate told Breitbart News about Rubio.\n\nDuring his speech to voters, Rubio touched on the hardship of student loans plaguing millennials.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has to go to a four year college,\u201d he said, adding that America needs welders, airplane technicians, and other skilled jobs that are good paying jobs that even pay better than some jobs that people get four-year degrees to have.\n\nBut he also said, those that can afford college and graduate degrees are able to \u201cget that higher education\u201d and it can change one\u2019s life.\n\nOther Iowa voters told Breitbart News during the Roast and Ride that Rubio may be the perfect candidate as he can pull both younger voters and Hispanic voters over to the Republican Party.\n\nRubio closed his speech in Ames by telling his supporters now that his older daughter is out of school for the summer, his family will come to Iowa to get to know everyone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iowa Voters Worry Rubio Is Too Inexperienced, But He's a Favorite With Younger Voters", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Iowa Voters Worry Rubio Is Too Inexperienced, But He's a Favorite With Younger Voters", "title": "Iowa Voters Worry Rubio Is Too Inexperienced, But He's a Favorite With Younger Voters - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/GettyImages-476142724-e1433681461809.jpg", "height": 427}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/09/iowa-voters-worry-rubio-is-too-inexperienced-but-hes-a-favorite-with-younger-voters/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa Voters Worry Rubio Is Too Inexperienced, But He's a Favorite With Younger Voters", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/GettyImages-476142724-e1433681461809.jpg", "title": "Iowa Voters Worry Rubio Is Too Inexperienced, But He's a Favorite With Younger Voters - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Republican Candidates, Foreign Defense, Iowa caucus, Sen.
