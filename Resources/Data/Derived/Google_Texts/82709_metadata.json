Then German-American Jermaine Jones roped one against Portugal. Then German-American Fabian Johnson lit up the wing in both games, offering a burst of offense as well as a hold-steady on defense.\n\nSo by the time it came for the team to face some Germans actually playing for Germany, any nationalistic doubters should have been silenced.

The German-Americans proudly flaunted their tattoos that testified to their commitment: Brooks with his giant eagle on his back, Jermaine Jones with his stars-and-striped kneecap.\n\nAgainst Germany, their narrative grew more rich, and, also, more American: The national mythos is full of stories of the spurned who get a shot at redemption.
