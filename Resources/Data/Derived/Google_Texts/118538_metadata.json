The sale represents yet another loss for American taxpayers over a stimulus-backed \u201cgreen\u201d initiative\u2014this time to the tune of $139 million.\n\nThe Daily Caller has the details:\n\nIncluding the $25 million loan sale, the DOE has recovered only $53 million of the original $192 million disbursed \u2014 netting taxpayers a $139 million loss. Fisker was awarded a $529 million loan guarantee by the Obama administration in 2009 to produce a luxury hybrid car, the Karma, which sold for a $103,000 per unit. However, failure to meet Energy Department benchmarks to receive funding resulted in the company losing its loan guarantee in 2011. The company drew down on $192 million before having its federal funding pulled. The Obama administration seized $21 million from the company in April to help repay taxpayers for its loan. Earlier this year, reports came out that Fisker had violated its loan agreements multiple times before being cut off by the Obama administration in 2011. Bloomberg reported that Fisker\u2019s technical defaults began in 2011 partly due to \u201clower-than-required earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and failing to meet a production milestone of at least 11,000 vehicles sold to dealers for an average of $87,500 by Sept. 30, 2011.\u201d\n\n\u201cFisker's collapse closes yet another sad chapter in DOE's troubled portfolio. The jobs that were promised never materialized and, once again, taxpayers are on the hook for the administration\u2019s reckless gamble,\u201d House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Pa., and House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said in a joint statement.\n\nThe sale represents the biggest taxpayer loss on a green loan since the Solyndra collapse, which cost taxpayers $528 million.\n\n\"Once again, American taxpayers are losing out to foreign investors due to the Obama administration's failed green energy policies,\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said. \"Time after time this administration has fumbled the ball with their attempts to pick winners and losers when it comes to American energy.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yet another loss for American taxpayers was announced on Friday over a green initiative--this time to the tune of $139 million. .05/24/2016 6:46:17AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Yet another loss for American taxpayers was announced on Friday over a green initiative--this time to the tune of $139 million.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Taxpayers Lose $139 Million After Energy Dept.
