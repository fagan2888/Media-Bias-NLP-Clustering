But he\u2019s seen to lack the necessary presidential qualities of deviousness and ruthlessness. And, again like Carter, he is seen to be plain unlucky \u2014 in Carter\u2019s case, his botched attempt at a military rescue of American diplomats interred in Tehran, in Obama\u2019s the way the secular rebels in Syria whom he supported were so quickly supplanted by jihadist terrorists.\n\nEven more woundingly, more and more Obama is being compared to the luckless Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe source for this doubt is of course the recent chaotic launch the \u201cObamacare\u201d health care reforms.\n\nThere\u2019s substance to this hand-wringing. A recent poll came up with the chilling finding that 52 per cent of Americans say they now don\u2019t always trust what Obama says.\n\nFor weeks now, media commentators have competed to describe how it could have happened that President Barack Obama should have gone so quickly and so completely from being widely admired as a cool brainiac to being seen as a dead duck.\n\nThis is that the root source of the problems Obama is having does not reside in his character \u2014 the launch of Obamacare, was indeed a horrendous bureaucratic bungle, but it\u2019s correctable. Rather, the root source may reside in the contemporary character of Americans.\n\nConsider this fact: Bill Clinton, probably the politically ablest president but for Ronald Reagan in the entire postwar period, also attempted a radical reform of health care. He got nowhere, even failing to legislate his ideas, as Obama has done.\n\nA second similar fact. A clear sign of Obama\u2019s current weakness is that immigration reform, on which he\u2019s worked for so long, is now completely stalled.\n\nExactly the same thing happened to George W. Bush, though. As president, Bush most certainly had his failings. But he knew Hispanics well because there were so many of them in Texas, and cared about them. In return, in 2004, he won 44 per cent of the Hispanic vote. His own Republicans then defeated \u2014 twice \u2014 Bush\u2019s attempts to enable illegal immigrants to become citizens.\n\nExtremism, as expressed by the Tea Party, is now an integral part of Republican ideology. The Democrats, if somewhat less hysterical about it, are almost as adamant.\n\nThese attitudes of resentment, suspicion, anger, are now so deeply entrenched as to raise the question whether Americans, large numbers of them at least, have made America itself ungovernable. Sort of like a larger Greece.\n\nThat comparison is exaggerated for effect. And Americans have an ability matched nowhere else to recover from failures and mistakes, as from defeat in Vietnam, or, today, from humiliating retreats from Iraq and, soon, from Afghanistan.\n\nToday\u2019s challenges are far more profound. As early as 2015, America\u2019s economic output will drop into the world\u2019s second spot, behind China. The U.S. will long remain by far the wealthier nation, and its military will be No. 1 for decades.\n\nComparatively, though, the U.S is in decline, just as Britain once was. It will become harder and harder for Americans to regard themselves, as is their founding myth, as citizens of an \u201cexceptional nation.\u201d\n\nObama is in a situation much like that of King Canute when he tried to turn back the tide. Who thinks Hillary Clinton could do much better if she runs and wins for the Democrats in 2016, or that Mitt Romney could now be doing better had he won it for the Republicans over Obama?\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that Obama couldn\u2019t do quite a bit better himself if he at last gets a run of luck.\n\nAnd that seems to be happening. The weekend nuclear deal with Iran, if only partial, opens up the possibility of a serious attempt at a peace pact between Israel and the Palestinians. The Republicans may stop committing electoral suicide by ignoring the Hispanic vote. And Obama may find someone who knows how to fix his health care website.\n\nOr he\u2019ll miss out on all these and go down in the records as Jimmy Carter the Second.\n\nRichard Gwyn\u2019s column appears every other Tuesday. gwynr@sympatico.ca", "article_metadata": {"description": "As with Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama\u2019s smarts and good intentions are widely accepted.
