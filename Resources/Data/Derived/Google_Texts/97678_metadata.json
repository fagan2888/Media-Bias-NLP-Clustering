(Photo: Holmdel Police Department )\n\nAn 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.\n\nDavid M. Adoni, 18, of Morganville was trapped following the 11:41 a.m. crash at Route 520 between Middletown Road and Longbridge Road, according to police Lt. Michael Pigott.\n\n\u201cHe left the roadway for unknown reasons and then we believe he overcompensated with the wheel and turned back too quickly causing the vehicle to roll over,\u201d Pigott said.\n\nHolmdel First Aid Squad and the Holmdel Fire Department were able to get Adoni out of the vehicle. Adoni was treated for injuries at the scene and taken to Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune for further treatment, Pigott said.\n\nIt was not immediately known whether Adoni was admitted.\n\nThe crash is under investigation by Patrolman John Maguire. He was assisted at the scene by Sgt. Charles Groder, Patrolman Michael Michalski and members of the Holmdel First Aid and fire companies.\n\nAnyone who witnessed the crash should contact Maguire at 732-946-9690 ext. 1876.\n\nStephanie Loder: 732-456-2159; sloder@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/VAp2Y0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "An 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "An 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.", "title": "Holmdel crash injures Marlboro man, 18", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/08/18/holmdel-vehicle-overturns/14254505/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a5d04d2921cc4ce9a160dea15410b8ed9053555b/c=159-0-671-512&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/08/18/holmdelcopcar.jpg", "title": "Holmdel crash injures Marlboro man, 18", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1345\"", "article_summary": "Holmdel police are investigating a Monday morning crash that injured a Marlboro man.\nHolmdel First Aid Squad and the Holmdel Fire Department were able to get Adoni out of the vehicle.\n(Photo: Holmdel Police Department )An 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.\nDavid M.
