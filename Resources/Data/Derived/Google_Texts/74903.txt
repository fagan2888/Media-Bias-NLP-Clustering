Last week, Moscow banned imports of meat, fish, milk and fruit from the USA and other countries in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:

The food ban will hurt Russia more. Its people will be back in long lines for food again. The Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine are there for one reason, and that is to support the rebels when needed.

The question is, what are President Obama, the European Union and NATO going to do?

If Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government wish to return to isolationism, then let them. We'll see how long that lasts. History has already gone down that path, and it doesn't work, but let the man and the country learn.

We are all on this earth together. Sooner or later, you have to grow up and act like it.

Importing food from China will be next. Putin is an absolute throwback to the old communist days. It's his way or the highway, and he doesn't care how much his citizens suffer in his quest to re-establish the old Soviet Union.

Russia gets about 40% of its food from imports. When the people of Russia have to stand in line all day for basics as they did back under communist rule, maybe they will finally rise up and overthrow this dictatorship.

Actually, Russian domestic producers will thrive because they will have less competition from EU imports. EU producers are the obvious losers here.
