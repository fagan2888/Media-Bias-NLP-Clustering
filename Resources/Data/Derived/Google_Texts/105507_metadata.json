Jon Tester. The DSCC is the party\u2019s official organization to support and elect Democrats to the US Senate.\n\nNot long after this donation, Shkerli\u2019s company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired the rights to the drug Daraprim, a 50-year old drug used to treat parasitic infections. In recent years, the drug has been used to treat AIDs and cancer patients who develop specific infections during treatment.\n\nAt the time of the Turing purchase, Daraprim, which is long past its patent-protection, was selling for around $13.50 a pill. Soon after the purchase of the drug was complete, however, Turing announced it was increasing the price to $750 a pill. The drug today costs around $1 a pill to produce.\n\nShkerli defended the price hike, saying the increase was needed to fund the development of new drugs to treat parasitic infections with fewer side effects. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients, it is us trying to stay in business,\u201d Shkreli explained.\n\nNews of the price hike sparked a public outcry, with Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton seizing on the story to boost her campaign. Within days, Shkerli announced that his company would lower the price of the drug, although he didn\u2019t specify a new amount.\n\nThe retreat wasn\u2019t enough for Hillary Clinton, however. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton demanded that Shkerli immediately roll back the price of the drug to the original amount, before the company purchased the rights to the medicine.\n\n\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t said how much the drug will cost going forward, and in the meantime, sick patients still have to wait and worry and continue to pay $750/pill.,\u201d Clinton wrote on a Facebook Q&A. \u201cSo Mr. Shkreli, what\u2019s it going to be? Do the right thing. Lower the cost today to its original price.\u201d\n\nWhich raises an obvious question for Sen. Tester and the Senate Democrats. Are they going to keep Shkreli\u2019s donation, or \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and return the money.\n\nWhat\u2019s it going to be Sen. Tester?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Price-Gouging Drug Exec Shared $34k With Senate Democrats", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Price-Gouging Drug Exec Shared $34k With Senate Democrats", "title": "Price-Gouging Drug Exec Shared $34k With Senate Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/131114_jon_tester_ap_605_956x519.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/29/price-gouging-drug-exec-shared-34k-senate-democrats/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Price-Gouging Drug Exec Shared $34k With Senate Democrats", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/131114_jon_tester_ap_605_956x519.jpg", "title": "Price-Gouging Drug Exec Shared $34k With Senate Democrats", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "drug, Hillary Clinton, john tester, patent, Shkerli,Big Government,Democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Shkerli", "published_time": "2015-09-29T19:42:10-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a3c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients, it is us trying to stay in business,\u201d Shkreli explained.\nNot long after this donation, Shkerli\u2019s company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired the rights to the drug Daraprim, a 50-year old drug used to treat parasitic infections.\nIn recent years, the drug has been used to treat AIDs and cancer patients who develop specific infections during treatment.\nLower the cost today to its original price.\u201dWhich raises an obvious question for Sen.
