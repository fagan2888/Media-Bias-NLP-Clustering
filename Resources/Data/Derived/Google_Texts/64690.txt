BARTOW — The Polk County Commission approved the sale of the former county adult daycare center in Lake Wales to Central Florida Health Care for $1 million.

Central Florida Health Care plans to open a medical clinic in Lake Wales with money that is part of $5 million in Affordable Care Act funds for 10 new community health clinics in Florida, part of $101 million being awarded nationwide to community health centers such as Central Florida Health Care, the Health and Human Services Department has said.

This will be recurring funding, an addition to approximately $6 million a year Central Florida currently gets in federal monies.

The medical center would go there and a dental clinic Central Florida now has at another location in Lake Wales could move into the same building.

n Concurred with the appointment of Dr. Joy Jackson as director of Polk County Health Department.
