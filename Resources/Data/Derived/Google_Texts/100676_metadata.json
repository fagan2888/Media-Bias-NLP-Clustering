People in those states will be disadvantaged by the changes.People in 10 other states that failed to abolish their high-risk pools are the \"winners,\" she writes.The Obama rules also force insurers to give enrollees \"a 30-day grace period during which they can continue to use doctors not in their plan\u2019s network. Winners: people who need time to switch to in-network doctors. Losers: taxpayers \u2014 who\u2019ll be obliged to bail out the insurers clobbered with the extra cost,\" McCaughey adds.According to the Galen Institute , a think tank specializing in healthcare issues, \"more than 42 significant changes\" have been made to Obamacare since its passage four years ago.They include least 24 that President Obama made unilaterally, and two others ordered by the Supreme Court. The remaining 16 were passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, directives, high-risk pools, employers", "pubdate": "2014-12-03T13:18:41", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Obama continues rewriting his signature healthcare overhaul by \"executive fiat,\" disregarding the will of Congress and the Constitution, says Betsy McCaughey, a health policy expert.", "title": "Betsy McCaughey: Obamacare Has Passed Into 'Lawlessness'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-directives-high-risk-pools-employers/2014/12/03/id/610834/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=d9215642-f932-4750-8ef1-b47b37ad4f17&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-directives-high-risk-pools-employers/2014/12/03/id/610834/", "description": "President Obama continues rewriting his signature healthcare overhaul by \"executive fiat,\" disregarding the will of Congress and the Constitution, says Betsy McCaughey, a health policy expert.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Betsy McCaughey: Obamacare Has Passed Into 'Lawlessness'"}, "epoch": 1417612721, "keywords": "obamacare, directives, high-risk pools, employers", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-12-03T13:18:41"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/obamacare-directives-high-risk-pools-employers/2014/12/03/id/610834/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "President Obama continues rewriting his signature healthcare overhaul by  executive fiat,  disregarding the will of Congress and the Constitution, says Betsy McCaughey, a health policy expert."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17e6\"", "article_summary": "The remaining 16 were passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.\nWinners: people who need time to switch to in-network doctors.\nPeople in those states will be disadvantaged by the changes.People in 10 other states that failed to abolish their high-risk pools are the \"winners,\" she writes.The Obama rules also force insurers to give enrollees \"a 30-day grace period during which they can continue to use doctors not in their plan\u2019s network.\nLosers: taxpayers \u2014 who\u2019ll be obliged to bail out the insurers clobbered with the extra cost,\" McCaughey adds.According to the Galen Institute , a think tank specializing in healthcare issues, \"more than 42 significant changes\" have been made to Obamacare since its passage four years ago.They include least 24 that President Obama made unilaterally, and two others ordered by the Supreme Court.\nPresident Obama continues rewriting his signature healthcare overhaul by \"executive fiat,\" disregarding the will of Congress and the Constitution, according to Betsy McCaughey, a health policy expert and former lieutenant governor of New York.Rule changes ordered by the president on Thanksgiving Eve \"create new losers as well as winners \u2014 the sort of trade-offs that legislators are supposed to weigh in our system of government,\" McCaughey said."}
