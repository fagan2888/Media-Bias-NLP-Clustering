Harp, right, listens to Lubbie Harper Jr. speak before swearing her in at inauguration ceremonies at Hill Regional Career High School in New Haven Wednesday. Harp\u2019s children, from left, Djana Harp, Jamil Harp and Matthew Harp, joined her on stage. Arnold Gold \u2014 New Haven Register\n\nNEW HAVEN >> Toni Nathaniel Harp was sworn in as the city\u2019s 50th mayor and first female to hold that office on Wednesday, and spoke on themes of social justice and chose to concentrate on the city\u2019s attributes, rather than problems, characterizing its prospects for economic development as \u201cdazzling.\u201d\n\nIt was standing-room only for a crowd that packed the auditorium and spilled over into a separate room at Career High School, a facility designed by her late husband, Wendell Harp.\n\nThe racially mixed crowd was excited that New Haven has its second African-African mayor in a city that has a majority of minority residents.\n\nHarp, 66, shared the stage with Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and the rest of the statewide elected officers, both U.S. senators and U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a testament to the powerful Democratic Party here and the votes it has turned out for Malloy, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy in their tough fights for office, with Malloy expected to seek a second term in November.\n\nHarp was administered the oath by her old friend Lubbie Harper Jr., who began his career as a teacher and then a school administrator in New Haven, before becoming a lawyer and advancing to the Connecticut Supreme Court, from which he recently retired. The new mayor\u2019s grown children \u2014 Jamil, Matthew and Djana Harp \u2014 held the Bible as she was sworn in.\n\nThe loudest applause from the large audience was elicited each time a speaker spoke about the importance of women in leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen women succeed, America succeeds,\u201d DeLauro said to sustained cheers.\n\nThroughout the long primary campaign and then the run-up to the election, Harp emphasized her connections to Hartford and a smoother, more consistent relationship with the governor than was always the case with outgoing Mayor John DeStefano Jr., who beat Malloy in a 2006 primary battle for the gubernatorial nomination.\n\nMalloy played into that, promising to work with her \u201cto change a parking lot to a thriving community,\u201d refering to LiveWorkPlayLearn plans for housing and other construction that needs infrastructure help in connecting roads across Route 34 to make it happen.\n\nHe also promised \u201cto revitalize the train station,\u201d a plan that would add retail and eventually housing to that portion of Union Avenue, and a more direct connection to downtown.\n\nWhile the tone of her address was overwhelmingly positive, Harp took the reins of government some 12 hours after a shooting that left a 20-year-old man in critical condition. The mayor said she and other officials are putting a lot of faith in community policing and Project Longevity to help stem the violence. New Haven ended 2013 with 20 homicides.\n\nHarp reiterated her support for Dean Esserman to stay on as police chief and said they both share an ideology \u201cthat puts crime prevention on equal footing with law enforcement.\u201d\n\nShe said it was important to intervene to help those who are beginning to despair \u201cso they choose a more sustainable path and reach a destination on the right side of the law.\u201d\n\nHarp said of those who make bad decisions, \u201cthere, but for the grace of a loving parent, inspiring teacher, caring member of the clergy, or someone else who got involved, could be virtually any one of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo first-grade student, when asked what he or she wants to be when grown-up, answers \u2018embezzler,\u2019 \u2018drug dealer\u2019 or \u2018murderer.\u2019 I\u2019m confident that the vast majority of those who commit crimes do so from desperation, not as a career destination. Each of these people has a story; no matter how heinous or deplorable a crime might be, it\u2019s the behavior that\u2019s reprehensible \u2014 even abhorrent \u2014 and rarely the perpetrator,\u201d she told the audience.\n\nHarp said she intends to have the \u201cfeet on the street\u201d needed to determine who is taking advantage of these diversionary programs. She said none of these observations should be viewed as \u201csoft on crime.\u201d The mayor said community policing will not compromise safety.\n\nHarp said those who turn their backs on \u201cconstructive alternatives\u201d to crime will have more consciously chosen \u201ccrimimnal behavior and will be treated accordingly.\u201d\n\nBeyond the major themes of health care, education, crime reduction and jobs, there was something concrete for everyone from the new mayor.\n\nHarp said a priority is to rebuild the seawall, \u201cso residents on the East Shore can rest assured their homes are safe and secure,\u201d an area that voted for her opponent in the general election, Alderman Justin Elicker.\n\nHarp also committed to rebuilding the Q House in the Dixwell neighborhood, a fondly remembered, but shuttered, facility for youth programs that a new study found would cost $13.4 million to replace. The lack of youth programs was a major election theme for all the candidates. The mayor also pledged to find a way to \u201cbreathe new life into the Latino Youth Development program.\u201d\n\nAs the former mayor of Stamford, Malloy had some advice for Harp, telling her that she should expect to be frequently stopped by her constituents as she goes about things as mundane as grocery shopping.\n\n\u201cMayors own the city and the city owns the mayor,\u201d Malloy told her as she begins her two-year term. \u201cI know that New Haven is prepared for Toni Harp and I know that Toni Harp is prepared for New Haven.\u201d\n\nDeStefano was mayor for 20 years and, while they didn\u2019t always get along, Harp made a special point of thanking him.\n\n\u201cAny new administration at every level of government stands on the shoulders of the previous administrations and works to build on its accomplishments. I want to personally extend my thanks for your commitment, steadfast dedication and achievements over the past ten terms,\u201d Harp said. DeStefano wasn\u2019t at the ceremony.\n\nHarp reflected on the changing cycle of leadership in the city, both public and private, with the first new Yale University president in two decades, in addition to a new mayor and new superintendent of schools. Harp said the city\u2019s \u201ccollective potential is positively inspiring.\u201d\n\nHarp\u2019s areas of concentration as a state senator for 21 years were health care, criminal justice and education. She praised the federal Affordable Care Act and pledged to make its promise of insurance a fact for needy New Haven residents.\n\nHarp said it was \u201can egregious moral failure for city residents to go without or be denied adequate health care while living figuratively across the street from one of the world\u2019s foremost medical centers,\u201d referring to Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n\nThe new mayor, pledging to continue many initiatives already under way in New Haven, said hunger continues to impact \u201can intolerable number\u201d of residents, saying, \u201cHunger must not be allowed a place at the table of plenty that is Connecticut.\u201d\n\nShe wants to deal with the so-called \u201cfood deserts\u201d in certain neighborhoods where it is hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nHarp is on board with the increasing supplemental role of schools that provide meals and health clinics in addition to teaching. She is high on community schools that look beyond academics and said she wants foreign languages and STEM courses \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 stressed in city schools.\n\nShe pitched New Haven to businesses, stating the city is within 500 miles of some one-third of the U.S. economy and two-thirds of the Canadian economy. She said its location is complemented by its educated workforce and the entrepreneurs who are coming out of the local colleges. Harp said New Haven and Connecticut remain committed to small businesses and the state has top-ten rankings in venture capital closings.\n\nThe inaugural ceremony stressed family, with City-Town Clerk Michael Smart accompanied by his neices, one of whom, attorney Kristina Allen, swore him in. Mariah Smart from Music Haven sang the national anthem, while the locally grown group Salt and Pepper also sang. The Unity Boys Choir got a standing ovation; Lisa Fluker sang an original song.\n\nThere were numerous Democrats from earlier administrations, as well as people who hadn\u2019t been engaged in politics before this past election. Also, sitting near the front was Yale President Peter Salovey, his wife, Marta Elisa Moret, and Bruce Alexander, Yale\u2019s vice president.\n\n\u201cI appreciated that she started her speech with such impassioned comments about the need to build economically and create jobs because that is an area that we are committing to also at Yale. Virtually every theme that she had represents an area where we could have partnerships, or do, whether it is economic development, community policing, reducing crime, public health, food security and nutrition, school reform, all areas where we work together. I was very energized by her speech,\u201d Salovey said, as he made his way to the receiving line for Harp.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Toni Harp sworn in as 50th mayor of New Haven", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140101/toni-harp-sworn-in-as-50th-mayor-of-new-haven", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140101/NEWS/140109952/AR/0/AR-140109952.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "979px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Toni Harp sworn in as 50th mayor of New Haven"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Toni Nathaniel Harp was sworn in as the city\u2019s 50th mayor and first female to hold that office on Wednesday, and spoke on themes of social justice and chose to concentrate on the city\u2019s attributes, rather than problems", "title": "Toni Harp sworn in as 50th mayor of New Haven", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140101/toni-harp-sworn-in-as-50th-mayor-of-new-haven", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140101/NEWS/140109952/AR/0/AR-140109952.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Toni Nathaniel Harp was sworn in as the city\u2019s 50th mayor and first female to hold that office on Wednesday, and spoke on themes of social justice and chose to concentrate on the city\u2019s attributes, rather than problems"}, "article_summary": "New Haven Mayor Toni N.
