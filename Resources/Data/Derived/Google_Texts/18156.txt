The e-filing tax software TurboTax stopped allowing customers to file their state tax returns on Friday.

The move comes after the company said it noticed an increasing number of suspicious filings. The Minnesota Department of Revenue stopped accepting returns filed using TurboTax after some tax payers found someone had already filed returns under their name.

Iowa TurboTax users are running into problems as well.

Friday, the Iowa Department of Revenue stopped processing state tax returns until TurboTax until a fraud investigation is finished.

Iowan Kristi Kenyon has turned to TurboTax for several years.

"It's not very complicated, so we figured it's be easier to just do on our own," said Kenyon.

The problems are a worry to some Iowans.

"You can change a card number, but you can't change your Social Security number," said Kenyon.

State revenue officials said they haven't heard from anyone affected in Iowa, but they are still taking extra steps to make sure it stays that way.

"We run every return through the fraud model and if there are any indication that we've got a fraudulent return then we follow up further," said Stu Vos, deputy director of the Iowa Department of Revenue.

Federal tax returns are still OK to file through TurboTax. If you've already filed your state tax return, your personal information is not in jeopardy, officials said.
