Consider: Chait and I and the White House (if Chait is right) all assume these unilateral maneuvers will be highly limited in their substantive impact. Their only real value is signaling that Obama believes he can exert his will on the economy without Congress and is working really hard to do that. But if that\u2019s the effect, then they only exacerbate Obama\u2019s dilemma by further persuading voters he has influence over the economy we just agreed he doesn\u2019t have.\n\nNow maybe the economy will improve on its own, in which case no foul. As I said earlier, the chances that it will are reasonably good. But if the economy doesn\u2019t improve, or god forbid it worsens, the new approach will be a disaster. It will stick Obama with an even larger share of the blame than he\u2019d otherwise come in for. Since the point of a political strategy is to shape voters\u2019 perceptions of events in a way that makes them look more favorable to you, not less, this doesn\u2019t strike me as a step forward.\n\nWhat strategy should Obama have adopted instead? He might have started with an idea his State of the Union speech noticeably omitted\u2014namely, an ambitious economic initiative. I have in mind a half-trillion-dollar-ish mix of middle-of-the-road stimulus proposals and the odd crowd-pleaser from the left. Say, infrastructure spending, some corporate and individual tax cuts, and an extension of unemployment benefits. You call it the American Growth, Opportunity, and Puppies Act (since people love puppies), send a few hundred densely-typed pages of proposed text to Congress, then go tour the country while instructing the House to get to work.\n\nThe message you want to convey, in other words, is that you have big uncontroversial plans to fix the economy, and that the only thing that could possibly derail them is an ornery, self-serving opposition party. If Republicans decide they can live with the resulting fallout and refuse to budge, fine. At least voters will know who to blame. And if Congress starts to get queasy about standing in the way of Growth, Opportunity, and Puppies, then maybe something will come of it, if not the whole $500-billion package (which is an opening bid in any case). This is essentially the approach Obama took in late 2011. Though Congress didn\u2019t sign off on his entire $450 billion American Jobs Act, his hectoring did make Republicans uncomfortable enough to extend a payroll tax cut worth roughly $100 billion. It\u2019s pretty much the only time in Obama\u2019s presidency I recall him playing his hand better than the cards he was dealt.\n\nThis time around, by contrast, Obama actually has a reasonably good hand, thanks to an opposition that completely discredited itself during last fall\u2019s shutdown, and which remains so confused and divided it can\u2019t even decide what delusional demand to make in a theoretical debt-ceiling negotiation that NO ONE BELIEVES IS GOING TO HAPPEN. But instead of forcing the goofy, self-defeating Republicans into the spotlight and making them answer for economic stagnation, Obama\u2019s year of doing-things-all-by-my-lonesome has effectively let them off the hook. It makes no sense.\n\nNoam Scheiber is a senior editor at The New Republic.
