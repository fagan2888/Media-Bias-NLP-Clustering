Scott Applewhite)\n\nHere\u2019s one thing that\u2019s worth noting about the coming general election: Democrats are probably going to run a very similar playbook against the GOP nominee, no matter who it is. Sure, if it\u2019s Donald Trump, they\u2019ll go hard at his penchant for insulting women and immigrants, and if it\u2019s Ted Cruz, they will focus on his singularly repellent aura and hard right positions on social issues.\n\nBut ultimately, Democrats are preparing to run hard against GOP fiscal policies \u2014 in particular, the Republican Party\u2019s inevitable general election embrace of a tax plan that delivers a huge windfall to the wealthy \u2014 which will happen whether the nominee is Trump, Cruz, or some unicorn savior candidate.\n\nGallup has released some new polling today that reminds us of the degree to which the American public sides with Democrats on this issue:\n\nSixty-one percent of Americans think upper income Americans pay too little in taxes, a view that\u2019s shared by 67 percent of moderates. But majorities of Republicans and conservatives think upper income Americans either pay the right amount or too much. Even more interesting:\n\nFifty two percent of Americans support this, even with very aggressive wording \u2014 the question raises the prospect of \u201cheavy\u201d taxes on the rich, in order to \u201credistribute\u201d wealth. A solid majority of moderates agrees. But large percentages of Republicans and conservatives oppose it. (In fairness, some polling has shown that Republicans, too, favor tax hikes on the rich.)\n\nWe already know that the tax plans offered by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would deliver large windfalls to top earners. Meanwhile, Ryan recently suggested in an interview with John Harwood that any tax reform the GOP embraces would likely cut top rates. Ryan has taken himself out of the running for president, but he functions as a useful generic unicorn savior candidate for now, a placeholder of sorts.\n\nObviously, Republicans argue that cutting taxes on everybody \u2014 including the highest earners \u2014 will unleash spectacular economic growth, lifting everyone\u2019s fortunes. Ryan argued that in his interview with Harwood. But this has frustrated some reform conservatives, who point out that the Republican Party still remains trapped in a 1980s fiscal worldview even as Trump is moving into the vacuum this has left behind by more directly addressing the economic concerns that struggling GOP voters are experiencing amid globalization and technological change. (Trump is pulling a scam here, since his actual policies aren\u2019t in sync with his rhetoric.)\n\nYet it\u2019s arguably worse than this. The plans embraced by the likes of Trump and Cruz would not simply deliver a large windfall to the top earners. They would roll back the redistributive policies put in place by Obama, and do more on top of that. Both Cruz and Trump would repeal Obamacare, and any replace plan adopted by the eventual GOP nominee (and the replace plan that Ryan promises to introduce any day now) will almost certainly cover fewer low-income people, for the simple reason that it will spend less government money.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump\u2019s tax plan would produce a decline of $9.5 trillion in revenues over a decade, while Cruz\u2019s plan would result in a decline of $8.6 trillion in revenues over a decade. That would likely mean massive cuts to government programs that might disproportionately hit lower income earners. We can\u2019t know for sure what fiscal agenda the eventual GOP nominee will adopt, but it\u2019s likely it will be framed around the idea that the primary problem facing economically struggling Americans is too much government-engineered downward redistribution of wealth. After all, the Gallup numbers above suggest that large swaths of the GOP base are hostile to any further efforts at redistribution.\n\nDemocratic operatives are already signaling that they will go hard at GOP fiscal priorities in the general election. As Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson recently put it, all of these GOP candidates are aligned with a set of priorities that include bit tax cuts at the top, opposition to raising the federal minimum wage (if not getting rid of it entirely), and nothing to alleviate student debt or address gender pay inequity.\n\nWhether the GOP nominee is crazy Donald Trump, nasty and vicious Ted Cruz, or Very Serious Wonk Paul Ryan \u2014 or some other savior candidate \u2014 he will all but certainly embrace an agenda shaped to no small degree around tax plans that deliver big cuts to the rich. Yet if Gallup is right, majorities think the current distribution of the tax burden is already unfair, and perhaps even favor redistribution in the opposite direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Gallup polling shows Republicans are at odds with the American people once again.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New Gallup polling shows Republicans are at odds with the American people once again.", "title": "Whether it\u2019s crazy Trump, nasty Ted Cruz, or wonky Paul Ryan, GOP nominee would cut taxes on rich", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/15/whether-its-crazy-trump-nasty-ted-cruz-or-wonky-paul-ryan-gop-nominee-would-cut-taxes-on-rich/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/14/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump_Middle_East_-00716.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/15/whether-its-crazy-trump-nasty-ted-cruz-or-wonky-paul-ryan-gop-nominee-would-cut-taxes-on-rich/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "donald trump, ted cruz, paul ryan, tax cuts for the rich, gop fiscal policies", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, ted cruz, paul ryan, tax cuts for the rich, gop fiscal policies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f63\"", "article_summary": "Scott Applewhite)Here\u2019s one thing that\u2019s worth noting about the coming general election: Democrats are probably going to run a very similar playbook against the GOP nominee, no matter who it is.\nWe already know that the tax plans offered by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would deliver large windfalls to top earners.\nThe plans embraced by the likes of Trump and Cruz would not simply deliver a large windfall to the top earners.\nMeanwhile, Ryan recently suggested in an interview with John Harwood that any tax reform the GOP embraces would likely cut top rates.\nWhether the GOP nominee is crazy Donald Trump, nasty and vicious Ted Cruz, or Very Serious Wonk Paul Ryan \u2014 or some other savior candidate \u2014 he will all but certainly embrace an agenda shaped to no small degree around tax plans that deliver big cuts to the rich."}
