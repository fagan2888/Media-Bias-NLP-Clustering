Re: “Check the costs of Denver ballot issue 2C,” Sept. 27 Susan Barnes-Gelt column.

Susan Barnes Gelt’s op-ed on Question 2C’s lack of details is shocking enough, yet the politically connected “Yes on 2C” group is spending more than $600,000 to convince Denverites to vote themselves a permanent tax increase without revealing even more unneeded costs. The renovation and expansion of the National Western Complex would be a positive, but the proposed (but not approved) expansion of Interstate 70 east nearby adds expensive water drainage costs due to the Colorado Department of Transportation’s 40-foot deep trench. Tripling the width of the highway also limits access to the National Western Complex. Lastly, the former Denver City Council’s parting gesture committed $180 million in one form or another to CDOT for I-70 east (yes, some of it for yet more water drainage!), money that (still) could go toward the stock show, reducing the amount for this tax.

Your decision to vote against 2C is an easy one. The devil’s in the details.
