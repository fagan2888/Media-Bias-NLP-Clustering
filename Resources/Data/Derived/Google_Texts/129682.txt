Disney Bringing 'Star Wars' to Life with Theme Parks, Cruises

Droid encounters, Jedi training and Starfighter battles loom in the near future for Star Wars fans and not just when viewing the upcoming movie, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, slated to be released in December. The Walt Disney Company recently announced new Star Wars worlds and Star Wars-themed cruises.

Walt Disney Parks and Resorts plans to build 14-acre Star Wars attractions at both Disneyland, Anaheim, CA, and Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, FL. Calling the new Star Wars world the “largest single themed land expansion ever,” Bob Iger, The Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO, says the new worlds “will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet.”



Fans will be able to guide the Millennium Falcon starship on a secret mission and engage in a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. A firm date for the new encounters has not yet been announced.



Meanwhile, fans can look forward to enhanced Star Wars experiences later this year at the parks’ existing Star Wars attractions, including seeing Force Awakens characters at Star Tours and Star Wars Launch Bay.
