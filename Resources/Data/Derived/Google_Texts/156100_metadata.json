On Thursday, October 16 players and coaches participated in a shoot around at the tribe\u2019s recreation center with tribal youth and members following the action as spectators.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have been traveling to many points across Southern California for exhibition games during the three-week preseason, and the shoot around in Temecula was a chance for the team to show gratitude for inland Southern California fans\u2019 loyalty. The Lakers\u2019 practice in Temecula was not open to the public, though members of the media were invited to interview coaches and players following the shoot around.\n\n\u201cWe deeply appreciate our partnership with the Lakers and their commitment to the broader Southern California community,\u201d said Tribal Chairman, Mark Macarro. \u201cOur youth were ecstatic. Today, they witnessed a focused, structured practice with high intensity, and what it takes to be a champion.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the support we have all over Southern California, not just in Los Angeles,\u201d said Lakers Head Coach, Byron Scott. \u201cThe guys [players] love it and motivates them to do even better.\u201d\n\nPechanga has been a longtime donor to the Lakers Youth Foundation and sponsor of the Los Angeles Lakers. The team held a similar practice at Pechanga in 2010 at the newly-built recreation center. The team was impressed with Pechanga\u2019s hospitality and returned in 2013 and 2014, and to raise money for charity. Many of the players and coaches took part in a casino night fundraiser at the Pechanga Resort & Casino on Wednesday night benefiting the Lakers Youth Foundation.\n\nKobe Bryant talked about what he looks forward to this season. \u201cThe challenge. It\u2019s such a long season. It\u2019s about staying healthy, getting our team to play at a high level.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gearing up for the first game of their regular season on Tuesday, October 28, the Los Angeles Lakers made a preseason practice stop at the Pechanga Recreation Center on the Pech", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/17/la-lakers-kobe-bryant-shoot-hoops-good-cause-pechanga-resort-casino-157397", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lakers_practice_at_pechanga_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "LA Lakers, Kobe Bryant Shoot Hoops for a Good Cause at Pechanga Resort & Casino"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-17T09:42-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/17/la-lakers-kobe-bryant-shoot-hoops-good-cause-pechanga-resort-casino-157397", "dc": {"title": "LA Lakers, Kobe Bryant Shoot Hoops for a Good Cause at Pechanga Resort & Casino"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "LA Lakers, Kobe Bryant Shoot Hoops for a Good Cause at Pechanga Resort & Casino"}, "article_summary": "Many of the players and coaches took part in a casino night fundraiser at the Pechanga Resort & Casino on Wednesday night benefiting the Lakers Youth Foundation.\n\u201cThe guys [players] love it and motivates them to do even better.\u201dPechanga has been a longtime donor to the Lakers Youth Foundation and sponsor of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the support we have all over Southern California, not just in Los Angeles,\u201d said Lakers Head Coach, Byron Scott.\n\u201cWe deeply appreciate our partnership with the Lakers and their commitment to the broader Southern California community,\u201d said Tribal Chairman, Mark Macarro.\nThe Lakers\u2019 practice in Temecula was not open to the public, though members of the media were invited to interview coaches and players following the shoot around."}
