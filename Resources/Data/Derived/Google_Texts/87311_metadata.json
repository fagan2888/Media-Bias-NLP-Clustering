But he\u2019ll also go out with the taste of defeat still lingering: Just five months earlier, his attempt to outlaw the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues was overturned in the courts.\n\nAs a consolation prize, the mayor\u2019s high-profile campaign against the health risks of soda may have contributed to a 6.8% decline in the amount of soda purchased in New York in the last year.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another consolation prize: As the WSJ\u2019s Amy Guthrie reports, Bloombergian limitations on unhealthy food and drink are taking off in Latin America:\n\nSince 2012, Peru, Uruguay and Costa Rica have banned junk food from public schools. Ecuador recently mandated a nutritional label system inspired by a traffic light, in which warnings of high salt, sugar and fat content are placed on red circles; lower levels will be indicated on yellow or green circles. Industrial food makers in Ecuador will also be barred from using images of animal characters, cartoon personalities or celebrities to promote products high in salt, sugar or fat. In October, Mexico\u2019s congress passed a special tax of 8% on packaged foods like potato chips, as well as a per-liter tax of one peso, or about eight U.S. cents, on sugary beverages. The beverage tax is widely seen as the most significant attempt yet to curb sugary-drink intake in a large country, given that Mexico is the Coca-Cola Co.\u2019s second-biggest market in the world by volume sales. Colombia\u2019s health minister has already suggested applying a sugary-beverage tax in his country.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Latin America: The government of the United Arab Emirates has also said it will ban large-sized sodas.\n\nSee also:\n\nJunk Food Feels the Heat in Latin America \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "When Michael Bloomberg finishes his tenure as Mayor of New York City next week, he can rest assured that his failed attempt to limit sales of sugary drinks is being taken up abroad.", "title": "After Bloomberg, Latin America Steps Up in War on Junk Food", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/27/latin-america-steps-up-where-bloomberg-failed/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CI439_DIET_S_G_20131208185804.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "After Bloomberg, Latin America Steps Up in War on Junk Food", "description": "When Michael Bloomberg finishes his tenure as Mayor of New York City next week, he can rest assured that his failed attempt to limit sales of sugary drinks is being taken up abroad.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "When Michael Bloomberg finishes his tenure as Mayor of New York City next week, he can rest assured that his failed attempt to limit sales of sugary drinks is being taken up abroad.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-12-28T00:28:52-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/27/latin-america-steps-up-where-bloomberg-failed/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-3329", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "When Michael Bloomberg finishes his tenure as Mayor of New York City next week, he can rest assured that his failed attempt to limit sales of sugary drinks is being taken up abroad.", "title": "After Bloomberg, Latin America Steps Up in War on Junk Food", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/27/latin-america-steps-up-where-bloomberg-failed/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CI439_DIET_S_G_20131208185804.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-3329", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-28T00:45:49-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeeb8\"", "article_summary": "And it\u2019s not just Latin America: The government of the United Arab Emirates has also said it will ban large-sized sodas.\nSee also:Junk Food Feels the Heat in Latin America \u2013 WSJ\nIndustrial food makers in Ecuador will also be barred from using images of animal characters, cartoon personalities or celebrities to promote products high in salt, sugar or fat.\nBloombergWhen Michael Bloomberg ends his tenure as mayor of New York City next week, he\u2019ll have many lasting legacies to celebrate.\nBut he\u2019ll also go out with the taste of defeat still lingering: Just five months earlier, his attempt to outlaw the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues was overturned in the courts."}
