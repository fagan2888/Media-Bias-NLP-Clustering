1. White House declares new HealthCare.gov a success

Following a frenzied race to fix the site, the Obama administration declared victory on Sunday in its effort to get HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of users.

3. U.S. and Afghanistan negotiations may lead to zero troop option

An increasing stalemate between the U.S. and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai has made the prospect of keeping no troops in Afghanistan after 2014, a "zero option," more realistic than the White House anticipated. After its longest war in history, the U.S. may have to dismantle the bulk of its counterterrorism infrastructure there and abandon Afghanistan's security forces. A wholesale withdrawal would also shut down ­foreign aid and sharply limit any U.S. diplomatic presence. The uncertainty over the long-term security deal has the potential to be particularly damaging on the eve of Afghanistan's presidential election, scheduled to take place next spring.
