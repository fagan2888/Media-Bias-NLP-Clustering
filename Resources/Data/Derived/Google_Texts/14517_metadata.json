The same view looking southeast from Michigan Street and Colfax Avenue shows a much different scene: Most of those storefronts are gone, replaced with the modernistic glass box 1st Source Center/DoubleTree by Hilton complex.\n\nThat\u2019s just one scene in \u201cSouth Bend Then and Now: Part II,\u201d a photographic exhibit currently on view at Studebaker National Museum.\n\nThe exhibit pairs historical images from the museum\u2019s archives with current photos showing the same local spots.\n\nIn some pairings the change is dramatic. In others, hardly anything has changed.\n\nA 1962 Studebaker promotional photo showing a female model in a Grand Turismo was taken outside the front door of LeMans Hall at Saint Mary\u2019s College. A contemporary photo, also showing a female model in a Grand Turismo, shows the same view of the campus.\n\nAnyone who wants a glimpse of South Bend\u2019s history will appreciate the exhibit.\n\nA 1950 aerial photo shows the massive Studebaker automotive plant, covering 100 acres, at full production. The \u201cnow\u201d view shows only one former Studebaker production building and the former administration building still standing, while new Ignition Park structures cover part of that landscape.\n\nSome other current and former area landmarks showcased in the photos include the JMS Building, the Oddfellows Building, the Sample Street Bridge and \u201cThe Hole\u201d that existed for years where the 1st Source Center eventually was built.\n\nmfosmoe@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6329\n\n@mfosmoe\n\nIf you go\n\n\u201cSouth Bend Then and Now: Part II\u201d photo exhibit continues through May 30 at Studebaker National Museum, 201 S.
