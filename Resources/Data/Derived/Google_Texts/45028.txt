Enthusiastic San Francisco Giants baseball fans gathered at Antonioâ€™s Nut House in Palo Alto on Oct. 28 to watch the Giants play the Kansas City Royals in Game 6 of the World Series.

Giants starter Jake Peavy was knocked out of the game early and the Giants offense struggled to get anything going against Royals starter Yordano Ventura and company. The Giants were waxed 10-0, forcing a decisive Game 7. The series is tied 3-3. Tim Hudson will take the hill Oct. 29 against former Stanford pitcher Jeremy Guthrie at 5:07 p.m. Pacific.
