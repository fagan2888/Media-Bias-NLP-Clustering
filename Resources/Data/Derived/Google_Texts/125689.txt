The Edmonton Oilers won the Connor McDavid sweepstakes Saturday night in the NHL draft lottery and the Avalanche retained the 10th pick.

With its fourth No. 1 pick in the last six years, Edmonton will undoubtedly select McDavid, who is viewed as a once-a-decade impact player, at the June 26-27 draft in Florida. The Oilers had a 11.5 percent chance to win the lottery, behind Buffalo (20 percent) and Arizona (13.5). The Sabres and Coyotes will pick second and third, respectively.

The Avalanche had a 3.5 percent chance to pick No. 1, among the 14 non-playoff teams. Plenty of impact players will likely be available at No. 10, including North American defensemen Ivan Provorov, Jakub Zboril, Thomas Chabot and Jeremy Roy of the Canadian Hockey Leagueâ€™s major-junior system, and Zachary Werenski of the University of Michigan.

The top-rated North American defenseman is Noah Hanifin of Boston College, but the freshman will likely be among the top five picks.

Buffalo will likely select Boston University center Jack Eichel with the No. 2 pick, and Arizona will get an outstanding player in Hanifan or major-junior center Dylan Strome.
