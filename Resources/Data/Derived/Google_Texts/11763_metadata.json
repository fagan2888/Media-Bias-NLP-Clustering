His son got sick. Like many in Maine\u2019s coastal fishing communities, he begrudgingly accepted insurance offered to his family through the Affordable Care Act and has come to rely on a federal discount to keep it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, that support may disappear for tens of thousands of families in Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nThose states, and more than 30 others, face that threat if the US Supreme Court rules against the administration in a pending decision that could upend a major piece of President Obama\u2019s health care law, cutting subsidies to about 7.5 million people.\n\nMore than 60,000 people in Maine would lose their tax credits next year and 50,000 would wind up uninsured, according to estimates from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. A negative ruling would gut subsidies for 44,000 people in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how they can just take it away,\u201d said Brown, 37, who also works at a nearby lobster storage facility. He worries about losing the $460 monthly federal tax subsidy for himself and two children. \u201cI\u2019d have to pick up another job or do something else,\u201d he said.\n\nThe challenge that the high court heard this month comes down to one technical detail: whether Congress meant to permit federal subsidies only in states that set up their own online health care exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court appears divided along ideological lines, leaving two potential swing votes from Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Their leanings on this case remain a mystery.\n\nThe court is expected to deliver its decision by June.\n\nIf it decides against the Obama administration, the subsidies would be illegal in the 34 states where insurance is offered through the federal government\u2019s exchange. Those states participate in the federal exchange because officials could not make their own state exchanges work or they refused to create their own.\n\nMaine, a rural state with the third-highest rate of enrollment in the health program, illustrates the weight of the court\u2019s decision and the political toll it could take on Republicans.\n\nGovernor Paul LePage, a Republican who opposes the Affordable Care Act, has not proposed any fallback plan if the federal assistance for lower- and middle-class residents ends. That could hurt numerous self-employed workers and an array of families scattered across Maine\u2019s sparse communities.\n\nIt would have a particular effect on the state\u2019s iconic fishermen and lobster haulers, who tend to be self-employed, work in the country\u2019s second-deadliest industry, and may otherwise skip insurance.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Maine residents who enroll in marketplace plans qualify for a tax credit, which averages $337 a month.\n\n\u201cIf the subsidy goes away, the whole thing collapses,\u201d said Deb Shields, outreach and enrollment coordinator at Eastport Health Care, a clinic that sits off a two-lane road past white steeples and houses dating to the 1700s. A poster in the office shows a lobsterman and his son, with the words, \u201cWho\u2019s Counting On You To Stay Healthy?\u201d\n\nAdvocates worry that healthy enrollees will drop their coverage without the subsidy, sticking the health insurance plans with a higher percentage of sick people. That would raise the cost and make coverage less affordable, the opposite of the law\u2019s intention.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, was enacted in 2010 and GOP lawmakers have worked to kill it since. They object to the cost and consider it governmental overreach. But if the law gets uprooted without a viable replacement, Republicans could face a backlash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re for Obamacare or not; fix it,\u201d said David Cousens, president of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association. \u201cIf this whole thing goes down the toilet, I think [Republicans] will get voted out.\u201d\n\nCousens\u2019 weather-beaten face reveals the decades he has spent on the windy waters. His wife uses the catch to make award-winning lobster rolls.\n\nA political independent who supports the law, Cousens enrolled in the marketplace and receives several hundred dollars a month in subsidies. So do his three sons, who followed their father into the profession and catch lobsters miles from Justice Roberts\u2019s summer home on Hupper Island.\n\nMichael C. York for The Boston Globe Braden Alley in Jonesport, Maine.\n\nCousens said he recently approached LePage about the issue, but the governor brushed off concerns. His office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhen the current Supreme Court case started moving through the courts last year, LePage warned that Maine could not assume the cost of the subsidies.\n\nA spokesman for Maine Insurance Superintendent Eric Cioppa said the department is researching options used in other states.\n\nThe state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, who often clashes with LePage, signed onto a Supreme Court brief last month with 21 states and the District of Columbia siding with the administration. The states warned that any change to the current system \u201cwould upend the bargain that states thought they had struck.\u201d\n\nMaine\u2019s sheer pace of enrollment has made the health program difficult to ignore.\n\nUS Representative Bruce Poliquin, whose district includes Pembroke, was one of three Republicans in February who voted against the law\u2019s repeal. He said he opposed the program but wanted to find a replacement first.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who has sought to reform the law, said Congress would need to come up with an interim plan. \u201cWe simply would be irresponsible to let the insurance of millions of Americans lapse,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nBut few lawmakers are sure how to fix it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the solution is,\u201d said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who backs the law. \u201cWe have people who for the first time have been able to get coverage, and it could be ripped out from under them.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire faces a similar dilemma, although the state has a partnership with the federal government that grants it more control over plans offered on the marketplace.\n\nGovernor Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire has said she would push the Legislature to let the state set up its own exchange. But even if that is politically workable, the process would be complicated and time-consuming. Vermont and Massachusetts slogged through months of mishaps before their exchanges came close to functioning normally.\n\nMaine Community Health Options, a health insurance co-op and major provider in the marketplace, is working with legislators on a bill that would allow the state to establish the exchange but contract with the federal government for the technical assistance it already receives. Three other states use a similar setup.\n\n\u201cThat is one we have within our control,\u201d said Kevin Lewis, the co-op\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nIt is unclear whether that plan would pass Supreme Court scrutiny.\n\nCongress could react to the ruling by changing the language of the law, but that would require a bipartisan deal in a session already marred by brinkmanship.\n\nFrustrations continue to exist with the law, particularly in Maine\u2019s coastal villages still decked in snow.\n\nA crowd of fishermen showed up at the Thirsty Moose Caf\u00e9 in Machias on a recent evening for their weekly pool league. Fish paintings lined the wall and a moose head eyed the bar.\n\nSome of the regulars did not qualify for subsidies because the lobster season had gone well, so they opted to pay the penalty for no insurance. Others bemoaned the government\u2019s control over their decisions.\n\n\u201cIt should be a preference,\u201d said Braden Alley, a 39-year-old lobstermen who could not remember his last visit to a doctor.\n\nAlley\u2019s wife, Dani, placed her hands over her cue stick and smiled. She signed the couple up last month for discounted insurance through the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t care if we had anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did. Plus, you don\u2019t have to pay much.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2088913093", "eomportal-id": 500703, "description": "Maine\u2019s fisherman are among the thousands who could lose insurance if the Supreme Court rules against the administration in a pending decision that could upend the federal health care law and leave more than 7 million people without coverage.
