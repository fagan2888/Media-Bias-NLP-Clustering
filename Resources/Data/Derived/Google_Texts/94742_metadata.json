You go to your local urgent care clinic, or doctor\u2019s office, and you\u2019re seen by a physician assistant (PA), who examines you, says everything is structurally intact, and you should use ice, elevate your leg and take some ibuprofen for the pain.\n\nWhat the PA said makes sense, but shouldn\u2019t you see \u2014 you know \u2014 the doctor?\n\nWell, maybe not. While it seems to make sense to always ask for an expert, there can be some downsides. It can take months to get an appointment with a doctor, or cost more to see them versus a PA or nurse practitioner (NP). Also, with the holidays approaching, it\u2019s prime season for senior physicians to be away, with the rest of the health care team pitching in. So when is it fine to see someone besides the doctor for your medical care? And when should you avoid it?\n\nWell, who else might you see at a medical clinic? In addition to a doctor, you could see a PA or NP. If you haven\u2019t seen one yet, you will. Medicine is increasingly becoming a team sport, requiring well-synchronized \u201cpit crews\u201c rather than isolated physicians. In Massachusetts, for instance, there are already close to 8,000 NPs and over 2,000 PAs and those numbers are rising to fill a growing shortage in primary care. A 2013 study estimates that Massachusetts will need 725 more primary care providers by 2030.\n\nI asked a few NPs and PAs \u2014 each with at least five years of clinical experience, and some with more than 30 \u2014 what they think patients should know about all this. They agreed that it\u2019s best to focus on experience rather than the degree behind the name. An NP with three decades of experience may be more knowledgeable than an MD who just finished their residency \u2014 and I say that as someone who is just about to finish residency.\n\nOne of those NPs with over 30 years experience is Lynne Crawford, a primary care NP at Cambridge Health Alliance. She phrased it this way: \u201cIf you see someone and you\u2019re uncomfortable with the encounter, it might be your rapport with them rather than the degree behind their name.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s likely because a good medical provider possesses more than book knowledge. Another primary care NP at Cambridge Health Alliance and Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Deidre Allesio, recommended looking for \u201cthe intangibles.\u201d Things like how well they communicate, how well and how fully they answer questions, who they turn to for further guidance and whether they focus on a particular health issue or the population as a whole.\n\nJoanna Gross, an ear, nose and throat PA at Cambridge Health Alliance, added: \u201cYou have to trust your gut and feel like you have a good rapport with that person to trust them with your care,\u201d\n\nClearly, no one knows everything about every specialty. It takes experience for the provider to learn the line of when they\u2019re over their head and need to refer a patient to a specialist. \u201cMy doctors trust me \u2014 I\u2019m not going to do something that\u2019s out of my league and they feel confident that I know when I\u2019m in over my head,\u201d Gross said. \u201cYou have to have that level of humility and ability to say what is the extent of my knowledge and my practice and when do I need to call for help.\u201d\n\nThe key is collaboration, according to Marcos Pienasola, an emergency room PA at MetroWest Health Center in Framingham. \u201cIf a patient is pretty sick, I\u2019ll start the initial workup,\u201d he described. \u201cI\u2019ll get a couple lines, some IV fluids, then I\u2019ll run the case by an attending [physician].\u201d\n\nBut not everyone agrees the expanding practice of NPs and PAs is a good thing. Some physician organizations would like to restrict the scope of practice for NPs and PAs until research proves their care is high quality. The American Medical Association accepts them practicing as part of a team as long as a physician is always at the helm.\n\nThese organizations complain that, unlike doctors, NPs and PAs do not do a residency program after they graduate, so they start with on-the-job training. That might mean a newly minted graduate may have only a few weeks experience in any particular clinical area under their belt, as The New York Times noted in an article on PAs last year.\n\nThese different roles and responsibilities reflect the fact that PAs and NPs don\u2019t go through as much formal training as MDs. Most physicians do an undergraduate degree, medical school, then complete a residency of at least three years where they practice as a doctor under the supervision of more senior physicians. PAs and NPs can enter practice under the supervision of a doctor immediately after graduating from their respective training programs, both of which are shorter than the four years physicians spend in medical school.\n\nYou might think that this proves that you should always ask to see the doctor, but that\u2019s not borne out by the evidence. In fact, most studies suggest that the care you get from NPs or PAs is indistinguishable from physician care in the outpatient setting, in the hospital and possibly in the intensive care unit and emergency room, though there is less data in the latter two settings.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you might be better off seeing an NP or PA. In one study, the patients who saw NPs in an outpatient clinic said they were more satisfied compared to those seeing physicians, perhaps in part because their visits with NPs were usually longer.\n\nNPs also tend to have more of a focus on education. They can receive extra certification to be a nurse educator for conditions like diabetes or asthma. That educational component is also what drives some people to the profession. \u201cMy identity is a nurse \u2014 I\u2019m an advanced practice nurse \u2014 but I will always be a nurse,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nSeeing the PA or NP can also streamline your care. For example, a CAT scan, X-rays or even some small procedures can be scheduled after a visit with a mid-level provider, helping you save months waiting to see a physician specialist.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the case in every state, unfortunately, because every state has different regulations for NPs and PAs that require different levels of physician supervision. In Massachusetts, both have a \u201cphysician supervisor\u201d that oversees aspects of their work. Yet, while there are very few things that a PA or NP strictly cannot do, how much autonomy they have varies based on the physician supervising them and even from hospital to hospital.\n\nFor PAs in Massachusetts, the scope of their practice is determined by their supervising physician, who does not need to be physically present, only \u201cavailable for consultation,\u201d during clinical encounters. Those competencies are reviewed every couple of years as the PA gets re-credentialed.\n\nNPs with prescribing authority in this state need an official physician to supervise them but have an independent license to practice. In fact, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, Massachusetts is the only state in the region to place such restrictions on NPs.\n\nSo regardless of which provider you see, the question may not be: \u201cshould I see the doctor?\u201d but \u201cwhen should I get a second opinion?\u201d And that second opinion could be with a doctor, or a more experienced NP or PA.\n\nWith any practitioner, you should consider a second opinion whenever you feel one is necessary. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s a patient\u2019s right to see an MD,\u201d Pienasola, the emergency room PA told me. \u201cIn the emergency department there is no real barrier to that.\u201d\n\nJerome Groopman, a cancer specialist and writer, gave his suggestions for when to seek a second opinion in an interview with WebMD:\n\nAny time you have a very serious or life-threatening disease:\n\n\u2022 where the treatment is very risky or toxic;\n\n\u2022 where the diagnosis is not clear, the treatment is experimental, or there is no established consensus or Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment;\n\n\u2022 if you\u2019re considering participating in a trial for a new drug;\n\n\u2022 if you\u2019re considering some new experimental approach or a procedure that involves using experimental instruments or devices.\n\nSeeking a second opinion can feel awkward because you might worry you\u2019re questioning the authority of the doctor, PA or NP. Don\u2019t worry, second opinions are common and every provider knows to expect patients will ask for them. The Center for Advancing Health has some suggestions for what you can say to politely broach the topic with your provider:\n\n\u2022 \u201cBefore we start treatment, I\u2019d like to get a second opinion. Will you help me with that?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cI think that I\u2019d like to talk with another provider to be sure that I have all my bases covered.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou know, this is a big decision for me, and I would like to talk with another expert or two so that I feel completely confident in our treatment plan.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy family insists that I get the opinions of a number of specialists before moving forward.\u201d\n\nHopefully by now your knee feels better after the ice and rest. Next time you\u2019re at the doctor\u2019s office, it might just save you time, money and energy to see the PA or NP rather than wait months to see the doctor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In one study, the patients who saw nurse practitioners in an outpatient clinic said they were more satisfied compared to those seeing physicians.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "In one study, the patients who saw nurse practitioners in an outpatient clinic said they were more satisfied compared to those seeing physicians.", "title": "When It\u2019s OK To See A Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant \u2014 And When It\u2019s Not", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/12/pa-np-care", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/08/doctorstethescope-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/12/pa-np-care", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/08/doctorstethescope-620x413.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "When It's OK To See A Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant -- And When It's Not"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-15", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 08:05:03 -0500"}, "article_summary": "When It\u2019s OK To See A Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant \u2014 And When It\u2019s NotBy Dr. David ScalesLet\u2019s say you hurt your knee doing your best Tom Brady impression playing flag football.\nAlso, with the holidays approaching, it\u2019s prime season for senior physicians to be away, with the rest of the health care team pitching in.\n\u201cMy identity is a nurse \u2014 I\u2019m an advanced practice nurse \u2014 but I will always be a nurse,\u201d Crawford said.\nIt can take months to get an appointment with a doctor, or cost more to see them versus a PA or nurse practitioner (NP).\nSeeking a second opinion can feel awkward because you might worry you\u2019re questioning the authority of the doctor, PA or NP."}
