Bobby Jindal\u2019s (R) refusal to consider the policy. By all appearances, the Republican made a plainly political decision without regard for the state\u2019s needs: Jindal wanted to be president (yes, of the United States), so he took a firm stand against \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nLouisiana\u2019s current governor, Democrat John Bel Edwards, ran on a platform of Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act, won his election fairly easily, and immediately adopted the policy. The Times-Picayune in New Orleans reported yesterday that the governor went directly to the legislature to explain why this was the smart move for Louisiana.\n\nMedicaid expansion is estimated to save Louisiana $677 million over the next five years and more than $1 billion over the next decade, Department of Health and Hospitals officials told Senate Health and Welfare Committee members Monday (April 18). The cost estimates came after Gov. John Bel Edwards testified before the committee about his decision to expand Medicaid eligibility to about 375,000 people between July 1 and June 30, 2017. DHH officials will make an effort in the coming weeks to educate legislators about the benefits of Medicaid expansion and what they said was misinformation given to the Legislature to justify not expanding Medicaid under former Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\n\u201cI believe the folks in the prior administration who said we couldn\u2019t afford Medicaid expansion, they took the worst case scenario on every variable,\u201d Edwards told lawmakers in the GOP-led legislature. \u201cIf you look at what we\u2019re doing in light of experience in other states \u2026 we know we\u2019re going to save money.\u201d\n\nAnd he knows this because it\u2019s true.\n\nI can appreciate why this may seem a little counter-intuitive. Ordinarily, when state policymakers recommend expanding benefits to struggling families, critics will respond, \u201cWe\u2019d like to help, but we can\u2019t afford it and we\u2019re not willing to raise taxes.\u201d\n\nBut Medicaid expansion is one of those policies in which states get to do both: participating states receive federal funds to implement the program, while expanding coverage for low-income families who would otherwise go uninsured. At the same time, hospitals\u2019 finances are strengthened as medical facilities see fewer patients who can\u2019t pay their bills.\n\nSince implementation of the Affordable Care Act began, how many states have found Medicaid expansion hurt state budgets? None. Republicans will be quick to argue that someday, maybe, in the future, the fiscal challenges will become more acute, but given pre-ACA reimbursement rates, there\u2019s no reason to believe they\u2019re correct.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly why every governor with access to a calculator \u2013 including plenty of red-state Republicans \u2013 have found the arithmetic undeniable.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Louisiana really is having an \"elections have consequences\" moment right now.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/louisiana-ready-make-big-gains-through-medicaid-expansion", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Louisiana really is having an \"elections have consequences\" moment right now.", "title": "Louisiana ready to make big gains through Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/louisiana-ready-make-big-gains-through-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_728799349823.jpg?itok=MCh8gSGg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/louisiana-ready-make-big-gains-through-medicaid-expansion", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap_728799349823.jpg?itok=_voWYRJc", "height": 553}, "title": "Louisiana ready to make big gains through Medicaid expansion", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Louisiana really is having an \"elections have consequences\" moment right now."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-19T10:05:54-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Louisiana ready to make big gains through Medicaid expansion", "tags": "health,health-care-reform,louisiana,medicaid,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/19/2016 10:05:54 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/louisiana-ready-make-big-gains-through-medicaid-expansion"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Louisiana really is having an \"elections have consequences\" moment right now.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Louisiana, Medicaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8e3\"", "article_summary": "Few states need Medicaid expansion more than Louisiana, which made it all the more difficult to justify former Gov.\nSince implementation of the Affordable Care Act began, how many states have found Medicaid expansion hurt state budgets?\nDHH officials will make an effort in the coming weeks to educate legislators about the benefits of Medicaid expansion and what they said was misinformation given to the Legislature to justify not expanding Medicaid under former Gov.\n\u201cI believe the folks in the prior administration who said we couldn\u2019t afford Medicaid expansion, they took the worst case scenario on every variable,\u201d Edwards told lawmakers in the GOP-led legislature.\nMedicaid expansion is estimated to save Louisiana $677 million over the next five years and more than $1 billion over the next decade, Department of Health and Hospitals officials told Senate Health and Welfare Committee members Monday (April 18)."}
