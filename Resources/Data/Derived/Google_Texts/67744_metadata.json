The extraordinary degree of that in this presidential campaign is the consequence of the range of extremism in the current field. On the far left is Bernie Sanders, a geriatric, dithering, unabashed socialist. On the far who-knows-what is Donald Trump, a churlish, egomaniacal demagogue with a poor grasp of public policy.\n\nHow about a dose of political reality? Let\u2019s start with the pretense that anyone, as president (or anything else), is going to reinvent fundamental political dynamics. Not going to happen. \u201cWe the people\u201d as a unified collective doesn\u2019t exist. Different people want different things from government. People on the left want more of it, especially for their \u201centitlement\u201d programs. Those on the right want less of it, except for national defense.\n\nThis is the great public divide, reflected in congressional gridlock. The low public approval rating of Congress is misleading. Democrats disapprove of congressional Republicans standing in the way of their legislative agenda and vice versa for Republicans. If one party were to have its own way, the approval rating of Congress would soar as its coalition would be overjoyed at the outcome.\n\nEven with a majority in Congress, Republicans haven\u2019t \u201cbetrayed\u201d their party\u2019s base. Given the power of the presidential veto and the two-thirds majority of Congress required to override it, a rollback of Obamacare or other major Democrat victories wasn\u2019t possible. The best Republicans could do was stymie further damage, which they\u2019ve done.\n\nOf the nation\u2019s 435 congressional districts in the House, only about 10 percent are truly competitive. The rest, year in and year out, are solidly the property of either Democrats or Republicans. And the agenda of their respective electoral coalitions will be pursued by those they elect. Unaffiliated voters can hop on one bandwagon or the other, cast a futile vote for a minor party, or not bother voting at all. We have a two-party system, which will continue.\n\nThe so-called party \u201cestablishments\u201d reflect the will of their respective mainstreams. Sanders may thrill the Democrats\u2019 radical left-wing faction but Hillary Clinton will win the nomination as the choice of its liberal mainstream. The Freedom Caucus is a doctrinaire ultra-conservative faction of Republicans in the House, comprised of members who are elected in solidly conservative districts. So they can afford to be uncompromising, which is fine with their constituents.\n\nBut they account for less than a fifth of the 246 House Republicans. They have some influence, but are too few to run the show. In most districts, constituents elected right-center Republicans. If they\u2019re the \u201cestablishment\u201d then so are the majority of Republican voters that put them there.\n\nPolitical parties that aspire to majority status, the locus of power in any legislature, will necessarily include an ideological mix. For example, Rep. Diana DeGette represents Denver, a Democrat stronghold. A Republican can\u2019t win there. That district routinely elects ultra-liberals. Rep. Doug Lamborn in Colorado Springs is a staunch conservative, a good fit for his Republican constituents, in a seat that Democrats can\u2019t win. I\u2019m glad to have Lamborn in my party, but his faction of the Republican coalition, including the Freedom Caucus, can\u2019t be the tail that wags the dog.\n\nThis is politics. It\u2019s practiced similarly and universally among nations. The term \u201cestablishment\u201d has become an overly broad generalization, a meaningless clich\u00e9, a self-indulgent, simplistic epithet employed by media opportunists, firebrands and angry and frustrated outliers on the extremes of left and right to stigmatize those who understand and are constrained by the legislative process and stubborn political realities.\n\nSure, the nature of the democratic process is frustrating. Therefore, what?\n\nIn my next, related column, I\u2019ll deal with populist delusions about lobbyists and the influence of money in politics.\n\nMike Rosen is a KOA News Radio personality.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: 2016 presidential election will not \u201creinvent\u201d politics", "title": "Rosen: 2016 presidential election will not \u201creinvent\u201d politics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/01/rosen-2016-presidential-election-will-not-reinvent-politics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__DP_NGPS_Export20160403_Z00_OP03C_ROSENp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__DP_NGPS_Export20160403_Z00_OP03C_ROSENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-01T11:48:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:26:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Even with a majority in Congress, Republicans haven\u2019t \u201cbetrayed\u201d their party\u2019s base.\nLet\u2019s start with the pretense that anyone, as president (or anything else), is going to reinvent fundamental political dynamics.\nThe extraordinary degree of that in this presidential campaign is the consequence of the range of extremism in the current field.\nIn my next, related column, I\u2019ll deal with populist delusions about lobbyists and the influence of money in politics.\nDemocrats disapprove of congressional Republicans standing in the way of their legislative agenda and vice versa for Republicans."}
