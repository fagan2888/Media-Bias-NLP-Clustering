Many of our colleagues in the HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis fields have both personal and professional commitments to their work, formed by diverse life experiences that continue to inspire them. Recently, we visited with our colleague Ms. Corinna Dan, R.N., M.P.H., who serves as Viral Hepatitis Policy Advisor in the HHS Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy. During our conversation, she reflected on her prior experience, including serving as the Adult Viral Hepatitis Prevention Coordinator for the Chicago Department of Public Health. Watch Corinna’s reflection below.

Corinna’s current work is focused on engaging both federal and non-federal partners in implementation of the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, which was updated and released earlier this year. To educate others about the Viral Hepatitis Action Plan, Corinna also shared with us information on the Action Plan. Please watch and share these videos.
