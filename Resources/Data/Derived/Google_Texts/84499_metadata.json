In states where filings were unavailable, Kaiser gathered data from tables released by state insurance departments. The overall picture could change as more premium data become available, notes Kaiser.\n\n\u201cThere is variation, but so far, premium increases in year two of the (ACA) are generally modest,\u201d said Drew Altman, Kaiser\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \u201cDouble digit premium increases in this market were not uncommon in the past,\u201d Altman added.\n\nACA insurance subsidies in limbo after federal courts issue conflicting rulings\n\nPremium adjustments were expected, according to the report, because in 2013 insurers had difficulty predicting subscriber demographics and gauging risk, but are now able to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe average decrease in premiums for the cost silver plan points to competitive forces, but competition can also result in \u201csignificant volatility,\u201d said the KFF study. As a result, people who chose low-premium plans for 2014 may find that the same low-cost option is not available in 2015.\n\nThe silver plan is closely watched because it is used as a benchmark to set tax credit subsidies, says the study. If the decline in premiums is observed across the county, the federal government could end up paying less for tax credit subsidies than initially expected.\n\nThe full report, Analysis of 2015 Premium Changes in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplaces, is available online.\n\nRelated:\n\nMost employers could shift healthcare coverage to exchanges by 2020, report\n\nACA enrollees opt for high-deductible plans on healthcare", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Premiums for the silver insurance premium plan that is used to benchmark tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will fall by an average .8% in 2015, while premiums for the lowest-cost bronze option will increase by an average of 3.3%.", "Description": "Premiums for the silver insurance premium plan that is used to benchmark tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will fall by an average .8% in 2015, while premiums for the lowest-cost bronze option will increase by an average of 3.3%.", "og": {"url": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/affordable-care-act/aca-exchanges-silver-premiums-decrease-average-8-", "image": "http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/HealthCare/2014/09/09/c6cc0522-a740-41b0-8518-f1b2a476f876/kaiser_chartfinal.jpg", "site_name": "Medical Economics", "description": "Courtesy of Kaiser Family Foundation.Premiums for the silver insurance premium plan that is used to benchmark tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will fall by an average .8% in 2015, ac", "title": "ACA exchanges\u2019 silver premiums decrease an average .8% for 2015"}, "DC.identifier": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/node/387293", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2014-09-09", "last-modified": "Wed, 10 September 2014 17:03:05 GMT", "DC.creator": "Lisa Smith", "DC.source": "Medical Economics eConsult", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "Affordable Care Act, Bronze Plan, Department of Health and Human Services, exchanges, Health and Human Services, healthcare exchanges, healthcare.gov, HHS, Kaiser Family Foundation, marketplace, Modern Medicine Feature Articles, premiums, Silver Plan, Practice Management", "emsContentType": "ACA exchanges\u2019 silver premiums decrease an average .8% for 2015", "DC.title": "ACA exchanges\u2019 silver premiums decrease an average .8% for 2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd017b\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, premiums for the lowest-cost bronze option available through the ACA\u2019s healthcare exchanges will increase by an average of 3.3%.\nCourtesy of Kaiser Family Foundation.Premiums for the silver insurance premium plan that is used to benchmark tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will fall by an average .8% in 2015, according to a new study.\nThe average decrease in premiums for the cost silver plan points to competitive forces, but competition can also result in \u201csignificant volatility,\u201d said the KFF study.\nThe overall picture could change as more premium data become available, notes Kaiser.\nThe full report, Analysis of 2015 Premium Changes in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplaces, is available online."}
