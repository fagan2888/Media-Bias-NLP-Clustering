It didn\u2019t hit me that I was potentially worse off than I\u2019d thought until about the seven-mile mark. I found myself panting and gnashing my way up a trio of killer hills, and that with nearly 20 miles left to power through somehow.\n\nA male runner\u2014who\u2019d passed me going up the second of three steep hills that opened the course\u2014lost speed on a downhill stretch, allowing me to draw alongside him. To engage or not to engage? At first, I thought not. He was the kind of guy I normally would have steered clear of \u2013 slightly shorter than me, which can be an issue for men, perfectly fit, and outfitted in the perfect workout gear. But I was about a quarter of the way into what was going to be a long morning, and I let the male runner, Michael, strike up a conversation with me. I told him I was trying to qualify to run the Boston Marathon in 2014, and he looked at me doubtfully.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really fast,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d qualified for \u2013 and run \u2013 Boston several times, as he was well into his personal goal to run a marathon in every state. He\u2019d also flown himself to a marathon in Drakes Well, Pennsylvania, in his own private plane, a detail that has no bearing on this story but says a lot about why I love runners. They\u2019ve got a self-reliant stubborn streak I admire, except when I\u2019m dealing with the situations my own stubbornness gets me into \u2013 like this marathon.\n\nMichael asked about my training history.\n\n\u201cI ran 20,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAround the fourth of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the most you\u2019ve run since then?\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen.\u201d\n\nHe just nodded, his face expressionless. I\u2019d meant to run more, train harder. I really had. I\u2019d been a daily runner for 14 years. But when I impulsively chose to try for Boston in a show of solidarity with my former hometown in the wake of the bombing, I\u2019d never run more than eight miles at a time.\n\nI was living in Brooklyn, and I hadn\u2019t counted on how much I would struggle against the heat and humidity in my training that summer. I\u2019d wake up at 6 a.m. to run. It was 80 degrees. I\u2019d wait until 9 p.m. to run, straining my eyes as I panted through the streets of my neighborhood, trying to avoid catching my foot on a bubbled stretch of pavement, and it was still 80 degrees.\n\nI was also pushing myself hard to finish a first draft of the memoir I\u2019d sold earlier in the year. Finally, it hit me one day. In order to make the qualifying time, which for my age group, they were estimating at three hours and 20 minutes that year, I was going to have to train much harder.\n\nI can either finish this book or qualify for Boston, I thought.\n\nI tried to be proud that I would finish my first marathon and write my first book of my own in the same year, but I\u2019m far too competitive and too much of a perfectionist to fall for soggy pep talks like that. Still, I was determined to do both. I kept writing. I kept running.\n\nIt was a hard spring and summer. My memoir was about my painful relationship with my dad, and how it had played out in my relationships with men over the years, and in order to write it, I\u2019d had to pick off each and every scab of my life, one by one. And I\u2019d done so without the luxury of my former vices to distract me. In the past, I\u2019d salved both the wounds themselves and my exploration of such painful subjects \u2013 whether in therapy or in prose \u2013 with a drink. Or a fling. Or my favorite drug of all \u2013 a staggering load of professional deadlines and self-imposed personal writing goals. Now, all I had was my book.\n\nI was sticking with mineral water and tea for the duration of the writing. I\u2019d just had my heart broken, so I was skirting the neighborhood bars and cafes where I might meet someone new. And as far as my writing went, there was nothing but my book, which was really just me, and my relationship with my dad, laid bare on the page. Every time I wanted to look away, I had no choice but to look, and to keep looking until I untangled whatever emotional mystery had plagued me and put it into some kind of order \u2013 and story \u2013 that would hopefully be resonant to readers.\n\nBy late August, I\u2019d finished a draft of my memoir that came in at a whopping 1,058 pages. I was elated. And completely overwhelmed. My agent forbade me to hand in the draft to my publisher until I got it down to 400 pages, ideally below. I\u2019d been hired to ghostwrite a book for a new client based in L.A., which meant packing up once again, and at least temporarily, leaving behind my new life in Brooklyn, the site of the heartbreak, as well as the scene of the memoir immersion. Honestly, I was glad to go. All I had to do first was run one little marathon.\n\nBack on the trail, my new runner friend, Michael, had no idea what this marathon meant to me. We\u2019d just hit mile eight when he pulled out a small package of the jellies long-distance runners consume mid-race to counteract glycogen depletion.\n\n\u201cYou want some?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo, thank you, I\u2019m good,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a GU for later.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me from the corner of his eye, moving as little as possible, every inch of his body intent on conserving precious energy for his race and his time.\n\n\u201cYou want some,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me. I always eat them at mile eight to keep from bonking. Keep your GU for later. I\u2019ve got plenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said.\n\nEven stubborn me knew enough to be grateful for his kindness. I extended my hand. He shook out a half-dozen bright red jellies. I ate one, and then another, saving a few for later, even though they were heating up and squishing out nearly flat in my sweaty palm.\n\nMichael and I talked as we ran together for several more miles, passing the 10-mile marker, where my friend Cathy had strategically placed herself to cheer me on. I could tell she hadn\u2019t expected me to reach her so quickly and was impressed by my time. My dreams of Boston momentarily bloomed again, and I ran with renewed vigor. But then, somewhere in the next mile, it became clear my pace was beginning to flag, and Michael had to leave me behind in order to reach his own race goal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I wanted to show solidarity with my Boston natives, but what I got from the experience was so much greater", "author": "Sarah Tomlinson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I wanted to show solidarity with my Boston natives, but what I got from the experience was so much greater", "title": "My first marathon was agony \u2014 and the cure for my broken heart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/my_first_marathon_was_agony_and_the_cure_for_my_broken_heart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/marathon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I wanted to show solidarity with my Boston natives, but what I got from the experience was so much greater", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/marathon.jpg", "title": "My first marathon was agony \u2014 and the cure for my broken heart", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "My first marathon was agony \u2014 and the cure for my broken heart", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Boston, Boston Marathon, Life stories, Runner's Culture, Running, Writers and Writing, Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Boston, Boston Marathon, Life stories, Runner's Culture, Running, Writers and Writing, Writing, Life NewsBefore the starter\u2019s pistol, I knew I was unprepared to run my first marathon in August 2013.\nI told him I was trying to qualify to run the Boston Marathon in 2014, and he looked at me doubtfully.\nHe\u2019d qualified for \u2013 and run \u2013 Boston several times, as he was well into his personal goal to run a marathon in every state.\nI was also pushing myself hard to finish a first draft of the memoir I\u2019d sold earlier in the year.\nI\u2019d just had my heart broken, so I was skirting the neighborhood bars and cafes where I might meet someone new."}
