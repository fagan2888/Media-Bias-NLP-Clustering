The No.3 U.S. airline by traffic earned $313 million in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, profit fell 25 percent to $435 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in part because United began recording non-cash taxes. Analysts on average estimated United would earn about $420 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

A collapse in oil prices continues to hurt demand for travel from energy center Houston, one of United's principal hubs. At the same time, a surge in flights from low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines Co and Spirit Airlines Inc continues to keep U.S. domestic prices low, although rival Delta Air Lines Inc said last week that it sees average fares starting to rise.

United said that in response to soft demand, it has reduced plans to add flight capacity in 2016 by 0.5 percentage points, meaning it will grow between 1 percent and 2 percent compared to a year ago.

It nonetheless expects passenger revenue as measured against flight capacity will decline between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent in the second quarter, lower than some investors had expected. The closely watched financial measure fell 7.4 percent in the first quarter.
