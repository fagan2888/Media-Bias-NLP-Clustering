(Photo: GMMB) Story Highlights More state call centers opening to explain complex new health insurance law\n\nMany don't even know Affordable Care Act is already in place\n\nMore than half of states are letting the federal government run their exchanges\n\nThis story was originally published Sept. 2, 2013.\n\nVermont has 45,000 uninsured residents that it's trying to attract to its new health insurance exchange. Connecticut has 344,000. Washington state is targeting 1 million people without insurance.\n\nThe three states, each with its own-sized challenge, will open call centers Tuesday to help as many of these people as they can navigate a new federally mandated way to buy insurance starting Oct. 1.\n\nCalifornia and Maryland, which are operating their own exchanges, are among the states already operating call centers. Other states will roll them out during September.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured will have to buy insurance on so-called exchanges, which are online marketplaces that allow them to compare prices and choose policies. If they don't buy insurance, they will face an annual penalty on their taxes.\n\nEvery state must start offering insurance to those who don't have it on Jan. 1, 2014; enrollment begins Oct. 1.\n\nStates can build an exchange that's all their own, operate it in partnership with the federal government or simply let the federal government do it for them. The Department of Health and Human Services is required to set up an exchange if a state can't or won't do it, then will handle the consumer help functions, in part through its own call center at 1-800-318-2596.\n\nFifteen states have approval to do their own exchange, the federal government is running 27 and eight others are different versions of federal and state partnerships. Here's a look at who's running the exchanges. in each state.\n\nThe call centers have their work cut out for them explaining the confusing and still-changing details of President Obama's health care law. During September, the first question may well simply be \"huh?\" or at least \"What's an exchange?\"\n\nSlightly more than half of 1,500 people polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation in August said they didn't know enough about the law to understand how it will impact their families. And 44% of 1,000 people polled separately by Kaiser in August said they weren't even sure the law is in effect after all of the political fighting and a Supreme Court challenge that was rejected.\n\nMany people \"know something's coming, but they don't know how it works,\" says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWhen 70 new call center employees start in Vermont Tuesday, customer support manager Kelly Barnier says, she expects very basic queries, such as \"What is Vermont Health Connect? Who can use Vermont Health Connect?\" referring to the state's exchange.\n\nTo get phones ringing Tuesday, Vermont is launching what will ultimately be a $2 million TV, radio and print advertising campaign about Vermont Health Connect. Call centers will open at 1-855-899-9600 for those with questions about the new health insurance exchange. The campaign theme focuses on how the health exchange \u2014 \"a new way to find a health plan\" \u2014 is \"For Vermonters, By Vermonters\"\"\n\nOther plans:\n\n\u2022Washington Health Plan Finder, that state's exchange, has 80 new customer service representatives available starting Tuesday. They were trained for nearly a month and are prepared for questions, as well as the challenge of making people realize insurance is important before they really need it, says spokesman Michael Marchand. \"Script scenarios\" help prepare the call center reps, but he acknowledges questions and solutions will vary widely based on factors including where people live, how old they are and the hardest situations, which he says are \"multitiered family scenarios\" such as grandparents in the same household.\n\n\u2022Connecticut has 73 new call center people starting work Tuesday at 1-855-805-HEALTH (4325). Access Health CT, the state's health exchange, has been advertising since June, and new ads will highlight the call center number soon. Call center workers have received \"a ton of training,\" so they can explain the complexity of the law, how to qualify for certain programs and what tax subsidies are available, says chief marketing officer Jason Madrak.\n\nThere are plenty of questions remaining across the USA.\n\nJoe Austin, 34, works for a small business near his home in Gulfport, Miss., that doesn't offer insurance. He's an Army veteran, which makes him eligible for some medical benefits, but it can take weeks to get an appointment.\n\n\"If I have a cold or stomach bug or immediate injury, then it's to the hospital I go,\" he said in an e-mail.\n\nHe's interested in the new law but has no idea what to do. \"Where do I need to go to sign up? What are the rates?\" he asks. \"I haven't seen anything about Mississippi's at all.\"\n\nMississippi is one of the 27 state exchanges run by the federal government.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/173glY1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tiny Vermont  joins Washington and Connecticut in opening call centers to answer questions from consumers about the new health care law.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Tiny Vermont  joins Washington and Connecticut in opening call centers to answer questions from consumers about the new health care law.", "title": "State health care call centers ramp up for Oct. 1", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/02/obamacare-health-care-exchange-call-centers-ad-campaigns/2730163/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tiny Vermont  joins Washington and Connecticut in opening call centers to answer questions from consumers about the new health care law.", "title": "State health care call centers ramp up for Oct. 1", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd7916d17deb5a5253d97808713cc68e60778095/c=422-0-1501-1080&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "State health care call centers ramp up for Oct. 1", "author": "Jayne O'Donnell", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf44701f1956e42da51b0c750ac9292f1162a775/c=556-0-1367-1080/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e51a7af3fdeb1ea78d4e76d969abaa0edf04049/c=422-0-1501-1080/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b59b0a89b3f745fd4480e3fb7908a40b28a0a61a/c=241-0-1678-1080/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3ac926edb46c7dca7e8e935d3f5e119770719e5/c=7-0-1916-1080&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-09-23T19:50:47-04:00", "shorthed": "Health exchanges get set for Oct. 1", "articleid": 2730163, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9502e949ca9c5647cfa011817e4573291c0eb90/c=7-0-1916-1080/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f69af72030487d7e93411ed3bf857326bfb5af8a/c=660-0-1263-1080/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/30/1377890161000-earlyrisers.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "obamacare, health-care law, healthcare reform, health exchanges,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4fb\"", "article_summary": "Access Health CT, the state's health exchange, has been advertising since June, and new ads will highlight the call center number soon.\nThis shot from Vermont's new health exchange ad campaign shows the very different types of residents the state is targeting.\nCall centers will open at 1-855-899-9600 for those with questions about the new health insurance exchange.\nVermont has 45,000 uninsured residents that it's trying to attract to its new health insurance exchange.\nThe campaign theme focuses on how the health exchange \u2014 \"a new way to find a health plan\" \u2014 is \"For Vermonters, By Vermonters\"\"Other plans:\u2022Washington Health Plan Finder, that state's exchange, has 80 new customer service representatives available starting Tuesday."}
