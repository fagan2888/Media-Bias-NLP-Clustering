WJBF News Channel 6\u2019s Stefany Bornman has the community\u2019s reaction to the hospital\u2019s sudden closure.\n\nFor 61 years, Southern Palmetto Hospital provided healthcare services to Barnwell and surrounding counties. Now the biggest concern for patients is the long distances they will have to travel to get the medical attention they need.\n\nIt was an emotional day in Barnwell, South Carolina. During a prayer vigil, in the front parking lot of the Southern Palmetto Hospital, people came to show their support for the life-long healthcare providers that served them for so many years.\n\n\u201cThere are people, who are in this community, who were born at this hospital. There are people in this community who have seen their family members leave the world at this hospital,\u201d said Lead Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Barnwell Keith Richardson.\n\nFor Misty Mccully this hospital opened a new door in her life, after she lost her job as a nurse at the Bamberg County Hospital. She says she knows first-hand that not having easy access to healthcare services creates many problems.\u201dI\u2019ve seen the impact of our hospital closure in 2012 and I just I feel for the community\u2026 the elderly, the persons here that aren\u2019t able to get to longer distances when they have a medical emergency,\u201d said the former Nurse of Southern Palmetto Hospital.\n\nPastor Richardson says he used the full-service facility for his regular check-ups and during emergencies he appreciated the convenience of having the hospital close-by. \u201cI\u2019ve had kidney stones twice in the last three to four years and I came right here and got great treatment and good care and I can\u2019t imagine having to drive in the pain that I was in,\u201d Richardson told WJBF News Channel 6.\n\nMore than 21,000 people currently live in the county and seniors will be the most affected by this closure.\n\n\u201cThis is a safety net for them. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re scared or they are feeling bad\u2026 they knew that they could get in the car and drive 5 minutes and just get someone to check them and make sure that they were okay,\u201d said Jess Wilbanks CPO of Barnwell County United Way.\n\nNow residents of Barnwell will have to drive at least 30 minutes to the closest hospital. Some employees, WJBF News Channel 6 spoke with, says they have been offered jobs at other hospitals in the area. Yet, they still worry about the future of their patients in Barnwell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Southern Palmetto Hospital closed their doors leaving more than 140 people out of work and citizens of Barnwell worried about the future of their local healthcare system.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397295844", "og": {"site_name": "WJBF-TV", "description": "Southern Palmetto Hospital closed their doors leaving more than 140 people out of work and citizens of Barnwell worried about the future of their local healthcare system.", "title": "Local Hospital Closes Leaving Patients Worried About Access To Local Health Care", "url": "http://wjbf.com/2016/01/21/local-hospital-closes-leaving-patients-worried-about-access-to-local-healthcare/", "image": "https://mgtvwjbf.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/fb-thumbnail.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Southern Palmetto Hospital closed their doors leaving more than 140 people out of work and citizens of Barnwell worried about the future of their local healthcare system.", "title": "Local Hospital Closes Leaving Patients Worried About Access To Local Health Care", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwjbf.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/barnwellhospital.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wjbf", "site": "WJBF", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Southern Palmetto Hospital, citizens of Barnwell, Barnwell, healthcare system, healthcare services, prayer vigil, support, healthcare providers, First Baptist Church of Barnwell, Bamberg County Hospital, elderly, medical emergency, emergency, Barnwell County, Stefany Bornman, Barnwell South CarolinaNurse, check-ups, emergencies, hospital", "msapplication-tooltip": "Coverage You Can Count On", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_03ebd2d94ee4cf29a937c47f9da2e200", "fb": {"pages": 44265444199}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wjbf.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/350b1f7f222b7734559bb71f813b2a90?s=16", "application-name": "WJBF-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WJBFNewsChannel6", "published_time": "2016-01-21T22:18:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T00:59:51+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "cq2zTQaJDKUA0ZJ1kvlL-SqsZzKT2izMZpzMtRgEVSk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For Misty Mccully this hospital opened a new door in her life, after she lost her job as a nurse at the Bamberg County Hospital.\nSouthern Palmetto Hospital closed their doors leaving more than 140 people out of work and citizens of Barnwell worried about the future of their local healthcare system.\nFor 61 years, Southern Palmetto Hospital provided healthcare services to Barnwell and surrounding counties.\nBarnwell, SC (WJBF) \u2013 On Thursday, Southern Palmetto Hospital closed their doors leaving more than 140 people out of work and citizens of Barnwell worried about the future of their local healthcare system.\nDuring a prayer vigil, in the front parking lot of the Southern Palmetto Hospital, people came to show their support for the life-long healthcare providers that served them for so many years."}
