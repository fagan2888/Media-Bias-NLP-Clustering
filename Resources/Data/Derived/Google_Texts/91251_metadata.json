For sure, in England, he is my dear enemy. For sure, he is the one that made me a better manager. To stop him or try and stop him has been very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nGerrard will leave Liverpool at the end of the season after 17 years as a professional at Anfield, with the former England captain heading to the MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy to finish his career.\n\nThe closest Gerrard came to leaving his boyhood club was in 2004 and \u201805 - and the team he almost joined on both occasions was Chelsea, then managed by Mourinho in his first stint at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\u201cI was dreaming of a Chelsea midfield of (Claude) Makelele, (Frank) Lampard and Gerrard, playing in an open triangle without a No. 10,\u201d Mourinho said in January. \u201cWe were dreaming that - me, Mr. Abramovich (Chelsea\u2019s owner) and (then-chief executive) Peter Kenyon - and we did everything to try to make it happen.\n\n\u201cIt was almost there.\u201d\n\nGerrard ended up staying at Anfield and has gone on to become one of Liverpool\u2019s greatest players.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I think he had an amazing career and (such) an amazing feeling with his people that he refused to play for other big clubs,\u201d Mourinho said Friday. \u201cHe refused to play in other big leagues to play only for Liverpool.\n\n\u201cI think this is a feeling that stays forever.\u201d\n\nGerrard will be one of the players who will form a guard of honor for the Chelsea team before kickoff on Sunday, a tradition afforded for newly crowned champions. Chelsea clinched the Premier League title last weekend, with three matches to spare.\n\n\u201cLiverpool is Liverpool - it is a giant club,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIf they want to do that (a guard of honor), obviously my players are going to accept that with respect.\u201d\n\nBut expect the niceties to end there.\n\nLiverpool needs to win to keep alive its faint hopes of getting in the top four and securing a Champions League qualification berth.
