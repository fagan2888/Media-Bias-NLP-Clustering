On a measure closely followed by the Fed, annual inflation is just 1.1 percent.\n\nLacker said he was confident inflation would move back towards 2 percent in the next year or two but added: \"This is not a certainty, however, and I believe the FOMC will want to watch this closely,\" referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Richmond Fed president also played down a drop in interest rate futures prices, which is having the effect of pulling forward the market's timeline for the Fed's first rate hike.\n\n\"My sense is that markets have a good solid appreciation of the committee's likely reactions with regard to interest rates,\" he said, noting that forward guidance had been strengthened just last month.\n\n\"I interpret changes in the forward curve as reflections of changes in expectations about growth and other determinants of short-term interest rate setting by the committee.\"\n\nLacker also said the Fed would have to think carefully about other policy options, including changing the rate banks are paid on excess reserves, which some policymakers have suggested cutting.\n\n\"I think we have to sort out what are our options there and evaluate what a good path forward could be, and I expect us to be paying some attention to that in the months ahead,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Krista Hughes; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Krista Hughes", "Author": "Krista Hughes", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers will likely discuss another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of bond buying at their next meeting, said a senior Fed official on Friday, who warned against reading too much into a weak jobs report for December.", "title": "Fed's Lacker sees $10 billion taper on table at next meeting", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140110&t=2&i=828347654&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0912KN00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, FED, LACKER", "sailthru.title": "Fed's Lacker sees $10 billion taper on table at next meeting", "keywords": "US,USA,FED,LACKER,Employment / Unemployment,United States,US Government News,Labour / Personnel,Mortgage Agency Debt,Government / Politics,Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Interest Rates / Policy,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Inflation,US Federal Reserve,National Government Debt,Mortgage-Backed Markets,Government Finances", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_GCA-Economy2010": "USBREA090M120140110", "news_keywords": "US;USA;FED;LACKER;Employment / Unemployment;United States;US Government News;Labour / Personnel;Mortgage Agency Debt;Government / Politics;Debt / Fixed Income Markets;Interest Rates / Policy;Central Banks / Central Bank Events;Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers;Inflation;US Federal Reserve;National Government Debt;Mortgage-Backed Markets;Government Finances", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
