Travis Purrington, an American student from Idaho, proposed a redesign of United States currency, which of course is not going to happen. This raises a couple of preliminary questions.\n\nWhy should Indians care? Not all Indians will, but significant numbers of citizens of the Five Tribes take special care when they handle U.S. twenty dollar bills, so as not to have to look at the face of the treaty-shredding practitioner of ethnic cleansing from before we had a phrase in English to describe ethnic cleansing.\n\nAll of the Five Tribes were uprooted from their ancestral lands, from their sacred sites, from the graves of their grandparents, from the locations of their origin stories. Admonished by descendants of the perpetrators to \u201cget over it,\u201d some of us still ask how long it would take them to get over it?\n\nWhy is Purrington\u2019s project doomed? Because he did not just ditch the dead presidents. He also removed \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d That alone would attract an evangelical jihad of opposition. Still, Purrington\u2019s designs are things of beauty and well thought out, worthy of the attention they are receiving.\n\n\"The end goal,\u201d Purrington told Mashable, \u201cwas not as much to create a functional replacement for the U.S. dollar as to create a discussion about contemporary monetary value.\" It was perhaps his first proposal in that discussion to eliminate the one-dollar bill, explaining that if it ever achieved a value to make it worthwhile, \u201cwe could always bring it back.\u201d\n\nWired was predictably enthusiastic about celebrating science on our currency rather than God and presidential demi-Gods. The fiver replaces the Great Emancipator\u2019s portrait with a different kind of emancipation: a representation of the human neural network and the notice, \u201cThis currency is upheld by the integrity of its people.\u201d\n\nThe ten-dollar bill begins with a Bucky Ball, the carbon cage molecule that won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1996 and forms a building block of modern nanotechnology. The Bucky Ball is also known as buckminsterfullerene or C60, representing a form of C between graphite and diamond. It could be said that Buckminster Fuller would, by the proxy of his ideas, replace Alexander Hamilton.\n\nForeign Policy commented on the current twenty that \u201c(Andrew) Jackson stares out from the $20, a reminder of the 46,000 Native Americans he forced off their ancestral lands in an act of sustained brutality almost unprecedented in American history.\u201d While an open sewer would be an improvement, the actual artwork is a thing of beauty, a star pattern overlaid on a crashing wave. The other side features human blood cells, like the ones Jackson spilled.\n\nThe only human being who makes the new money is an astronaut on the fifty, from a photo of American Danny Olivas on a spacewalk taken by Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang. On the other side, a circuit board. Both are more exciting than U. S. Grant.\n\nThe venerable Benjamin is replaced by Ansel Adams\u2019 iconic photo of the Grand Tetons and the Snake River, a view that will excite the people of that land.\n\nInstead of E. Pluribus Unum, Latin comes to the new money as vires alit, \u201cstrength feeds.\u201d The import for the designer is that \u201cthe truly strong help the weak.\u201d Very like the tribal understanding of the duty of a warrior, and another reason why these beautiful designs will never kill the dead presidents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposed designs for U.S. currency scrap Indian-killer Andrew Jackson and religion in favor of science and achievement.
