The deadline to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable care act is about two weeks away. Under the law, anyone without a plan in place by February 15th will face fines.

For many, the process is confusing and even daunting, but if you haven’t signed up yet and would like to, there’s still time. A non-partisan group called “Enroll Virginia” is offering free help over the phone or in person for anyone who has not chosen a health coverage plan.

"And hopefully, when they see what we have and hear what we have to say they will have a change of heart if they’re sitting on the fence and at least talk to us because they’ll have the knowledge, the accurate information to help them make an informed decision," says Lois Caliri, an outreach specialist with Enroll Virginia.

Caliri says you have to call to make an appointment to meet with a specialist in person or by phone. Enroll Virginia is a non-partisan organization founded by the Virginia Poverty Law Center and other legal aid organizations. Its mission is to educate Virginians about the new health insurance marketplace and give free, unbiased, help. The number to call is 888-392-5132. Click here for more information.
