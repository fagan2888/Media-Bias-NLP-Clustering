Santa\u2019s Mailbox is similar to an angel tree and provides coats, shoes, clothing and toys for students who don\u2019t have homes or families to visit and must spend Christmas at the school for the holidays.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate so much the leadership of Community First Bank in providing Christmas presents for our children who could not go home for the holidays,\u201d said KDS executive director Dr. David Craig. \u201cWith the leadership of the bank and the generosity of the community, our children had a happy and exciting Christmas.\u201d\n\nThis year to vamp up fundraising efforts, Community First held two separate $5 Jean Days that allowed all employees at its eight locations in Maury, Williamson and Hickman counties to donate $5 to wear jeans to work on those days.\n\nThis alone generated more than $700. They used this money to fill letters from Santa\u2019s Mailbox.\n\nAlong with Community First, The King\u2019s Daughters\u2019 circles, Knights of Columbus, St. Catherine Catholic Church and many generous friends rallied to buy and wrap gifts, fill stockings, host Christmas parties and provide financial and other support to the students during the holidays.\n\n\u201cMost of all, we are thankful for the tremendous support we receive from our employees, customers and community members who fill the letters to Santa, make generous donations and support and welcome the students in the community all year long. We extend our most sincere gratitude and thanks to each of you,\u201d said Louis Holloway Community First president and CEO.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Staff Reports", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "From Staff Reports", "title": "Community First Bank provides a merry Christmas for KDS students", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/lifestyles/features/community-first-bank-provides-merry-christmas-kds-students", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_CFBK-Santa-s-Mailbox-for-KDS_swt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/lifestyles/features/community-first-bank-provides-merry-christmas-kds-students", "title": "Community First Bank provides a merry Christmas for KDS students", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=736467", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=736467", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "keywords": "Features,Celebrations,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T23:50:11-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb945\"", "article_summary": "More than 250 wish letters were filled and a generous Christmas was provided for about 50 students.\n\u201cWe appreciate so much the leadership of Community First Bank in providing Christmas presents for our children who could not go home for the holidays,\u201d said KDS executive director Dr. David Craig.\nThey used this money to fill letters from Santa\u2019s Mailbox.\nFrom Staff ReportsStudents at The King\u2019s Daughters\u2019 School had an extra special Christmas this year due to the efforts of Community First Bank &Trust who sponsored the Santa\u2019s Mailbox program for the 13th consecutive year.\nSanta\u2019s Mailbox is similar to an angel tree and provides coats, shoes, clothing and toys for students who don\u2019t have homes or families to visit and must spend Christmas at the school for the holidays."}
