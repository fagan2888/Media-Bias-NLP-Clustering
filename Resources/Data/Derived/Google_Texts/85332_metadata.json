But thanks to his insistence, this post at the Campaign for Liberty\u2019s website caught my eye:\n\nFreedom comes with a certain amount of risk. If you wanted to live a risk free life, then a benevolent dictatorship might be your preferred form of government. But, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201dI would rather be exposed to the inconveniencies [sic] attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.\u201d On his Facebook page, Rep. Massie at least had a sense of humor about the opposition to his bills from Big Milk, posting \u201cThe lactose lobby can be so intolerant! It\u2019s time to legalize freedom.\u201d We\u2019re glad to see Rep. Massie is in line with a great American political tradition that places personal freedom over the desire for the Nanny State to keep us safe from ourselves. This sort of strong opposition, this early, from Big Milk is actually a good sign that they\u2019re worried about the number of original cosponsors this legislation has and the potential for momentum to swing in our direction.\n\nMassie has introduced two bills that would create more freedom with regards to milk sales. One, with 11 cosponsors, would allow for the interstate sale of raw milk. The other, with 20 cosponsors, would allow the sale of raw milk between states that already allow raw milk sales.\n\nVia Politico, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports the risk of raw milk is substantial, as compared to pasteurized milk:\n\nDuring 1993\u20132006, 121 outbreaks reported to CDC were caused by dairy products where the investigators could determine if the dairy product was pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw). These outbreaks included 4,413 illnesses, 239 hospitalizations, and 3 deaths.\n\n73 outbreaks (46 from fluid milk and 27 from cheese) were caused by raw milk, and 48 outbreaks (10 from fluid milk and 38 from cheese) were caused by pasteurized milk.\n\nProbably no more than 1% of the milk consumed in the United States is raw, yet more outbreaks were caused by raw milk than by pasteurized milk.\n\nIf you consider the number of outbreaks caused by raw milk in light of the very small amount of milk that is consumed raw, the risk of outbreaks caused by raw milk is at least 150 times greater than the risk of outbreaks caused by pasteurized milk.\n\nAnd the diseases have worse effects:\n\nThe hospitalization rate for patients in outbreaks caused by raw milk was 13 times higher (13% vs. 1%) than the rate for people in outbreaks caused by pasteurized milk.\n\nThis difference is probably partly because the outbreaks caused by raw milk were all caused by bacterial infections that tend to be more severe. For example, E. coli O157:H7, a bacterium that can cause kidney failure and death, was a common cause of outbreaks due to raw milk. For outbreaks caused by pasteurized milk, relatively mild viral infections and foodborne toxins were more common causes.\n\nThis difference makes sense because raw milk is probably contaminated at the time of milking of the cows. The skin of cows is contaminated with huge numbers of bacteria, even if sanitary precautions are taken. Some of the bacteria, while harmless to the cows, can cause disease in people. On the other hand, if pasteurized milk is contaminated after pasteurization, it is likely to be due to improper storage or by an infected food preparer. In these situations, serious bacterial infections are less likely to happen.\n\nHowever, one advocate told Politico the risk shouldn\u2019t matter with regards to its legality:\n\nPete Kennedy, president of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, the major national group advocating for raw milk, argues that the statistics paint a misleading picture. He says there are several other products that aren\u2019t banned that contribute to diseases, such as cigarettes, alcohol and even pasteurized milk in some cases. \u201cThe trouble is that raw milk is the only food that is held to a standard of perfection,\u201d he said.\n\nI don\u2019t drink milk due to a slight allergy, but recently I took the plunge and drank a glass of my friend\u2019s raw milk. I didn\u2019t end up in the hospital, and in fact felt none of the normal allergenic effects I normally associate with drinking milk (something he had said would be the case). I doubt I\u2019ll be making raw milk a regular habit, but like how I support the right of restaurants to allow smoking despite my personal distaste for the habit, and how I wear a bike helmet and a seat belt despite my opposition to mandates for adults to use both, I am glad to see Rep. Massie and a bipartisan group work to give the right of free trade back to the American people.\n\nAs always, though, praise for this effort should be balanced with realization of how inconsequential this issue is in the grand scheme of things. Yes, it\u2019s great to see any legislation that expands personal liberty get bipartisan support in Congress, even if it\u2019s going nowhere fast, but let\u2019s be honest: the ban on sales of raw milk is hardly the nation\u2019s most pressing issue. If only these guys and gals could actually work together on issues of critical importance \u2014 say, cutting the budget where there is enormous bipartisan agreement, such as ethanol subsidies or fraud, duplication, and improper payments, or joining the majority of American people in banning late-term abortions.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The liberty to get sick?", "title": "Should Americans be allowed to buy and sell raw milk?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/05/should-americans-be-allowed-to-buy-and-sell-raw-milk/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T17:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T10:04:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0282\"", "article_summary": "The other, with 20 cosponsors, would allow the sale of raw milk between states that already allow raw milk sales.\nShould Americans be allowed to buy and sell raw milk?\nIf you consider the number of outbreaks caused by raw milk in light of the very small amount of milk that is consumed raw, the risk of outbreaks caused by raw milk is at least 150 times greater than the risk of outbreaks caused by pasteurized milk.\nProbably no more than 1% of the milk consumed in the United States is raw, yet more outbreaks were caused by raw milk than by pasteurized milk.\n73 outbreaks (46 from fluid milk and 27 from cheese) were caused by raw milk, and 48 outbreaks (10 from fluid milk and 38 from cheese) were caused by pasteurized milk."}
