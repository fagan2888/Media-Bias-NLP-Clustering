Donald Payne Jr.)\n\nA new federally qualified health center opened in Newark in place of a medical center which was shut down in 2008.\n\nThe closing of St. James Hospital left a gap in health care, and residents were forced to forgo doctor visits or rely on emergency room visits.\n\nBut $600,000 in funding was awarded through the Affordable Care Act, and U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez were credited for pleading the case of needed health care in Newark\u2019s largest Latino community.\n\n\"This is a good day for the residents of the East Ward of Newark,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Albio Sires. \u201cFor the first time in nearly a decade since St. James Hospital closed, we are returning access to affordable, high-quality health care to the Ironbound. That is why I am so proud to have worked with local, county, state and federal elected officials to finally see this project come to its completion.\u201d\n\nThe multilingual staff at St. James will provide primary, OB/GYN, pediatric and internal medicine care, as well as help patients navigate the insurance and Medicare and Medicaid landscape.\n\n\u201cInvestments in our community health centers \u2014 like St. James \u2014 are exactly the kind of investments we must make if we want all of our communities and families to prosper,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nThey anticipate at least 4,000 patients this year, and will operate five days a week with extended weekend and evening hours in the spring.\n\n\u201cCommunities like Newark face incredible barriers to adequate health care, such as transportation, language, and inadequate access to information,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThis new federally qualified health center will help address these health inequities by bringing critical, high-quality health care services into the community. I was proud to have worked closely with HHS to bring nearly $3.7 million in federal funding to New Jersey for community health centers, and stand committed to continue strengthening our underserved communities.\u201d\n\nThere are currently 15 FQHCs in Newark, including mobile units and primary care centers located at schools.\n\nNicole Fields, CEO and president, St. James Health, said: \u201cSt. James Health was founded in 2014 to fill the gap in primary care left by the closure of St. James Hospital, to improve health outcomes and to guarantee access to culturally competent care, specifically in the East Ward. Our residents are not traditional health care patients. Here many residents face language and cultural barriers. They may not have proper health insurance. Most critically they are experiencing disproportionately high rates of asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. This trend must be reversed if we are to reach the goal of a healthy Newark.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s community health centers provide thousands of hardworking New Jerseyans with access to quality, comprehensive health care services,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. \u201cCommunity health centers understand the health needs of their communities, and they tailor services to those needs. St. James Health will allow for the treatment of more underserved New Jerseyans, improving the quality of life in our communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160203/NJBIZ01/160209910/update-federally-qualified-health-center-opens-in-newark", "site_name": "NJBIZ", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Update: Federally qualified health center opens in Newark | NJBIZ"}, "twitter": {"site": "@njbiz", "domain": "njbiz.com", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Update: Federally qualified health center opens in Newark | NJBIZ"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis new federally qualified health center will help address these health inequities by bringing critical, high-quality health care services into the community.\nSt. James Health will allow for the treatment of more underserved New Jerseyans, improving the quality of life in our communities.\u201d\nNicole Fields, CEO and president, St. James Health, said: \u201cSt.\nCory Booker and Bob Menendez were credited for pleading the case of needed health care in Newark\u2019s largest Latino community.\n\u201cCommunities like Newark face incredible barriers to adequate health care, such as transportation, language, and inadequate access to information,\u201d Booker said."}
