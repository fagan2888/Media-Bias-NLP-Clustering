Scott Walker\u2019s biggest selling point as a presidential candidate has been his blue-collar populist appeal, and it\u2019s something that clearly shined through on the stage at a forum of GOP presidential candidates in Manchester, New Hampshire, at Saint Anselm College on Monday night.\n\nAfter Walker and moderator Jack Heath discussed how Walker\u2019s state budget in Wisconsin went from starting, when he took office away from Democratic control, in a deficit of $3.6 billion to now having a surplus that he\u2019s used to cut taxes and grow his state\u2019s economy, Walker and Heath discussed Walker\u2019s battle against special interest labor unions.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nationally been known as someone who took on the unions,\u201d Heath asked Walker. \u201cAre you anti-union or anti-worker?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Walker responded plainly. \u201cI\u2019m pro-worker and pro-taxpayer. We gave workers the freedom to choose. We made Wisconsin a right-to-work state. We gave workers the freedom to choose whether they want to be in a labor union or not. Many chose to keep that money that they used to use to pay for union dues to pay for their kids\u2019 college education or other things they have for their family. We\u2019re pro-taxpayer. Before, all the power was concentrated in Wisconsin in the hands of the elite union bosses, we instead redistributed that back to the hardworking taxpayers and the people they duly elect. So, for example, in our schools, we no longer have seniority or tenure, we can hire and fire based on merit, we can pay based on performance. That means we can put the best and brightest in our classrooms.\u201d\n\nGraduation rates and test scores are on the rise after Walker did this, he noted next.\n\n\u201cIf it can work in a blue state like Wisconsin\u2014if it wasn\u2019t too late for Wisconsin, it\u2019s not too late for America,\u201d Walker said.\n\nLater, in the second round, Walker pitched himself as a \u201cnew fresh face\u201d in politics and said he\u2019d be thrilled to run against either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vice President Joe Biden in a general election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve won three elections in four years, the last two of which I won after a lot of people were upset on the Democratic side of things,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe did it by making big, bold actions and got results because of that. In the end, I\u2019d love to go against whether it\u2019s Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, I\u2019m a new fresh face versus a name from the past. I\u2019m someone from outside of Washington with a proven track record and most of all I\u2019ve gotten things done in a blue state.\u201d\n\nIn his 30 seconds to close his argument, Walker noted that what makes him different from other candidates, it\u2019s that \u201cI fought and I won.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just win three elections in four years in a blue state running for governor,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe actually won on the big issues. We balanced our budget. We cut taxes. We defunded Planned Parenthood long before these videos came out. And we did so and went forward in a way that took on the big government special interests and put the power back in the hands of the people. If we could do it in Wisconsin\u2014it\u2019s not too late there, and it\u2019s certainly not too late for America. I ask for your vote.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s pitch to take on special interests goes to a whole new level when it comes to the issue of immigration, as he\u2019s pledged to stand up for American workers over those special interests pushing for a massive increase in foreigners to be imported into America\u2019s workforce from abroad. Walker, however, wasn\u2019t asked about his position on that issue tonight\u2014but several other candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and more who support increasing foreign immigration to the United States were asked about it. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who supports cutting legal immigration by 25 percent at least, was also asked about the issue. Walker\u2019s position is closest to Santorum\u2019s, a good place to be for someone running for president on the Republican side. Santorum won 11 states while trying to beat Mitt Romney last cycle. Walker is in a prime position, the more he talks about this issue of taking on the special interests and conjoining it with immigration, to rise back up in the polls after he\u2019s seen a bit of a slip in the polls after getting sidetracked with a brief bout with frontrunner Donald Trump. Trump wasn\u2019t present at the forum on Monday evening, nor was former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2014another candidate who supports restrictions on immigration in order to help struggling Americans find work instead of trying to help foreigners.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott Walker\u2019s Populist Appeal Shines at New Hampshire Forum", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Scott Walker\u2019s Populist Appeal Shines at New Hampshire Forum", "title": "Scott Walker\u2019s Populist Appeal Shines at New Hampshire Forum - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/AP_806878583425-e1438660503226.jpg", "height": 441}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/03/scott-walkers-populist-appeal-shines-at-new-hampshire-forum/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Walker\u2019s Populist Appeal Shines at New Hampshire Forum", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/AP_806878583425-e1438660503226.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker\u2019s Populist Appeal Shines at New Hampshire Forum - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Populism, Scott Walker, special interests,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "special interests", "published_time": "2015-08-03T20:55:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And we did so and went forward in a way that took on the big government special interests and put the power back in the hands of the people.\nScott Walker\u2019s biggest selling point as a presidential candidate has been his blue-collar populist appeal, and it\u2019s something that clearly shined through on the stage at a forum of GOP presidential candidates in Manchester, New Hampshire, at Saint Anselm College on Monday night.\nWalker\u2019s position is closest to Santorum\u2019s, a good place to be for someone running for president on the Republican side.\n\u201cIf it can work in a blue state like Wisconsin\u2014if it wasn\u2019t too late for Wisconsin, it\u2019s not too late for America,\u201d Walker said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cYou\u2019ve nationally been known as someone who took on the unions,\u201d Heath asked Walker."}
