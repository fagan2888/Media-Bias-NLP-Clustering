Richard Burr, R-N.C., told Wrightsville Beach Mayor Bill Blair that coastal communities should plan for more beach renourishment funding in their own budgets in anticipation of a reduction of federal funding.\n\nBurr said that while the federal government, through the Army Corps of Engineers, has a \u201crich history\u201d of financially participating in beach renourishment, it is sliding on the list of priorities for the corps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that in the future there will be available funds,\u201d Burr said. \u201cThe coastal communities will have to incorporate in their annual planning a little more. The property owners are going to be required to keep the tourism at the levels that they are at now.\u201d\n\nBurr said with tourism and the beaches being such a driver of the state\u2019s economy, finding a solution for beach renourishment would be a rising priority for state politicians.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much of our economy driven off of our coastline, this really has to be a federal, state and local partnership. The sooner we start those discussions, the better off we are,\u201d Burr said. \u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t affect summer rentals as much as it does the property values and the ability to sell.\u201d\n\nBlair asked about maintenance for the Intracoastal Waterway. Burr said the waterway is often associated with recreational boating, but in North Carolina commercial industries also heavily use the waterway for transportation.\n\n\u201cIn some places, the Intracoastal Waterway has become unusable,\u201d Burr said. \u201cWe may need to find some ways to collect some revenues from the Intracoastal Waterway.\u201d\n\nBlair raised concerns with Burr about the Affordable Care Act, which he said would have an impact on the town\u2019s budget as premiums for employees\u2019 health insurance were set to rise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s putting pressure on a small little town like us,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBurr said the insurance industry is in the second year of a three-year implementation of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. He said North Carolina\u2019s largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, has seen a 33 percent increase in premiums and still expects to lose $100 million next year.\n\n\u201cThat gives an indication of where 2017 rates will go,\u201d Burr said. \u201cMost of us agree that\u2019s unsustainable.\u201d\n\nHe said the bill was badly written and there have been some unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cThere will be a continued bipartisan effort to roll back and fix pieces of it,\u201d Burr said of the healthcare law.\n\nBurr met with a handful of local officials Wednesday, Jan. 6 in Wilmington. Meeting attendees included Blair, Carolina Beach Mayor Dan Wilcox, New Hanover County Board of Commissioners Chair Beth Dawson and Wilmington Police Chief Ralph Evangelous.\n\nBurr faces re-election this year. He has two challengers for the Republican primary in March 2015.\n\nemail terrylane@luminanews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Lumina News", "description": "While he anticipated some federal funding would remain available, U.S. \u00a0Sen.
