Kris Hudson\n\nHousing starts declined by 17% in February from January. So, we should all panic, right?\n\nNo.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s data for February home starts, released Tuesday, is an anomaly born of harsh weather in many parts of the U.S. last month. Residential building permits provide a better view of the market\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t so much whether this spring home-selling season is off to a disastrous start. Rather, it\u2019s more about whether the spring is starting slowly or if it\u2019s shaping up for big gains. The former would deliver modestly disappointing gains from last year\u2019s lackluster result, and the latter is what most builders and economists are hoping for.\n\nConsider that, even though overall construction starts were down 3.3% in February from a year earlier, residential building permits were up 2% in the same span. Permits are a solid gauge of building activity in the near future, and they aren\u2019t whipsawed as much each month by weather as are construction starts.\n\nFrom another perspective, the number of permits issued in January and February of this year for single-family houses shows a 0.9% increase from the same period a year ago. That\u2019s not a strong gain. But neither is it the disastrous decline that today\u2019s headline number implies.\n\n\u201cWe think harsh weather in the Northeast may have been partially responsible as that region fell the hardest sequentially and year-over-year in February (in permits for single-family homes),\u201d Wells Fargo Securities Analyst Adam Rudiger wrote in a note distributed to his firm\u2019s clients on Tuesday. \u201cIn contrast, the more important South and West regions were up 4.8% and 13.6% year over year, respectively, pointing to a stronger start to the 2015 spring selling season.\u201d\n\nThe concern stemming from the February construction-starts data is that perhaps the new-home market remains stuck in first gear, unable to kick into the higher gears needed to contribute more to job growth and overall increases in gross domestic product. Economists are hoping for a big gain in home construction this year after 2014, with only a small gain, amounted to only 63.3% of the average annual output since 2000.\n\nSeveral large, public home builders have reported sizeable gains in their January and February sales from their year-ago results, but it\u2019s still a bit early in the season to know with certainty if the market will be hot or just room temperature.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, noted that February was a bad month for numerous economic indicators in addition to home-construction starts. His outlook remains positive. \u201cThere are nothing but tailwinds to the housing market now,\u201d he said Tuesday in an interview. \u201cSo, I\u2019d be surprised if we don\u2019t see better conditions.\u201d\n\nAt Century Communities Inc., sales across the builder\u2019s four states of Colorado, Nevada, Texas and Georgia are better so far this year than a year ago, co-CEO Dale Francescon said in an interview. He said he saw no sustained impact on construction from harsh weather \u2013 at least not enough to throw off an entire month\u2019s results.\n\nHome-buyer \u201ctraffic continues to be better year over year,\u201d Mr. Francescon said. \u201cBuilders have reported that the year has started off well, and we\u2019re not seeing anything different from that. We\u2019re still pretty optimistic about where this year is going to be, because it\u2019s been a pretty good start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Commerce Department\u2019s data for February home starts, released Tuesday, is an anomaly born of harsh weather in many parts of the U.S. last month.
