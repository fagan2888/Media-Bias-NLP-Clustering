Then, agriculture. Less dire, but still concerning: what the water shortage will mean for local breweries.\n\nThe 110-mile Russian River in Northern California is not only a source of drinking water to half a million people, it\u2019s where craft beer from Lagunitas Brewing Co. gets its unique taste. And now it\u2019s drying up. NPR reports on the impending crisis:\n\n\u2026in the wake of 2013, the driest year ever recorded in California, Lagunitas\u2019 owners say they\u2019re nervous about shortages that could mean a switch from the river water to not-as-tasty well water. \u201cIf [the county] shifts us over to groundwater, we\u2019d have to sacrifice our nice water supply \u2014 that unique, signature, clean Russian River water,\u201d says Jeremy Marshall, head brewer at Lagunitas. The problem with groundwater, he says, is that it\u2019s heavy in minerals that don\u2019t go well with beer. \u201cIt would be like brewing with Alka-Seltzer,\u201d Marshall says. \u2026Marshall says any off-flavors in the well water might not show through in a malty, bitter beer. However, the minerals could coax undesirable flavors from grainy and hoppy styles. \u201cA beer that might normally taste crisp and refreshing could have an astringent taste \u2014 kind of planky, like Popsicle stick,\u201d Marshall says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Local breweries are concerned about what water rationing will mean for their beer", "title": "California drought beer is going to taste awful", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Local breweries are concerned about what water rationing will mean for their beer", "title": "California drought beer is going to taste awful", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/21/california_drought_beer_is_going_to_taste_awful/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/28772_581799828530052_508181159_n-e1393000231781.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local breweries are concerned about what water rationing will mean for their beer", "title": "California drought beer is going to taste awful", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/28772_581799828530052_508181159_n-e1393000231781.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Beer, California Drought, drought, Water Shortage, Wine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeee0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Beer, California Drought, drought, Water Shortage, Wine, Sustainability News, Business NewsIn the face of California\u2019s ongoing and devastating drought, the No.\n\u201cA beer that might normally taste crisp and refreshing could have an astringent taste \u2014 kind of planky, like Popsicle stick,\u201d Marshall says.\nLess dire, but still concerning: what the water shortage will mean for local breweries.\nThe 110-mile Russian River in Northern California is not only a source of drinking water to half a million people, it\u2019s where craft beer from Lagunitas Brewing Co. gets its unique taste.\n\u2026Marshall says any off-flavors in the well water might not show through in a malty, bitter beer."}
