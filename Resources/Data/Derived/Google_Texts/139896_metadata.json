Rest of market positive, but eroding near the close.\n\nWASHINGTON, Nov. 20, 2015 \u2013 We were among the first yesterday to note the ringing announcement\u2014or really an aside\u2014tossed out yesterday by mega-insurer UnitedHealth (UNH). Whatever its initial intent, the company\u2019s hint that they might drop out of Obamacare exchanges nationwide in 2017 and would cut the marketing budget for their 2016 plans turned out to be like detonating a chunk of plastic explosives during Thursday\u2019s trading action.\n\nIt\u2019s not a mistake that we\u2019re drawing this explosive analogy with yesterday\u2019s announcement. As if UNH\u2019s warning blast itself was not, it set off chain reaction detonations that clobbered not only its own stock but the shares of every other publicly traded company that participates in the convoluted Obamacare system.\n\nRead also: Obamacare reality slaughters UnitedHealth [UNH], other insurers\n\nThat in turn, creamed these stocks and hammered ETFs and allied companies in the same basic business. It hit investors and particularly HFTs like a ton of bricks, broadcasting to all what we\u2019ve been preaching here since, oh, 2010 or so. Namely, that, while some way to address this nation\u2019s healthcare problems is still a major issue, the Obamacare monstrosity \u2014 pushed solely by the Democrats and the greedy insurers and drug manufacturers they managed to co-opt \u2014 is collapsing under the weight of its own inherent lack of planning, resource management and common sense.\n\nRepublicans are clearly excited to get this gift of an issue back on the table just in time for the 2016 election party. It could be a winner. Then again, given the instinctive obtuseness of America\u2019s Stupid Party\u2026.\n\nUNH, which also feasts at the Medicare table, courtesy of its long-time, technically hands-off relationship with yet another liberal funding vehicle\u2014AARP\u2014is obviously shocked, shocked that the Obamacare promoters in Congress and the White House misled them with rosy Obamacare profit projections, all of which, as anyone who reads can know, are turning back to the dust they always were.\n\nSo now, UNH is likely outraged that it clearly can\u2019t make money on this massive federal government charade. Their announcement yesterday was a warning shot across the administration\u2019s lame-duck bow: either get us more taxpayer money, or we\u2019re outta there.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly what Obama\u2019s and Harry Reid\u2019s minions expected to hear from this industry, at least not yet. But it was bound to happen since Obamacare is really designed to strangle the insurance companies so they\u2019ll ALL pull up stakes and leave, allowing the federal government to go to the single-pay, government owned and operated socialist healthcare scheme they\u2019d always planned in this scam from the very beginning.\n\nFinally seeing the obvious, healthcare stock optimists launched yesterday\u2019s massive dump-a-thon of healthcare insurers Thursday, likely exacerbated by HFTs either dumping more shares or shorting even more.\n\nThe healthcare companies are trying to recover today. But it may be some time before they even get back to even after Thursday\u2019s shocker. But it just goes to show you. If you put faith in anything America\u2019s socialist party either promises you or bribes you with, you\u2019ll always wind up the bigger fool in the end. America\u2019s political left, 2015 edition, just wants more and more and more of your money\u2014and that includes the big corporations who\u2026 donate lavishly to America\u2019s socialist party.\n\nNow they\u2019re reaping their dividends from the corrupt federal government, all of which, surprisingly, are showing up as red ink.\n\nThe unions, which routinely support Democrats, have discovered the same thing, as this administration uses the SS Storm Troopers of the EPA to crush all remaining jobs in mining and manufacturing, because\u2026 global warming climate change.\n\nIn Obamanation, you NEVER get what you pay for. But will the unions and corporate giants learn? Nahhhh\u2026. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the U.S. today.\n\nRegarding the rest of the market, stocks are trading positively today against a messy backdrop. But as we enter the final hour of Friday trading, the averages are beginning their traditional Friday afternoon swoon. Strongly up earlier in the day, averages are slowly sinking, likely leading to a weak but positive close, but maybe not by much. Bad things usually happen on Monday trading, too, and the sensibly faint-of-heart just don\u2019t want to be there.\n\nToday\u2019s trading tips\n\nDefensively, we lightened up a bit on Molina (MOH) yesterday, one of the worst hit of the healthcare providers but one that\u2019s more involved with administering state Medicaid programs than it is with Obamacare products. That said, the company is highly leveraged, so it moves faster and nastier than the insurance giants so we reluctantly took a partial haircut yesterday as we\u2019re now too old to sustain the heavy losses that bothered us when we were just starting out.\n\nEverything else: too slippery right now. In 2015, three out of four Mondays have been down days, meaning that if you really want to buy something, it\u2019s usually on sale Monday. So we\u2019ll watch and wait and see what happens then before we even think about moving.\n\n*NOTE: Cartoon by Branco, reprinted by arrangement and permission, courtesy of ComicallyIncorrect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Warning shot by UnitedHealth (UNH) heard \u2018round the capitol as the \u201cI told you\u201d brigade revs up for 2016.
