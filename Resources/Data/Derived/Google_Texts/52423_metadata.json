Wolfe has been out since he fell ill on the team bus on Nov. 29, missing the past four games. Although the team hasn\u2019t given specific details of what was wrong with the defensive end, coach John Fox said last week that he\u2019s been looking better and better.\n\nWebster, a rookie cornerback, broke his thumb in the team\u2019s Dec. 12 loss to the Chargers. His return Wednesday didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise; the team has hoped since the injury and his surgery the next day that he\u2019d be able to return this week and play with a cast on his right hand.\n\nTight end Joel Dreessen and center Steve Vallos were both missing from the team\u2019s Christmas Day practice Wednesday. Vallos suffered a concussion on Sunday, and Dreessen has battled knee problems all season. Wide receiver Eric Decker (thigh) and quarterback Peyton Manning (ankle) also were limited.\n\nA modified Christmas schedule. The Broncos reported to practice three hours late Wednesday. Instead of arriving at 7:20 a.m., they were permitted to show up at 10:20 to the facility. Practice \u2014 which was in full pads \u2014 began at 2:10 p.m. instead of 11:10 a.m., allowing players with young children to be at home with them in the morning. The team also canceled afternoon meetings so that players could be home for dinner.\n\nLinebacker Marshall on the 53-man roster. A day after being activated from the Broncos\u2019 practice squad to fill Von Miller\u2019s spot, linebacker Brandon Marshall spoke to the media. Marshall spent the first 16 weeks of the 2013 season on Denver\u2019s practice squad, and he knows his role now that he has been moved to the active roster.\n\n\u201cSpecial teams come first,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI\u2019m not a first-round pick. I\u2019m a guy that came in, so definitely special teams, and I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d\n\nLinebacker Nate Irving will likely absorb the bulk of Miller\u2019s playing time.\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com, twitter.com/joanniesen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker, Derek Wolfe, Kayvon Webster return to Broncos practice", "title": "Wes Welker, Derek Wolfe, Kayvon Webster return to Broncos practice", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/25/wes-welker-derek-wolfe-kayvon-webster-return-to-broncos-practice/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225_030142_wes-welker-vs-tennessee-titans.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225_030142_wes-welker-vs-tennessee-titans.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-25T14:56:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:51:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd561\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos got three gifts on Christmas Day, in the form of Wes Welker\u2019s, Derek Wolfe\u2019s and Kayvon Webster\u2019s returns to practice.\nTight end Joel Dreessen and center Steve Vallos were both missing from the team\u2019s Christmas Day practice Wednesday.\nA day after being activated from the Broncos\u2019 practice squad to fill Von Miller\u2019s spot, linebacker Brandon Marshall spoke to the media.\nWolfe has been out since he fell ill on the team bus on Nov. 29, missing the past four games.\nWebster, a rookie cornerback, broke his thumb in the team\u2019s Dec. 12 loss to the Chargers."}
