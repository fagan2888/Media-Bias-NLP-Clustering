He\u2019s an extremely bright young man and he\u2019s positive,\u201d said Kelly Williams, another attendee.\n\nDean Schaibley, who served in the Army from 2001 to 2005, likes Rubio\u2019s positions on the issues, but just as importantly he said he thinks Rubio is the only candidate in the Republican field who can work with Democrats in Washington to get things done.\n\n\u201cWhat it comes down to is Marco is going to be able to work with both sides,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor our country to move forward you got to be able to work across both sides.\u201d\n\nRetired Marine Corps Colonel Jonathan Brazee said he was deciding between Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich for a similar reason.\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump would be detrimental to the country,\u201d he said of the billionaire Republican front-runner. \u201cI think [Texas Sen. Ted] Cruz cannot work with the Democrats.\u201d\n\nRight now, Trump holds a large lead in Nevada, according to the few polls that have been conducted in the state, with Rubio far back competing with Cruz for second place. A couple of attendees at the Rubio rally admitted that they were leaning toward Trump but were open to possibly switching to Rubio.\n\nRobin Brimer likes Trump on economic and security issues, but said he is a little annoyed with Trump\u2019s statement last week during a CNN town hall that he supports the Obamacare mandate. (Trump has since backtracked on that position.)\n\n\u201cSounds like he is just changing the name of Obamacare to something else,\u201d Brimer said.\n\n\u201cI just kind of trust him to get a lot of things done, but are they going to be good things?\u201d he added. But Brimer said that as of now he is giving Trump the benefit of the doubt and that he hopes Trump will pick Rubio as his running mate should he be the nominee.\n\nSporting a tattoo sleeve on his arm, Brian Larsun said before Rubio\u2019s speech that he is also leaning toward Trump because of the real estate mogul\u2019s business background, but came to the event with his wife and son because he has been impressed by Rubio\u2019s recent debate and televised town hall performances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very open to just anybody now,\u201d he explained, before stipulating that being open to anybody does not mean being open to Cruz.\n\n\u201cI just feel that he is not really authentic,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s more like a machine.\u201d\n\nAfter Rubio finished speaking, Larsun told TheDC that he was impressed by Rubio\u2019s speech and now considers him \u201cneck and neck\u201d with Trump in his considerations.\n\n\u201cWhat I notice about him that he has a lot of visions that Donald Trump has as well, but more detailed, which is important,\u201d Larsun explained.\n\nThis being Vegas, some in the crowd were little more than eccentric voyeurs there to see a show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the best story you got in this place,\u201d Richard Schwartz confided to TheDC.\n\nWith his Trump-like humility, Schwartz explained he is among that rare demographic that really likes Rubio and Democratic contender Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the best spokesman,\u201d he said of Rubio, before adding: \u201cSanders would be great if he was not my age.\u201d\n\nWho Do You Plan To Vote For?

The white-bearded near-octogenarian wanted to discuss the secret American military operation in Cuba he claims he was supposed to be apart of in 1961 because of his resemblance to Fidel Castro. The Bay of Pigs Invasion?\n\n\u201cSomething even worse, but it didn\u2019t happen thank God,\u201d Schwartz said, suggesting his mission would have involved chemical warfare.\n\nUnfortunately for Rubio, even though Schwartz likes the Florida senator, he doesn\u2019t intend to caucus Tuesday. He said he lives across the street from Texas Station and was just at the rally to check out the scene.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "LAS VEGAS -- Sometimes primary elections are decided less by differences on issues than\u00a0by questions of character.
