Big screw-ups and a looming strike top the headlines today in the Pacific Northwest.

NOT HELPING: The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce may have just poured salt in the fresh wound of Boeing Co. threatening to build its 777X commercial jet in another state. The chamber placed a an ad in the Seattle Times urging the legislature to pass a transportation package saying it would help urge Boeing to stay. Problem is they used a photo of Boeing’s competitor, an Airbus jetliner. Important to note is that the legislature has already passed an unprecedented nearly $9 billion tax incentive package for Boeing. It was the lack of agreement with union members that prompted the company to shop other states.

STRIKE: The Portland Public Schools and the teachers association cannot come to an agreement after months of back and forth. A strike looms.

HOT SEAT: Cover Oregon Executive Director Rocky King faced tough questions from lawmakers during committee meetings in Salem on Wednesday. The health exchange has yet to enroll a single person in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And it’s possible the agency is processing 19-page paper applications with one fax machine.

GOT RAW MILK: An Oregon dairy farmer is suing the state on free speech grounds over a law that bans advertising of raw milk. She can sell it, but she can’t talk about it.
