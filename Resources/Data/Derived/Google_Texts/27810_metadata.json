The decision came after the humanitarian group reported it treated nearly two dozen Rohingya Muslim victims of communal violence in Rakhine state, which the government has denied.\n\nThe humanitarian group said it was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by Myanmar\u2019s decision to expel it after two decades of work in the country.\n\n\u201cToday for the first time in MSF\u2019s history of operations in the country, HIV/AIDS clinics in Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states, as well as Yangon division, were closed and patients were unable to receive the treatment they needed,\u201d the group said in a statement, using the French acronym for its name.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAs Myanmar\u2019s main provider of HIV drugs, supplying treatment to 30,000 people, the group described the impact as devastating.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s presidential spokesman Ye Htut had criticized Doctors Without Borders in the Myanmar Freedom newspaper for hiring \u201cBengalis,\u201d the term the government uses for Rohingya, and lacked transparency in its work.\n\nHe also accused the group of misleading the world about an attack last month in the remote northern part of Rakhine. The United Nations says more than 40 Rohingya may have been killed, but the government has vehemently denied allegations that a Buddhist mob rampaged through a village, killing women and children. It says one policeman was killed by Rohingya and no other violence occurred.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it treated 22 injured and traumatized Rohingya.\n\nRepeated attempts to reach Ye Htut for comment were unsuccessful Friday.\n\nMyanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 60 million, only recently emerged from a half-century of military rule. Since then, ethnic tensions have swept Rakhine state, raising concerns from the United States and others that the bloodshed could undermine democratic reforms. Up to 280 people have been killed and tens of thousands more have fled their homes, most of them Rohingya.\n\nSince the violence erupted in June 2012, Doctors Without Borders has worked in 15 camps for the displaced people in Rakhine state. For many of the sickest patients, the organization offers the best and sometimes only care, because traveling outside the camps for treatment in local Buddhist-run hospitals can be dangerous and expensive. The aid group has worked to help smooth the referral process for emergency transport from some camps.\n\nDue to increasing threats and intimidation from a group of Rakhine Buddhists who have been holding near daily protests against Doctors Without Borders, the organization has said its activities have been severely hampered and that it has not received enough government support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The decision came after the humanitarian group reported it treated nearly two dozen Rohingya Muslim victims of communal violence in Rakhine state, which the government has denied.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The decision came after the humanitarian group reported it treated nearly two dozen Rohingya Muslim victims of communal violence in Rakhine state, which the government has denied.", "title": "Doctors Without Borders Expelled From Myanmar", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/doctors-without-borders-expelled-myanmar/180820/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Myanmar-Protest_Webf-1-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-28T09:33:07-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The decision came after the humanitarian group reported it treated nearly two dozen Rohingya Muslim victims of communal violence in Rakhine state, which the government has denied.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Myanmar-Protest_Webf-1.jpg", "title": "Doctors Without Borders Expelled From Myanmar", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Rakhine", "published_time": "2014-03-01T05:00:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-28T09:33:07-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17ac\"", "article_summary": "ANGON, Myanmar (AP) \u2014 Doctors Without Borders said Friday it has been expelled from Myanmar and that tens of thousands of lives are at risk.\nSince the violence erupted in June 2012, Doctors Without Borders has worked in 15 camps for the displaced people in Rakhine state.\nDoctors Without Borders Expelled From MyanmarThe decision came after the humanitarian group reported it treated nearly two dozen Rohingya Muslim victims of communal violence in Rakhine state, which the government has denied.\nMyanmar\u2019s presidential spokesman Ye Htut had criticized Doctors Without Borders in the Myanmar Freedom newspaper for hiring \u201cBengalis,\u201d the term the government uses for Rohingya, and lacked transparency in its work.\nDoctors Without Borders said it treated 22 injured and traumatized Rohingya."}
