Chris Noth, currently starring in \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d played Detective Mike Logan on \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order: Criminal Intent,\u201d and \u201cMr. Big\u201d on \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Noth has now outed himself \u2014 as yet another liberal. Worse, his moronic anti-GOP, anti-tea party comments put him into the category of \u201cbrain dead\u201d Hollywood liberal, to use an expression from playwright David Mamet.\n\nNoth, unhappy with the partial government shutdown, tweeted this thoughtful analysis: \u201cHighest level of racism was shown yesterday when Republicans forced a shutdown of our government. Mostly because our President is black.\u201d Naturally, he weighed on the tea party: \u201cEvery tea party member should be horsewhipped.\u201d Get it? Opposition to Obamacare \u2026 is racist!\n\nMamet, in 2008, wrote an article for the \u201cVillage Voice\u201d called \u201cWhy I Am No Longer a Brain-Dead Liberal.\u201d He described his conversion from the typical Noth-like Hollywood mindset:\n\n\u201cAs a child of the \u201960s, I accepted as an article of faith that government is corrupt, that business is exploitative and that people are generally good at heart. These cherished precepts had, over the years, become ingrained as increasingly impracticable prejudices. Why do I say impracticable? Because although I still held these beliefs, I no longer applied them in my life. \u2026 I began reading not only the economics of Thomas Sowell (our greatest contemporary philosopher) but Milton Friedman, Paul Johnson and Shelby Steele, and a host of conservative writers, and found that I agreed with them: A free-market understanding of the world meshes more perfectly with my experience than that idealistic vision I called liberalism.\u201d\n\nNoth confidently displayed his bigotry toward Republicans and the tea party because he knows that where he works most people think just like that \u2014 or they\u2019re are smart enough to shut up if they don\u2019t.\n\nBen Shapiro, attorney and talk show host, wrote \u201cPrimetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV.\u201d Conservative actors, writers, producers and staffers, Shapiro writes, are blatantly discriminated against: \u201cThe television industry is \u2026 ideologically xenophobic. Most conservatives in Hollywood don\u2019t work today, at least not openly. That\u2019s not because conservatives are untalented or unqualified or incapable of empathy, as many on the left ridiculously contend. It\u2019s because liberals employ a mirror form of McCarthyism on a large scale.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Noth, many Americans feel hostility toward Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., and the House Republicans, and blame them for the partial shutdown. But Ted Cruz led the charge \u201cmostly because our President is black\u201d?!\n\nSince 1976, there have been 17 \u201cshutdowns\u201d \u2014 not counting the latest \u2014 for a total of 110 days. In 15 of these cases, Democrats controlled the House. Were the Dems \u201chostage takers,\u201d \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201canarchists\u201d?\n\nThe shutdown was about Obamacare. Teamsters head James Hoffa, an Obamacare supporter, wrote a letter to Obama in which he said that Obamacare threatened the 40-hour workweek. Warren Buffett agreed that Obamacare should be \u201cscrapped,\u201d and he warned of our healthcare market becoming \u201cless and less competitive.\u201d Did they criticize Obamacare \u201cmostly because our President is black? Noth believes Republican/tea party opposition to Obama is rooted in racism. How many of his Hollywood homies back Obama because he is black? Did Noth tweet about fellow actor Samuel L. Jackson? Jackson explained why he supported the then-Senator from Illinois in 2008: \u201cI voted for Barack because he was black. \u2018Cuz that\u2019s why other folks vote for other people \u2014 because they look like them.\u201d\n\nSince Noth is concerned about \u201cracism,\u201d one wonders how he feels about a recent poll that asked Hispanic, black and whites this question: As between Hispanics, blacks and whites, which group is most racist? More Americans (37 percent) believe most blacks are racist, versus 15 percent saying most whites are racist and 17 percent believing Hispanics are racist. Even blacks consider blacks the most racist. Thirty-one percent of blacks, according to the poll, said blacks are the most racist, 24 percent said whites and 15 percent said Hispanics. Mr. Noth, does this mean that blacks\u2019 hostility toward President George W. Bush was \u201cmostly because our President was white\u201d?\n\nPolls have long asked Americans if they would vote for a black person for president. In 1960, about 40 percent said yes. By 1980, 80 percent said yes. More recently, in a 2006 Times/Bloomberg poll, 97 percent said yes. But more Democrats (at 4 percent) than Republicans (at 3 percent) ruled out voting for a black candidate.\n\nReckless charges of racism are standard operating procedure for the Hollywood left. But the election and re-election of the first black president presents a challenge. When the evidence demonstrates the declining significance of race, how can leftists continue to complain about its alleged significance? Answer: expand the definition of \u201cracism.\u201d At one time, hostility toward a race made one a racist. Today, mere opposition to a policy \u2014 providing a black president is on the other side \u2014 makes one not only a racist, but one in need of a \u201chorsewhipping.\u201d\n\nLarry Elder is a best-selling author and radio talk-show host.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Noth has now outed himself -- as yet another liberal.", "title": "Chris Noth: Another 'brain dead' actor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Good-Wife-Ep-23-3-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/10/24/chris-noth-another-brain-dead-actor/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Noth has now outed himself -- as yet another liberal.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Good-Wife-Ep-23-3-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Noth has now outed himself -- as yet another liberal."}}, "article_summary": "Worse, his moronic anti-GOP, anti-tea party comments put him into the category of \u201cbrain dead\u201d Hollywood liberal, to use an expression from playwright David Mamet.\nBut the election and re-election of the first black president presents a challenge.\nMostly because our President is black.\u201d Naturally, he weighed on the tea party: \u201cEvery tea party member should be horsewhipped.\u201d Get it?\nMore Americans (37 percent) believe most blacks are racist, versus 15 percent saying most whites are racist and 17 percent believing Hispanics are racist.\nMr. Noth, does this mean that blacks\u2019 hostility toward President George W.
