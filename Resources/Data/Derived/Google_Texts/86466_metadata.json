It would raise the monthly premium to $331.65, up from $212.44. The rate applies to a \"silver\" plan for a 21-year-old non-smoker.\n\nHowever, if a 21-year-old wants the lowest possible price in 2016, an offering from Highmark is available for $228.58 per month.\n\nRELATED: Here is an in-depth look at the requests and the reasons insurers are giving for requested increases.\n\nProposed 2016 premiums are available on the website of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, which is reviewing the requests, and has authority to reject requests it deems unjustified. The premiums shown reflect the cost before government subsidies received by about 80 percent of Pennsylvania customers.\n\nA look at premium requests for plans available in the midstate shows steep increases requested for some plans. Yet other plans, which may not have seemed like such a great deal last year, would see only modest increases, or decreases. The figures are for \"silver plans,\" which are one of four prices categories \u2014 the others are bronze, gold and platinum. Silver plans cover about 70 percent of medical costs. The plans are sold in the federally-run online marketplace known as the exchange.\n\nFor example, a silver plan from Capital BlueCross that cost $351.62 per month for a 40-year-old non-smoker in 2015 would cost $334.87 in 2016.\n\nStill, that's significantly more that the cheapest plan available in 2015, which was from Highmark and cost $271.50 per month.\n\nHowever, someone looking for the lowest premium could select a Highmark plan that's new for 2016, and which would cost $292.13 per month.\n\nAnd 2016 premiums will drop for those willing to go with an HMO plan, which typically have more restrictions than the other plans, called PPO plans.\n\nIn the seven-county region that includes Dauphin, Cumberland, Perry and Lebanon, a 40-year-old non-smoker could get coverage from Keystone Health Plan Central for $217.04, down from $229.55 in 2015.\n\nProposed premiums show similar fluctuations in the York, Lancaster and Berks county areas.\n\nInsurance commissioners in Pennsylvania and around the county are reviewing premium requests. Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, increase requests of 10 percent or more are subject to review and approval.\n\nAround the country, premium requests for amounts well into the double digits are making headlines, and providing fuel for arguments against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet advocates are stressing that other plans are requesting much more moderate increases, or even decreases. They are advising consumers that, in order to get the best price, they must be willing to switch to a different plan. The downside to switching is that the new plan might have a different network, meaning it might not include the same doctors and hospitals as the previous plan.\n\nPennsylvania, unlike most states, has published requests for less than 10 percent in addition to those for more than 10 percent.\n\nHere are proposed 2016 premiums for people living in Dauphin, Cumberland, Perry, Lebanon, Franklin, Fulton and Juniata counties.\n\nPPO plans for a 21-year-old non-smoker:\n\nCapital BlueCross: $262.03, down from $275.13\n\nGeisinger Quality Options: $331.65, up from $212.44\n\nHighmark Health
