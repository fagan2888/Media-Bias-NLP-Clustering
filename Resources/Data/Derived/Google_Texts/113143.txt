Sasse self-described “Anti-Obamacare Candidate”

WASHINGTON – The National Right to Life Committee, the nation’s oldest and largest pro-life group, today endorsed Ben Sasse for the U.S. Senate.

“Ben Sasse is committed to protecting the right to life of America’s most vulnerable citizens,” said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president. “Ben Sasse will use his knowledge and expertise to strengthen a culture of life throughout the nation and in Congress.”

From 2006 until 2007, Sasse advised the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services about health policy issues including affordable healthcare access. Nominated by President George W. Bush in 2007, Sasse served as the principal advisor to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on policy development, serving from 2007 until the end of the Bush Administration in January 2009. In 2009, Ben Sasse became president of Midland University.

In 2010, Democrats in Congress voted to enact Obamacare, which provides government funding for health plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will result in rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. In announcing his senate candidacy, Ben Sasse described himself as “the anti-Obamacare candidate.” One of the leading critics of Obamacare, he is deeply committed to help reverse the abortion-expanding and rationing effects of that law.

Ben Sasse is needed in the U.S. Senate as we work toward restoring legal protection to unborn children threatened by abortion, and extending protections to the medically dependent and disabled whose lives are threatened by assisted suicide and euthanasia.

“Ben Sasse believes even one abortion is too many. The most vulnerable members of our human family will be well served by his election to the U.S. Senate,” said National Right to Life President Carol Tobias.
