Just. So. Excited. That. Hillary. Clinton. Is. Ready. To. Be. My. Champion.\n\nI mean, she says she\u2019s ready, what with \u201cthe deck\u2026 still stacked in favor of those at the top.\u201d\n\nOh, ma\u2019am, we \u201ceveryday Americans,\u201d I can tell you, have had it up to here with the \u201ctop\u201d people running everything. We\u2019re ready for a president with a family net worth of only $13 million: somewhere in the Clinton range, we\u2019re informed.\n\nSomething else we\u2019re ready for is a president whose speech-giving fees, pre-campaign, were a modest $200,000: $10,000 a minute or thereabouts; no more than your Aunt Bessie would spend on a new Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nExcited? That doesn\u2019t begin to express how us everyday folks \u2014 scuse my stomach growling, Miz Clinton, we gave up breakfast so we could pay our Obamacare premiums \u2014 what I was trying to say back there was that us everyday people appreciate how you got a deep feeling for us. And for our votes.\n\nAnd\u2026 and\u2026 what more is there to say about the Clinton campaign? Not a lot, when it comes to substance. Twenty-three years into the Clinton Era, whose opening was marked by Bill\u2019s first election to the White House, we know no more than, in substantive terms, we ever knew about this remarkable and persistent couple.\n\nThe main thing we know is, they won\u2019t get off the stage. They can\u2019t. They wouldn\u2019t know where to go or what to do, once off.\n\nTheir mission \u2014 because they always present it as such \u2014 is to devise missions whose performance keeps the curtain from closing on them.\n\nIt is a sad thing to say in the context of the family\u2019s latest bid for longevity, but Mrs. Clinton is old news.\n\nWe think the Bushes have been around too long? What about \u2014 to keep the spotlight on its present object \u2014 Mrs. Clinton? What is her reason for non-retirement? Is it to guide our nation through a unique moment that this unique figure understands uniquely? If such is the case, none of the uniqueness shines through the darkness. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton logged a lot of airline miles. As, previously, senator from New York, she left no stamp on public affairs. She came; she served; she moved on.\n\nSpeaking of \u201cmoving on,\u201d it\u2019s the Clinton formula for dismissing complaints about questionable activities and performances, such as her mysterious profits in Whitewater investments, such as imputed negligence in guarding the safety of our ambassadorial staff in Benghazi, Libya. It all got in the news. It got talked about \u2014 isn\u2019t that enough? She bids us move on. The Clinton motif is always \u201cforward.\u201d Forward toward what? To more of the Clintons\u2019 exquisite company \u2014 what more could be desired?\n\nI was feeling morose about the likelihood of the Clintons\u2019 championing us, world without end, Amen. Then I caught the Masters final. Along came some real excitement \u2014 not just the usual blather about Tiger or even about the easily more enjoyable Phil Mickelson.\n\nNo, the excitement concerned Jordan Spieth, who at age 21 exhibited a polish and skill and steadiness and determination we\u2019d not previously had occasion to admire. Oh, was it fun to admire! Fun, real fun: something genuinely new \u2014 no ordinary nag here. Think, rather, of Secretariat in the Belmont: 30 lengths in front: sleek, unstoppable.\n\nAnd with it all, nice and amiable. At one point, I caught from Spieth\u2019s direction a mic\u2019d \u201cGosh,\u201d rather than the \u201c%#!$\u201d occasionally associated with the vanishing champion whose bogey putts the Masters commentators insisted on noting for our edification.\n\nAnd I thought: Gosh. Wow. Something is altogether new here. Something that captures the imagination, leaving the past \u2014 the good, the bad, all of it \u2014 in the dust.\n\nHave the Republicans a Spieth? Hard to say at this point. Rubio? Walker? Someone else? We can\u2019t tell yet. We know the Democrats lack one. What they have is \u2014 sigh! \u2014 Hillary. Here she comes, down the fairway, the usual gleam in her eye. I take pleasure in noting on behalf of everyday folk everywhere that our political golf game is still on the front nine.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea82\"", "article_summary": "As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton logged a lot of airline miles.\nWhat about \u2014 to keep the spotlight on its present object \u2014 Mrs. Clinton?\nIt is a sad thing to say in the context of the family\u2019s latest bid for longevity, but Mrs. Clinton is old news.\nWe\u2019re ready for a president with a family net worth of only $13 million: somewhere in the Clinton range, we\u2019re informed.\nNo, the excitement concerned Jordan Spieth, who at age 21 exhibited a polish and skill and steadiness and determination we\u2019d not previously had occasion to admire."}
