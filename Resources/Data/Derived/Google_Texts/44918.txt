SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BioUtah today announced that the organization’s 5th annual Utah Life Science Summit set new standards for attendance and sponsorship support. More than 400 registered for the multitrack, all-day annual event, with 375-plus in attendance. In addition, 2014 Summit-specific sponsorships eclipsed all previous years.

The Summit was the culmination of a highly eventful and productive year for BioUtah. Other 2014 highlights included:

A signature victory in the 2014 Utah Legislative Session with overwhelming passage of the BioUtah-sponsored Senate Bill 263: Small Business Innovation & Research, which changed the nature of Utah’s Technology Commercialization & Innovation Program. Other significant collaborative legislative wins included creation of the Utah STEM Action Center and continued support for the Utah Science Technology & Research Initiative (USTAR).

Growing visibility on the national stage through congressional fly-ins and briefings with AdvaMed, MDMA and BIO. BioUtah actively participates in crucial collaborative federal efforts, such as repeal the Medical Device Excise Tax within the Affordable Care Act, FDA reform and CMS reimbursement issues. BioUtah CEO Kimball Thomson conducted a Senate briefing about industry/government collaboration in April. The event was a collaboration between 14 state and regional life science industry associations.

BioUtah’s June State of the Sector event, part of the association’s Masters Series, drew more than 100 attendees for a discussion about the dynamic global life science environment, and Utah’s emerging opportunities in this rapidly evolving marketplace.

BioUtah made the appointment in June of a new chair and vice chair of the BioUtah Executive Board. Serial medtech entrepreneur Rich Linder, CEO of CoNextions Medical and co-founder of BioUtah, was named as chair. George Hamilton, VP of Business Development for Intermountain Healthcare, is the association’s vice chair. Merit Medical founder and CEO Fred Lampropoulos was the outgoing chair of BioUtah, while Nelson Labs CEO Jeff Nelson served as vice chair.

The association’s August International Regulatory Pathways conference sold out, with more than 100 in attendance.

BioUtah partnered with association leaders in Arizona, California, Colorado and Idaho to hold the first White Hat Investors Conference. Four Utah life science companies presented to a group of top life science investors.

A growing number of additional key strategic partnerships, including: a scholarship program sponsored by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and the Utah STEM Action Center to recognize and support promising high school students; a jobs and career board in concert with HireLifeScience.com; an education and training partnership with LifeCollaborative; and a series of compliance clinics in concert with MasterControl, PathWise and others.

“It has been an exceptional year for BioUtah in the evolution of our programs and relationships alike,” said Kimball Thompson, President and CEO of BioUtah. “With the vision, talent and leadership on our executive board and the deep community support we are receiving, BioUtah is positioned to achieve extraordinary growth and impact in the years ahead.”

BioUtah plans to build on its 2014 success with several major ongoing initiatives: the Utah Life Science Report, a weekly Internet radio show that will debut in January 2015; a glossy annual magazine, Life Science Utah, slated to debut in Q1 2015; and an investment capital mentoring partnership with the Wayne Brown Institute, which will serve start-up and growth-stage Utah life science companies and entrepreneurs.
