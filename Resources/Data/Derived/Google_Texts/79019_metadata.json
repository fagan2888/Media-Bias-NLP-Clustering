(AP) - A community college in Reno is becoming the first in Nevada to establish a new four-year degree in logistics to help meet anticipated demand for skilled workers at Tesla Motors and other high-tech companies moving distribution hubs to the region.\n\nThe state Board of Regents on Friday approved the Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Logistics Operations Management as well as a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Emergency Management Homeland Security - Public Safety.\n\nThe new programs will be offered for the first time at Truckee Meadows Community College in the fall semester of 2016.\n\nTruckee Meadows President Maria Sheehan said it\u2019s the responsibility of community colleges to respond to changing economic climates as quickly as possible. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the exciting part - when you can do something that is responsive that\u2019s going to address certainly jobs for the future and economic revitalization,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bachelor\u2019s degree in logistics will train students for operations planning, warehousing, sustainability, safety and operations.\n\n\u201cLogistics students have not had an option to continue to bachelor\u2019s studies in Nevada, and we want to keep these talented students in the state,\u201d said Mari Murgolo-Poore, dean of the college\u2019s Business Division.\n\nThe importance of such a program grew last fall when Tesla announced it\u2019s building a $5 billion gigafactory at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center along Interstate 80 east of Reno to manufacture lithium batteries to power its electric cars.\n\nThe community college said the Tesla gigafactory will bring 3,600 construction jobs and 6,500 factory jobs to northern Nevada in the next three to four years. The majority of those jobs will require more than a high school diploma, school officials said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an absolute tsunami coming of opportunities,\u201d said Michael Pender, the managing director of Porous Power Technologies who works with companies that are moving into the area. The vast majority are looking for a trained, experienced workforce, he said.\n\nApplied logistics is an integral part of all distribution hubs, Pender said, and that\u2019s why his original company decided to locate in the area in the late 1990s. \u201cDistribution and logistics are key to so many industries that are here now and industries that are coming,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A community college in Reno is becoming the first in Nevada to establish a new four-year degree in logistics to help meet anticipated demand for skilled workers at Tesla Motors and other high-tech companies moving distribution hubs to the region.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/13/eyeing-tesla-tmcc-offers-new-4-year-degree-in-logi/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A community college in Reno is becoming the first in Nevada to establish a new four-year degree in logistics to help meet anticipated demand for skilled workers at Tesla Motors and other high-tech companies moving distribution hubs to the region.", "title": "Eyeing Tesla, college offers new 4-year degree in logistics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A community college in Reno is becoming the first in Nevada to establish a new four-year degree in logistics to help meet anticipated demand for skilled workers at Tesla Motors and other high-tech com", "card": "summary", "title": "Eyeing Tesla, college offers new 4-year degree in logistics"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDistribution and logistics are key to so many industries that are here now and industries that are coming,\u201d he said.\nThe bachelor\u2019s degree in logistics will train students for operations planning, warehousing, sustainability, safety and operations.\nThe state Board of Regents on Friday approved the Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Logistics Operations Management as well as a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Emergency Management Homeland Security - Public Safety.\nThe community college said the Tesla gigafactory will bring 3,600 construction jobs and 6,500 factory jobs to northern Nevada in the next three to four years.\nThe new programs will be offered for the first time at Truckee Meadows Community College in the fall semester of 2016."}
