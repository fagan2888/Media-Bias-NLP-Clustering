Bernard Sanders unapologetically describes himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d prompting much discussion among press and public about the candidate\u2019s political pedigree. But wait. Mr. Sanders has also attracted the attention of some other socialists, like the New York-based Socialist Party USA, where the motto is, \u201cLet\u2019s build a future worthy of our dreams.\u201d They too have a presidential candidate in mind for 2016. That would be Emidio \u201cMimi\u201d Soltysik, who has a thought or two about Mr. Sanders.\n\n\u201cWhat I see is a candidate who\u2019s running on the Democratic Party ticket. To me, Sanders sounds more like a progressive Democrat/social Democrat. I don\u2019t see him putting forth a socialist proposal. I\u2019m not seeing him talk about workers owning the means of production. I don\u2019t see imperialism as a part of any socialist platform, period. So I think that there are some very fundamental differences,\u201d Mr. Soltysik recently told The Socialist, the party\u2019s official publication.\n\nThen there is the Party for Socialism and Liberation, founded 12 years ago with offices in San Francisco and the nation\u2019s capital. They also have been sizing up Mr. Sanders and they also have own presidential candidate.\n\nSEE ALSO: After Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire loss, Obama says voters are \u2018scared\u2019\n\n\u201cThere have been no signs that the Sanders campaign\u2019s momentum will let up. For a candidate to have gone from being considered non-serious to a real contender so explosively is testament to the depth and breadth of anger at Wall Street and the political establishment that exists in society. It also indicates serious weaknesses in the Clinton political machine, despite its vast network of contacts and lavish funding, including $21.4 million from the financial sector at the end of 2015,\u201d says Walter Smolarek, managing editor for Liberation, the party\u2019s newspaper. \u201cThe Sanders campaign also had to contend with increasingly hostile coverage from major media outlets and the mobilization of the Democratic establishment in Clinton\u2019s defense.\u201d\n\nAnd their candidate? Gloria La Riva, a San Francisco-based labor, community and antiwar activist, is pushing a 10-point campaign agenda that includes an end to capitalism, free health care, education and affordable housing, and \u201cmaking a job a constitutional right.\u201d\n\nBUMPER STICKER-TO-BE\n\nSEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane: Madeleine Albright\u2019s comments \u2018unfortunate and disturbing\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough of those guns and large sodas, America. Bloomberg 2016. He\u2019ll save you from your own bad judgment.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Suggested campaign slogan for potential presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, from National Review contributing editor Jim Geraghty.\n\nThe former three-term New York City mayor (who\u2019s worth $40 billion by the way) has commissioned a second national poll to gauge his chances in an often chaotic presidential race. Will he skitter into the race?\n\n\u201cMike is itching to do it,\u201d a confidant of Mr. Bloomberg told the New York Post, hinting that the media kingpin believes there\u2019s a spot on the slate for centrist alternative.\n\nABOUT THE WOMEN VOTING FOR WOMEN THING\n\nYeah, well so much for that. Rasmussen Reports has just released a new poll asking voters if women have an \u201cobligation\u201d to vote for a woman candidate, as suggested in a recent campaign event for Hillary Clinton. Only 4 percent of the respondents said it\u2019s more important for women to vote for a woman candidate because she is a female. Ninety-one percent disagree and place more importance on where the woman candidate stands on the issues.\n\nThe survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted Feb. 9-10.\n\nWEEKEND CANDIDATE TRACKER\n\nThe ninth Republican presidential debate looms for the six remaining GOP hopefuls on Saturday, who are in a loose orbit around South Carolina. The state\u2019s primary is not for another week, but there\u2019s still much to do.\n\nFront-runner Donald Trump arrives for the bout from previous campaign rallies in Louisiana and Florida. Sen. Ted Cruz is all about faithful moments \u2014 his four events this weekend take place at churches. The Texan will also \u201cshare his testimony\u201d at the Community Bible Church in Beaufort and appear at the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University, as will Ben Carson. Mr. Carson also has a quartet of events, including a public Valentine\u2019s Day Dinner with his wife Candy on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, who has been campaigning all week with South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, appears at seven town halls this weekend and will also speak at the aforementioned presidential forum. A recharged Jeb Bush has nine events, Gov. John Kasich four \u2014 though he\u2019s due for a meet-and-greet at Mutt\u2019s Famous Barbecue in Mauldin. Mr. Kasich is off to Michigan by Sunday.\n\nFresh from the seventh Democratic debate, the Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders are hitting the road. Mrs. Clinton spends the weekend at multiple \u201cGet Out the Caucus\u201d events in Las Vegas before bolting for Florida on Monday. Mr. Sanders is in Colorado this weekend, hosting a \u201cFuture to Believe In\u201d rally.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: \u201cFour over Four Victorian:, built in 1895 in Winnsboro, South Carolina.
