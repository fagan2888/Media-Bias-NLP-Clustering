CAHC\u2019s funding stream had been justified for years as allowing this private nonprofit to help people obtain health insurance.\n\nHowever, there were several problems with this contract. First, there is no need for it, especially now. Anybody seeking health insurance coverage can go to www.healthcare.gov, which is the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nThis site has been promoted and advertised to the tune of billions of dollars, and everybody is now mandated to have insurance coverage. Those using the exchange who find themselves eligible for Medicaid are directed to DHHS.\n\nCAHC is nothing but an unnecessary middleman in the cog of Maine\u2019s health care system. State government has far too many government employees and contracted organizations like CAHC with too little work to do. It\u2019s time to cut the fat, and that\u2019s exactly what DHHS did.\n\nEven if CAHC provided a needed service to DHHS, they have shown how ineffective and wasteful they are.\n\nOne of CAHC\u2019s missions is outreach, yet they spent just $2,000 of their $800,000 budget on advertising in 2013.\n\nTake a guess at how much CAHC paid its executive director. The answer? More than $120,000 to run an office with some half-dozen employees.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew makes roughly the same amount to run a $3.5 billion, 3,300-person government agency.\n\nCAHC\u2019s mission is statewide outreach, but their Facebook page has fewer \u201clikes\u201d than the Madawaska Police Department. So what are they doing with all that time and money?\n\nOne of the worst-kept secrets in Augusta is that many of the nonprofit organizations receiving state funding have two stated goals. One is to justify taxpayer subsidies \u2014 health care outreach in the case of CAHC, or legal aid for the poor in the case of Maine Equal Justice Partners.\n\nThe other is a more unstated goal of lobbying the Legislature and the media for left-wing policy initiatives.\n\nCAHC says it needs this $400,000 in order to help people \u201cnavigate\u201d the health insurance system \u2014 never mind that ObamaCare is already pumping millions into \u201cnavigator\u201d groups \u2014 yet their hearts and minds are really in the fight to push socialized medicine on Maine taxpayers.\n\nThat\u2019s why they spend most of their time lobbying for Medicaid expansion, single-payer health care, or the now-defunct Dirigo Health, and opposing virtually any market-based reforms that would drive down costs in our health care system.\n\nThis mindset is no more apparent than when CAHC advertises job openings. On a liberal jobs board, they require \u201ca commitment to social justice,\u201d which is code for \u201cwe only hire Democrats.\u201d Why would a \u201ccommitment to social justice\u201d be required of someone answering phones to help people find health insurance?\n\nFrankly, CAHC\u2019s primary mission is self-preservation. In 2012, when Maine reformed its health insurance regulations, lawmakers saw fit to put industry experts on the insurance rate review panel instead of the historically favored left-wing activist organizations like CAHC and Maine People\u2019s Alliance.\n\nThis jeopardized their grant funding, so they got a politician to introduce a bill to restore the seat for which the organization is eminently unqualified.\n\nThis time they\u2019ve tapped two state representatives who serve on the Health and Human Services Committee, Karen Vachon, R-Scarborough, and Patty Hymanson, D-York, persuading them to introduce legislation to force DHHS to continue paying CAHC $400,000 per year for services DHHS doesn\u2019t need.\n\nCAHC is a wasteful nonprofit \u2014 one of many at the government trough in Augusta \u2014 that is more concerned about pushing left-wing ideology than they are about helping people with health insurance.\n\nIf you\u2019re as concerned about reforming Augusta as I am, contact your state lawmakers and urge them to oppose the Vachon/Hymanson bill to force DHHS to subsidize CAHC.\n\nLawrence Lockman, R-Amherst, is serving his second term in the Maine House of Representatives (District 137), and serves as the ranking Republican on the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development committee.
