Obviously, this tactic has been around forever \u2014 but there\u2019s a definite increase in those who spout doomsday rhetoric and those who believe it.\n\nReal education\u2019s taking a back seat. Where is skepticism, or even normal curiosity? Hordes of speakers have parroted the phrase \u201cjob-killing Obamacare\u201d for years, not in the least slowed down by our country\u2019s unemployment numbers steadily falling to 5 percent (Romney promised to get down to 6 percent, and his audiences cheered wildly). The fact that jobs don\u2019t pay as much as they used to is another subject \u2014 automation, outsourcing, or the collapse of unions \u2014 unconnected to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump, though right now, with the help of the media, he\u2019s making the most noise. Now that he\u2019s been \u201cwinning, winning,\u201d as Cokey Roberts observed, \u201che\u2019s not so funny anymore.\u201d But Senator Ted Cruz is less funny, and more scary. With his \u201ccarpet bombing till the sands glow\u201d threats, he sounds more like North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un wiggling his nuclear trigger finger than someone who claims to have \u201ca personal relationship with Jesus Christ.\u201d This, too, brings enormous applause, so my thought is, Do they understand what he\u2019s saying? And if so, Would they really want him for president?\n\nIn a recent letter to CL\u2019s editor-in-chief David Warner, a reader named John attacked me for some \u201canti-Trump\u201d remarks I\u2019d written (though I was quoting Republican criticisms). John\u2019s clearest sentence went as follows: \u201cThe reason this country is in such decline is because of all the left wing teachers in this country are [sic] indoctrinating the youth into your wacko ideology which has been proven time and time again to be a complete failure.\u201d\n\nWell, no details are given, but he seems to be talking about the wacko ideology that brought us Social Security, Medicare, health care, fair labor standards (including the banning of child labor), civil rights law, gay rights decisions, and climate change awareness. There are other laws I\u2019d guess he wouldn\u2019t like, but it\u2019s hard to say, because all he tells us is that the \u201cideology\u201d is something that\u2019s been proved \u201ctime and time again\u201d to be a total bust.\n\nIs he talking about Germany? Norway? France? We\u2019re clearly doing better than they are these days, thanks to President Obama\u2019s \u201cideologies,\u201d though they remain charming countries to visit. It\u2019s true that most \u2014 by no means all \u2014 college teachers are on the left, but that\u2019s natural: They read more. They speak more languages. They believe in climate change. It\u2019s hard to figure where John\u2019s overstated and overheated vitriol comes from.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s been bullied by thugs with accents. He thinks Obama\u2019s a Muslim and Clinton\u2019s a Nazi, but I\u2019d gently urge him to check Wikipedia or Politifact or just get out a bit more. I don\u2019t know if John has lost his wallet, his job or his mind. If any of these dire things are true, and this isn\u2019t just a snit, trust me, John, both President Obama and I wish you better luck.\n\nIt sounds to me that he\u2019s picked up the frumious tone of Senator Cruz, our own Bandersnatch (via Lewis Carroll), who\u2019s coldly racing Trump to scoop up the \u201cangry vote.\u201d In my article I implied the acceptance of crazy ideas and general name-calling \u2014 even Marco Rubio has joined in now \u2014 might be attributable to faulty information pooling in our schools and living rooms. Bad manners breed in stagnant water like zika-bearing mosquitoes.\n\nUh-oh. I\u2019ve just been bitten, so I\u2019ll join John and the others, and end with a quote from one of my favorite authors:\n\nSir, I admit your gen\u2019ral rule\n\nThat every poet is a fool;\n\nBut you yourself may serve to show it,\n\nThat every fool is not a poet.\n\n\u2014\u201cEpigram from the French\u201d and (above) from \u201cEpistles to Several Persons,\u201d by Alexander Pope (1688-1744).\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Tis education forms the common mind,\n\n\n\n  Just as the twig is bent, the tree\u2019s inclin\u2019d.\n\n\nIn a recent column about Donald Trump, I suggested th...", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://r1.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2016/03/960w/news_pn_030316.jpg", "site_name": "Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay", "description": "\u2018Tis education forms the common mind,\n\n\n\n  Just as the twig is bent, the tree\u2019s inclin\u2019d.\n\n\nIn a recent column about Donald Trump, I suggested th...", "title": "Poet's Notebook: Stampeding elephants"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "7ehqC5TVlujj_KkCw_cMXSyKukkqxKv9SOkcxE1CbCI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24f5\"", "article_summary": "Poet's Notebook: Stampeding elephants\u2018Tis education forms the common mind,Just as the twig is bent, the tree\u2019s inclin\u2019d.\nNow that he\u2019s been \u201cwinning, winning,\u201d as Cokey Roberts observed, \u201che\u2019s not so funny anymore.\u201d But Senator Ted Cruz is less funny, and more scary.\nIt\u2019s true that most \u2014 by no means all \u2014 college teachers are on the left, but that\u2019s natural: They read more.\nIt\u2019s not just Trump, though right now, with the help of the media, he\u2019s making the most noise.\nObviously, this tactic has been around forever \u2014 but there\u2019s a definite increase in those who spout doomsday rhetoric and those who believe it."}
