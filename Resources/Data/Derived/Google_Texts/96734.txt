My interview was misrepresented, and only a portion of my comments were used as a headline to give the impression that I was condemning members of the LGBT community living in their own truth. In the interview, I express I was raised as a child to have a certain set of beliefs, but my beliefs have evolved significantly as my own personal relationship with Christ has increased.

Shepherd told an interviewer that she was brought up in the Christian faith which believes homosexuality is a sin.

This is something that they teach in churches. So it’s something that I grew up believing,” she told [Fusion host Alicia] Menendez last week….”I might not agree with your lifestyle, but I love you,” she continued. “You may not agree with my lifestyle, but you love me … I don’t say it’s a choice. If you tell me, ‘Sherri, I was born gay.’ Okay. I’m not gonna argue with you, because I can’t tell you how you feel and what’s going on inside. I’m trying to make it into heaven by the skin of my teeth … I don’t know who I’m gonna see. So if you tell me you’re born [gay], I’m not gonna argue with you. And I absolutely respect you for that. I just ask that people respect how I feel, [I] respect how you feel and we can have a great dialogue.

Robertson, a Christian, stated that homosexual acts are sinful in an interview with GQ magazine and was briefly suspended from his hit reality show Duck Dynasty as a result. Robertson refused to apologies for his comments, and the suspension was lifted in less than two weeks.
