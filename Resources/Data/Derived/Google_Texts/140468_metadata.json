Representative Ken Buck (R-Colorado) tweeted a picture of himself and Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) holding Buck\u2019s AR-15. The problem is that the picture was taken in Buck\u2019s House offices.\n\n.@TGowdySC stopped by today and we got a photo with my AR-15 #2A #SecondAmendment @TPPatriots @TeaPartyExpress pic.twitter.com/FhnAlyqTeW \u2014 Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) April 16, 2015\n\nAs The Hill is reporting, somebody sent this information off to the authorities and an investigation is underway.\n\nPolice in Washington, D.C., have been referred materials for a possible investigation into two Republican congressmen who posed for a picture with an assault rifle in a House office building\u2026 Having the AR-15 in the District could be a violation of the city\u2019s strict gun laws, and the city attorney general\u2019s office has referred the matter to police, a spokesman told The Hill. \u201cThe matter has been referred to the Metropolitan Police Department for further investigation,\u201d he said. Buck said in the tweet the assault rifle is his and the picture was taken after Gowdy \u201cstopped by.\u201d\n\nThis could turn out to be a problem for Congressman Buck because the authorities there may not have a problem looking the other way for a rather liberal friendly member of the network media, but if they get their claws into a Republican things may get far more serious. Looking at the current D.C. gun laws, they do prohibit the registration and possession of \u201can assault weapon\u201d and a .pdf of the specific banned weapons does include the AR-15 series, with penalties of a fine up to $1000 and a year in jail for a first offense.\n\nBuck explained that the weapon is inoperable because, \u201cthe bolt carrier assembly is not in the rifle; it is in fact in Colorado.\u201d We\u2019ll need some lawyers versed in the specifics of these laws to make a determination but I\u2019m not sure if that qualifies. It may indeed be true that \u201cthe\u201d bolt carrier assembly which came with the rifle is in Colorado, but a replacement assembly could be inserted, right? On a quick check I don\u2019t see any cases which have been argued on a gun possession charge involving a weapon with any components missing.\n\nAt first blush I can certainly sympathize with Congressman Buck. These laws are ridiculous and the ones talking about so called \u201cassault weapons\u201d are doubly so. But from a strictly conservative perspective, we don\u2019t fight against gun grabbing laws by violating them, we fight to get them changed. While the laws are on the books we\u2019re still obligated to follow them, particularly if we work in the chamber responsible for crafting laws. Perhaps there is an out here or, failing that, the authorities may take all the particulars into consideration and opt not to pursue this as they did with David Gregory. But given Ken Buck\u2019s high profile position I wouldn\u2019t bet the ranch on it.\n\nUPDATE: No action to be taken.\n\nAfter consulting with the Capitol Police, D.C. Metro Police decided to take no action, officials in the city said\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Neither locked nor loaded", "title": "Ken Buck investigated for having an AR-15 in his DC office Update: Dismissed", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/22/ken-buck-investigated-for-having-an-ar-15-in-his-dc-office/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T15:01:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T16:52:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "ar-15, assault weapons, Colorado, gun control, gun rights, guns, Trey Gowdy,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Representative Ken Buck (R-Colorado) tweeted a picture of himself and Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) holding Buck\u2019s AR-15.\nAt first blush I can certainly sympathize with Congressman Buck.\nAfter consulting with the Capitol Police, D.C.
