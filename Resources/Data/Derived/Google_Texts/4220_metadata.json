But lately, he\u2019s gotten attention for online posts mocking Republicans, most recently a fake craigslist help-wanted ad for a House speaker following GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s abrupt departure from the speaker race Thursday, Oct. 8.\n\n\u201cMost Congressmen Are Boring. This One is Funny -- On Purpose,\u201d read a headline from a 2013 profile of Takano by the liberal magazine \u201cMother Jones.\u201d\n\nTakano\u2019s jabs at the GOP are a double-edged sword, said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College.\n\n\u201cOn the plus side, Takano gets lots of attention and has become a favorite of progressive Democrats nationwide,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cTheir support could be very helpful if ever he decides to run for higher office.\n\n\u201cThe downside is that he could develop a reputation as a smart-aleck rather than a serious legislator. In this respect, he suffers by comparison with (Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Palm Desert), who has made a point of working across party lines to solve important problems of public policy.\u201d\n\nTakano has embraced social media, using Twitter and Facebook to get his message across. His staff also maintains \u201cThere Will be Charts,\u201d a Tumblr blog of Takano\u2019s snarky Internet comments, known as memes, and other information.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S A GATEWAY\u2019\n\nIn a telephone interview Friday, Takano said he uses humor to reach voters about important topics. Representatives, he said, have a duty to inform as well as represent the public.\n\n\u201cPeople are just so busy out there leading their lives and working and various forms of media are claiming their attention,\u201d he said. \u201cTo break through all of that noise, you need sometimes a powerful tool or a powerful device.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gateway, a window into more serious work,\u201d Takano added.\n\nThe congressman and his staff, including Chief of Staff Richard McPike and legislative director Yuri Beckelman, toss around ideas for memes, usually based on the events of the day. Ideas are constantly refined and not every idea ends up online.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very strict rule about not being mean and not being personal,\u201d Beckelman said.\n\nStaff members often send Takano concepts while he\u2019s in a committee meeting or otherwise busy, requiring him to discreetly check his phone.\n\n\u201cSometimes I have to keep myself from laughing,\u201d he said.\n\nTakano\u2019s big break came in 2013, when he got hold of a House GOP letter on immigration. A former high school English teacher, Takano used a red pen to mark up the letter before giving it an \u201cF.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe assignment was to address what should be done about the 11 million (undocumented immigrants) already here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDid you purposefully leave this out?\u201d\n\nNOD TO KANYE\n\nThe markup went viral and Takano continues to mix social media with pop culture to troll the GOP on other matters. A meme mocked Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s marathon Senate floor speech against Obamacare by imitating rap star Kanye West\u2019s 2013 interruption of Taylor Swift\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, Ima let you finish, but Wendy Davishad the greatest filibuster of all time!\u201d Takano says, a reference to the Democratic Texas state senator\u2019s filibuster in support of abortion rights.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "content_author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, takano, gop, district, riverside, media, staff, republican, public, represent, issue", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "POLITICS: Takano relishes role as clown prince of Congress", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-09 14:46:56", "sailthru.title": "POLITICS: Takano relishes role as clown prince of Congress", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvz391-b88536204z.120151009144656000gdicg6on.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvz391-b88536204z.120151009144656000gdicg6on.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-10-09", "Description": "News: POLITICS: Takano relishes role as clown prince of Congress | takano, gop, district, riverside, media, staff, republican, public, represent, issue", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: POLITICS: Takano relishes role as clown prince of Congress | takano, gop, district, riverside, media, staff, republican, public, represent, issue", "title": "POLITICS: Takano relishes role as clown prince of Congress", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nvz391-b88536204z.120151009144656000gdicg6on.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/takano-782978-gop-district.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "takano, gop, district, riverside, media, staff, republican, public, represent, issue", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nvz391-b88536204z.120151009144656000gdicg6on.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96ae\"", "article_summary": "Takano\u2019s big break came in 2013, when he got hold of a House GOP letter on immigration.\n\u201cOn the plus side, Takano gets lots of attention and has become a favorite of progressive Democrats nationwide,\u201d Pitney said.\nThe Riverside Democrat made headlines in 2012 as the first openly gay person of color elected to the House of Representatives.\nStaff members often send Takano concepts while he\u2019s in a committee meeting or otherwise busy, requiring him to discreetly check his phone.\n\u2018IT\u2019S A GATEWAY\u2019In a telephone interview Friday, Takano said he uses humor to reach voters about important topics."}
