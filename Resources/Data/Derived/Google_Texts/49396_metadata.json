But, from Aurora, Colorado, to Sandy Hook, Connecticut, there is another alarming similarity among these suspects: mental illness.\n\n\u201cYou can get some help,\u201d says John Dornheim, past president of NAMI Dallas, the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cBut, can you get enough? No.\u201d\n\nAccording to NAMI, a staggering one in four Americans is affected by mental illness\u2014 that\u2019s more than AIDS, cancer, even heart disease. Dornheim insists that the mentally ill are not more violent than the general population; but, sufferers do struggle to access adequate services.\n\n\u201cTexas a few years ago was spending $39 per person on mental illness. Maine was spending $300 per person. Are we not worthy of as good mental health care as the state of Maine.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Texas legislature restored some funding cuts\u2014increasing spending on mental health services by nearly $350 million dollars. But, advocates say by refusing to invest an additional $1.34 billion over the next three years to expand Medicaid under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act, $23.94 billion in federal funds was left on the table.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I thought it was irresponsible,\u201d says State Senator Royce West. \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to determine whether or not the federal government is going to have the dollars to fund Medicaid.\u201d\n\nSenator West serves on the Health and Human Services committee and says he and other lawmakers supported language that would have mandated that state funding revert to agreed upon levels if for some reason the federal government failed to fund the additional services as promised.\n\n\u201cBut, there was not the political will to do that,\u201d says West. \u201cThe governor has his reasons. I just don\u2019t happen to agree with them. Those dollars are now going to other states and Texas could have benefited.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, NAMI ranked Texas at the very bottom for per capita spending on mental health. The situation has since improved slightly, but advocates say Texas is still near the bottom.\n\n\u201cThis influx of money that the legislature approved is going to be very positive,\u201d says Dornheim. \u201cBut, it\u2019s going to be hard to make up that lack of funding for all of those years. Mental illness is one of those things that just doesn\u2019t go away. We have a sick population here.\u201d\n\nLatest News:\n\nTop Trending:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas ranks near the bottom in regards to spending per mental health patient.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/09/17/another-mass-shooting-renews-mental-health-debate/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/more-aaron-alexis-1.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/more-aaron-alexis-1.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Texas ranks near the bottom in regards to spending per mental health patient.", "title": "Another Mass Shooting Renews Mental Health Debate, Texas Near Bottom In Spending"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/more-aaron-alexis-1.jpg?w=625", "description": "Texas ranks near the bottom in regards to spending per mental health patient.", "site": "CBSDFW", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Another Mass Shooting Renews Mental Health Debate, Texas Near Bottom In Spending"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of DFW", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Dallas / Fort Worth", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW"}, "keywords": "health, local, news, syndicated local, texas, watch + listen, affordable care act, health and human services, health care, medicaid, mental health, mental illness, nami, national alliance on mental illness, patient, robbie owens, royce west, texas", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d84b3f65c780e092277ee393cdbaeb66?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, health and human services, health care, medicaid, mental health, mental illness, nami, national alliance on mental illness, patient, robbie owens, royce west, texas"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdd0\"", "article_summary": "But, from Aurora, Colorado, to Sandy Hook, Connecticut, there is another alarming similarity among these suspects: mental illness.\n\u201cYou can get some help,\u201d says John Dornheim, past president of NAMI Dallas, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nAre we not worthy of as good mental health care as the state of Maine.\u201dThe most recent Texas legislature restored some funding cuts\u2014increasing spending on mental health services by nearly $350 million dollars.\nMental illness is one of those things that just doesn\u2019t go away.\nNo.\u201dAccording to NAMI, a staggering one in four Americans is affected by mental illness\u2014 that\u2019s more than AIDS, cancer, even heart disease."}
