America perpetually claims it is acting in the interests of free people everywhere, but when you learn of dirty tricks like this, one must question this.'\n\nFor its part, Der Spiegel said the information gleaned from private conversations can only have come from the NSA. It said on Friday: 'It is becoming increasingly clear that representatives of the German government at best looked away as America violated the law, at worst supported them.'\n\nOther media noted that Spiegel could be seen as a legitimate target by intelligence operatives as it has in the past published many stories about the NSA spying operation which has frustrated and annoyed Washington.\n\nThe media revelations came after it was announced by the whistleblower platform that Mrs Merkel, her economics minister and the finance minister were allegedly bugged in a long-running programme stretching back to the 1990's.\n\nSpying: Other media noted that Spiegel could be seen as a legitimate target by intelligence operatives as it has in the past published many stories about the NSA (pictured, headquarters) spying\n\nMrs Merkel, who smoothed over relations with America after revelations last year that her own mobile phone was hacked by the agency, is now facing fresh demands for concrete action against Washington following the scandal which broke on Thursday.\n\nShe has so far made no public comment although Washington's ambassador to Berlin was summoned to the Chancellery where sources said Mrs Merkel's displeasure was made known to him 'in no uncertain terms.'\n\nThe rival Green Party claimed she has 'failed to restore faith' in the partnership with the USA.\n\n'These things lead to an ever-greater mistrust among the public,' said Konstantin von Notz, a German parliament MP sitting on the NSA inquiry committee.\n\n'That isn't good for the transatlantic relationship in these difficult times. Both the US and Frau Merkel come off badly.'\n\nPart of the debate taking place within Germany centres on the role played by its own foreign intelligence service, the BND, and its levels of cooperation with the NSA.\n\nConservative elements in government have played down the spying allegations in the past, but the latest raft of revelations may prove too large to sweep under the diplomatic carpet.\n\nVon Notz told a German news website: 'There are legal problems with what the BND has done, there have to be reforms and consequences. This couldn't-care-less attitude doesn't help our country or our intelligence services.\n\nDiplomatic: Mrs Merkel (right) has smoothed over relations with America (President Barack Obama, left) after revelations last year that her own mobile phone was hacked by the NSA\n\n'The USA and Germany and Europe are bound together by common values, including the rule of law. We have to reinstate the integrity of our relationship.'\n\nChristian Flisek, the senior SPD lawmaker on the NSA committee, said the fresh revelations of spying were only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble took time out from trying to save the euro on Friday to say: 'The impression is forcing itself upon us that someone or other in the American secret services has somewhat lost sight of the norm.'\n\nBut he added spying by the Americans was a 'small problem', and that 'other world powers cause me more worry.'\n\nMartina Renner from thje hard-left Die Linke party said: 'The government has wasted time debating whether the NSA also conducts espionage in Germany and offered only a vague response to repeated spying scandals.'\n\n'All the assurances that Germany wasn't being spied on were apparently false,' said Andr\u00e9 Hahn, chairman of the Bundestag's intelligence oversight committee.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Merkel,pressure,act,s,revealed,America,spied,German,magazine,government", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3149325/Merkel-pressure-act-s-revealed-America-spied-German-magazine-government.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "German leader Angela Merkel (left) is under increasing pressure to act on the NSA spying scandal after it was revealed that it spied on the country's top news magazine, as well as politicians.", "title": "Merkel under pressure to act after NSA spied on top German magazine", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3149325/Merkel-pressure-act-s-revealed-America-spied-German-magazine-government.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/04/13/2A36BB3800000578-0-image-a-22_1436011799165.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3149325/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3149325/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3149325, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Merkel,pressure,act,s,revealed,America,spied,German,magazine,government", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-07-04T12:21:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Allan+Hall+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-07-04T13:06:10.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Merkel pressure act s revealed America spied German magazine government"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "German leader Angela Merkel (left) is under increasing pressure to act on the NSA spying scandal after it was revealed that it spied on the country's top news magazine, as well as politicians.", "title": "Merkel under pressure to act after NSA spied on top German magazine", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3149325/Merkel-pressure-act-s-revealed-America-spied-German-magazine-government.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/04/13/2A36BB3800000578-0-image-a-22_1436011799165.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2015/05/1418450360_4223405020001_4223308147001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "German leader Angela Merkel (left) is under increasing pressure to act on the NSA spying scandal after it was revealed that it spied on the country's top news magazine, as well as politicians."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6c5\"", "article_summary": "German leader Angela Merkel is coming under increasing pressure to act on the NSA spying scandal after it was revealed Washington spooks eavesdropped on the country's top news magazine as well as politicians.\nFor its part, Der Spiegel said the information gleaned from private conversations can only have come from the NSA.\nThe media revelations came after it was announced by the whistleblower platform that Mrs Merkel, her economics minister and the finance minister were allegedly bugged in a long-running programme stretching back to the 1990's.\nChristian Flisek, the senior SPD lawmaker on the NSA committee, said the fresh revelations of spying were only the tip of the iceberg.\n'All the assurances that Germany wasn't being spied on were apparently false,' said Andr\u00e9 Hahn, chairman of the Bundestag's intelligence oversight committee."}
