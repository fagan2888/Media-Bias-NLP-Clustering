But after an embarrassing debate gaffe\u2014he couldn\u2019t remember which three federal agencies he wanted to close\u2014and a series of campaign struggles, he quickly fell in the polls. This year, the former Texas governor, acknowledging that he wasn\u2019t ready four years ago, has attempted to reboot his campaign. But he\u2019s struggled to gain traction: Perry was edged out of the prime-time debate last week, and his fundraising has been weak. On Monday, it was reported that his campaign has stopped paying its staff.\n\nPerry\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t over, but it\u2019s not a good sign. And it\u2019s a shame that he has failed to take off this round. While I was no fan of his 2012 run and I continue disagree with him strongly on many issues, Perry has run an interesting, valuable campaign that ought to have injected some seriousness and substance into the GOP field\u2014ought to, and would have, I suspect, if not for the presence of Donald Trump\n\nTo understand why Trump has made it so hard for a candidate like Perry to stand out, and why the billionaire reality star has had such a pernicious overall effect on the race, it\u2019s worth going back to July, when Perry delivered a lengthy speech on financial reform at a two-hour event held at the Yale Club in Manhattan. It was in many ways an unusual topic for a Republican candidate to address at length; GOP candidates are more likely to call for the repeal of Dodd-Frank than to offer ideas of their own.\n\nPerry\u2019s speech, though, was peppered with wonky policy proposals\u2014dealing with everything from strengthening capital requirements for big banks to overhauling the Consumer Financial Protection to building in \u201cregulatory breathing room\u201d for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Perry didn\u2019t have every detail nailed down, but relatively speaking it was a substantive and detailed speech that left a lot to discuss\u2014and, perhaps, to disagree with. The former Texas governor promised flatly that as president he would never bail out any Wall Street bank. He also called for, among other things, regulations on certain types of mortgage products, crediting his state\u2019s rules restricting cash-out refinancing for helping the state to weather the recession.\n\nAt the end of the two-hour event, there was time for one question from the audience. It went to a reporter from The Daily Mail who asked Perry not about anything from his speech but about attacks from the GOP presidential frontrunner, Donald Trump. Rick Perry jokingly responded that he\u2019d like to challenge Trump to a pull-up contest. Google News currently counts more than 400 stories that reference Perry\u2019s pull-up challenge. (Yes, for the record, I briefly referenced it too.)\n\nThat\u2019s the Trump effect at work. The entire GOP field becomes defined by their relationship to Trump\u2014by what Trump has said about them, and what they have said about him.\n\nTo be fair, Perry has courted this, at least to some extent. Of all the GOP candidates in the race, he has probably been Trump\u2019s most open and aggressive antagonist; certainly he was Trump\u2019s loudest critic in the field prior to the GOP debate, labeling Trump a \u201ccancer on conservatism.\u201d Yet this too is an example of how the Trump effect alters the race. With Trump and his antics leading the field, the other candidates, especially those not in the top tier, are looking for ways to stand out with their own outrageous comments\u2014by tweeting about Cecil the Lion and Planned Parenthood, for example, or comparing the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran to the Holocaust. Perry\u2019s attempt to draw attention by attacking Trump directly was, in comparison, the high road.\n\nIndeed, Perry\u2019s campaign this year has tried to take the high road whenever possible. That was its big idea\u2014to run an honest campaign built on big ideas.\n\nThe financial reform speech wasn\u2019t the first time that Rick Perry had given a big speech that challenged conservatives as well as liberals. Earlier in the summer, before Trump took hold, Perry delivered an address on race and economic opportunity that was praised by liberals like The Washington Monthly\u2019s Ed Kilgore for its frank admission that black Americans had understandable reasons for voting Democrat, and that Republicans hoping to win their votes would have to respond not only with rhetoric but with policies designed to improve their lives. At the same time, the address was hailed by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board as \u201cthe speech of the campaign so far.\u201d The editorial praised Perry for laying out \u201ca rationale and a specific agenda for how the GOP can earn\u2014and deserve\u2014the support of black Americans,\u201d and for pointing to real-world evidence from Texas that his ideas could work. Writing at National Review, Yuval Levin called it \u201can ambitious and impressive performance\u201d that he hoped would \u201c[set] the tone for the coming campaign. \u201c\n\nThis was the campaign that Rick Perry wanted to run\u2014a campaign built on substance; a campaign that was not afraid to challenge certain conservative orthodoxies, but also did not respond by simply adopting watered-down versions of liberal policies; a campaign that, at its best, could unite open-minded liberals and smart conservatives. And it was a campaign that, in a different race, might have at least helped nudge the GOP field in different, more substantive, direction. It might have helped set the tone.\n\nBut with so many candidates in the field, and Trump leading them all, it\u2019s been difficult for a candidate like Perry to stand out. At the end of July, Donald Trump accounted for a whopping 50 percent of all evening network news election coverage. Coverage like that just doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for the other 16 candidates.\n\nRick Perry\u2019s campaign struggles aren\u2019t all Donald Trump\u2019s fault. Perry gives a good speech, and performs well enough on TV\u2014which he\u2019s done a lot of. But he\u2019s not a great debater. And he was always going to have to overcome some of the negative perceptions that took hold in the 2012 race and helped take him out of that field.\n\nYet Perry was running a better, more interesting, more honorable campaign this time around. And while libertarians would have found plenty to disagree with (Perry is, among other things, more hawkish and more supportive of restrictions on immigration than most libertarians would be comfortable with), there are also elements to admire about his record as governor, from his record on job growth to his willingness (after some initial resistance) to back criminal justice reform that saved money and put fewer people in jail. He even shut down a prison.\n\nPerry\u2019s record as governor of the world\u2019s twelfth largest economy is the foundation of his current campaign. As Avik Roy, a policy adviser to Perry (and friend of mine), told me Tuesday, the goal was to start with Perry\u2019s economic record in Texas and then build out a suite of big-idea policy proposals over the course of the run. Perry\u2019s campaign takes as its starting point the idea that, as Roy told me, \u201cno state in America that has demonstrated the results of economic freedom better than Texas\u201d\u2014and then seeks to expand on that approach nationally.\n\n\u201cOur strategy,\u201d Roy said, was to \u201ctake the voters seriously.\u201d It\u2019s an admirable idea, and could have been Rick Perry's biggest strength as a candidate. Sadly, in a race so dominated by a thoroughly unserious figure like Donald Trump, it may turn out to be his biggest weakness.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The former Texas governor is running a strong campaign.
