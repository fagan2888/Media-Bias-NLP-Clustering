She said the Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, has cut the ranks of the uninsured by 16.4 million people while slowing the rate of health premium increases substantially.\n\nBurwell told her audience at the Westin Copley Place hotel that the government can play a role in curbing the rise in health costs by shifting half of Medicare enrollees by 2018 to alternative payment programs that reward health care providers for keeping them healthy \u2014 rather than paying them for the number of visits, tests, and procedures.\n\n\u201cWe have got to shift from a system where we pay for volume to a system where we pay for value,\u201d she said.\n\nBurwell said the president\u2019s $215 million Precision Medicine initiative, unveiled in January, will put the weight of the government behind efforts in academic and industry research to use improved understanding of genetics to develop medicines for individual patients.\n\nFunding will go to the National Institutes of Health and its National Cancer Institute to compile genomic databases and conduct early-stage research, Burwell said. She also said the Food and Drug Administration will invest in new ways of regulating genetics-based therapies, while other government agencies will work to transition health records so their information can be used in a meaningful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurwell acknowledged that the aging of the baby-boomer generation and greater longevity present challenges to controlling health costs.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control the fact that a number of people in this room are going to be over 65 [soon],\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2690992063", "eomportal-id": 394754, "description": "The top Obama administration health official Tuesday defended the federal overhaul that has boosted health insurance rolls nationally and said the US government will move aggressively to support precision medicine.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The top Obama administration health official Tuesday defended the federal overhaul that has boosted health insurance rolls nationally and said the US government will move aggressively to support precision medicine.", "zip": 2116, "title": "Top Obama health official touts insurance progress, precision medicine initiative - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/04/28/top-obama-health-official-touts-insurance-progress-precision-medicine-initiative/KXWlS35R6eZvgZQZ2gBx5J/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/04/28/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/greenhouse_29burwell-1_business.jpg", "state": "MA", "longitude": "-71.07728329999997", "streetaddress": "10 Huntington Ave", "latitude": "42.3486765", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,Health and human services,Sylvia Matthews Burwell,Partners Healthcare,Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Precision medicine,World Medical Innovation Forum", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:05:31 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Health and human services,Sylvia Matthews Burwell,Partners Healthcare,Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Precision medicine,World Medical Innovation Forum", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "8801a8c6-ee28-11e4-b8c0-fabefdd92caa"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration\u2019s top health official defended the federal overhaul that has boosted health insurance rolls nationally and said the government will move aggressively to support precision medicine.\nFunding will go to the National Institutes of Health and its National Cancer Institute to compile genomic databases and conduct early-stage research, Burwell said.\nAdvertisementBurwell acknowledged that the aging of the baby-boomer generation and greater longevity present challenges to controlling health costs.\nShe said the Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, has cut the ranks of the uninsured by 16.4 million people while slowing the rate of health premium increases substantially.\nAdvertisement\u201cIf you look at the issues of affordability, access, and quality, we\u2019ve been working on it for 100 years,\u201d Burwell said."}
