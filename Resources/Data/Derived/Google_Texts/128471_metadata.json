The candidate search is back on, and Cabinet officials are hoping to agree on a successor at their next meeting.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting state officials conducted interviews with two finalists in a bid to replace Florida\u2019s current top insurance regulator. Office of Insurance Regulation, or OIR, Commissioner Kevin McCarty will leave the post in early May. The interview process began with Jeffrey Bragg, a former Treasury official who set up and oversaw the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n\nBragg boasts 40 years in the insurance industry working in the public and private sector, and he\u2019s seen as Governor Scott\u2019s favorite for the position. He pitched himself as a willing functionary for the Cabinet.\n\n\u201cAs the COO I don\u2019t make policy,\u201d Bragg told Cabinet members. \u201cI implement your policy, and I\u2019m responsible to you, and each and every one of you in some cases on a daily basis, to make sure that your policies are carried out.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Governor Scott wants to hear. In the past, the governor has shown he\u2019s willing to drop the axe on intractable agency heads. At the end of 2014, he pushed out Gerald Bailey\u2014the state\u2019s top cop at the time. Bailey alleged the firing came after he rebuffed the governor\u2019s efforts to interfere with department investigations.\n\nThe other finalist up for consideration was Rep. Bill Hager (R-Delray Beach).\n\n\u201cI know insurance,\u201d he said, \u201cI know all lines of insurance, and I know them in depth and in detail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know insurance regulation. I know Florida. I know Florida\u2019s politics\u2014I\u2019ve been an elected official in this state since 2002.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater is backing Hager\u2019s bid. In this year\u2019s session they partnered on a bill requiring life insurers take extra steps to pay claims to beneficiaries.\n\nHager has been working in the industry nearly as long as Bragg, and he served as Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner in the late 1980s. He and Bragg are Republicans, and both offered a number of boiler plate responses focused on encouraging private companies to participate in Florida\u2019s market. But Hager offered an idea about long-term care coverage.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of the things I would like to see from a creative standpoint is life insurance,\u201d Hager explained. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we ought not be able to work with the industry to as people get older see some kind of a conversion from the cash value in life policies have the flexibility to convert it into long term care policies whether through a rider, etc.\u201d\n\nMuch of the discussion focused on property insurance, but Attorney General Pam Bondi asked both candidates about health insurance in the wake of the Affordable Care Act\u2014and that\u2019s where Bragg had a bit of a hiccup.\n\nBondi asked about Navigators, and Bragg didn\u2019t appear to know what they do. Navigators help people choose plans on the federal exchange, and Bondi has been suspicious of the program since at least 2013. But state law requires Navigators register with the CFO\u2019s office, and the agency posts their names on its website.\n\nIn the end, CFO Atwater moved to give the job to Hager, but state law demands the CFO and the governor agree\u2014and Gov. Scott wasn\u2019t biting.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t second it,\u201d he said bluntly.\n\nInstead the Cabinet is reopening the search. They\u2019ll be taking applications until April 15 with an eye on approving a new commissioner at the next meeting, April 26.", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "Florida\u2019s Cabinet is at odds over who should become the state\u2019s next Insurance Commissioner.
