From Trussville Tribune staff reports

TRUSSVILLE –Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex. will bring his campaign to become the Republican nominee for president to Trussville, according to state senator Shay Shelnutt.

The Trussville visit is planned for December 20, from 2-4 p.m. at the Trussville Civic Center.

Shelnutt believes Cruz, a staunch conservative, will be popular in Alabama.

“If voters are looking for a true anti-establishment conservative, Cruz is their guy,” Shelnutt said. “He’s consistently done what the voters sent him to Washington to do and that’s stand up for the citizens. He hasn’t backed down from the establishment and he won’t.”

The District 17 senator had endorsed Cruz early-on in the campaign.

“The things I like about Sen. Cruz include his fight for smaller government, his defense of the Second Amendment, his pro-life stance, and the fact that he understands how Obamacare has hurt the economy in this country and how hard he has worked to undo it,” Shelnutt said. “Having a record of actually standing for these things when others have compromised means something. His principles and has fortitude match those of the voters in Alabama. I anticipate a very good turnout from people in Trussville, Clay, Gardendale and Pinson.”
