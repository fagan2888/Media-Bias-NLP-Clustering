We were thrilled to read about how connected to the music of Rachmaninoff her child was, rocking in her chair and waving her hands to the sound of the orchestra. That being said, it was troubling to read about her negative experience with the usher assigned to her section. The ushers are not employees of the Colorado Symphony, and an inquiry to the management of the ushers (the Denver Performing Arts Complex) has been initiated.\n\nThe challenges she and thousands of other families face when caring for loved ones with autism need not include feeling \"banned from experiencing the performing arts,\" as she wrote. In fact, recently the Colorado Symphony's community and education programs department has been working on scheduling sensory-friendly performance experiences specifically designed for patrons who may exhibit atypical audience behaviors.\n\nThe first of these will be in September on the Lone Tree Arts Center's Sensory Friendly Family Tree series. We're looking forward to scheduling large-scale performances like this at Boettcher Concert Hall as well, where we can assure you, expression and joy will be heartily encouraged. The Colorado Symphony recognizes the power music has to connect us to self expression, and to each other. That is why we are working hard to create these special performances. And as you said, you shouldn't ever \"need to explain or apologize.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine Beeson\n\nDirector of Community and Education Programs\n\nColorado Symphony\n\nDenver", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28268780/catherine-beeson-colorado-symphony-working-accommodate-unconventional-responses", "modificationDate": "2015-06-07T16:36:56-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-06-06T19:25:55-0600", "description": "The Colorado Symphony appreciated reading Julie Hoffman Marshall's  story about the experience with her daughter at a 2014/15 season Colorado Symphony Masterworks concert.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28268780:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-07T19:25:55-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28268780/catherine-beeson-colorado-symphony-working-accommodate-unconventional-responses", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Colorado Symphony appreciated reading Julie Hoffman Marshall's  story about the experience with her daughter at a 2014/15 season Colorado Symphony Masterworks concert.", "title": "Catherine Beeson: Colorado Symphony working to accommodate unconventional responses"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The Colorado Symphony appreciated reading Julie Hoffman Marshall's  story about the experience with her daughter at a 2014/15 season Colorado Symphony Masterworks concert.", "title": "Catherine Beeson: Colorado Symphony working to accommodate unconventional responses", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28268780/catherine-beeson-colorado-symphony-working-accommodate-unconventional-responses", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-07T19:25:55-0600", "sailthru.title": "Catherine Beeson: Colorado Symphony working to accommodate unconventional responses", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-06-07T16:38:31-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce866\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado Symphony appreciated reading Julie Hoffman Marshall's story about the experience with her daughter at a 2014/15 season Colorado Symphony Masterworks concert.\nThe Colorado Symphony recognizes the power music has to connect us to self expression, and to each other.\nThe first of these will be in September on the Lone Tree Arts Center's Sensory Friendly Family Tree series.\nThe ushers are not employees of the Colorado Symphony, and an inquiry to the management of the ushers (the Denver Performing Arts Complex) has been initiated.\nThe challenges she and thousands of other families face when caring for loved ones with autism need not include feeling \"banned from experiencing the performing arts,\" as she wrote."}
