We'll probably never hear more candid reactions from President Obama than we did during his episode of "Between Two Ferns" with Zach Galifianakis.

That is, until now.

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly wasn't too pleased with the President's decision to sit down with a comedian to promote the Affordable Care Act. So, we decided to see how Obama's brutally honest answers to Zach's inane questions sound when mashed up with his most recent interview with the "Papa Bear" O'Reilly.

We call it: "Between Two O'Reillys." Watch above!
