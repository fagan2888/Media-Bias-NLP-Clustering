It gives him access to 4-thousand feet paved runway.\n\nMcCormack says he'll be testing the drones on land, in the water and the air.\n\n\"Right now we, they've developed an vehicle that they'll be testing in the rivers, in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said McCormack.\n\nGulf Unmanned Systems Center has been working with C-4 company since the mid-80's building drones.\n\nThe company builds combat submersibles for naval special warfare and special operations command.\n\n\"Something like this, an unmanned vessel, with side scans underneath it, it can just scoot on in underneath the ships and take a peak underneath without a lot of preparation and stuff,\u201d said Tim Despard, employee.\n\nBut the drones will have more than military applications.\n\nMcCormack says they're especially important for agriculture.\n\n\"You can fly this 55 pound vehicle, 450 feet above the ground and it will tell you exactly, if you need more water in a certain place, and that's important because we don't have a lot of water,\u201d said McCormack.\n\nMcCormack says he's already received 40 applications for 10-current job openings and he plans to hire more people in about a year.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A local businessman is hoping to close a deal that he believes will have a huge impact on the Panhandle\u2019s future.", "language": "english", "author": "Tiffany Huertas", "og": {"description": "A local businessman is hoping to close a deal that he believes will have a huge impact on the Panhandle\u2019s future.", "title": "A Panama City Beach Business is Moving its Operations to Carrabelle to Create Drones", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Panama-City-Beach-Business-is-its-Moving-Operations-to-Carabelle-to-Create-Drones-241952391.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/19B/4EA/19B4EAB00F7A45CBB4450E78F9A47D33", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/75A/870/75A8704F4E2E4EA4B5606900B75411E0.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "A local businessman is hoping to close a deal that he believes will have a huge impact on the Panhandle\u2019s future.", "title": "A Panama City Beach Business is Moving its Operations to Carrabelle to Create Drones", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Panama-City-Beach-Business-is-its-Moving-Operations-to-Carabelle-to-Create-Drones-241952391.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/1+drones.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "A Panama City Beach Business is Moving its Operations to Carrabelle to Create Drones", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "A Panama City Beach Business, is Moving its Operations to"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34b1\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s the CEO and owner of Gulf Unmanned Systems Center, a Panama City beach-based company that creates and tests the unmanned systems.\n\"Franklin County because of the geography and the demographic,\u201d said Bruce McCormack, Gulf Unmanned Systems Center CEO.\nGulf Unmanned Systems Center has been working with C-4 company since the mid-80's building drones.\nIn December, he revealed his plans to move the operation to a vacant building in Carrabelle to test them.\n\"Right now we, they've developed an vehicle that they'll be testing in the rivers, in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said McCormack."}
