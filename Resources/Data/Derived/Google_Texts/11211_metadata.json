If you\u2019re 27, you can expect to pay more than $260 a month in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, Indiana, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska. Cheaper insurance of less than $170 a month is available in Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Arizona, Oregon and Hawaii.\n\nFor 50-year-olds, the same group of states has the cheaper insurance but only in relative terms: less than $290 a month. The more expensive states \u2014 now more than $420 for this age group \u2014 shift a bit. Alaska, New Jersey, Indiana, Mississippi and Wyoming remain on the high end of the spectrum and are joined by Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arkansas.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare doesn\u2019t drag health-care stocks, biotech\n\nObamacare signups top 2.1 million\n\nDid Beyonce\u2019s new album outsell Obamacare?", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-03T13:20:20-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One handy tool for insurance shoppers comes from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers estimates of how much you can expect to pay for health insurance, based on the state where you live.", "title": "Map shows state-by-state estimates of health-insurance premiums", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/03/map-shows-state-by-state-estimates-of-health-insurance-premiums/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR906_aca_ma_MG_20140103123124.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Obamacare,PricewaterhouseCoopers,state costs", "article.headline": "Map shows state-by-state estimates of health-insurance premiums", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Obamacare,PricewaterhouseCoopers,state costs", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "One handy tool for insurance shoppers comes from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers estimates of how much you can expect to pay for health insurance, based on the state where you live.", "article.published": "2014-01-03T13:20:20-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/03/map-shows-state-by-state-estimates-of-health-insurance-premiums/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One handy tool for insurance shoppers comes from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers estimates of how much you can expect to pay for health insurance, based on the state where you live.", "title": "Map shows state-by-state estimates of health-insurance premiums", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/03/map-shows-state-by-state-estimates-of-health-insurance-premiums/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR906_aca_ma_MG_20140103123124.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1797", "article.updated": "2014-01-03T13:20:20-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8543\"", "article_summary": "Alaska, New Jersey, Indiana, Mississippi and Wyoming remain on the high end of the spectrum and are joined by Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arkansas.\nIf you\u2019re 27, you can expect to pay more than $260 a month in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, Indiana, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska.\nFor 50-year-olds, the same group of states has the cheaper insurance but only in relative terms: less than $290 a month.\nCheaper insurance of less than $170 a month is available in Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Arizona, Oregon and Hawaii.\nThe consultancy\u2019s map, linked on the illustration at left, shows all 50 states and shades them according to price categories on silver plans \u2014 the second-lowest-cost insurance \u2014 for 27-year-olds and 50-year-olds."}
