A bullet pierced and shattered a large window at a McDonald’s restaurant in Arvada Sunday afternoon and police are searching for a compact silver car and possibly a black car.

Nobody was hurt, Arvada Police Department spokeswoman Jill McGranahan said. And police do not know who fired the gun.

The McDonald’s at 9825 West 58th Ave., contains a play area for children. The bullet and glass entered the main lobby area, manager Solomon Lauro said.

“There was a conflict outside the building,” Lauro said. “A bullet went through the window but nobody was hurt.”

That conflict apparently had nothing to do with McDonald’s. Arvada police received a call about 2:45 p.m. alerting them to a single shot fired, McGranahan said.

“We’ve been talking at surrounding businesses, trying to acquire their surveillance video,” she said. “It’s possible the shot was fired from one vehicle at another. That’s one of the scenarios were looking at.”
