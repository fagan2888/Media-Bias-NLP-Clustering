Bush era from its current Tea Party incarnation, President Obama has never enjoyed the kind of high approval ratings that used to accompany most two-term presidents. Whether it\u2019s due to his race, our growing ideological polarization, the poor economy, or a combination of all of the above, Obama\u2019s rarely known what it feels like to be a president of whom more than half of Americans approve. According to the Huffington Post, it only took until the tenth month of his first year before his number dipped below 50 percent.\n\nFighting as he is now to keep his approval rating north of 40 percent, November 2009 probably looks to Obama like the good old days. And mindful, perhaps, of how he\u2019s previously looked on the verge of irrevocably losing the people\u2019s faith, only to bounce back to his usual place in the mid- to high 40s, Obama may also believe that this current spate of bad polling will eventually pass. Anything\u2019s possible; the economy could start booming. Unemployment could drop. Wages could rise. Obama could recover.\n\nBut I\u2019m starting to think this time may be different, and that when it comes to Obama\u2019s relationship with millions of former supporters, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nWhat\u2019s got me thinking this way is a raft of new polls showing not only that the president is unpopular, but that he\u2019s becoming increasingly so in the very places, and among the very people, he could usually count on for support. A release from Field Poll earlier this month, for example, found the president to have only a 45 percent approval rating in \u00fcber-blue California. Most strikingly, the pollster reported that California Dems\u2019 support for Obama dropped 8 percent during just this summer and was down 11 percent in Los Angeles alone.\n\nThe Field Poll wasn\u2019t an outlier, either. This past week, Marist College released a poll from that other bedrock of the Democratic Party, the state of New York. No good news there, either: Only 39 percent of registered New York voters are happy with Obama\u2019s performance, the lowest score he\u2019s registered in the state throughout his entire presidency. As was the case with the California poll, Marist found a big drop in the number of New York Obama supporters in the past few months. He was at a passable 45 percent as recently as July.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see, then, that a good number of one-time supporters of the president are profoundly unhappy, and that their unhappiness has increased dramatically of late. It\u2019s also fair to guess that unhappiness over the crisis in Ukraine, the new war in the Middle East and the decision to kick the can on a deportations-related executive order are all playing a role. But although these developments are recent, they\u2019re not exactly new \u2014 liberals have been uncomfortable with targeted drone strikes and record-setting levels of deportation for years. Why only now do these disagreements represent White House failures so egregious that they justify withdrawing support?\n\nObviously, I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer to that question, at least not yet. Polls aren\u2019t predictions so much as snapshots of a particular moment in time \u2014 and they\u2019re blurry ones, at that. We may find out in the future that this summer was a bad one for the U.S. economy, which could explain the president\u2019s troubles more persuasively than a decision about U.S.I.C.E. bureaucracy or the international status of Donetsk. But assuming this summer swoon is no mere blip, and instead represents a permanent change in liberals\u2019 judgment, I think timing may be the reason why.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For many liberals, it's Sen.
