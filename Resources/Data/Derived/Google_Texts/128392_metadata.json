Avik and I have serious and deep differences over these issues. Our different worldviews are exemplified by his comment: \u201cIt\u2019s Medicaid, i.e., welfare dependency, that leads to family breakdown and social disrepair.\u201c\n\nGiven our differences, you might be surprised that we had the civil conversation we did about his new \u201cuniversal exchange\u201d health care plan.\n\nFor several reasons, every progressive should read Roy\u2019s plan.\n\nIt is a serious, thought-provoking read. That\u2019s not only because it is one of the few conservative proposals to acknowledge the reality of the 2012 election (and the eventually successful rollout of ACA since last Fall). Obamacare is now part of the fabric of American life. Republicans can hinder or modify ACA. They cannot and will not \u201crepeal\u201d Obamacare, because this now would require snatching coverage from millions of people while disrupting coverage for tens of millions of others. That\u2019s not going to happen. Yet because ACA establishes market-based insurance exchanges, health reform offers generative opportunities for conservatives willing to take notice.\n\n\u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d offers valuable insights into what Republicans really could do in pushing ACA in a more conservative direction. Roy would maintain several key features of ACA. But he would repeal the individual and employer mandates. He would constrain essential health benefits, narrow current ACA subsidies, encourage health savings accounts, allow health insurance premiums to raise more sharply with age, and more.\n\nRoy\u2019s plan has been assembled with greater professionalism and care than other Republican proposals I\u2019ve seen. Since 2010, most such proposals have been basically vaporware, obfuscating critical, politically unpalatable details and implications. \u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d certainly doesn\u2019t fill in every detail. (See, e.g., this critique by Tim Jost.) Still, Roy\u2019s plan is clear enough in its 50,000-foot vision of what it seeks to do.\n\nMost striking, \u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d proposes a gradual, but fundamental change to Medicare as we know it. Indeed the real target of Roy\u2019s Universal Exchange plan is not Obamacare, but the broader structure of American health policy put into place in 1965 with the advent of Medicare and Medicaid. Indeed the financial implications of Roy\u2019s plan are much larger for Medicare than they are for anything he has in mind to alter the structures of Obamacare.\n\nCurrent retirees could continue on traditional Medicare pretty much unaffected. But Roy would raise the Medicare eligibility age by four months every year. So in the coming decades, an increasing proportion of seniors would obtain coverage through private health plans or through the new health insurance marketplaces. Poor and near-poor Americans would receive subsidies through exchanges and other means (with other protections for individuals with costly conditions). They could also choose to opt into traditional Medicare.\n\nYet subsidies under Roy\u2019s plan would phase out at about 317 percent of the poverty line. That\u2019s about $37,000 for an individual, about $50,000 for a couple. Median income among Americans 65 and older is about $33,000. So this plan proposes a gradual but significant cost-shift over time from the federal government onto other payers, most notably onto middle-class and affluent retirees.\n\nBecause Medicare provides lower reimbursement rates than private insurers do, it is unclear that Roy\u2019s plan would reduce national health expenditures. Roy would reduce federal spending by reducing the large actuarial subsidy now being received through Medicare by roughly the top half of Americans during their retirement years. Many seniors within the current generation of retirees seem unaware of the dramatic actuarial subsidies they have received. With no small irony or cognitive dissonance, many fiercely oppose far less costly measures designed to insure younger Americans. Plans such as this one force us all to confront this basic reality.\n\nI don\u2019t see the American public supporting such fundamental alteration of social insurance. I don\u2019t support it, either. Yet Roy\u2019s proposal forces us to ponder what we really want Medicare to be and do. Not coincidentally, it raises intriguing dilemmas for Republican politicians, whose party base encompasses so many Americans nearing or past the usual age of retirement. What is the conservative response, now that Obamacare is the new status quo?\n\nTranscript of Part 1 (of 3):\n\nHarold: : This is Pollack. Welcome to another edition of Curbside Consult and I\u2019m delighted today to have Avik Roy here to discuss with me his new health plan, \u201cTranscending Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAvik: : Hi Harold, how are you?\n\nHarold: : Very well. Why don\u2019t we start by just describing how this plan came to be. We\u2019ll give a 50,000-foot discussion before getting down to the seven-inch level of detail that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to before too long.\n\nAvik: : Well, let\u2019s start going back to 2012. My view and I think the view of most people in 2012 was that if you wanted to repeal Obamacare \u2013 as nearly all Republicans had sought at that time \u2013 you had to win the 2012 election. Because if President Obama was re-elected then the subsidies, etc, the whole exchange system, and everything would go online, the Medicaid expansion \u2026\n\nI think we all have a view, based on history, that once a large program like that goes online it\u2019s not something you can just simply repeal. At least that was a view that Republicans had in 2012, and that\u2019s why they put a lot of energy into trying to win the 2012 election. And I actually \u2026\n\nHarold: : By the way who won the 2012 election?\n\nAvik: : Our president Obama.\n\nHarold: : Thank you, I just wanted to get that on the record.\n\nTax credits \u2013 a \u2018centrist solution\u2019\n\nAvik: : That\u2019s fine. So President Obama defeated my guy Mitt Romney, who I advised in that election. So you can blame me for the fact or thank me for the fact that President Obama won, depending on your point of view. But I felt then \u2013 even going into that election, and certainly once it was over \u2013 it was clear in my view that Obamacare was here to stay. To me that wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom for conservatives who care about health care reform.\n\nBecause my view had been then and is now that exchanges \u2013 or let\u2019s put it another way \u2013 the use of tax credits, refundable tax credits to subsidize coverage for the uninsured with private insurance is the ideal way in fact to have a true safety net and provide coverage for the uninsured.\n\nSo my hope \u2013 and perhaps it\u2019s an unrealistic hope \u2013 but my hope is that the fact that the left and let\u2019s just say at least certainly mainstream Democrats and their allies, have been so energetic in their defense of tax credits for the purchase of private insurance that this could be an opportunity for bipartisan co-operation. There are more cynical ways to look at that: The left complains that \u201cit\u2019s all really a conservative idea. Obamacare is a conservative idea therefore blah, blah, blah \u2026 \u201d\n\nHowever you look at it, it seems to me that \u2013 the way I put it in a lot of my op-eds recently is that Paul Ryan\u2019s plan for Medicare reform and the Obamacare exchanges are actually very similar if you strip away the party affiliations of the people who proposed them. In fact, Paul Ryan\u2019s plan for Medicare reform comes from Democratic scholars like Henry Aaron and Bob Reischauer. There is a bit of the inverted scenario there as well.\n\nSo the whole point of all this is to say that exchanges or tax credits for the purchase of private coverage is an attractive centrist solution shall we say to the problem of the uninsured. My argument has been \u2013 looking at systems like Switzerland that have shown excellent fiscal performance using such a model \u2013 that we could actually solve both progressive goals and conservative goals. That is to say, we could expand coverage while also putting the fiscal situation in balance at the same time. You can even do that while reducing spending.\n\nSomething for the right \u2013 and left\n\nThere were a lot of opportunity to actually bring both sides together with such an approach. And again, from my point of view, it is very important to have something that can actually attract support from both parties.\n\nI wrote the piece for National Review in November 2012 or December of 2012 it was officially published explaining this, because Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, had asked me to write a sort of \u201cokay what should we do now?\u201d piece. So I did that.\n\nAnd the reaction was interesting on both sides \u2013 I think people on the left were like: \u201cSee, there goes the \u2018Obamacare surrender,\u201d by the right. And conservatives \u2013 some of them \u2013 said the same thing.\n\nBut some of them said, \u201cNo, this is actually extremely interesting and maybe there is a path forward for conservatives.\u201d It was clear in those ensuing months that nobody else was doing that \u2013 with the lone exception of Doug Holz-Eakin, the former CBO director, in a piece we wrote together for Reuters \u2013 almost nobody else on the right was interested in joining me in articulating this concept, or exploring or fleshing it out this concept, even if they might sympathize with it in private.\n\nSo I realized that it really fell to me to develop this concept as extensively and as rigorously as possible. I spent the next 21 months, effectively, from November of 2012 until now, August 2014, doing just that: Developing the concept, really trying to think through and work through how one would actually do something along these lines \u2013 which is to deregulate the exchanges to a degree, or reform exchanges, so that the cost of insurance plans on the exchange can be more affordable. And then gradually migrate people on other programs like Medicaid and Medicare onto these reformed exchanges as a means of entitlement reform.\n\nThat is basically the simple architecture, the concept. But as you know, Harold, the guts of it are a lot more complex and a lot more detailed than that. And that required a lot of work. It required fleshing out qualitatively what kind of policy you would want to do that. And then working with as many people as were interested in reaching out to me \u2013 including you, as you know \u2013 just to kind of think through all the details of how this would work, try to figure out what are things I wasn\u2019t thinking about that other people were, things I was overlooking, technical considerations I hadn\u2019t thought about. And to model it fiscally: to use the best outside (that is to say nongovernmental) sources, to model fiscally how this plan would work.\n\nAll that took a long time \u2013 and then writing it up \u2013 it is a 20,000-word monograph. I thought, you know, you look at some of these plans that Republicans have put out, they tend to be (say) eight pages with a lot of bullet points. My goal was to put something out as detailed as I possibly could, and still have it actually be read by people. That way we can litigate these ideas and think them through, and if there are things that need to be improved or revised, this is the time to do that. Take a couple of years, put it out ahead of time, and see how it can be refined.\n\nAreas for agreement\n\nHarold: : This is Harold Pollack again at healthinsurance.org. I almost said HealthCare.gov. That would be the wrong website.\n\nI am talking with Avik Roy about his new health plan \u2013 I do think that progressives should carefully read this. I and others would disagree with a lot that\u2019s in here. I think it is extremely valuable to see what a conservative vision would look like, that does have near-universal coverage and some of the elements that make it at least a basis for conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s explicit in the areas where we would disagree. It\u2019s actually fairly radical in terms of what is going on in Medicare in some ways and we\u2019ll get to that. I want to start with a few areas where we actually probably agree or at least have some basis for agreement. One is the Cadillac tax, which you keep in your plan. In fact you would start it sooner and you would get rid of some of the negotiated arrangements that essentially Democratic interest groups made in the passage of the bill.\n\nI must say that to me, this is a political issue that has to be negotiated with a lot of stakeholders. But the idea of limiting the tax expenditures to people like you and me for health coverage is a very sensible idea. I think most health economists would agree that something of this structure, there is a lot of revenue there. And there is a lot of economic inefficiency there that the current system promotes. I was happy to see you keep that.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is unpopular and so I think you and I may both lose that one in terms of what happens in the U.S. Congress there, but I like that.\n\nI thought also, there is less disagreement about how Medicaid and the exchanges should work together than there might appear to be on the surface. A lot of conservatives would like to see less emphasis on the Medicaid expansion on traditional Medicaid and more emphasis on putting people into the new exchanges.\n\nFrom my point of view, for basically healthy low-income people particularly, this seems to me to be fine. In fact, Medicaid managed care looks a lot like what people might potentially get on an exchange anyway. I think if you ask a typical Medicaid recipient in many states: What does your life look like? They may well have an Anthem insurance card anyway.\n\nIt may be useful that there\u2019s an apparent disagreement between Democrats and Republicans because then we can use that as a basis of an apparent concession to get things moving \u2013 But I thought that that was also something that was fruitful. I do think that there\u2019s a lot in here that there is bi-partisan potential agreement on.\n\nMaybe I should attack the plan more aggressively \u2026\n\nI should say for our readers and listeners that you and I have tangled many times and I was a very strong supporter of ACA and you were on the other side. So maybe I should attack you more aggressively.\n\nPreserving programs, but \u2018evolving\u2019\n\nAvik: : I am sure all your readers who follow health care policy well probably already think of me as their bete noir, so it may not be necessary but I would say that \u2013 Well, first of all let me just dispute your characterization of my plan as radical in some ways. One thing I would say \u2013 and we can talk about this later \u2013 one thing I really emphasize in the design of this plan was gradual evolution of the health care system in a different direction. Is the end result different than the system we have today? Absolutely.\n\nBut it takes 30, 40, 50, 60 years to get to that point. And that is okay because from a standpoint of the fiscal situation that I\u2019m fairly concerned about \u2013 that\u2019s what you need. So long as the direction of the long-term problems are addressed, that is what the financial markets, that is what the debt markets in particular needs.\n\nIf you have confidence that the U.S. government is not going to go bankrupt. And also it helps us protect and preserve the promise to the people who depend on these programs today, that those programs will have the financial stability they need to be there for them tomorrow. So that\u2019s a big part of what I am really trying to do here, to preserve and protect people\u2019s existing arrangements and yet, gradually, with as much voluntarism as possible, evolve those arrangements in a different direction for future years. For example, a guy like me who is 41 years old, I don\u2019t expect to have Medicare in its current form when I am 65, because I know that in 25 years, the country is going to be in a lot worse fiscal shape than that it is today.\n\nOne way or another, these things are going to change. In terms of the Cadillac tax in particular \u2013 since we started with that \u2013 let me say that I am more confident than you are that the Cadillac tax in some form will be there because it\u2019s such a big chunk of the revenue stream or the funding the ACA in its current set up. You can\u2019t repeal the Cadillac tax without offsetting that in some other way: Either through substantial spending cuts or other tax increases. Given the policy appeal of something like the Cadillac tax, I would be very surprised to see it repealed.\n\nI think what you could see \u2013 when I talked to Republicans or conservatives about my plan, they say that the Cadillac tax is really kludgy and clunky. Why not replace it with a standard deduction of the kind that economists have long favored as a replacement \u2013 a gradual replacement for the employer tax exclusion.\n\nAnd as I note in the plan, I am okay with that so long as the fiscal effects are the same. Edmund Burke once said: If it\u2019s not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change. And I think I\u2019ve tried to apply that principle in my approach to health reform, which is to say the Cadillac tax is already there. Since the policy outcome of keeping it versus changing it into a standard deduction is not that significantly different, just keep it as it is. Since I am doing a lot of other things \u2013 proposing a lot of other changes, let me at least find the excuses where possible not to change things.\n\nObamacare: not a government takeover \u2026\n\nHarold: : Let me talk about the fiscal issues for a minute. One thing that is not as clearly stated in your document as it should be \u2013 and I think in your rhetoric \u2013 this is one area where you and I disagree \u2013 is the actual cost of the things that people fight about in health reform \u2013 the Medicaid expansion, the exchanges \u2013 those are not very expensive. The real money in health care is in the elderly and the disabled.\n\nI happen to have in front of me Table 1.1 of a Congressional Budget Office document which just projects out the cost of Medicaid, CHIP, and the exchange subsidies out to 2040. What is really surprising about that, to many readers, is that all the ACA stuff, the increase is 1.5 percent of GDP. It\u2019s very little. Once ACA is fully engaged, the actual cost of getting low-income people into the exchanges, expanding Medicaid for the low-income population \u2013 the things were ideologically the most polarized \u2013 that\u2019s not where the money is. In fact, the real money you save in your plan is really in Medicare and in those features.\n\nAvik: : Page 14 of my monograph, Figure 3, has a pretty similar chart. It describes the increase in spending for the coverage expansion of the ACA and overlays on top of that the legacy health care spending on Medicare and Medicaid, etc. to make exactly the same point, that there is this perception among conservatives that Obamacare is a government takeover of the health care system.\n\nAnd it certainly expands \u2013 no one would dispute \u2013 that it expands the role of government in the health care system. But it\u2019s very important in my view that conservatives understand that the government has already been heavily involved in the health care system. The real step-change was in 1965 with the passage of the amendments to the Social Security Act that created Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAnd so, if conservatives want to tackle the problem of government involvement in the health care system and rationalize government involvement in health care system in a more efficient way, it is very important for conservatives to understand that actually it\u2019s a lot of conservative voters who benefit from government involvement in the health care system, particularly on the Medicare side. And that is something that a lot of conservative voters don\u2019t understand because no one has been telling them that.\n\nHarold: : I think that they don\u2019t want to understand that. That\u2019s part of it. There is a huge element of cognitive dissonance going on where the Republican base is so weighted towards an older group of white voters, many from of whom are on Medicare, and who are actually the group of people who are the largest beneficiaries of the most imbalanced government transfers in a life cycle sense.\n\n\u2026 and not a Trojan horse\n\nAvik: : I think that is right. I have a PowerPoint that I give to conservative groups and Tea Party groups about my heath care plan. I lead with those charts, and I explain to them how much the federal government is already involved in the health care system \u2013 how so much of that is driven by spending on them. And it\u2019s something they don\u2019t realize.\n\nYou know people say, well \u2013 I get asked often when I do interviews on conservative talk radio or certain cable networks, they\u2019ll say, \u201cAvik, don\u2019t you think that Obamacare is the Trojan horse for single payer?\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cDo you realize that 90 million Americans were already on single payer health care before Obamacare? Yes Obamacare expands a single-payer component health care by expanding Medicaid, but that\u2019s not a Trojan horse. It\u2019s spelled out in Title I.\n\nHaving that sense of proportion as to what Obamacare is doing in the health care system and what was there before \u2013 to me that is the first step in helping conservatives understand where there is common ground for reform. Because if conservatives believe that Obamacare is the government takeover of the health care system, and that government wasn\u2019t doing anything before then, then they are going to obviously support repeal of Obamacare and go back to the status quo ante.\n\nHowever if they understand that actually the government has been involved in a lot of different ways and distorted a lot of different things, then you can actually start to have a constructive conversation. You say: \u201cOkay. Here are all the things that the government is doing. Let us all agree that we want the poor and the disabled and the sick to have a safety net, but we don\u2019t want to spend your hard-earned taxpayer dollars subsidizing health care for Mitt Romney and Warren Buffett. If we all agree on that, surely we can come to some interesting approach that will be different from the kind of the box that conservatives had locked themselves in.\n\nImplications for Medicare\n\nHarold: : Again this is Harold Pollack on healthinsurance.org. I am talking to Avik Roy. Right now we are talking about Medicare. In a sense your plan is really using Obamacare in a sense as a platform to go after things that you don\u2019t like about the existing health care system before Obamacare particularly it\u2019s Medicare \u2013 sort of the heavy set-up of Medicare on autopilot for older Americans \u2026\n\nAvik: : Older upper-income Americans.\n\nHarold: : Yes, including upper-income. Your plan in a sense says we\u2019re going to use the exchanges as a platform to essentially over time raise the age of Medicare and effectively use the exchanges \u2013 the subsidies within the exchanges \u2013 so that lower- and middle-income older people get subsidized, but increasingly older people would have to essentially pay their own way in Medicare. Is that an accurate description?\n\nAvik: : The important thing to understand about the exchanges is that exchanges provide premium support subsidies to anyone below a certain income threshold. Under the ACA, it\u2019s 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The idea here would be that upper-income retirees who are younger would be expected to either \u201cpay\u201d their own way as you put it or stay in the workforce, in which case their employers to continue to sponsor to their health coverage.\n\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be just up to them to just pay for it directly, necessarily. But low-income people, low- to middle-income people would still be protected by the same system that the ACA creates for people who are 64 and 63. My argument effectively is if it is humane to offer ACA-subsidized exchange-based coverage for 64-year-olds, surely it is also humane to offer the same type of coverage to 65-year-olds, especially if it guarantees the permanent financial solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. This is an important point.\n\nSo current retirees, if you are already on Medicare, these changes don\u2019t affect you at all because you are already past the retirement age. The gradual raising the eligibility age for people my age doesn\u2019t affect people who are currently retirees. If you are on Medicare today, this change does not affect you at all. It will affect people like me. People like me won\u2019t be eligible for traditional Medicare until later in life. But if I am low-income I am still protected.\n\nEffectively, the net effect of this is to substantially increase the amount of redistribution in the system. Instead of subsidizing upper-income retirees, we will continue to subsidize lower and lower middle-income retirees but not upper-income retirees who again will have the incentive to stay in the work force or pay for their health coverage themselves.\n\nWill presidential contenders embrace the plan?\n\nHarold: : Somewhat to my surprise, I am somewhat ambivalent about this \u2013 I\u2019m surprised because you might expect me to more harshly disagree with you than I might. This is, though, a massive shift of cost and financial risk off the federal government onto various other payers and onto individuals. The political fight that this element of your plan would create is enormous. I\u2019m curious how Republican presidential contenders are going to, whether they are going to run from that or embrace it.\n\nAvik: : To their credit, whatever you think of the Paul Ryan plan, everyone thought that was going to be suicide for House Republicans when they enacted that budget in 2010. They got reelected in 2012, and they looked like the House majority is not in danger in 2014. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan campaigned on this approach, not my approach but on an approach that\u2019s somewhat similar in 2012. And Republicans lost every other demographic except for older Americans.\n\nI think the key insight of the Paul Ryan approach to Medicare reform is that you don\u2019t make major changes for current retirees. If you are already on Medicare, and you are already relying on the program, and you have planned your whole life around it \u2013 that is something that one needs to preserve. But I think people who are younger and who recognize the fiscal instability of the program are much more open to gradual changes that preserve the financial benefit and the structure overall, but make reasonable adjustments, again for young Americans.\n\nThe public polling all shows that raising the eligibility age for Medicare is something \u2013 of all the different Medicare reform proposals you might choose, that\u2019s one that has historically been among the \u2013 the public has been most amenable to. And it\u2019s especially from a policy standpoint, an attractive approach when you have the ACA exchanges to ensure that low-income and low- to-middle income people still have health coverage.\n\nPart 2 of Harold Pollack\u2019s Curbside Consult with Avik Roy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Given their differences, you might be surprised that Avik Roy and Harold had a civil conversation about Roy's new \"universal exchange\" health care plan, titled \"Transcending Obamacare.\" But Pollack says every progressive should read Roy's plan.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Given their differences, you might be surprised that Avik Roy and Harold had a civil conversation about Roy's new \"universal exchange\" health care plan, titled \"Transcending Obamacare.\" But Pollack says every progressive should read Roy's plan.", "title": "\u2018Transcending Obamacare\u2019", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2014/09/06/transcending-obamacare/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2014/09/Transcending-Obamacare-Avik-Roy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "Curbside Consult, health policy, health reform repeal, Medicaid, Medicare, repeal and replace", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T05:00:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d offers valuable insights into what Republicans really could do in pushing ACA in a more conservative direction.\nMost striking, \u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d proposes a gradual, but fundamental change to Medicare as we know it.\nYes Obamacare expands a single-payer component health care by expanding Medicaid, but that\u2019s not a Trojan horse.\nWelcome to another edition of Curbside Consult and I\u2019m delighted today to have Avik Roy here to discuss with me his new health plan, \u201cTranscending Obamacare.\u201dAvik: : Hi Harold, how are you?\nto make exactly the same point, that there is this perception among conservatives that Obamacare is a government takeover of the health care system."}
