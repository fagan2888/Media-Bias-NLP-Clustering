Six years after the start of the health-care debate, Republicans keep telling reporters that they\u2019re working on a plan. (Jeffrey Young has a hilarious, frequently updated timeline of the perennially just-over-the-horizon Republican Obamacare replacement plan.) In fact, the Republicans do have a health-care plan: It is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with what we had before Obamacare. They don\u2019t want to admit that\u2019s their plan, but it is. It\u2019s right there, in the new budget released by House Republicans this week.\n\nWhen you point out the Republican health-care plan, conservatives generally object. Oh no, they will tell you. Republicans have health-care plans. Lots of \u2018em. Patrick Brennan, one of the more reasonable types at National Review, objected the other day to the premise that the Republican plan is to repeal Obamacare and do nothing. Brennan pointed out that Representative Tom Price actually has an Obamacare replacement:\n\n@jonathanchait @sahilkapur Right, because Tom Price doesn't have an Obamacare replacement plan that spends on the uninsured. \u2014 Patrick Brennan (@ptbrennan11) March 17, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 Representative Tom Price has a health-care plan. Of sorts. It\u2019s a really sketchy plan that Price has not had scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which allows it to serve the purpose of letting Republicans cite it to refute the charge that they have no plan without being held accountable for its effects. This shows the primary obstacle to Republicans uniting around an Obamacare alternative. Reforming the health-care system is very tricky, and requires trade-offs. The Republican position on health care has relied almost entirely on the public\u2019s status quo preference. Republicans have relentlessly attacked every discomfiting policy change in the Affordable Care Act and promised to change the system in ways people desire, without spelling out the very unpopular downside such changes would create.\n\nThe House budget illustrates the second obstacle to the adoption of a Republican health-care alternative. If Republicans wanted to replace Obamacare with Tom price\u2019s health-care \u201cplan,\u201d they would include it in their budget. Tom Price probably has the clout to get his health-care plan onto the desk of the person in charge of writing the House Republican budget, who also happens to be Tom Price.\n\nBut the Price-authored budget ignores the Price health-care plan for the same reason the old Ryan budget ignored the Ryan poverty plan. It\u2019s a thing Republicans want to say they\u2019re for, but don\u2019t want to make the sacrifices necessary to do it. The place where a party reconciles its competing priorities is its budget.\n\nNow, the Republican budget does not actually reconcile its competing priorities. It is filled with smoke and mirrors. It won\u2019t actually pony up the extra defense spending its hawks want, but it won\u2019t deny their wishes, either, so the budget adds a one-year \u201cemergency\u201d defense hike, then whisks it away in subsequent years, even though nobody really thinks that would happen.\n\nThe biggest single gimmick is health care. Since Republicans are theologically committed to repealing every word of Obamacare, they have to repeal not only the law\u2019s outlays, but also the tax hikes and spending cuts it uses to finance them. But they need those savings to pretend to cut the deficit. So the Republican budget claims to repeal them, and replace them with some other form of savings whose nature it won\u2019t even hint at, let alone identify.\n\nSo their health-care plan is to repeal all of Obamacare, replace its savings with $1 trillion in magic money, and then spend zero on subsidizing health insurance for the millions of Americans who would become uninsured. If Republicans wanted to spend something on an Obamacare replacement \u2014 tax credits, high risk pools, whatever \u2014 they would need to set aside money for it. They chose not to. As hard as it is to design a health-care plan, designing one that cuts $1 trillion and spends nothing is really hard.\n\n\n\nIndeed, even the existing budget fails to account for the party\u2019s competing demands. It doesn\u2019t set aside the extra defense spending that the hawks are angrily demanding. Nor does it account for the trillions in lost revenue that pretty much all the presidential candidates are promising. It\u2019s pretty clear that, when it comes time to turn the Republican budget into reality, the first constituency with its hand out will be the tax-cutters, and the next one will be the defense hawks. There\u2019s no way any money will be left over for health care. Republicans don\u2019t even have the budget room to pay for the stuff they actually care about.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "You'll get nothing and like it.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "You'll get nothing and like it.", "title": "House Republicans Unveil Plan for Replacing Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/republicans-unveil-plan-for-replacing-obamacare.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/18/18-tom-price-house-budget.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You'll get nothing and like it.", "title": "Republicans Unveil Plan for Replacing Obamacare", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/18/18-tom-price-house-budget.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, tom price", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,tom price", "published_time": "2015-03-18T17:24:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, tom price", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bdd\"", "article_summary": "In fact, the Republicans do have a health-care plan: It is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with what we had before Obamacare.\nBrennan pointed out that Representative Tom Price actually has an Obamacare replacement:@jonathanchait @sahilkapur Right, because Tom Price doesn't have an Obamacare replacement plan that spends on the uninsured.\nBut the Price-authored budget ignores the Price health-care plan for the same reason the old Ryan budget ignored the Ryan poverty plan.\nWhen you point out the Republican health-care plan, conservatives generally object.\nIf Republicans wanted to replace Obamacare with Tom price\u2019s health-care \u201cplan,\u201d they would include it in their budget."}
