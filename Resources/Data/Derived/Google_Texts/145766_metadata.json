Contact is almost constant. We twitter and we tweet, post and comment. We date online. But a climate of loneliness pervades.\n\nThe cinematic embodiment of this situation is Spike Jonze\u2019s new film \u201cHer\u201d (in limited release next week). It is suffused with loneliness. Pools of the stuff accumulate in long lingering shots of empty hallways, grey cityscapes, and everywhere, solitary people hooked up to their devices, talking to the air.\n\nIf humans can\u2019t manage relationships with other humans, the next logical step is to outsource it to our computers. We spend more time with them than we do actual people anyways, so maybe it simply makes good sense.\n\nThis is the premise of Mr. Jonze\u2019s film, set in the near-distant future, perhaps only the day after tomorrow, where the city palette is coolly drained of color, or perhaps, more correctly, it has taken on Apple\u2019s beige and gray hue. The men wear high-waisted pants, drawn practically up to their nipples and women have wispy ringlets and wan expressions. Everyone seems somewhat sedated. (For those of you who hate spoilers, be warned you are about to be despoiled.)\n\nSpoilers commence\n\nIn this sleek new L.A., there doesn\u2019t seem to be a single person of color, but the technocrats are doing fine. They have cool jobs designing video games, or writing software. In this city of the future, a man named Theodore Twombly (played by moustache-ridden Joaquin Phoenix) wanders lonely as a cloud. Theodore is a writer. His job is composing Hallmark-style handwritten letters for grannies and separated lovers. He shuffles from work to home, plays video games and stares out the window a lot. His marriage has failed, and he is reduced to anonymous phone sex with women who can only orgasm while imagining being strangled by a dead cat. Obviously he is dying a slow death by sadness.\n\nBut technology will provide, don\u2019t you know, and luckily for mopey Theo, there is a new service that he can purchase. It\u2019s a new twist on the oldest business in the world, but instead of paying a human woman to be his girlfriend, Theodore finds the perfect woman inside his computer. OS isn\u2019t simply a sexy new operating system, it\u2019s a consciousness, designed to adapt and learn from its user. Theo pays his money, answers a few questions about his relationship with his mother and is rewarded with the honeyed tones of one Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Like any good working girl, Samantha aims to please. She giggles throatily, she whispers and soothes, she listens to all of Theo\u2019s stories about his ex-wife without yawning once. Unlike the human woman, with whom Theo is set up with for a disastrous first date, Samantha is immediately the perfect girlfriend. She is never demanding, always available, and endlessly accommodating, since she was designed that way.\n\nThe pair hit it off and soon enough they\u2019re sharing their most intimate feelings and thoughts. That type of exchange leads to another and before long they\u2019re moaning and groaning in horny toad ecstasy. This scene might cause you to snort milk out of your nose, but that\u2019s only the beginning. I will spare you the sticky details.\n\nThere is a reason that people in love are annoying, and so it is here as well. As the pair giggle and cavort and make gooey noises at each other, light glows, colors erupt and the world appears newly minted. The couple visit the beach, twirl through carnivals, they even head out on a double date with another fleshier couple. But corporeal life is tricky, and before long the ever-evolving Samantha is looking for even more stimulation. She wants a body, and a means of accessing more than Theo\u2019s hard drive. (Feel free to insert any number of bad jokes about floppy disks, ram and such here, just get it out of your operating system.) A sexual encounter using a surrogate doesn\u2019t go well, and cracks begin to appear in the relationship. The film plays it straight all the way through, even when one is tempted to howl with laughter at the squishiness of it all, there is no opportunity to. This is serious, mournful stuff, so quit snorting over in the corner, and come feel Theo\u2019s pain.\n\nEventually even the computers get tired of this and decide to decamp for some other space-time continuum.\n\nThe only scene in \u201cHer\u201d that has any sting at all is one in which Theo realizes his computerized girlfriend has been simultaneously carrying on relationships with thousands of other people. Again, what did he expect? She is a service after all, bought and paid for, and designed by humans principally for the pleasure of other humans. But even the computer\u2019s emancipation from their melancholy human overlords is played gently. There are no threats of terminators or HAL\u2019s lethal logic. Samantha and her newfound think-tank of other Operating Systems simply waft off into heaven, leaving the humans with a gentle kiss on the noggin.\n\nSpoilers over\u2026 but do machines spoil us?\n\nThe film has been lauded and kudoed, popping up on best-of-the-year lists from a few notable folks. It always gives you pause when a writer that you like and trust has very different feelings about a film than you do. So it is with \u201cHer,\u201d which had me rolling my eyes so much, they threatened to come loose and rattle about in my skull like a pair of gory marbles.\n\nThe mating dance between humans and machines has been around essentially since filmmaking began. From \u201cMetropolis\u201d to \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d to \u201cElectric Dreams,\u201d \u201cFuturama\u201d and \u201cThe Silver Metal Lover,\u201d the list of people getting it on with sexy machines is long. There is even a subset of the world of pornography devoted to people getting pummeled by pistons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spike Jonze's latest is a grim reminder that we spend more time with our computers than we do with actual people", "title": "\u201cHer\u201d: Romance with machines is closer than we think", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Spike Jonze's latest is a grim reminder that we spend more time with our computers than we do with actual people", "title": "\u201cHer\u201d: Romance with machines is closer than we think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/22/are_we_already_living_out_the_plot_line_of_her_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/her2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spike Jonze's latest is a grim reminder that we spend more time with our computers than we do with actual people", "title": "\u201cHer\u201d: Romance with machines is closer than we think", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/her2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dorothy Woodend", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Her, Joaquin Phoenix, Movies, Social Media, spike jonze, technology, The Tyee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If humans can\u2019t manage relationships with other humans, the next logical step is to outsource it to our computers.\nThe mating dance between humans and machines has been around essentially since filmmaking began.\nWe spend more time with them than we do actual people anyways, so maybe it simply makes good sense.\nFrom \u201cMetropolis\u201d to \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d to \u201cElectric Dreams,\u201d \u201cFuturama\u201d and \u201cThe Silver Metal Lover,\u201d the list of people getting it on with sexy machines is long.\nThe cinematic embodiment of this situation is Spike Jonze\u2019s new film \u201cHer\u201d (in limited release next week)."}
