Curry, NNPA Columnist\n\nNo United States president has been more disrespected than Barack Obama \u2013 and his family.\n\nThe hatred for the nation\u2019s first African American president is so deep that all but seven Republicans in the U.S. Senate were willing to write a letter to Iran that amounted to treason on a grand scale.\n\nIn an effort to derail talks that would limit Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons, 47 Republican senators signed an \u201copen letter\u201d to Iran\u2019s leaders claiming any deal they reach with the administration won\u2019t last after Obama leaves office.\n\nIn an issue that caused the Republican senators to be labeled traitors in a New York Daily News headline. An editorial: said, \u201cRegardless of President Obama\u2019s fecklessness in negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran, 47 Republican U.S. senators engaged in treachery by sending a letter to the mullahs aimed at cutting the legs out from under America\u2019s commander-in-chief. We join GOP signatories in opposing the pact as outlined, but we strenuously condemn their betrayal of the U.S. constitutional system.\u201d\n\nIn case there is any doubt, the liberal political website PoliticusUSA stated, \u201cAccording to the dictionary definition, a traitor is one who betrays a person, a principle, or especially their country. It is of no consequence why someone, or a group, chooses to work in opposition to their nation, or fellow citizens\u2019 well-being, because if their intent and result of their actions is to deliberately damage or cause harm to their country or fellow citizens, they are by definition traitors.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all that long ago that Democrats and Republicans observed the rule that while we might have our internal debates, when it comes for foreign policy, we speak with one voice \u2013 that of the president.\n\nHouse Republicans ignored that long-standing custom by inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress, knowing he would be critical of ongoing negotiations by the U.S. and its allies to freeze Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons. The White House was not consulted on the invitation, a sharp departure from established protocol.\n\nThe disrespect for Obama and the presidency itself has reached such a low point that a headline in the Washington Post summed it up this way: \u201cRepublicans are beginning to act as though Barack Obama isn\u2019t even the president.\u201d\n\nThe story explained, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that no president in modern times has had his legitimacy questioned by the opposition party as much as Barack Obama. But as his term in office enters its final phase, Republicans are embarking on an entirely new enterprise: They have decided that as long as he holds the office of the presidency, it\u2019s no longer necessary to respect the office itself.\u201d\n\nAnd many argue that the hatred extends well beyond partisan politics.\n\nPolitcusUSA stated, \u201cIt is likely that throughout America\u2019s short history, except for the traitorous Confederacy, no group of individuals has exhibited the characteristic betrayal of a traitor more than conservatives in general, and Republicans in particular. What makes their actions all the more despicable is that their traitorous actions are founded on racial animus for one man; and allegiance to foreigners and one tiny segment of the population.\u201d\n\nThe attacks on Obama began when he first ran for president, with some conservatives openly questioning whether he was a U.S. citizen.\n\nMarilyn Davenport, a member of the Orange County Republican Party in California, e-mailed a cartoon in 2010 with the face of President Obama superimposed on a chimpanzee. Also pictured were two older chimpanzees described as \u201cparents.\u201d The inscription on the cartoon read: \u201cNow you know why \u2013 No birth certificate.\u201d\n\nThe New York Post went well over the line of respectability by publishing a cartoon in 2009, in the wake of Connecticut police shooting a pet chimpanzee, depicting the authors of the stimulus bill as a dead chimpanzee.\n\nAnd who could forget Rep. Joe Wilson [R-S.C.], interrupting a 2009 presidential address on health care to Congress in by shouting, \u201cYou, lie!\u201d\n\nThe personal attacks have not been limited to President Obama \u2013 his entire family has been attacked.\n\nLast week, Emmy-winning Univision host Rodner Figueroa was fired for saying, \u201cMichelle Obama looks like she\u2019s part of the cast of Planet of the Apes.\u201d\n\nMichael O\u2019Neal, Speaker of the Kansas House, circulated an email referring to the first lady as \u201cMrs. Yo\u2019 Mama.\u201d\n\nEven Sasha and Malia have been targets of conservatives. They have been upbraided from everything from taking their spring break in the Bahamas to the clothes they wore when their father pardoned a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nAs Media Matters, the watchdog group, stated, \u201cOn May 27, [2010] President Obama explained at a press conference that he was reminded daily about the consequences of the oil spill by his daughter Malia who asked him did you plug the hole yet? while he was shaving.\u201d\n\nBoth Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh saw fit to imitate Malia on air.\n\nNo stunt is too low or too vile for conservatives who hate everything about Obama, including his race.\n\nGeorge E.
