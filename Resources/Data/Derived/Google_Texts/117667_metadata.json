(Photo: ~Courtesy of Felecia Nace) Story Highlights Somerset County author says her book helps schools and communities embrace and implement change\n\nBook was written with a focus on school leaders, in layman\u2019s terms\n\nFelecia Nace \u2014 a former teacher, a change facilitator for schools and businesses, and an education specialist for the New Jersey Department of Education \u2014 has written a book exploring the subject of systemic change in education.\n\nHer recent book, \u201cMassaging the Mindset: An Intelligent Approach to Systemic Change in Education\u201d (Rowman and Littlefield; February, 2015) is targeted to help schools and communities, she said.\n\n\u201cThis book was written with a focus on school leaders, but I chose to write in layman\u2019s terms,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI wanted families, community members and educators in various positions to easily grasp the concepts about current trends and changes in schools in the U.S and how each of us plays a unique role, and most importantly, a shared responsibility in the education process.\u201d\n\nNace explained that systemic change or collective movement of a system can be challenging for school districts, businesses and even families.\n\n\u201cIt is often difficult for a large group of individuals to come to agreement about how directional changes will take shape,\u201d Nace said. \u201cIn organizations like schools that can sometimes have difficulty moving innovative ideas forward, leaders will often say \u2018employees don\u2019t want to change.\u2019 However, there are three sides to every story. My book is written from the perspective that humans are creatures of habit and \u2018effective change is learned behavior.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll of us have a comfort zone that we enjoy. In order for systemic changes (which involves collective movement) to occur in schools, everyone attached to the system must recognize some need for change, know how the change will enhance learning, have a voice in the change process, and understand the expectations of each individual who is attached to a given school system. So, it may not be that people don\u2019t want to change, but more a case of people don\u2019t know how to effectively change. In other words, the elements of systemic change can be taught.\u201d\n\nIn addition, she continued, the breadth and depth of inclusiveness and the clarity of messages in an organization can be the \u201ctailwind\u201d for moving changes forward.\n\nShe said she used Somerset County resources to research her book.\n\n\u201cThe Clarence Dillon Public Library in Bedminster was a great resource to me in completing my book as the staff was extremely helpful and it was often a quiet place to write away from the distractions of home,\u201d she said. \u201cThe county library in Bridgewater also served as a great resource.\u201d\n\nNace holds a doctorate in Educational Leadership and Change from Fielding University, Santa Barbara, California.\n\nShe said the idea for the book started from a graduate course about 14 years ago.\n\n\u201cEver since I enrolled in a systemic thinking course in graduate school back in 2001, I have been fascinated with how change occurs in large organizations \u2014 taking into account all the different personalities, opinions and mindsets that leaders of organizations encounter,\u201d she said. \u2018\u201cNaturally, my curiosity about systems thinking and systemic change centered around school systems since I have been involved with school systems for over 20 years, wearing many different hats. Systemic change is not a new topic in education. It has been written about in myriad forms.\u201d\n\nShe said it is a community effort and parents, administrators, community leaders, teachers and school staff must work together for the greater good.\n\n\u201cGiven the tsunami of changes that schools are currently navigating, it is wise to consider that all of us \u2014 educational leaders, school staff, parents and community members \u2014 hold a piece of the puzzle about how to improve education, but rarely do we have the opportunity to share our ideas on a large scale,\u201d Nace said. \u201cThis was my opportunity to share my collective experiences in the field of education with the world.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Nace is serving on Bedminster\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission, appointed by Mayor Steve Parker in January 2015 to serve a three-year term. The Historic Preservation Commission advises the township\u2019s Planning Board and Zoning Board of Adjustment on all matters pertaining to historic districts, sites and structures.\n\n\u201cSince serving on the board, I have learned of hidden treasures about the history of Bedminster and the surrounding area,\u201d Nace said.\n\n\u201cMassaging the Mindset: An Intelligent Approach to Systemic Change in Education\u201d is available online through Rowman and Littlefield publishers (https://rowman.com/RLPublishers), barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com. The softcover is priced at $20, eBook 19.99, and the hardcover is priced at $40. The official date of publishing was Feb. 11.
