Jan Brewer said Wednesday that she does not want U.S. House Republicans to succeed in their bid to shut down the Affordable Care Act, saying it would \u0093devastate\u0094 the state budget.\n\n\"Brewer said she has never been a fan of \u0093Obamacare.\u0092\u0092 And she pointed out she was among several governors who sued \u0097 unsuccessfully \u0097 to have it declared unconstitutional.\n\n\"But the governor said once it was clear the law would take effect, she sought ways to have Arizona take advantage of a key provision rewarding states that expand their Medicaid programs. In this state, that is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, which she described as the \u0093gold standard\u0094 of Medicaid programs.\n\n\"And she said that made it worthwhile to fight with members of her own Republican Party, to the point of forming an alliance with legislative Democrats, to push the plan through.\n\n\u0093'The bottom line is we need that money in our economy to save rural hospitals and jobs in the rural areas,' the governor said, as well as making sure hospitals in metropolitan areas, where most AHCCCS patients are seen, get paid. 'It\u0092s all about jobs and getting back federal dollars that our taxpayers have paid to the federal government, to bring them home.'\n\n\"Brewer estimates the Affordable Care Act will produce $1.6 billion in payments a year to the state\u0092s Medicaid program. And she said there is no direct cost to Arizona taxpayers, with the state\u0092s share being paid by a tax on hospitals.\n\n\"That concern is causing the normally partisan governor to lash out at congressional Republicans as much as she criticizes the president for the shutdown in Washington over the issue of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"'It\u0092s pretty clear that the Obama administration does not want to compromise one iota,' the Republican governor said.\n\n\"But asked if House Speaker John Boehner is wrong in refusing to put a clean \u0093continuing resolution\u0094 on the floor for a vote \u0097 one without repeal or delay of the Affordable Care Act \u0097 Brewer said it would be wrong to put all the blame on that side.\n\n\u0093'I will agree that Congress doesn\u0092t want to compromise one iota,' she explained.\n\n\u0093'They need to come together,' Brewer continued. 'They have to understand it\u0092s their job to get it done.\u0092'\n\n\"And Brewer said those involved need to be realistic and recognize that Obamacare was enacted, it remains the law and the votes are not there to repeal it.\n\n\"In pursuing Medicaid expansion \u0097 and tapping into the Affordable Care Act \u0097 the governor caused a schism in her own Republican Party earlier this year. If the federal law goes away, the problems Brewer created in her party will have been for naught.\n\n\"But the governor said that\u0092s only a piece of the fallout if Arizona does not get the money from Washington she is counting on.\n\n\u0093'If it doesn\u0092t happen, then we will be faced with a calamity,\u0092' she said.\n\n\"The state was able to ignore a voter-approved mandate to provide expanded Medicaid services because the courts ruled the initiative required Arizona to use only 'available'\u0092 funds, which at a time of budget crisis were limited.\"\n\n\"Since then, state finances have recovered. It ended the last fiscal year with close to $1 billion in the bank, plus another $450 million in a 'rainy day'\u0092 fund \u0097 money Brewer said she fears a court would force it use to fulfill the voter mandate.\"\n\n\u0093'We will be forced by the courts to take those dollars out of our budget to pay for it,\u0092' she said, meaning less money for other programs.\"", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "health coverage, health issues, healthcare reform, obama care, hmo, health care bill, health savings account, health care legislation, health care in the us, affordable care act, health care coverage, costs of health care, health care costs, obama health care, health care problems, health insurance costs, health care reform bill, health policies, health care policy, health care laws, health care regulations, health care politics", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/community/blogs/images/health_stew/mug_170x161.png", "type": "article", "description": "Politics makes strange bedfellows, that's for sure!", "title": "Arizona Governor Jan Brewer cries"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001044693856,507486035", "app_id": 135637993114591}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0946\"", "article_summary": "\"Brewer estimates the Affordable Care Act will produce $1.6 billion in payments a year to the state\u0092s Medicaid program.\n\"In pursuing Medicaid expansion \u0097 and tapping into the Affordable Care Act \u0097 the governor caused a schism in her own Republican Party earlier this year.\nJan Brewer said Wednesday that she does not want U.S. House Republicans to succeed in their bid to shut down the Affordable Care Act, saying it would \u0093devastate\u0094 the state budget.\nIn this state, that is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, which she described as the \u0093gold standard\u0094 of Medicaid programs.\n\"But the governor said that\u0092s only a piece of the fallout if Arizona does not get the money from Washington she is counting on."}
