Since its October 1 launch, the marketplace site has been difficult to access.\n\nHowever, officials with nonprofit groups helping residents enroll noted that there have been improvements to the website recently. For example, residents can now get a list of the insurance plans available in their county, as well as an estimate of how much insurance will cost after subsidies.\n\nStill, various error messages and blank screens generally greet people trying to complete an application through the site.\n\nDonnette Williams, social programs manager for Newark Community Health Centers Inc., has been overseeing the program to enroll residents in her organization, which is one of the state\u2019s federally qualified health centers.\n\nWilliams said the application process has been time-consuming, since many of the residents applying for coverage lack basic knowledge about health insurance. The application itself can take up to 45 minutes, not including the explanations provided by staff members.\n\nIn addition, the paper application only determines whether the resident is eligible for the marketplace insurance. Once they have received a mailed response from the federal government, they must use one of the specific health plans offered through the marketplace.\n\nWilliams said she is hopeful that the site problems will be resolved soon, allowing her staff to concentrate more on community outreach. Federal officials have not provided a timeframe for when the site will be fully accessible.\n\n\u201cWe try it every day, because we\u2019re waiting for the day where we can actually complete an online [application],\u201d said Williams, noting that the problems with the website have also prevented her staff from identifying residents whose incomes make them better candidates for Medicaid.\n\nKatherine Grant-Davis, president and CEO of the New Jersey Primary Care Association, said much work can still be done to prepare residents while the website remains down. Her association represents all of the state\u2019s federally qualified health centers.\n\n\u201cMost people are in the information-seeking stage at this point,\u201d Grant-Davis said, adding that the centers are in the process of distributing thousands of flyers about the online marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that people are frustrated at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, they will get it resolved soon. It\u2019s only been 15 days.\u201d\n\nDecember 15 is the deadline to enroll for coverage that starts January 1, although the open enrollment period will last until March 31. But Cantor is skeptical about the website\u2019s ability to handle a rush of applicants right before December 15.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t shown that they can handle that, to say the least,\u201d Cantor said.\n\nHe suggested residents interested in the marketplace wait two weeks before proceeding.\n\n\u201cCertainly you\u2019re not going to get insurance any faster if you register this week vs. the end of the month,\u201d he said.\n\nBut those looking to enroll residents are hoping to make the best of the situation.\n\nMarion Lynch, spokeswoman for the FoodBank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties, said her organization has helped residents complete paper applications.\n\nThe organization is one of five in the state that received federal funds to serve as \u201cnavigators\u201d to help residents enroll through the marketplace. In addition, the foodbank used the opportunity to help residents enroll in other healthcare and social programs, including some who are newly eligible for Medicaid.\n\nShe said the information that is available on the marketplace site -- such as the premium and subsidy estimate -- is \u201cwhat most consumers want\u201d at this point.\n\n\u201cOnce the technical issues are resolved they can go in and sign up,\u201d Lynch said, \u201cand this gives people time to be smart consumers.\u201d\n\nEileen Henderson, vice president for the Camden-based Center for Family Services, said her organization has focused on scheduling residents for application appointments in coming weeks, as well as participating in outreach efforts. The center is serving as the navigator for southern New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult, but we\u2019re hoping very soon that the volume issues are going to become more manageable,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cOf course, it is anxiety-producing for some of the consumers", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/13/1015/2230"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "While navigators remain hopeful, concerns begin to grow about marketplace delays", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a11\"", "article_summary": "Problems with the online federal health insurance marketplace have forced New Jersey residents to revert to pen and paper when they apply for coverage.\nIn addition, the paper application only determines whether the resident is eligible for the marketplace insurance.\nSince its October 1 launch, the marketplace site has been difficult to access.\nHowever, officials with nonprofit groups helping residents enroll noted that there have been improvements to the website recently.\nShe said the information that is available on the marketplace site -- such as the premium and subsidy estimate -- is \u201cwhat most consumers want\u201d at this point."}
