He\u2019s losing women by 16 percent.\n\nWhile Republicans usually have gender and age gaps, these disparities are particularly large. While a Republican can get away with age and gender gaps, Trump is seeing age and gender canyons.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that this poll only shows him losing to Clinton by 6 percent overall \u2014 while the RealClearPolitics average of polls says she is beating him by 11.2 percent. This isn\u2019t an anti-Trump poll by any means, and if Trump wants to be competitive in November, he needs to figure out how to work some demographic miracles.\n\nWhile Trump does bring in new voters, the polls show he\u2019s alienating more than he\u2019s bringing in.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via AP/Elise Amendola A series of awful polls from across different networks and educational institutions are confirming what the #NeverTrump movement has been saying for months: Donald Trump is unelectable \u2014 even against Hillary Clinton.
