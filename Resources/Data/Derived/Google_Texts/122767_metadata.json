He would have been a failed promise.\n\nInstead, Obama finished the week in Charleston singing, really singing, and returned to a White House lit up like a rainbow that people who wanted to celebrate just felt drawn to. Hours after the partying stopped, they stayed late into the night, just sitting and staring at the building and thinking about how much had just changed.\n\nWhat Obama first represented as a half-white, half-black man of a new generation, with the middle name Hussein and all the rest, seemed to have actually arrived in America \u2014 that guy America voted for in 2008 seemed to suddenly (and to a lot of his supporters, finally) show up. So did the country they voted for.\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s voice broke through in a way that it hasn\u2019t, maybe, since the 2004 keynote address that introduced him to America. A week that started with the media obsessing over one charged word he said ended with the country glued to his whole 25-minute eulogy in South Carolina on how the country is a whole lot more racist but also a whole lot more hopeful than it likes to admit, reverberating and replaying on the news, on iPhones and on YouTube all through the night and weekend.\n\nObama often talks about his presidency as just trying to write his paragraph in history.\n\nThe past week, said Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, is \u201can exclamation point on already historic and satisfying paragraphs.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday captured the frustration of those who feel the country\u2019s changed too much and too quickly under their feet, calling the Supreme Court rulings \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d in a radio interview with Sean Hannity.\n\nEven inside the White House, the rush of change is almost overwhelming.\n\n\u201cThe country is emerging in a way that is interesting and different \u2014 and we\u2019re all taking it all in,\u201d said a senior White House aide. Obama\u2019s \u201cvoice and his role in a lot of these issues were important for him personally, and for his presidency.\u201d\n\nWhen an Ebola panic set in, when Baltimore rioted, when American hostages were killed in yet another stumble against ISIL, the country demanded he respond. This week, however, Americans really wanted to hear what he had to say.\n\nObama and his aides are determined to seize this moment, though they\u2019re still not quite sure what that will mean beyond getting him and his voice out more.\n\n\u201cWhat we did this week was very intentional,\u201d the White House aide said. \u201cThis is what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe singing, though, wasn\u2019t in the script.\n\nThe Obama White House is a superstitious place, where meetings often have to pause for everyone in the room to knock on wood (or whatever the nearest conference table is made of) when anyone does. There was a lot of extra wood knocking at the beginning of the week: court decisions on health care and gay marriage that they couldn\u2019t control but they knew could damage the president\u2019s legacy, a nagging nervousness about the last few steps on fast-track trade authority, warily eyeing the discussion about race in the wake of a vicious massacre, worries about whether the eulogy would hit the mark that they knew America needed it to.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of tension,\u201d said Plouffe, who dropped by the White House on a trip through Washington earlier in the week.\n\nOn Friday, after the Supreme Court had declared a right to gay marriage just a day after upholding a key provision of Obamacare, a lot of people were high-fiving and hugging each other around the West Wing, saying, \u201cCan you imagine if this had all gone the other way?\u201d\n\nIn the helicopter on the way to Andrews to fly to Charleston, Obama started talking to some of his staff about the eulogy he would deliver at the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, gunned down with fellow worshippers in his own church by a man determined to start a race war. Obama had been spending a lot of time thinking about \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as he wrote the eulogy deep into Thursday night and Friday morning. He\u2019d just celebrated the second Supreme Court decision in a row in the Rose Garden. Maybe he\u2019d sing.\n\nFive days of emotion, validation and vindication, said senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who was traveling with him, \u201cgave him an opportunity to capture the attention, the imagination and the potential of the American people. You have to seize those opportunities, and this week he did.\u201d\n\nHe took the stage in Charleston still not sure what he\u2019d do. He got to the moment in his prepared text. He sang the first two words, paused, watched and listened to the reaction. He finished the first line, paused again. And then he and 6,000 people were all singing together.\n\nThe thing about a black church, one of the bishops who\u2019d been on stage joked later in the day, is that if they\u2019re not with you, they\u2019ll just stare at you and let you sing \u2014 but if they\u2019re with you, they\u2019ll be on their feet, clapping and singing and following your lead.\n\nObama, the bishop said, could have kept them going for the whole second verse, too.\n\nNo one could have predicted seven years ago that the pro-gay rights Human Rights Campaign could have shown up at the Supreme Court on Friday morning confident enough that its \u201cLove Wins\u201d balloons were already inflated. No one could have predicted on the morning that nine African-Americans were gunned down at Bible study that the Confederate flag would start coming down around the country, almost by acclamation.\n\nFew would have guessed that at this point in Obama\u2019s presidency, having overseen years of historic Democratic losses in Congress and statehouses, Obama would be at all relevant to the political conversation \u2014 and yet so far, the Republican and Democratic primary fields have both largely been a debate about him and what he\u2019s doing.\n\nGetty\n\nMeanwhile, progressives on the Hill, especially those still burning over how hard he steamrolled them on trade, are rolling their eyes at the lionizing. Remember, they point out, that many of the big things Obama gets the credit for didn\u2019t originate with him \u2014 people like Nancy Pelosi were pushing him further on health care than the White House wanted to go, or out in favor of a gay marriage plank in the 2012 convention platform when he was still deciding what to say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been pushed into everything they\u2019ve ever done,\u201d one senior Democratic Hill staffer griped Saturday morning, expressing that feeling.\n\nThe last time there was an impromptu party in front of the White House, it was the night Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed. Six and a half years in, Obama\u2019s America is now officially more \u201cModern Family\u201d than \u201c24.\u201d\n\nThe Obama people are true believers, the kind of people who spent Friday at the White House and in bars afterward hugging each other, saying \u201cthis is what we fought for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did a good thing,\u201d Plouffe said he wrote to a fellow Obama \u201908 alum on Friday night, urging anyone who questions what they delivered to go back to Obama\u2019s 2007 kickoff speech in Springfield and note the consistency.\n\nOr, more sarcastically: \u201cWhen America elected a proudly progressive President \u201908, conservatives had a lot of nightmare scenarios, this is the week they came true,\u201d former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted Friday afternoon.\n\nWhen he got back from Charleston on Friday, Obama didn\u2019t join the party. He went right into the residence, to spend the evening with his wife and his family and get a chance to take in all that happened.\n\n\u201cThe equilibrium of the country has moved to some extent more to the left, and the equilibrium of the country is being moved by the sensibilities of millennials for whom human rights, civil rights mean more,\u201d said National Urban League president Marc Morial, standing on Friday afternoon outside the church where the shooting happened after listening to the president give the eulogy. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to yesterday.\u201d\n\nYesterday\u2019s a long time ago.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He sang.
