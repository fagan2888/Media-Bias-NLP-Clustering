The couple was first married during the Mountaintop Matrimony three years ago, and have come back each year since to renew their vows.\n\n\u201cWe actually met on a mountain during a mountain biking trip when he was my excursion leader,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe both love the mountains and love to ski.\n\n\u201d When we got engaged, we both knew we didn\u2019t necessarily want to spend a lot of money on a wedding, so we decided this is where we should do it. I even bought white snow pants and a white jacket instead of buying a wedding dress, and I\u2019ve gotten more use out of it than I ever could have with a dress.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the couples gathered in the cabin were returning guests \u2014 some with over a decade of the tradition under their belts \u2014 the majority were first-timers.\n\nKarla and Jed Rumora first met in third grade, but had lost touched. After each ended previous marriages, the two reconnected on Facebook and got hitched just two years ago.\n\nFor them, this tradition only adds to their fairy tale romance 40 years in the making.\n\n\u201cWe were sweethearts from third to seventh grade, so this is truly like marrying your best friend,\u201d Karla Rumora said. \u201cJed always loved skiing and loved Colorado, and since his birthday was in January, this was my gift to him. It\u2019s our first time, but he\u2019s always said he\u2019d marry me every year from here on out, so we\u2019ll likely be coming back to do this again.\u201d\n\nOf the 89 couples to participate, 14 used the annual Valentine\u2019s tradition to officially tie the knot. The ceremony was ordained by the Rev. Harry Heilman of Universal Life Church and long-time minister of the Mountaintop Matrimony celebrations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this 23 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working here and would marry various couples on the mountain on Valentine\u2019s Day, and now it\u2019s turned into something that can bring crowds of hundreds up here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, ultimately it\u2019s the folks renewing their vows who start to cry during the ceremony, because they\u2019re looking backward and forward at their lives together. But they always take care of the new couples there, too. Everybody is just happy and smiling.\u201d\n\nCouples were dressed in anything from traditional wear, such as white veils and wedding dresses, to riskier and more distinctive dress, such as a pair of matching penguin costumes.\n\nBut all wore matching smiles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got two hearts beating in tandem, and that\u2019s a lasting force that will get you through all trials and tribulations in life,\u201d Heilman said amongst cheers and an occasional whizzing snowball.\n\n\u201cHey, you all know your anniversary now, don\u2019t you?\u201d he continued. \u201cGrab an extra pair of hands next to you and stay warm today. Let\u2019s all ski together and be merry.\u201d\n\nNatalie Munio: 303-954-1666, nmunio@denverpost.com or @nataliemunio", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Valentine\u2019s Day: Dozens of couples marry at Loveland Ski Area\u2019s Mountaintop Matrimony", "title": "Valentine\u2019s Day: Dozens of couples marry at Loveland Ski Area\u2019s Mountaintop Matrimony", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/14/valentines-day-dozens-of-couples-marry-at-loveland-ski-areas-mountaintop-matrimony/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__cd15VALENTINES_HR_HHR0638p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160214__cd15VALENTINES_HR_HHR0638p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T16:04:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:13:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The couple was first married during the Mountaintop Matrimony three years ago, and have come back each year since to renew their vows.\nLOVELAND SKI AREA \u2014 Ski helmets adorned with white lace veils and black silk top-hats floated down the ski slopes of Loveland Mountain on Valentine\u2019s Day, as about 100 couples flocked to the mountain for the ski area\u2019s 25th annual Mountaintop Matrimony.\nHarry Heilman of Universal Life Church and long-time minister of the Mountaintop Matrimony celebrations.\nThe Mountaintop Matrimony annual event allows couples an opportunity to get married or renew their marriage vows for a 2-for-1 lift ticket price, just $ 65, in a \u201cmass wedding\u201d ceremony on the cabin\u2019s outdoor deck.\n\u201cWe actually met on a mountain during a mountain biking trip when he was my excursion leader,\u201d Bennett said."}
