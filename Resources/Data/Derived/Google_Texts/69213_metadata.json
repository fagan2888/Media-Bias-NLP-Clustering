Ted Cruz said Tuesday he is signing up his family for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act, a law the Republican presidential candidate has vowed to repeal should he win the White House.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nCruz formally launched his presidential campaign on Monday, and his wife, Heidi Cruz, began an unpaid leave of absence from her job as a managing director in the Houston office of Goldman Sachs. That meant the family would soon lose access to health insurance through Mrs. Cruz's job, triggering a need for the Cruz family to find a new policy.\n\nThe first-term senator from Texas said he is looking at options available on a health insurance exchange, or a clearinghouse of policies available to Americans who don't receive coverage through their employers. The Democrats' health care law, also known as Obamacare, created the exchange system.\n\nMembers of Congress and their staff not otherwise covered, such as via a spouse's health care insurance, are required to enroll in a plan sold through an exchange under an amendment to the law crafted by Sen.

His advisers said that remains his plan and pointed to his comments to the newspaper from Iowa, which hosts the lead-off caucuses in early 2016.\n\n\"I believe in 2017, a new president, a Republican president, will sign legislation repealing every word of it,\" Cruz told the Register.\n\nDemocrats highlighted that Cruz is now enrolling in a program he frequently criticizes.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act, by design, helps Americans who have gaps in employment get coverage, and it's working,\" Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Holly Shulman said. \"We encourage others to follow presidential candidate Ted Cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Philip Elliott on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/philip_elliott", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/LIFESTYLE AND BUDGET,/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS,/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/Commodities,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.abstract": "Sen.
