(AP) - Eugene police are closer to buying about 170 body cameras thanks to a $249,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe city of Eugene must match the grant announced Wednesday in order for the department to get the cameras and space to store the recordings, The Register-Guard reported (http://is.gd/gGaUOF ).\n\nAssistant Police Chief Karl Durr said he hopes to have most officers using body cameras by next year.\n\nBody cameras eventually will become standard equipment for police officers everywhere, Durr said. He said the department already was discussing how to finance and deploy body-worn cameras, which cost $300 to $1,100 each, when it learned about the federal grant.\n\nThe Eugene and Beaverton police departments were the only ones in Oregon selected to receive the federal grant. In its grant application, Eugene included letters of commitment from multiple organizations, including the local chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\n\u201cWe feel like the more transparency the police have, the more trust there will be in their work,\u201d said Eric Richardson, president of the NAACP\u2019s Eugene-Springfield chapter.\n\nBefore buying the cameras, the Police Department will develop policies that match Oregon law. House Bill 2571, passed earlier this year, mandates how video is to be handled, such as blurring faces in videos that are made public.\n\nDepartment policy also will address when the cameras must be turned on and which interactions are to be recorded.\n\nThe department must also decide how to store video that\u2019s recorded. The department can use its own physical storage or opt for cloud storage, which means that data is stored, managed and backed up over the Internet.\n\n\u201cThere are other issues such as security that we have to take a look at,\u201d Durr said. \u201cThe hardware has come down in price \u2026 but your true cost is your long-term storage.\u201d\n\nHow long video will be stored, Durr said, could depend on the type of incident that\u2019s been recorded: six months at a minimum, forever at a maximum.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Register-Guard, http://www.registerguard.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eugene police are closer to buying about 170 body cameras thanks to a $249,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Eugene police are closer to buying about 170 body cameras thanks to a $249,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.", "title": "Federal grant will help Eugene police get body cameras", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/24/federal-grant-will-help-eugene-police-get-body-cam/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/24/95155193fbc3f12a820f6a7067007464.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/24/95155193fbc3f12a820f6a7067007464.jpg", "description": "Eugene police are closer to buying about 170 body cameras thanks to a $249,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.", "card": "summary", "title": "Federal grant will help Eugene police get body cameras"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfeaa\"", "article_summary": "EUGENE, Ore.
