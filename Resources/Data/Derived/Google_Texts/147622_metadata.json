Richards, CEO of Medical Associates Plus @ Belle Terrace, said the clinic applied for and was awarded a $255,914 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as a part of $350 million that the department gave out to nearly 1,200 community health centers across the country in an effort to increase access to medical, dental, behavioral health or vision care, according to a release from the department.\n\nMore than 30 centers in Georgia, including East Georgia Healthcare Center in Swainsboro, received nearly $8.8 million in this Health Center Expanded Services round of funding that was provided through the Affordable Care Act, the department said.\n\nMedical Associates Plus received more than $900,000 from the department last month to begin operating a clinic in Keysville to provide primary care there.\n\nThe Augusta clinic plans to use part of the new funding to hire a licensed clinical social worker to address behavioral health issues, Richards said.\n\n\u201cWe find that a significant number of people we serve have either a behavioral health or a mental health condition that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we want to make sure we are providing comprehensive services.\u201d\n\nPart of the money will also go toward adding a physician to the center\u2019s clinic in Wrens, Richards said.
