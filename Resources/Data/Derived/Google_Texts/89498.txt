TEANECK â€”Two Teaneck parents are suing Saddle River Day School for failing to protect their teenage daughter from tormenters even though the state's tough new anti-bullying law only applies to public schools, according to a report on northjersey.com

The Bergen county private school's officials have said they follow most of the law's provisions voluntarily, but the case raises questions about whether private schools should be held accountable for their response to bullying.

In an interview with The Record, attorney Elliot Malone decline to provide specific details of the bullying, but said the harassment involved "social exclusion" of his clients' daughter by other students.

Unable to cite the anti-bullying law in the complaint, Malone's clients based their lawsuit on alleged violations of the state Consumer Fraud Act and breach of contract for the school's failure to enforce it's own anti-harassment policies.
