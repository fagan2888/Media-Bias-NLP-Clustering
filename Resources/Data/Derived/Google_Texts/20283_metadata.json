Some motorists had to wait for an open space.\n\nSuch heavy absentee voting before an off-year primary is rare in the St. Louis area and speaks to the likely interest in the region\u2019s marquee contest on Tuesday\u2019s ballot \u2013 the Democratic and Republican primaries for county executive.\n\nEven so, Rita Days -- the county\u2019s Democratic elections director (there\u2019s a Republican elections director as well) \u2013 predicts that the county\u2019s overall voter turnout may end up less than the 20 percent prediction that she forwarded to the Missouri secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI was being optimistic,\u2019\u2019 said Days, adding that she feared the county\u2019s voter turnout could be 15 percent or lower by Tuesday. That would be far below the county\u2019s turnout in the August 2010 primary.\n\nAugust 2010 primary attracted more Republicans\n\nIn August 2010, St. Louis County figures show that 23.5 percent of its registered voters showed up at the polls, even though no local primary contest generated as much interest as this year\u2019s county-executive race.\n\nMost of those who turned out in August 2010 turnout were Republican, despite the county\u2019s Democratic-leaning makeup. The reasons?\n\nA GOP primary battle for state auditor;\n\nInterest in Proposition C \u2013 a conservative-backed measure to bar enforcement in Missouri of many of the provisions in the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nIn August 2010, about 11,000 absentee votes were cast in St. Louis County. This year, the absentee-ballot tally was 10,700, as of the close of business Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, more than 400 people had shown up to cast ballots by mid-afternoon, Days said.\n\nAbsentee balloting also will be available on Saturday at the Election Board headquarters, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nThe art and science of predicting voter turnout\n\nProjecting voter turnout in a statewide primary can be a tricky business -- and one reason polls often turn out to be inaccurate.\n\nVictory in a primary often belongs to the candidate who has been the most successful in getting his or her supporters to the polls. An energized base of backers can often knock out a poll\u2019s predictions. (Just ask John Brunner, who many polls had predicted would win the 2012 GOP primary in Missouri for the U.S. Senate nomination. Todd Akin handily won instead.)\n\nThat uncertainty may explain why the Missouri secretary of state\u2019s office is not issuing a prediction for next Tuesday\u2019s primary. Instead a spokesman said that the office was simply passing on the estimates offered by local election officials around the state.\n\nBased on those local estimates, Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander\u2019s office reported that the predicted overall statewide turnout would come to 26.9 percent. But his spokesman emphasized that the figure came from compiling the local estimates and was not Kander\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe projections from the 116 voting jurisdictions around the state varied widely, from Knox County\u2019s prediction of 69 percent voter turnout to Howell County\u2019s estimate that only 9 percent of its voters will show up.\n\nIn the St. Louis area, the county\u2019s 20 percent prediction was among the lowest. Election officials in St. Charles were estimating a turnout of 35 percent, with St. Louis offering up a projection of 25 percent. Jefferson County election officials predicted a turnout of 18.2 percent.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Business was brisk Friday afternoon at the St. Louis County Election Board, where lines of people \u2013 most of them elderly -- were waiting to cast an", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-county-election-board-packed-absentee-voters", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201408/CountyElecBrd.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Business was brisk Friday afternoon at the St. Louis County Election Board, where lines of people \u2013 most of them elderly -- were waiting to cast an", "title": "St. Louis County Election Board Packed With Absentee Voters"}, "story_id": 337187972, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "St. Louis County Election Board Packed With Absentee Voters"}, "nid": 38552, "datePublished": "2014-08-01", "keywords": "Jason Kander, Rita Days, Absentee voting", "wordCount": 645, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca911\"", "article_summary": "Business was brisk Friday afternoon at the St. Louis County Election Board, where lines of people \u2013 most of them elderly -- were waiting to cast an absentee ballot for Tuesday\u2019s primaries.\nElection officials in St. Charles were estimating a turnout of 35 percent, with St. Louis offering up a projection of 25 percent.\n\u201cI was being optimistic,\u2019\u2019 said Days, adding that she feared the county\u2019s voter turnout could be 15 percent or lower by Tuesday.\nIn the St. Louis area, the county\u2019s 20 percent prediction was among the lowest.\nJefferson County election officials predicted a turnout of 18.2 percent."}
