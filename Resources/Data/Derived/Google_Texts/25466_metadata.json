In an act of desperation to drop the pounds, we become more vulnerable to fad diets that promise dramatic results but seldom live up to their claims. Now, Jim White, a dietitian, personal trainer, and owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios in Virginia Beach, Va., suggests women have got dieting all wrong: We should \u201ceat like a man\u201d to lose weight.\n\n\u201cEat like a man,\u201d may sound like patronizing advice for women, implying we should copy men\u2019s eating habits to sort out ours, but White\u2019s key messages may have some merit. His advice stems from the theory women are constantly dieting, which encourages yo-yo weight loss and gain \u2014 the endless cycle of gaining, losing weight, and gaining weight again \u2014 by choosing foods that don\u2019t do enough to keep us full.\n\nIn an interview with Fitness magazine, White cites research from the University of Toronto to support his belief, explaining: \u201cRestrained eaters are more likely to overeat before starting a diet and binge after they end it than ones who don't go on restrictive diets.\u201d Counterintuitively, depriving yourself is one of the worst things a dieter can do when they are trying to lose weight. On the other hand, White mentions guys rarely ever \u201cdiet.\u201d \u201cSure, they might try to eat healthier or cleaner, but that's about it. No D-word, no all-or-nothing mentality,\u201d he said.\n\nMen and women are built differently, so following a man\u2019s eating regime won\u2019t necessarily yield the same results, and blindly \u201ceating like a man,\u201d may have the opposite effect. Women naturally have a higher body-fat-to-lean-tissue ratio than men, and body fat naturally increases with age, says the NYU Langone Medical Center. Now, while it is known men lose weight faster than women due to testosterone, the male hormone, women should still adopt \u201cman eating habits,\u201d according to White.\n\nThe dietitian and personal trainer\u2019s guidelines have received praise from fellow nutrition and fitness experts in the community. Matt Townsend, a New York-based personal trainer, agrees with White\u2019s advice, especially when it comes to eating proteins for a better workout. \u201cI've found great success with women eating more animal proteins on days they do heavier weights for workouts, followed by eating like a vegetarian on days where more cardio intensive workouts, traveling or rest days are on the schedule,\u201d Townsend told the Daily Mail.\n\nRather than patronizing women and saying we need to \u201ceat like a man,\u201d it\u2019s best to highlight White\u2019s key points in dieting that will work for men and women, from focusing on the quality of ingredients we\u2019re eating to keeping a good balance of fats, carbs, protein, and greens. Healthy eating and exercise are key to living a healthy lifestyle.\n\n1. Eat More Protein\n\nWhen we diet, we tend to order a salad and skip out on the steak, but White believes the former is the wiser weight-loss option. Low-calorie foods often lack fat and protein, which is known for keeping us full, and instead are loaded with extra sugar and sodium to add flavor lost by the fat. They tend to be completely unsatisfying.\n\n2. Drink Beer\n\nLadies, we may think we\u2019re making smart choices opting for mixed drinks like margaritas, but we\u2019re actually loading up on more sugar. Beer, on the other hand, can make us feel fuller, making us less likely to snack.\n\n3. Boycott 'Low Fat' Foods\n\nMen don\u2019t tend to bother with microwaveable low-fat meals and portion-controled snacks, according to White, because they tend to be completely unsatisfying. Since these foods are generally low in fat and protein, they can actually make you want to eat more by the day\u2019s end.\n\n4. Guzzle Water\n\nDrink more water to prevent hunger pangs and from getting tired from dehydration. \u201cPrioritizing hydration, which might actually be more important for women than it is for men,\u201d White said. Women tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, including fatigue, which can make us want to eat more to gain more energy.\n\n5. Eat Quality Ingredients\n\nConsume foods that have balanced proportions of protein, carbs, and fat. If you eat meat, consume a little less but better quality.\n\n6. Eat Constantly\n\nWhile most guys appear to look like \u201cconstantly running garbage disposals,\u201d they are actually boosting their metabolism by keeping it high and burning calories. Going four hours without eating will trick the body into thinking it\u2019s starving, which will make it respond by slowing down your metabolism and hanging onto any calories it can. Portions and meals should be kept small.\n\n7. Don\u2019t Diet\n\nRemember, restraining yourself means you are more likely to overeat before starting a diet and then binge after it ends. Rather, opt for small portion-controled indulgences, and avoid binge fests and cheat days. Instead, follow a healthy lifestyle with healthy meals and exercise.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take White\u2019s advice with a grain of salt.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eat like a man, how to lose weight, weight loss, drop the pounds, shed the fat, burn the fat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jim White, a dietitian and personal trainer, gives the skinny on why women who \"eat like a man\" \u2014 from drinking beer to boycotting low-calorie foods \u2014 can actually lose weight.", "title": "7 Ways 'Eating Like A Man' May Actually Help Women Lose Weight", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-eat-lose-weight-7-ways-eating-man-will-help-women-burn-fat-293754", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/17/woman-ripping-raw-red-sirloin-steak-teeth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim White, a dietitian and personal trainer, gives the skinny on why women who \"eat like a man\" \u2014 from drinking beer to boycotting low-calorie foods \u2014 can actually lose weight.", "title": "7 Ways 'Eating Like A Man' May Actually Help Women Lose Weight", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-eat-lose-weight-7-ways-eating-man-will-help-women-burn-fat-293754", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/17/woman-ripping-raw-red-sirloin-steak-teeth.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/17/woman-ripping-raw-red-sirloin-steak-teeth.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-17T17:56:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T17:56:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jim White, a dietitian and personal trainer, gives the skinny on why women who \"eat like a man\" \u2014 from drinking beer to boycotting low-calorie foods \u2014 can actually lose weight."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a2a\"", "article_summary": "Now, while it is known men lose weight faster than women due to testosterone, the male hormone, women should still adopt \u201cman eating habits,\u201d according to White.\nMen and women are built differently, so following a man\u2019s eating regime won\u2019t necessarily yield the same results, and blindly \u201ceating like a man,\u201d may have the opposite effect.\nWomen tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, including fatigue, which can make us want to eat more to gain more energy.\n\u201cEat like a man,\u201d may sound like patronizing advice for women, implying we should copy men\u2019s eating habits to sort out ours, but White\u2019s key messages may have some merit.\nWomen naturally have a higher body-fat-to-lean-tissue ratio than men, and body fat naturally increases with age, says the NYU Langone Medical Center."}
