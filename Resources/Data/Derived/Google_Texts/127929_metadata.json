In other times, this would be encouraging news for the job market. However, it appears that the regulatory environment is stifling the types of IPOs that will drive true job creation.\n\nGary Sturisky\n\nSince the 1970s, 92% of job growth at public companies has occurred following IPOs, according to data recently compiled by the Securities Exchange Commission, with most of that growth occurring in the first few years. Although strong IPO activity is historically associated with healthy job growth, this post-recession IPO increase doesn\u2019t offer the same promise.\n\nWhile the overall volume of IPOs is rising, large companies account for the vast majority of the increase. That is not in itself bad, but history suggests we get more bang-for-the-buck in job growth when more small or mid-sized companies are going public.\n\nScott Vanlandingham\n\nThe shift away from IPOs coming out of the middle market is in part the result of increased regulation driving up the costs of issuing an IPO. Further, the cost of being a public company is higher than ever, offsetting many of the benefits. Congressional leaders became aware of this shift and made attempts to address it through the JOBS Act. We are not, however, seeing the needed return on the job-creating, middle-market IPOs.\n\nWhile middle-market companies do not need IPOs to create jobs, going public can accelerate growth dramatically. When companies reach a turning point in building their businesses and need an increase in capital, they look at their menu of options. Increasingly, they are concluding that there are simpler ways to gain capital than through an IPO.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame them. In fact, non-IPO capital raises are a good choice for businesses at the moment \u2014 but for a nation that desperately needs to see more job creation, it\u2019s not the preferred option. Acquisition activity, either by a competitor or private equity, rarely results in as much job growth as an IPO because the organization is not organically growing in the same way.\n\nThere are other issues at play, not just regulatory red tape. Some are hard to address through policy changes or regulatory adjustment. For example, growing signs of economic improvement have not lifted the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over much of the business community. While employment and gross domestic product are growing, they are still too slow to turn caution to optimism in the boardrooms of many growing companies.\n\nHigh-End Spenders Shrug Off Headwind (3:28) Despite continued weak employment data and gridlock in Washington, consumers are showing surprising signs of confidence, and opening their wallets to buy big-ticket items ranging from washing machines to fast boats.

In the early part of the 2000s, we saw a substantial uptick in legislation such as Sarbanes-Oxley and regulatory changes like the Regulation National Market System, which contributed to significantly higher costs and created prohibitive complexity for smaller firms evaluating IPOs as their growth strategy.\n\nThese changes, and others that came more recently such as Dodd-Frank, were defined by considerations related to the largest companies and protections for the smaller ones, not by concerns for the mid-sized firms that happen to be best-suited for going public.\n\nFor middle-market companies, the prospect of going public became even more daunting due to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding implementation of the Affordable Care Act. ACA is a major drag on middle market companies, most of which are well above the 50-employee threshold for the employer mandate. These firms are more likely than large companies to need to make major changes to adjust to the law\u2019s new requirements. Middle-market companies have also been more cautious since the passage of January\u2019s tax agreement, which created an income threshold that exempted owners and partners in much smaller firms, but left mid-sized companies exposed to higher rates.\n\nCongress recognized the link between IPOs and increased jobs last year and attempted to bridge the critical connection with the JOBS Act. Passed with rare bipartisan support, the legislation aimed to eliminate some of the hurdles that smaller firms seeking to go public encounter when trying to secure financing.\n\nUnfortunately, the legislation has been thwarted by a string of implementation delays; it hasn\u2019t helped companies move past the regulatory and economic challenges to accessing equity capital. The JOBS act has not been in place long enough to say for certain it was ineffective, but at this time the legislation\u2019s success at bringing back the IPO market is in serious doubt.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "In the JOBS Act, Congress and the SEC have tried to help mid-sized companies raise the capital they need to grow, but regulations are still blocking the IPOs we need if we want robust job growth, write Gary Sturisky and Scott Vanlandingham.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN565_sturis_MG_20131022101813.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Gary Sturisky and Scott Vanlandingham", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "In the JOBS Act, Congress and the SEC have tried to help mid-sized companies raise the capital they need to grow, but regulations are still blocking the IPOs we need if we want robust job growth, write Gary Sturisky and Scott Vanlandingham.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/vanishing-middle-market-ipos-haunt-job-growth-2013-10-24", "author": "Gary Sturisky and Scott Vanlandingham", "parsely-title": "Vanishing middle-market IPOs haunt job growth", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-24T06:30:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "In the JOBS Act, Congress and the SEC have tried to help mid-sized companies raise the capital they need to grow, but regulations are still blocking the IPOs we need if we want robust job growth, write Gary Sturisky and Scott Vanlandingham.", "title": "Vanishing middle-market IPOs haunt job growth", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/vanishing-middle-market-ipos-haunt-job-growth-2013-10-24", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN565_sturis_MG_20131022101813.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN565_sturis_MG_20131022101813.jpg"}, "article.id": "12788452-3B4C-11E3-86B1-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Although strong IPO activity is historically associated with healthy job growth, this post-recession IPO increase doesn\u2019t offer the same promise.\nWhile middle-market companies do not need IPOs to create jobs, going public can accelerate growth dramatically.\nWe are not, however, seeing the needed return on the job-creating, middle-market IPOs.\nGary SturiskySince the 1970s, 92% of job growth at public companies has occurred following IPOs, according to data recently compiled by the Securities Exchange Commission, with most of that growth occurring in the first few years.\nIn other times, this would be encouraging news for the job market."}
