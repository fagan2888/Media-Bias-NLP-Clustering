He has no campaigns left to run, President Obama likes to remind audiences of late. But he nonetheless will return to Los Angeles next week to raise money for his party as it gears up for the next presidential race.

ICM Partners cofounder Chris Silbermann and his wife, Julia Franz, will host the president for a "roundtable discussion" on March 12, according to an invitation obtained by the Los Angeles Times. Cost of attendance is $33,400 per couple, with donations used to help build the Democratic National Committee's operations ahead of the 2016 elections.

"In 2015 the DNC is focused on investing resources in opposition research and press, the voter file and analytics infrastructure, voter protection, and building our state networks," a message to potential donors said.

The president traveled to California last month for a DNC fundraiser in San Francisco, as well as a golf weekend with friends in Palm Springs.
