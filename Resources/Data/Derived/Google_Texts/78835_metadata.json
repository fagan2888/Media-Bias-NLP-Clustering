The pelicans are left unable to hunt and swallow their food, leaving them to starve to death slowly.\n\n\u201cWith the way the cuts are done, fish slide out of the pouch and the bird can\u2019t eat. It gets weaker and weaker and dies,\u201d Totman tells The Key West Citizen.\n\nNancy Finley, spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services at the Florida Keys National Wildlife Refuge Complex in Big Pine Key, said the cuts don\u2019t appear to be a natural occurrence.\n\n\u201cThe cuts are deep, all the way to the windpipe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears to be a knife slice.\u201d\n\nSome pelicans also have been spotted flying around with their pouches slashed, raising concerns more could die, Totman said.\n\nThe birds with slashed pouches have been found from Sugarloaf Key to Key West. Some have been recovered, and if the cuts are small, they are treated with manuka honey to speed up healing, Totman said.\n\nIf the cut is large, the pelican is taken to surgery to attempt to stitch up the slice, or the bird dies, she said.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know who is doing this,\u201d Totman said. \u201cIs it a fisherman throwing bones in the water, or is it a crazy person? It is just incredible that it is happening.\u201d\n\nPelicans are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and anyone injuring the birds is subject to fines and possible jail time if found guilty, Finley said.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is investigating, and officials ask the public to report any sightings of injured pelicans.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 10:11:47 -0400", "Description": "BIG PINE KEY \u2013 Authorities are investigating the deaths of several brown pelicans found with their pouches slashed in the Florida Keys.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "BIG PINE KEY \u2013 Authorities are investigating the deaths of several brown pelicans found with their pouches slashed in the Florida Keys.", "title": "Brown pelicans found dead with slashed pouches in Keys", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/florida/brown-pelicans-found-dead-with-slashed-pouches-in-keys-20131221/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-12-21T12:42:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Brown pelicans found dead with slashed pouches in Keys"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-21T10:11:47Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-21T12:42:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "key west,pelicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86d6\"", "article_summary": "BIG PINE KEY \u2013 Authorities are investigating the deaths of several brown pelicans found with their pouches slashed in the Florida Keys.\nFlorida Keys Wildlife Refuge Director Maya Totman said Friday that 10 pelicans have been found dead.\nThe birds with slashed pouches have been found from Sugarloaf Key to Key West.\n\u201cIt appears to be a knife slice.\u201dSome pelicans also have been spotted flying around with their pouches slashed, raising concerns more could die, Totman said.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is investigating, and officials ask the public to report any sightings of injured pelicans."}
