This would be one of those moments.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch sees an opportunity for many of the nation\u2019s major health insurers now that private exchanges appear to be catching on with some large employers, but investors cast down shares on all the big carriers Thursday.\n\nShutterstock.com\n\nIn a note to clients, Borsch followed up on his Wednesday missive, issued after Walgreen Co. /quotes/zigman/245520 /quotes/nls/wag WAG became the third major employer to announce a shift to private exchanges. That came on the heels of announcements from International Business Machines Corp. /quotes/zigman/230066 /quotes/nls/ibm IBM and Time Warner Inc. /quotes/zigman/528906 /quotes/nls/twx TWX\n\nBorsch said if there is a large-scale shift to private exchanges, it could bode well for insurers, but carriers\u2019 shares all dropped Wednesday. Then on Thursday, he followed it up with another note outlining exactly how that could happen.\n\nThe so-called \u201cBig Five\u201d insurers \u2014 UnitedHealth Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/258846 /quotes/nls/unh UNH , WellPoint Inc. /quotes/zigman/362231 /quotes/nls/wlp WLP , Aetna Inc. /quotes/zigman/272706 /quotes/nls/aet AET , Cigna Corp. /quotes/zigman/222255 /quotes/nls/ci CI and Humana Inc. /quotes/zigman/229688 /quotes/nls/hum HUM \u2014 should realize a collective $1 billion in additional pretax earnings if 13 million people make the move by 2019.\n\nPrivate exchanges are being set up at some companies, similar to the public clearinghouses being assembled now to get ready for President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul, or Obamacare. The private exchanges could bring a wider selection of players, since employer-sponsored health insurance is by far the most common form of coverage now obtained in the U.S.\n\nCI Your browser does not support iframes.\n\nBorsch says the insurers will lose some members, but that will be more than offset by the amount of revenue that goes directly to carriers. He adds that scenario may be overly conservative when figuring loss of members. If so, the additional profit could be as high as $2 billion.\n\nThat fell on deaf ears among investors. All five carriers were down 2% or more for the day, with Cigna taking the biggest hit. It was down more than 4% to $77.72, and off nearly 8% from the all-time high it reached on Monday when it closed at $84.27.\n\n\u2013 Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\n\u2013 Follow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-09-19T17:31:06-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One analyst says private exchanges could mean a huge opportunity for major health insurers, but investors aren't yet seeing it that way.", "title": "Analyst\u2019s praise of private health exchanges falls on deaf investors", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/19/analysts-praise-of-private-health-exchanges-falls-on-deaf-investors/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH876_health_MG_20130905111416.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health care,Health insurers,Obamacare,Private health exchanges", "article.headline": "Analyst\u2019s praise of private health exchanges falls on deaf investors", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "health care,Health insurers,Obamacare,Private health exchanges", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "One analyst says private exchanges could mean a huge opportunity for major health insurers, but investors aren't yet seeing it that way.", "article.published": "2013-09-19T17:31:06-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/19/analysts-praise-of-private-health-exchanges-falls-on-deaf-investors/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One analyst says private exchanges could mean a huge opportunity for major health insurers, but investors aren't yet seeing it that way.", "title": "Analyst\u2019s praise of private health exchanges falls on deaf investors", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/19/analysts-praise-of-private-health-exchanges-falls-on-deaf-investors/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH876_health_MG_20130905111416.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1185", "article.updated": "2013-09-19T17:31:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff5c\"", "article_summary": "Private exchanges are being set up at some companies, similar to the public clearinghouses being assembled now to get ready for President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul, or Obamacare.\nShutterstock.comIn a note to clients, Borsch followed up on his Wednesday missive, issued after Walgreen Co. /quotes/zigman/245520 /quotes/nls/wag WAG became the third major employer to announce a shift to private exchanges.\nThe private exchanges could bring a wider selection of players, since employer-sponsored health insurance is by far the most common form of coverage now obtained in the U.S.CI Your browser does not support iframes.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch sees an opportunity for many of the nation\u2019s major health insurers now that private exchanges appear to be catching on with some large employers, but investors cast down shares on all the big carriers Thursday.\n\u2013 Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\u2013 Follow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog"}
