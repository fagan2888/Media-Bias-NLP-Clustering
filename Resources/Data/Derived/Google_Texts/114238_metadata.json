To help children better understand the process of cancer treatment and ease their anxiety, DeLand released The Great Katie Kate Tackles Questions About Cancer.\n\n\u201cThroughout my career as both a doctor and mother, I have learned that children have a natural curiosity and a resilience that often surprises adults,\u201d DeLand explained to Medical News 4 You. \u201cChildren want and need clear explanations and straight answers to gain a sense of control over their own lives.\u201d\n\nDeLand, a single mother of two, says the point of her book is to remove some of the fear from both the child and the parent, also known as the Worry Wombat. She also believes that her book can help keep the parent and child on the same page so confusion over the diagnosis doesn\u2019t occur. The most important part of cancer development in children, she says, is getting children to understand what the disease is.\n\n\u201cWell a cancer diagnosis just knocks parents over, and they want to know, what are the best options, and they want to communicate with their child just as they always have,\" DeLand told Fox News. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very difficult, communication breaks down.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s main character, The Great Katie Kate, is a superhero who helps Suzy, a young girl who just learned about her cancer diagnosis, better understand what that entails \u2014 including blood work, X-rays, and chemotherapy. The Great Katie Kate series also helps children cope with other diseases, such as asthma and diabetes.\n\nAlthough rare, childhood cancer cases have been on a steady increase over the past few decades. The American Cancer Society estimates that 11,630 U.S. children will be diagnosed with some type of cancer in 2013. Today, over 80 percent of children with cancer survive for five years or longer.\n\n\u201cI think a child really doesn\u2019t understand what cancer means, like, \u2018What is this going on in my body?\u2019 And children, like adults, want to have control,\u201d Dr. DeLand told Fox News. \u201cThey want to have a sense of understanding, and for each, their journey is unique.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "great, katie, kate, tackles, questions, about, cancer, childhood cancer, deland", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Children's book \"The Great Katie Kate Tackles Questions About Cancer\" helps kids and parents deal with childhood cancer.", "title": "'The Great Katie Kate,' Children's Book Superhero, Helps Kids Deal With Cancer Treatment Process", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/great-katie-kate-childrens-book-superhero-helps-kids-deal-cancer-treatment-process-257342", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/great-katie-kate.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Children's book \"The Great Katie Kate Tackles Questions About Cancer\" helps kids and parents deal with childhood cancer.", "title": "'The Great Katie Kate,' Children's Book Superhero, Helps Kids Deal With Cancer Treatment Process", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/great-katie-kate-childrens-book-superhero-helps-kids-deal-cancer-treatment-process-257342", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/great-katie-kate.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/great-katie-kate.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-19T16:30:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-19T16:30:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Children's book \"The Great Katie Kate Tackles Questions About Cancer\" helps kids and parents deal with childhood cancer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd565\"", "article_summary": "To help children better understand the process of cancer treatment and ease their anxiety, DeLand released The Great Katie Kate Tackles Questions About Cancer.\nThe Great Katie Kate series also helps children cope with other diseases, such as asthma and diabetes.\nThe most important part of cancer development in children, she says, is getting children to understand what the disease is.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s very difficult, communication breaks down.\u201dThe book\u2019s main character, The Great Katie Kate, is a superhero who helps Suzy, a young girl who just learned about her cancer diagnosis, better understand what that entails \u2014 including blood work, X-rays, and chemotherapy.\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that 11,630 U.S. children will be diagnosed with some type of cancer in 2013."}
