One says that the Democrats will cave in because they won\u2019t want to be blamed for a government shutdown just to defend the Affordable Care Act. The other school believes that the Democrats will stand up and support the ACA but it will still be a win for the Republicans no matter what it does to the country because come 2014 the voters will blame the Democrats for the shutdown and vote accordingly, presumably giving the Senate as well as the House to the Republicans.\n\nTo show why I don\u2019t buy into the idea that either of those are realistic let\u2019s look at that American favorite, the TV cop show. The scene isn\u2019t that uncommon in them, the villain of the piece, desperate to overcome the advantage the cops have over him, grabs ahold of an innocent victim to use as a shield and hostage to gain their goal. The gun is held to the hostage\u2019s head and the hammer cocked back and the villain tells the authorities that if they don\u2019t give the hostage-taker what he demands the hostage dies. In this scenario, though, let\u2019s say that the villain gives a deadline for the authorities to meet his demands, it isn\u2019t met and the trigger is pulled. The hostage dies. How many Americans watching this scene are going to blame the police? How many will blame the the guy who took an innocent hostage? I think most Americans blame the one who threatens the innocents, not the one who doesn\u2019t cave in to extortion.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "I consider it singularly appropriate that this article from The Daily Beast refers to the current actions of the GOP as a murder-suicide.
