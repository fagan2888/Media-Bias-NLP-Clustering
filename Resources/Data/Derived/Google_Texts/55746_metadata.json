Omada Director of Medical Affairs Cynthia Castro Sweet, PhD, and Director of Medicaid and Safety Net Commercial Development, Eliza Gibson, LCSW, will oversee the clinical trial, with results expected in 2017.Those enrolled in the trial will be Medicaid beneficiaries, Medicaid eligible, or uninsured. The trial will track clinical outcomes for 12 months using independent evaluators, funded by the California Health Care Foundation and the Kresge Foundation, according to statement from Omada. Besides clinical outcomes, the trial will assess:\u00b7 Participant engagement\u00b7 Hospital and health system utilization\u00b7 Qualitative feedback\u201cThis trial is the culmination of more than a year of work by our team,\u201d said Sean Duffy, Omada co-founder and CEO, in a statement. \u201cOmada\u2019s mission is to inspire and enable people everywhere to live free of chronic disease; this is another step in making that mission a reality.\u201dChronic conditions including diabetes have been shown to be more common among underserved populations, which creates fiscal concerns for the federal government and the states as Medicaid has enrolled 11 million new recipients due to expansion under the Affordable Care Act.A 2013 study in JAMA found that while new Medicaid enrollees as a group were less likely to be obese or have chronic conditions like diabetes, those who did come to Medicaid with a chronic condition were in bad shape: 80% who had 1 of 3 chronic conditions (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes) were uncontrolled, and many were unaware of their diagnosis.Finding scalable solutions to help underserved populations to combat chronic conditions related to obesity, including T2D, is essential to hold down healthcare costs for both Medicaid and commercial plans.Digital solutions may offer an answer, since smartphone technology appears to have crossed all economic boundaries. A study just published in Diabetes Care found that adding a daily, standardized text message to the National Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum helped participants lose 17% more weight, with even better results among Spanish speakers.Elements of the Prevent program tailored to underserved populations include:\u00b7 Recommended recipes will take into account access to food and the cost of ingredients.\u00b7 Recommended activities will acknowledge neighborhood safety concerns.\u00b7 Bilingual health coaches will be available.\u00b7 The curriculum will be adapted for those with limited literacy skills, as well as those who speak English as a second language.Said Duffy, \u201cMedicaid and uninsured populations live with disproportionate rates of chronic disease; it\u2019s time to bring this type of life-changing intervention to anyone and everyone who needs it.\u201d1.
