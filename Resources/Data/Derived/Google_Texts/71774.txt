Dorothy Bush Koch, who is hosting a D.C. mental wellness conference this week, says she has to focus on mindfulness throughout her day because, to her, “politics is personal."

The youngest daughter of former President George H.W. Bush and wife of lobbyist Bobby Koch said she utilizes positive-thinking strategies, such as daily meditation walks, in order to manage the negative attention her family receives in the media.

“I needed mindfulness because I come from a family that’s in the spotlight, and even though I’m not in the public eye all the time, it affects all of us, in good ways and in bad ways,” she said in an interview with Fox 5 D.C. on Thursday.

“For me, politics is personal, because it’s my family, and just being aware of my thoughts — are my thoughts productive?” she added.

The founder of the Achieving Optimal Health Conference said being present in the moment has helped her overcome her worries. She is set to host a conference on mental wellness Saturday at Georgetown University.

Bush Koch, nicknamed “Doro” by her family, said her brother, former President George W. Bush, was “very mindful” while in office.

“He wouldn’t watch all of the talking heads tear him apart,” she said.

Koch said that she was initially hesitant about the decision of her brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to run for the White House in 2016.

“When I heard Jeb was running, I first thought, ‘Wow, I’m not sure I could go through anther campaign,’ but Jeb is so smart,” she said. “It’s almost harder for the people that love the candidate, rather than the candidate.”
