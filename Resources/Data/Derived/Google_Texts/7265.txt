President Obama hosted the New England Patriots in a South Lawn ceremony this afternoon, recognizing their Super Bowl win earlier this year.

But quarterback Tom Brady declined attending the ceremony, according to multiple Boston media outlets this morning, citing a family obligation.

During the “deflate gate” controversy before the Super Bowl, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest joked about Brady back in January.

“The one thing I can tell you is that for years it’s been clear that there is no risk that I was going to take Tom Brady’s job as quarterback of the New England Patriots,” Earnest told reporters at the time. “But I can tell you that as of today, it’s pretty clear that there’s no risk of him taking my job, either.”

Earnest was referring to Brady’s awkward press conference in which he answered questions about the deflated balls.

“This isn’t ISIS, this isn’t, you know, no one’s dying,” Brady said during the press conference.
