The government last month revised its official gross domestic product growth forecast for 2015 to 2.0-2.5 percent from 2-4 percent previously.\n\nThe legacy of Lee Kuan Yew, who died on March 23, will be fresh in the minds of voters and the PAP will be keen to convince people it is best placed to ensure Singapore's success over the next 50 years.\n\nLee drew praise for his market-friendly policies, but also criticism at home and abroad for his strict controls over the press, public protest and political opponents.\n\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Singapore goes to the polls on Sept.", "title": "Singapore ruling party for first time faces election fight for every seat", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/01/Singapore-ruling-party-first-time-faces-election-fight-every-seat", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/singapore-elections_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/01/Singapore-ruling-party-first-time-faces-election-fight-every-seat", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/singapore-elections_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Singapore goes to the polls on Sept.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b4d\"", "article_summary": "The PAP, co-founded by the Prime Minister's father, the late Lee Kuan Yew, has ruled Singapore since six years before independence in 1965.\nThe election comes at a time when Singapore is seeing slowing growth.\n\"This is about your future, vote seriously for the PAP to make sure that we can work together with you, for you, for Singapore,\" Lee said to waving party supporters in central Singapore after filing his nomination papers.\nThe government last month revised its official gross domestic product growth forecast for 2015 to 2.0-2.5 percent from 2-4 percent previously.\nThe party is trying to improve its performance from 2011 when its share of vote fell due to unhappiness over then high housing prices, the cost of living and immigration."}
