He greeted customers at the front of the dinner and worked his way to the back room, shaking hands and posing for photographs. He then met with seven people working to sign up others for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act before the March 31 enrollment deadline. \"Hey Dianna,\" Biden said to Dianna Ashford, a certified application counselor with the Rural Health Corporation of Northeast Pennsylvania, shaking her hand. \"Thanks for taking to time to do this,\" Biden said as he sat down a the table with the seven participants. \"So far, things are moving pretty well after getting off to a slow start with the website.\" Biden said he wanted to talk about \"what it is that has worked and hasn't worked\" and \"what you think we should be doing.\" He noted more than 4 million Americans have enrolled in health insurance plans through the federal and state exchanges since Oct. 1. After March 31, Americans without health care plans will have to pay a penalty. The cost of health insurance for most young adults is probably less than what they pay for cell phone service, Biden added. The others at the table were: Laura Long, Certified Application Counselor, Wayne Memorial Community Health Centers Belinda Opeil, Certified Application Counselor, Scranton Primary Health Care Center, Inc.
