Rietz said it all started with a simple offhand comment made during a conversation with one of his residents. Within a couple of days, the petition garnered more than 250 signatures.\n\nRietz and his supporters want to see calorie counts next to items on student center menus so students can be more informed about what they eat. Although nutrition information is posted in the student center, it is presented as a large spreadsheet that many find difficult to use.\n\n\u201cIf you go to Ranch (a restaurant in the Lincoln Park student center), there\u2019s going to be a stand there with this gigantic sheet of all the calories and every single item from lettuce to beans and pork,\u201d Rietz said.\n\nRietz said students would have to use a calculator to figure how many calories are in a meal.\n\n\u201cIf they provided the calorie count on the menu, then you would know \u2018this is 400 calories,\u2019\u201d Rietz said. \u201cIt would be a lot easier for students, especially in between classes to figure out how to eat healthy on the go.\u201d\n\nSuch calorie counts have shown up on the menus of popular establishments such as McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle in the past few years as mandated by a provision in the Affordable Care Act. According to the law, institutions with more than 20 locations are required to post their nutritional information.\n\nBut there are ways around this provision and Chartwells may not have to provide that information, Rietz said. But the goal was to \u201cpush Chartwells in the direction where they can provide that information regardless of what the FDA regulation loophole allows for.\u201d\n\nAfter the petition gained steam, Rietz was contacted by officials from the student center and Chartwells for a meeting where they discussed these issues. Rietz said it went well.\n\n\u201cWe had a really good discussion,\u201d Rietz said. \u201cAnd it focused on me trying to convey \u2018this is what students want,\u2019 and them trying to convey \u2018this is what we can do, this is what we\u2019re trying to do.\u2019 I brought up a couple of important problems that I personally found, and a few students brought up.\u201d\n\nOn DePaul\u2019s dining website, nutrition information is posted along with tips for students seeking to have a healthy diet. Rietz believes that easier access would better serve students.\n\nThe movement does not currently plan to become an actual student organization, but will seek to use existing structures such as the Student Government Association and RHC to achieve change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of students started a petition a couple of weeks ago in an effort to improve nutrition labels on the menus in DePaul\u2019s student center.", "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "og": {"site_name": "The DePaulia", "description": "A group of students started a petition a couple of weeks ago in an effort to improve nutrition labels on the menus in DePaul\u2019s student center.", "title": "DePaul students petition for nutrition labels - The DePaulia", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chipotle.jpg", "height": 365}, "updated_time": "2015-04-26T19:04:57-05:00", "url": "http://depauliaonline.com/2015/04/26/depaul-students-petition-for-nutrition-labels/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of students started a petition a couple of weeks ago in an effort to improve nutrition labels on the menus in DePaul\u2019s student center.", "title": "DePaul students petition for nutrition labels - The DePaulia", "image": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chipotle.jpg", "creator": "@thedepaulia", "site": "@thedepaulia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 108424530298}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDePaulia/", "section": "Campus News", "tag": "nutrition labels", "published_time": "2015-04-26T18:28:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-26T19:04:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A group of students started a petition a couple of weeks ago in an effort to improve nutrition labels on the menus in DePaul\u2019s student center.\nAlthough nutrition information is posted in the student center, it is presented as a large spreadsheet that many find difficult to use.\nFreshman Thomas Rietz, a residence hall council (RHC) member who resides in Corcoran Hall, was the first to imagine a petition for better nutrition labels.\nBut there are ways around this provision and Chartwells may not have to provide that information, Rietz said.\nRietz and his supporters want to see calorie counts next to items on student center menus so students can be more informed about what they eat."}
