The 2010 law states that federal tax credits to help people pay for insurance are available for plans purchased \u201cthrough an exchange established by the state.\u201d But it is unclear on whether the subsidies are available for those buying coverage from the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace. The law\u2019s supporters say the ambiguity was a drafting oversight, but opponents say it means that subsidies are not available on the federal exchange.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled Tuesday that people buying health insurance in the 36 states that rely on the federal exchange are not eligible for tax credits to reduce premiums. Another appeals court ruled the opposite that day, saying the law was ambiguously worded.\n\nThose pushing the legal case against the Affordable Care Act say Congress deliberately wrote the law to offer tax credits only for the state-based exchanges as a way of pressuring states to set up their own exchanges. The video shows Gruber seeming to agree with that premise while answering questions at an event in January 2012.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this is, if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits,\u201d he says. \u201cBut your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. . . . I hope that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges, and that they\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe video appeared Thursday on a blog by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which coordinated and funded legal challenges to the subsidies.\n\nGruber, reached by phone while organizing a conference Friday morning, referred the Globe to comments he made to the New Republic about the video.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember why I said that,\u201d he is quoted as saying. \u201cI was speaking off-the-cuff. It was just a mistake. People make mistakes. Congress made a mistake drafting the law, and I made a mistake talking about it.\u201d\n\nGruber goes on to speculate that he \u201cmay have been thinking\u201d that if the federal exchange was not ready by 2014, people might not be able to get the tax credits in states that did not set up their exchanges.\n\n\u201cBut there was never any intention to literally withhold money, to withhold tax credits, from the states that didn\u2019t take that step,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s clear in the intent of the law and if you talk to anybody who worked on the law. My subsequent statement was just a speak-0 . . . you know, like a typo.\u201d\n\nA short time later Friday, blogger John Sexton posted on the Breitbart.com website an audio recording of Gruber making similar comments in San Francisco a few days before the video was made. Talking about possible threats to the law, Gruber says, \u201cWill people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn\u2019t set up an exchange, you\u2019re losing hundreds of millions in tax credits to be delivered to your citizens?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Sexton wrote, \u201cGruber can continue to claim he was wrong, but it becomes harder to explain this as the equivalent of a typo when he said it more than once.\u201d\n\nThe revelation of Gruber\u2019s 2012 comments kept bloggers on left and right busy Friday.\n\nPhilip Klein, writing in the Washington Examiner, said the recordings are unlikely to affect the legal case. \u201cBut in terms of the public debate,\u201d Klein wrote, \u201cthis is nothing short of a bombshell. Liberals have launched a campaign to discredit anybody advancing the idea that subsidies were only available to state-based exchanges as alternately dishonest, ignorant, or insane. But now there\u2019s video evidence of the left\u2019s go-to expert on the law taking the same view.\u201d\n\nJonathan Cohn, writing in the New Republic and apparently the only reporter to whom Gruber gave an interview, said the Gruber video does not change his view that Congress intended subsidies for everybody.\n\n\u201cI had literally hundreds of conversations with the people writing health care legislation in 2009 and 2010, including quite a few with Gruber,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cLike other journalists who were following the process closely, I never heard any of them suggest subsidies would not be available in states where officials decided not to operate their own marketplaces. a big deal that, surely, would have come up in conversation.\u201d\n\nNicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, provided much-retweeted solace to the law\u2019s supporters in the Incidental Economist.\n\n\u201cIf you think what Gruber said is some evidence about what the ACA means, you can\u2019t ignore other, similar evidence,\u201d he writes, pointing to a long list of people involved in drafting the law, journalists who covered the process, and academics who observed it, all saying they never heard of any threat to deny states subsidies if they used the federal exchange.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.380061861", "eomportal-id": 534620, "description": "Jonathan Gruber, a major architect of the Affordable Care Act, twice made comments in 2012 that seem to support legal arguments advanced by opponents who are challenging the federal health insurance law in court.
