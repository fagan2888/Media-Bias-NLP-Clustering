Sebelius, one of 37 cases brought by for-profit businesses challenging the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201cHHS Mandate\u201d\u2014that portion of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) that forces employers to provide insurance coverage for life-ending drugs and devices without regard to the employers\u2019 consciences or religious beliefs.\n\nThe bad news is that the Sixth Circuit upheld a lower court opinion that will force the plaintiffs to choose between abiding by the mandate or facing potentially ruinous fines. The Autocam Corporation, which is controlled by members of a devout Catholic family, could be assessed fines of $19 million a year if it does not comply with the mandate.\n\nThe good news is that a Supreme Court showdown looms, one that plaintiffs challenging the mandate have a great chance to win.\n\nAt the heart of the Autocam case and the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\n\nBut in Autocam, the Sixth Circuit ruled that a for-profit company does not qualify as a \u201cperson\u201d under RFRA and therefore cannot use it to challenge the HHS mandate. The Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion recently in Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp v. Sebelius. On the other hand, the Tenth Circuit ruled in Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius that for-profit businesses are protected by RFRA.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThis \u201cCircuit spilt\u201d\u2014or disagreement between the Circuits\u2014makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to hear one or more appeals in these cases. Hundreds of plaintiffs have their livelihoods on the line, and a decision from the Supreme Court is needed.\n\nAnd there is more good news. To date, there are at least 67 cases and over 200 defendants challenging the HHS Mandate. Of those cases, 37 involve for-profit businesses. There have been rulings touching on the merits in 32 of those 37 cases\u2014and courts have ruled in favor of the private businesses 26 times. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s ruling in Autocam does not change the score because it was merely affirming one of the few losses on our side.\n\nWhile the fight in the courts regarding the HHS mandate is far from over, the momentum is clearly in favor of freedom of conscience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Showdown Looming on Battle to Stop Obamacare's HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In a good news-bad news scenario, businesses troubled by Obamacare's anti-life provision have gotten one step closer to the high court.
