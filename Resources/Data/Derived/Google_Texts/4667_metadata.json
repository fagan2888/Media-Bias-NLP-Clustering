A location is still being scoped out. Both Michelle Nunn, the U.S. Senate candidate, and Jason Carter, who is challenging Republican incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal, are expected to be on hand.\n\nHillary Clinton, who is expected to make a White House run in 2016, was in Atlanta on Saturday for a Michelle Nunn fundraiser, but that appearance was a private affair, kept out of sight of the media.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal, Carter\u2019s opponent, said the wrong president is coming to town.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine with me. You would think he would want the current president, since he\u2019s the face of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Deal at a campaign stop in Cornelia. \u201cI would think he would want President Obama to come and be his spokesperson, since he embraces Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat supports expanding Medicaid, though he hasn\u2019t said exactly how he would push such a change through in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAn early warning: Prepare for a touchy commute that Friday. Halloween traffic is already notoriously bad in metro Atlanta, and an ex-president\u2019s motorcade will only make gridlock worse.\n\nCheck back here for more details as the day progresses.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/10/27/bill-clinton-headed-to-georgia-as-a-democratic-closer/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/gov-campaigns-jpeg-0314c.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "The closing act for Democrats in Georgia will include a Friday rally headlined by former President Bill Clinton in downtown Atlanta, we're told.
