Ted Cruz (R-TX) placed in first place in the Breitbart Primary\u2019s first month. He was closely followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) came in third. Two other candidates, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina\u2014both Washington outsiders\u2014proved to be gaining steam in the first month of the Breitbart Primary.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m greatly encouraged by the results because it represents a win for the people and I believe it demonstrates what we\u2019re seeing all across the country,\u201d Cruz told Breitbart News on Tuesday in response to Monday\u2019s announcement of the first month of results.\n\nGrassroots conservatives aren\u2019t interested in a lot of talk. They want someone with a proven record of fighting for our principles and values. Someone who has fought for them by consistently opposing amnesty, Obamacare, and for protecting religious liberty, and the rule of law. They want someone who has stood up for the them against the Washington Cartel, that is the career politicians in both parties, lobbyists, special interests, and elite media that have rigged the game at the expense of hardworking Americans. Together we can crush the cartel and return government control to the people.\n\nWalker\u2019s spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the governor is very pleased that Breitbart readers are showing their support for him as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited that so many Breitbart readers are supporting Governor Walker,\u201d Strong said in an email. \u201cFrom championing collective bargaining reform, to turning a deficit into a surplus, to advancing a strong pro-life agenda, and opposing common core, Governor Walker\u2019s successful record of conservative leadership is unsurpassed.\u201d\n\nCruz topped the field for the month of June winning 30 percent, while Walker came in a close second with 22 percent and Paul came in third with 13 percent.\n\nCarson finished in fourth place with 7 percent and Fiorina was tied for seventh with 4 percent, placing considerably better than many other national polls\u2014meaning both of these candidates\u2019 strength is with the grassroots in places like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nCarson told Breitbart News he\u2019s excited by the results.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to see that our grass-roots campaign continues in a positive, competitive direction,\u201d Carson said in an email.\n\nThe Breitbart poll is a solid measure that Americans of all persuasions are listening to the messages from all candidates that now is the time to take our country back. I look forward to an aggressive and productive campaign through the Republican primaries. In the end, I\u2019m confident that our efforts will set the Washington political class on their heels, and enable the people\u2019s voice to be heard over all others.\n\nFiorina is also thrilled her grassroots support is growing as evidenced by the Breitbart Primary\u2019s June numbers.\n\n\u201cThis just shows the momentum that Carly is building among conservatives across the country,\u201d Fiorina spokeswoman Anna Epstein said in an email. \u201cAmericans are ready for a leader who is outside the political class and will challenge the status quo.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to expect that any other straw poll on the grassroots level across America will match the volume level of response so far\u2014a level that is expected to grow significantly in the coming weeks and months\u2014from the grassroots.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unheard of to have a participation rate in any poll\u2014scientific or straw\u2014of more than 5,000 respondents. That 55,000 people have participated in the first month, a number expected to increase significantly as the 2016 primary process plays itself out, shows just how energetic the conservative grassroots are in 2016\u2014and just how important it is for whoever the Republican nominee ends up being, if they want to win the general election, to excite that base rather than ignore them.\n\nOf course, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney\u2014the 2012 nominee\u2014failed to turn out the Republican base in the 2012 election with most estimates saying at least 5 million conservatives stayed home. Looking forward to 2016, it is these voters\u2014the people who are voting in this straw poll\u2014who will be crucial not just in the GOP primary but also in the general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz, Walker, Carson and Carly: Breitbart Primary Is Where It\u2019s At", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz, Walker, Carson and Carly: Breitbart Primary Is Where It\u2019s At", "title": "Cruz, Walker, Carson and Carly: Breitbart Primary Is Where It\u2019s At - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/image1.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-07T20:40:46-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/08/cruz-walker-carson-and-carly-breitbart-primary-is-where-its-at/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz, Walker, Carson and Carly: Breitbart Primary Is Where It\u2019s At", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/image1.jpg", "title": "Cruz, Walker, Carson and Carly: Breitbart Primary Is Where It\u2019s At - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Ben Carson, Breitbart primary, Carly Fiorina, Gov.
