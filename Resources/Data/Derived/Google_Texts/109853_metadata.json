The startup insurers that were seeded with loan money under the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan Program of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , captured huge shares of the market in Maine and Kentucky. But in many other states they struggled to compete with legacy carriers, particularly Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. The co-ops were also tripped up by the technical problems that plagued the federal exchange and many state-based marketplaces.In Maryland, which had a dysfunctional exchange, CareFirst Blue Cross and Blue Shield dominated the individual marketplace. The co-op there, Evergreen Health, signed up just 450 individuals for coverage. Dr. Peter Beilenson, Evergreen's CEO, attributed the struggles to \u201cpredatory\u201d pricing by CareFirst, suggesting they underpriced plans by about $100 this year. CareFirst is hiking rates by 16% for 2015.Evergreen was more competitive in the small-group market, where it has signed up 5,000 individuals for coverage. Beilenson expects the company's individual products to be priced much more competitively during the next open-enrollment period.\u201cWe actually don't want to get deluged,\u201d Beilenson said.Oregon's Health Republic Insurance faced a similar dynamic, with Moda Health capturing more than three-quarters of exchange business in the state. But Dawn Bonder, Health Republic's president, said all exchange plans will be priced within a very narrow band for the 2015 enrollment period, with differences typically $15 or less.Bonder believes that will allow Health Republic\u2014which has so far signed up 8,000 customers\u2014to convince consumers that they offer higher quality service and therefore attract a greater share of business. Health Republic will also be introducing a lower-cost, higher-deductible plan in response to indications that price is the No. 1 factor that many shoppers base their decisions on. Oregon's state-based exchange was a complete debacle and the state will rely on HealthCare.gov for 2015 enrollments.\u201cWe've got a ballgame in Oregon,\u201d Bonder said. \u201cIt's going to get interesting.\u201dNevada is another state that struggled with a dysfunctional exchange and is switching to the federal website for the next enrollment period. Thomas Zumtobel, CEO of Nevada Health Co-Op, said that less than a third of the expected 120,000 sign-ups materialized in the state. But the co-op was able to capture 37% of that business, a far greater share than anticipated.Zumtobel said the co-op is keeping premiums largely flat in the southern part of the state, which includes Las Vegas, but is reducing rates by 30% in the northern part of the state. \u201cWe were out of whack in the north,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we fixed that.\u201dDr. Martin Hickey, CEO of co-op plan New Mexico Health Connections and chair of the national association for the plans, argued that co-ops will deliver a higher level of customer service than consumers are used to receiving from the large legacy insurers. The not-for-profit insurers will be able to compete more effectively as exchange shoppers become more sophisticated about their choices. And they will have to, Hickey said. \u201cIf you don't have numbers you don't have a business.\u201dFollow Paul Demko on Twitter: @MHpdemko", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Many consumer-governed insurance plans that struggled to attract customers during the first year of open enrollment are aggressively pricing and retooling products to be more competitive when the exchanges re-open for business on Nov. 15.", "title": "ACA co-op plans retool for 2015 open enrollment", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Many consumer-governed insurance plans that struggled to attract customers during the first year of open enrollment are aggressively pricing and retooling products to be more competitive when the exchanges re-open for business on Nov. 15.", "title": "ACA co-op health plans are retooling their pricing, products for 2015 open enrollment", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140916/NEWS/309169949", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Many consumer-governed insurance plans that struggled to attract customers during the first year of open enrollment are aggressively pricing and retooling products to be more competitive when the exchanges re-open for business on Nov. 15.", "title": "ACA co-op health plans are retooling their pricing, products for 2015 open enrollment", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140916/NEWS/309169949", "published_at": "2014-09-16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2810\"", "article_summary": "But in many other states they struggled to compete with legacy carriers, particularly Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.\nThomas Zumtobel, CEO of Nevada Health Co-Op, said that less than a third of the expected 120,000 sign-ups materialized in the state.\nThe co-op there, Evergreen Health, signed up just 450 individuals for coverage.\nThe not-for-profit insurers will be able to compete more effectively as exchange shoppers become more sophisticated about their choices.\n\u201cIf you don't have numbers you don't have a business.\u201dFollow Paul Demko on Twitter: @MHpdemko"}
