Hershey said the new version of the chocolates began shipping a few weeks ago and are already in stores, or will be as soon as shelves are restocked.\n\n\u201cNatural flavor\u201d will now be listed on the ingredients instead of vanillin, the artificial ingredient that used to give the chocolate a vanilla flavor. Lactose, a sugar in milk, is also set to be removed from the chocolates soon. Hershey has already gotten rid of PGPR, which used to make the chocolate flow better in a manufacturing plant. Instead, they\u2019re adding more cocoa butter to create the right texture.\n\nIn February, the Pennsylvania-based chocolate manufacturer announced it would be combing through its products to simplify ingredients, an endeavor that will likely take a few years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hershey, chocolate, replaces, artificial, flavor, real, vanilla, continuing, promised", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vanilla will be replacing an artificial flavoring in the company's chocolate products.", "title": "Your Hershey's Chocolate Is Undergoing A New, More Natural Makeover", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/hershey-chocolate-replaces-artificial-flavor-real-vanilla-continuing-promised-361964", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/17/hershey-kisses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vanilla will be replacing an artificial flavoring in the company's chocolate products.", "title": "Your Hershey's Chocolate Is Undergoing A New, More Natural Makeover", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/hershey-chocolate-replaces-artificial-flavor-real-vanilla-continuing-promised-361964", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/17/hershey-kisses.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/17/hershey-kisses.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-11-17T16:41:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T16:41:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vanilla will be replacing an artificial flavoring in the company's chocolate products."}, "article_summary": "\u201cNatural flavor\u201d will now be listed on the ingredients instead of vanillin, the artificial ingredient that used to give the chocolate a vanilla flavor.\nHershey has made the first step in its previously announced plans to use simpler ingredients \u2014 the chocolate company will now use real vanilla in its famous milk chocolate Kisses and bars, instead of artificial flavoring.\nLactose, a sugar in milk, is also set to be removed from the chocolates soon.\nHershey has already gotten rid of PGPR, which used to make the chocolate flow better in a manufacturing plant.\nIn February, the Pennsylvania-based chocolate manufacturer announced it would be combing through its products to simplify ingredients, an endeavor that will likely take a few years."}
