He\u2019ll then head to another, closed-door fundraiser benefiting the national Democratic Party before returning to Washington.\n\nEarlier Friday, Obama will visit a Brooklyn high school to showcase a rare partnership between public schools, a public university system and IBM that lets students finish high school with an associate\u2019s degree in computers or engineering.\n\nHis fundraising schedule condensed, Obama will headline at least nine fundraisers before the end of November for Democratic campaign committees. Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are holding their own events. Obama\u2019s spree will take him away from Washington more than a half-dozen times, from Florida to Texas to California.\n\nTraditionally, the president is a party\u2019s most potent fundraising tool, and the effort isn\u2019t without potential reward for Obama. A return of Congress to full Democratic control next year would open the door to sweeping policies Obama would love to enact, but Republicans refuse to consider.\n\nIn sporadic fundraisers earlier in the year, when Obama was actively seeking better relations with Republicans, he avoided overt partisanship in his pitch to donors. His message was: I\u2019ll work with fair-minded lawmakers from either party, but the more power Democrats have in Congress, the better my chances for success.\n\nBut any semblance of comity between Obama and Republicans evaporated during the standoff over government funding and the debt ceiling, when the White House was accusing the GOP of holding hostages and threatening to burn down the house. Republicans\u2019 insistence that the government shut down unless Obama agreed to debilitating changes to his health care law made the lack of common ground all too clear.\n\nSo the immediate crisis averted, Democrats and Republicans alike are looking to the president\u2019s words on Friday for signs of how Obama and his party will cast the bitter fights in Washington as they gear up for 2014 races across the country.\n\n\u201cI recognize that the Republican Party has made blocking the Affordable Care Act its signature policy idea,\u201d Obama said this week at the White House. \u201cSometimes it seems to be the one thing that unifies the party these days.\u201d\n\nMore Americans blame Republicans than Obama for the 16-day shutdown, giving Obama and Democrats a new bludgeon to hammer Republicans and argue they must be voted out. Just 32 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted Oct. 17-20, compared to 46 percent who view Democrats favorably.\n\nThe political blow to the GOP from the crisis has made some Democrats more bullish about retaking the House next year \u2014 an incredibly tall order that, if successful, would bolster Obama\u2019s prospects for achieving his second-term goals.\n\nBut at the same time, Obama is weighed down by the calamitous debut of the website for new insurance exchanges, raising the prospect that Obama\u2019s health care law will be more of a liability than an asset in 2014 even for Democrats who supported the law.\n\n\u201cI would take our position over theirs any day of the week,\u201d said Mo Elleithee, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe have been working to give people more benefits and increase their access to affordable health care, while Republicans shut down the government.\u201d\n\nAfter winning re-election last year, Obama vowed to go all-in for Democrats by holding at least 20 fundraisers ahead of the midterm elections. Although Obama had planned to spread events out over many months this fall, Democratic officials say he was forced to put politicking on hold \u2014 first by the crisis over Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, then by the shutdown-and-debt debacle.\n\nBy and large, Democrats have been more successful than Republicans in leveraging the fiscal showdown to raise money, according to fundraising reports released by campaign committees for House and Senate. But Republicans say that\u2019s where Obama\u2019s usefulness to his party ends. After all, the nation\u2019s new health insurance program remains a tough sell even with independent voters, and Obama is personally unpopular in many of the southern, conservative-leaning states holding critical Senate elections next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still not one Democrat candidate in a toss-up race who wants him visiting their district, because they know he\u2019s not wanted anywhere other than New York, San Francisco or Chicago,\u201d said Daniel Scarpinato, a National Republican Congressional Committee official.\n\n___\n\nAP Director of Polling Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.
