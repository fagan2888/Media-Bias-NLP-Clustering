The post has been shared more than 14,000 times, and drew a speedy response from Starbucks, which promised to \u201censure this doesn\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the world cops live in,\u201d wrote the officer. \u201cIt\u2019s hip for this generation to berate and totally disrespect cops in front of the public and praise cop killers as the heroes\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat prompted such a declaration? According to the cop's post*, he visited a Philadelphia-area Starbucks and asked to use the bathroom, which was locked and required a key code. The barista\u2014a \u201cyoung blonde liberal,\u201d according to the cop\u2014told him only paying customers were allowed to use the bathroom:\n\nI then ask in a very polite manner if I could please use it. She then states in the same loud manner and a smirk \u201cAre you a paying customer?\u201d. It was at this point that I realized what she was doing. As I walked out with my hand up and while she continued loudly to tell me about the bathroom down the street, I was even more astonished that the many customers and other employees said nothing and seemed indifferent. \u2026 I never post things but I hope my fellow brothers and sisters in blue see this and know that we have each other\u2026\n\nThis is the world we live in today\u2014one in which police officers are expected to abide by the same Starbucks bathroom rules as everybody else. Outrageous!\n\nObviously, it\u2019s possible that this Starbucks employee was ruder than she needed to be. But I sincerely doubt she originated the paying-customers-only policy, which probably exists to satisfy the needs of people who actually have some business being in Starbucks. The barista could have gotten in trouble for relaxing the policy, even for a pushy police officer.\n\nThe officer, after all, is not arguing that the policy is wrong, but rather, that he deserves an exemption from it by virtue of being a police officer. In this manner, he is not asking for cops to be treated with the same respect that all people deserve. No, he\u2019s asserting that cops deserve blanket above-and-beyond respect, by mere virtue of their badges.\n\nThe idea that cops aren\u2019t getting the extra-respect they deserve is often presented in tandem with the notion that policework is uniquely dangerous\u2014that there is a \u201cwar on cops.\u201d But this notion is manifestly untrue.\n\nDaniel Bier of the Foundation for Economic Education and Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute recently crunched some data in separate blog posts. Bier provides telling examples:\n\nIn 2008, you were 12 times more likely to be killed living in New Orleans than wearing a badge. Since then, the number of police has increased, so the rate is almost certainly lower today. The bottom line is that cops are safer than many workers, safer than residents of many cities, and indeed safer than they\u2019ve been in decades. It\u2019s safer to be a cop than it is to live in Baltimore. It\u2019s safer to be a cop than it is to be a fisher, logger, pilot, roofer, miner, trucker, or taxi driver. It\u2019s safer to be a cop today than it\u2019s been in years, decades, or even a century, by some measures.\n\nThe fact that law enforcement is a relatively safe occupation does not mean cops deserve to be spit upon in public. (No one does.) But they also don\u2019t deserve exemption from public scrutiny\u2014and wouldn\u2019t, even if their work was dangerous\u2014nor should they enjoy special privileges at Starbucks.\n\n[*Updated at 4:20 p.m.] Joe Leighthardt, the individual who posted details of the incident to Starbucks' Facebook page, claims he was merely reposting someone else's story.
