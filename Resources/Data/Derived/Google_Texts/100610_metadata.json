(WTVR) \u2013 A worker at a Central Virginia call center says inadequate training and confusion is muddling the process for citizens who want to buy insurance via the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA General Dynamics call center in Chester is one of seven call centers set up across the country to answer questions about the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\u201cThere's a lengthy wait time for people calling into the marketplace,\" the worker told CBS 6 News\u2019 Sandra Jones. \u201cIt's more about manpower than anything else.\u201d\n\nThe worker, who spoke out on the condition of anonymity because she feared losing her job, things are so bad General Dynamic is hiring anybody in order to staff the call center.\n\nShe said workers ran into problems logging onto websites and following scripts to answer callers\u2019 questions on the first day.\n\nShe is also worried that she \u2013 and other workers -- did not receive enough training to help callers with the complicated enrolment process.\n\n\"I think it's somewhat chaotic because you have people as back up that only had one week of training,\u201d the worker warned.\n\nThe worker said she fears the lengthy wait times could be because workers are putting callers on hold because they are using a standardized script and do not know the \u201cins and outs\u201d of the system.\n\nEven so, she fears she and other workers could be fired because they cannot process calls quickly enough.\n\n\u201cYou are monitored for your calls and if you get so many calls where you're not showing a certain performance level, you could be terminated,\" she said.\n\nAs the call centers fielded calls about the Health Insurance Marketplace, complaints mounted across the nation about lengthy wait times.\n\nCBS 6 News went through the process to see how long it would take to get an agent on the phone.\n\nA recorded message said it would take around 15 minutes, which was accurate. However, a worker from Houston, Texas, call center answered the phone.\n\nA manager and supervisor from General Dynamics directed our inquiries to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Washington, D.C., which oversees the call centers. However, officials were unable to comment since only essential personnel were in the office because of the government shutdown.\n\nStay with WTVR.com and CBS 6 News for updates on this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A General Dynamics call center in Chester is one of seven call centers set up across the country to answer questions about the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "A General Dynamics call center in Chester is one of seven call centers set up across the country to answer questions about the Health Insurance Marketplace.", "title": "Call center worker sounds alarm over Affordable Care Act training", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2013/10/01/obamacare-call-center-worker-sounds-alarm-over-training/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mgngrnnbuhoiqtjh4xmdoxojbro-i4w8.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mgngrnnbuhoiqtjh4xmdoxojbro-i4w8.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2013-10-01T22:43:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-01T22:46:30+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "health insurance marketplace, wait times, call center, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Marketplace, Wait Times, Call Center, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17ca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere's a lengthy wait time for people calling into the marketplace,\" the worker told CBS 6 News\u2019 Sandra Jones.\nA General Dynamics call center in Chester is one of seven call centers set up across the country to answer questions about the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace.\nHowever, a worker from Houston, Texas, call center answered the phone.\n\"I think it's somewhat chaotic because you have people as back up that only had one week of training,\u201d the worker warned.\nEven so, she fears she and other workers could be fired because they cannot process calls quickly enough."}
