The second most dangerous, manufacturing, reported 150,000 fewer injuries. Despite this, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducts 20 times more inspections at construction sites than at healthcare facilities, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nAlthough hospitals and some states have their own individual safety standards, the ANA has lobbied for years to mandate nationwide safety standards, but their most recent effort at passing a federal law was unsuccessful, according to ABC News. In June, the ANA drafted their own national standards and made them available for purchase. Three thousand hospitals have already bought them, according to Harrington.\n\nIn 2011, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a safe-patient-handling bill after former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed five such bills, but some nurses testified before California's OSHA that many problems persisted since the law was enacted.\n\n\"We do not have any nurses' aides, nor do we have a lift team, so it's just us to lift the patients,\" testified Debra Amour, an RN in the ICU at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, Calif., according to a blog post by National Nurses United. \"When you have a 400-pound patient who has a leg wound for example, it can take the entire staff to hold the leg while the dressing is changed, which can easily take twenty minutes.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the ABC News article\n\n- read the BLS data\n\n- read the National Nurses United blog post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare tops list for workplace injuries; OSHA 'hamstrung'\n\nHealthcare worker injuries jump by up to 10%\n\nHospital violence strikes nurses' aides the most\n\nHospital workplace safety means better patient care\n\nSafer patients mean safer hospital workers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Orderlies, attendants and nursing aids suffer more musculoskeletal injuries than any other profession, and registered nurses suffer more such injuries than the average worker, ABC News reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Orderlies, attendants and nursing aids suffer more musculoskeletal injuries than any other profession, and registered nurses suffer more such injuries than the average worker, ABC News reports.", "title": "Nursing staff frequently injured on job", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nursing-staff-frequently-injured-job/2013-09-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Nurses Association,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Occupational Safety And Health Administration OSHA,workplace injuries", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0074\"", "article_summary": "The healthcare industry reported more than 600,000 workplace injuries and illnesses in 2010, making it the most dangerous occupation in the nation.\nIn June, the ANA drafted their own national standards and made them available for purchase.\nArnold Schwarzenegger vetoed five such bills, but some nurses testified before California's OSHA that many problems persisted since the law was enacted.\n\"When we're losing skilled folks to back injuries and other musculoskeletal injuries, that's a problem,\" Suzy Harrington, safety and wellness director of the American Nurses Association (ANA) told ABC News.\nDespite this, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducts 20 times more inspections at construction sites than at healthcare facilities, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
