The trend is not expected to decline either.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion and the health care option certainly has spurred this influx, without a doubt,\u201d Cordum said. \u201cIt\u2019s people from all walks of life. They\u2019re coming in with all different kinds of medical problems, and they enter the hospital through the ER because many don\u2019t have a primary care physician and they are very sick.\u201d\n\nMercy Fort Smith saw an increase of 527 emergency department visits in July, with 3,954 compared to 3,427 last July. Mercy\u2019s primary care visits at its many clinics also increased by 37,789 visits in one year, with 70,811 visits by the end of fiscal year 2013 and 108,600 visits by the end of fiscal year 2014.\n\n\u201cWhile there will always be a need for emergency departments to care for people who suffer trauma or have a sudden illness, we are building a delivery model of care that will better manage the health of our population and promote care, when needed, in the most appropriate setting for the patient,\u201d wrote Ryan Gehrig, president of Mercy Fort Smith.\n\nGehrig said Mercy will continue to grow primary care resources and work toward better health for the larger community.\n\n\u201cThere is a demonstrated need for better access to care,\u201d Gehrig added.\n\nPeople who are sick are not getting treatment at clinics because it takes take them longer to get an appointment, Cordum said. Fort Smith needs 30 to 40 more primary care physicians to meet demand. Complications from high blood pressure and diabetes make up a large part of the issues at the Sparks ER.\n\n\u201cSometimes correcting a long-standing health care issues such as high blood pressure can spur several other disease processes that require immediate attention,\u201d Cordum said.\n\nIn the process of the body trying to self-correct, Cordum explained, sometimes when medication is given to a high blood pressure patient to correct the problem, his or her kidneys stop functioning, because the organ has adjusted to the higher pressure of blood to have everything work.\n\nWinter Is Coming\n\nThe Sparks nursing chief said she has to open 32 more medical \u201csurge\u201d beds and 10 more ICU beds to meet the demand of more patients. The hospital is also hiring 30 more RNs and 20 health care support staff by Halloween.\n\nSparks employs 782 RNs in the hospital and 44 at its clinics. It also reintroduced the LPNs in recent years and has 135 of the mid-level nurses to conduct procedures and free the RNs for other duties. At least 11 LPNs at Sparks are studying to become RNs and four RNs studying for doctorates. There are 140 nursing assistants.\n\n\u201cGoing into the winter, if we don\u2019t start projecting now people to care for those, we\u2019re going to get into the busy months and it\u2019s going to be really hard for everybody,\u201d Cordum said.\n\nPeople with respiratory illnesses have a difficult time when the seasons change, Cordum added. They tend to have more pneumonia and other acute illnesses when the weather changes. An additional 12 nurses were added to the emergency department at Sparks to meet the demand of seeing between 190 and 225 patients a day, a number usually only seen during flu season. Flu shots are expected to be available soon.\n\nCordum said before Medicaid expansion the Sparks ER saw an average about 160 patients a day, and was the \u201cbusiest ER in the state\u201d in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that we\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people, but we have to be prepared for that surge and monitor it very closely,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this winter is going to be very telling for us as we see the different disease processes.\u201d\n\nAdapting, Expanding\n\nAdapting to the change brought on by health care expansion is a challenge for the hospitals, but one they are willing to do in an effort to create a more healthy population.\n\nGehrig said the key to stabilizing emergency department visits is expanding primary care.\n\n\u201cEarly intervention in the primary care setting will help many patients avoid the high-cost, resource intensive environment of the emergency department,\u201d Gehrig stated. \u201cMercy\u2019s commitment to recruiting more primary care physicians and creating new clinics is designed to help people get the care they need before it becomes an emergency situation.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, Mercy Clinic increases its primary care visits by 53 percent. It added more health care providers an care centers, Gehrig noted.\n\nIn addition to new primary care clinics, Mercy added four clinics in schools, one in a retirement living center and one dedicated to providing expanded access for Medicaid patients needing to establish with a primary care provider.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost a year after the first health insurance enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, local hospitals Sparks Regional Medical Center and Mercy Fort Smith have seen an uptick in emergency room visits.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Almost a year after the first health insurance enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, local hospitals Sparks Regional Medical Center and Mercy Fort Smith have seen an uptick in emergency room visits.", "title": "ER Visits Up At Fort Smith Hospitals Following Health Care Act", "url": "http://swtimes.com/business/er-visits-fort-smith-hospitals-following-health-care-act", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_Ryan-Gehrig-09.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/er-visits-fort-smith-hospitals-following-health-care-act", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_Ryan-Gehrig-09.jpg"}, "creator": "@timesrecord", "description": "Almost a year after the first health insurance enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, local hospitals Sparks Regional Medical Center and Mercy Fort Smith have seen an uptick in emergency room visits.", "title": "ER Visits Up At Fort Smith Hospitals Following Health Care Act"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1162823", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1162823", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T04:45:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdc6\"", "article_summary": "It added more health care providers an care centers, Gehrig noted.\nFort Smith needs 30 to 40 more primary care physicians to meet demand.\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion and the health care option certainly has spurred this influx, without a doubt,\u201d Cordum said.\nGehrig said Mercy will continue to grow primary care resources and work toward better health for the larger community.\nMercy\u2019s primary care visits at its many clinics also increased by 37,789 visits in one year, with 70,811 visits by the end of fiscal year 2013 and 108,600 visits by the end of fiscal year 2014."}
