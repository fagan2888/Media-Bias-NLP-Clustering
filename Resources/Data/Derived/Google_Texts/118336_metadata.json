But we\u2019ve cut through the clutter to get to the point of what\u2019s required.\n\nWho has to report\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s make it clear who has to abide by these reporting rules. Who knows maybe you\u2019re small enough to recuse yourself from all this mess.\n\nThe reporting requirements apply to \u201capplicable large employers\u201d (ALE) \u2014 those who employ 50 or more full-time or full-time equivalent employees. They also apply to anyone who provides minimum essential health coverage under the law to an individual \u2014 this would apply to a very small self-insured employer, for example.\n\nWho\u2019s a full-time equivalent employee? That\u2019s an issue we tackle here.\n\nThe IRS then says: \u201cIf an employer has fewer than 50 full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees, on average during the prior year, the employer is not an ALE for the current calendar year. Therefore, the employer is not subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions or the employer information reporting provisions for the current year.\u201d\n\nReporting requirements\n\nNow it\u2019s time to get down to brass tacks.\n\nThere are four forms ALEs need to familiarize themselves with:\n\nForm 1094-B \u2014 Transmittal of Health Coverage Information Returns.\n\n\u2014 Transmittal of Health Coverage Information Returns. Form 1094-C \u2014 Transmittal of Employer Health Insurance Offer and Health Coverage Returns.\n\n\u2014 Transmittal of Employer Health Insurance Offer and Health Coverage Returns. Form 1095-B \u2014 Health Coverage.\n\n\u2014 Health Coverage. Form 1095-C \u2014 Employer Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage Insurance.\n\nWho files what?\n\nThe reporting system mirrors the current W-2 reporting system in that a 1095-B or 1095-C will be prepared for each applicable employee, and those forms will be filed with the IRS using a transmittal form \u2014 1094-B or 1094-C.\n\nForm 1095-C and Form 1094-C will be filed by ALEs. These forms will be required if the employer offers an insured or self-insured group health plan, or does not offer any group health plan.\n\nALEs must prepare a Form 1095-C for each full-time employee regardless of whether the employee is participating in an employer-sponsored group health plan. In addition, ALEs with self-insured plans will complete a Form 1095-C for each non-full-time employee who\u2019s enrolled in the self-insured health plan. The employer will not prepare a Form 1095-C for non-full-time employees who are not enrolled in a plan.\n\nForm 1094-C must be used to transmit Forms 1095-C to the IRS.\n\nForm 1095-B and Form 1094-B must be filed by insurance companies to report individuals covered by insured employer-sponsored group health plans.\n\nIn addition, small, self-insured employers will also use Form 1095-B and Form 1094-B to report employees and their family members who have coverage under the self-insured plan. Employees who are offered but decline coverage are not reported.\n\nForm 1094-B must be used to transmit Forms 1095-B to the IRS.\n\nWhat do employees get?\n\nA copy of the applicable Form 1095, or a substitute statement, must be given to each employee by January 31 every year after 2016 and can be provided electronically with the employee\u2019s consent. The 2016 deadline (for the 2015 year) has been moved to March 31, 2016.\n\nWhen are the forms due to the IRS?\n\nEmployers must file these returns for the 2015 year by May 31, 2016 (June 30 if filed electronically). Any employer filing at least 250 returns must file electronically. The deadline for future year\u2019s returns will be Feb. 28.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that employers with between 50 and 99 full-time and full-time equivalent employees were granted transition relief from having to comply with the ACA\u2019s employer mandate to provide insurance to employees. But even those granted transition relief must files these forms in 2016.\n\nPenalties apply\n\nWarning: Failing to provide these forms in a timely manner to the IRS or employees can result in fines \u2014 $250 per return.\n\nBut like with many ACA penalties, the IRS said that it won\u2019t impose penalties if firms can prove they made a good faith effort to comply with the 2015 reporting regs. But an \u201cuntimely\u201d filed form won\u2019t meet the good-faith requirement, the IRS said.\n\nFiling electronically?\n\nElectronic filing takes place in four stages:\n\nNaming your responsible official(s) and IRS contacts\n\nObtaining a Transmitter Control Code (TCC)\n\nTest filing, and\n\nActual filing.\n\nResponsible officials\n\nYou must file an application with the IRS to obtain a TCC needed to e-file. But before the application process can begin, you must register responsible officials and contacts with the IRS (here\u2019s the link to register).\n\nThe responsible official(s) you name will have authority over the e-filing process and are the contact persons for communications with the IRS. All companies that plan to e-file must put at least one responsible official and two contacts on their applications.\n\nApplying for a TCC\n\nOnce that registration process is complete, you can apply for a TCC. Anyone transmitting info to the IRS is required to complete an ACA Information Return Transmitter Control Code Application through the IRS e-services portal.\n\nThe TCC will then be mailed to you.\n\nTest filing\n\nAfter receiving your TCC, transmitters are encouraged to complete a communication test using the IRS\u2019 Affordable Care Act Assurance Testing System.\n\nActual filing\n\nOnce you\u2019ve test filed, you\u2019re ready to file for real. To do this, you must use the IRS\u2019 Affordable Care Act Information Returns Program \u2014 aka AIR.\n\nBut the program won\u2019t be ready until Oct. 22, 2015.\n\nExtension available in some cases\n\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to hit the aforementioned reporting deadlines, don\u2019t panic just yet.\n\nThere\u2019s a 30-day reprieve available from the reporting requirements.\n\nIn order to take advantage of the extension, employers must use Form 8809 (Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns) and submit it by the reporting deadline. If that form seems familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s the same form used to request an extension for filing W-2s and 1099s.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all.\n\nThe 30-day extension can be extended even further in certain situations. According to the instructions on Form 8809, an additional 30-day extension may be provided if the request for an additional extension is filed before the expiration of the original extension.\n\nEmployers shouldn\u2019t bank on getting the additional extension, however. The IRS makes it clear that \u201crequests for additional time are granted only where it is shown that extenuating circumstances prevented filing by the date granted by the first request.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "If you think the Obamacare\u00a0reporting requirements issued by the IRS are confusing, you\u2019re not alone.
