And, Albert Pujols is one of the planet\u2019s greatest ambassadors for loving and supporting people with Down Syndrome. His own step-daughter was born with Down Syndrome. Pujols and his wife, Dee Dee, formed the Pujols Family Foundation for Christian mission work to his native Dominican Republic and to show the humanity and dignity of people born with Down Syndrome.\n\nHe did that last night with one, big, sweep-him-off-his-feet hug of Champ Pederson.\n\nIt was especially awesome to see because Champ had just finished talking to a reporter, on camera, about how much he loved Pujols, but he was still hoping his little brother Joc would win that round of the derby.\n\nJoc did. Then, as Pujols and Joc came together for handshakes, Champ was alongside the two. Pujols turned and picked up Champ with a big hug.\n\nOK, so a little \u201ctruth in advertising\u201d: I wrote a biography of Albert Pujols a number of years ago and have been following his story since he was in the minor leagues 16 years ago. He\u2019s the real deal. And, given his heart and his commitment to Jesus Christ, I have no doubt that he will accomplish even more good in the world after he finishes baseball than he has while he has been kept busy with the job of baseball \u2014 and that\u2019s saying a lot, given all he does to serve others.\n\nOh, that our culture of death would wake up and realize the beauty and humanity of people born with Down Syndrome. Some estimates reveal that 90 prcent of babies who are diagnosed with Down Syndrome while in the womb are then aborted.\n\nTake a look at the Pujols-Pederson embrace from last night and be moved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nothing prepared us Monday night for the Albert Pujols crushing hug and love he threw onto Champ Pederson, the older brother of Los Angeles Dodgers' rookie Joc Pederson during the Home Run Derby.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nothing prepared us Monday night for the Albert Pujols crushing hug and love he threw onto Champ Pederson, the older brother of Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 rookie Joc Pederson during the Home Run Derby.", "title": "W.
