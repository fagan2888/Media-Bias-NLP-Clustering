He saw a need that couldn\u2019t be met.\n\nPeople lined up for days, waiting to be seen. Mothers held crying babies. Nurses quickly recorded vital signs and asked about symptoms. Sometimes antibiotics were available. Most times, nurses could only console families and urge them to drink clean water, find clean sources of food, and wait.\n\nThat was summer 2008. Now Travis plans to study emergency medicine.\n\n\u201cYou see the complete spectrum of people, because anyone can go to the emergency department and they must be treated,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the doctor, you have to figure out what the problem is and help them.\u201d\n\nSmith, 25, is one of 40 fourth-year students in the first graduating class of the Georgia Regents University-University of Georgia Medical Partnership. Like most of his classmates, Smith applied for a specialty that will take him through additional training after medical school.\n\nThe U.S. faces a shortage of 90,000 primary care doctors by 2020 and 130,000 by 2025, says the Association of American Medical Colleges. About 48 million Americans live in areas where more primary care doctors \u2014 such as family physicians, internists and pediatricians \u2014 are needed. The demand will grow as the Affordable Care Act provides help to millions of previously uninsured patients.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s population, meanwhile, has been increasing faster than its supply of primary care doctors.\n\nWithout \u201cimmediate statewide cooperation\u201d in Georgia, the outlook is even worse and \u201cthe state may never again have an adequate supply of physicians,\u201d according to a report by the association\u2019s Center for Workforce Studies. Without changes, \u201cGeorgia will rank last in the United States in physicians per capita by 2020.\u201d\n\nDespite this nationwide demand for more family medicine doctors, Smith and medical students around the country still pursue specialties and subspecialties for their careers. The number of medical students considering primary care training, including family medicine, general pediatrics and general internal medicine, is falling. But at the same time, the need for such physicians is growing.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2010, the number of medical students increased by 13.6 percent, but those expected to enter primary care fields decreased by 6.3 percent.\n\nSmith and his classmates talk about these trends in class. But they clearly don\u2019t like the notion of weighing one category of doctors against another. They say specialties contribute as much to solving the nation\u2019s health problems as do careers in family medicine.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, emergency medicine is a primary care profession,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo many people come in for reasons that they very easily could have gone to their primary care doctor for, but couldn\u2019t get in for an appointment or waited too long.\u201d\n\nWhy do they do what they do?\n\nWhen Bree Berry was a child, and adults asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she said \u201cpediatrician\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had a great one when I was little, and I\u2019ve always been interested in that aspect of primary care and being the person who patients seek when they\u2019re sick,\u201d she said. \u201cI like the idea of building long-term relationships with patients.\u201d\n\nAfter a summer internship in pediatrics research and a pediatrics rotation, she confirmed what she already knew.\n\n\u201cI feel lucky that what I want to do with general outpatient pediatrics will help with the doctor shortage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not self-sacrificing on my behalf. I\u2019m able to do what I want to do.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, several academic journals investigated how today\u2019s medical students choose their specialties, and what factors influence their decisions. Some say money, some say debt, and others say it boils down to student personality.\n\n\u201cThe choice of a specialty is a complex and important one for the student that has significant implications for the health care and health of the community,\u201d David Mirvis, a public health professor at the University of Tennessee, wrote earlier this year. Many decisions \u201creflect student needs and values.\u201d\n\nThese needs and values include lifestyle, intellectual stimulation and income. Other factors \u2014 such as work hours, attitudes of the community, and prestige \u2014 play into the decision as well.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between the specialties that students choose and how much they expect to earn, reported University of Georgia professor Mark Ebell in 2009.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, less than 15 percent of graduating medical students will be in primary care practices,\u201d he said. \u201cIn most countries, about half of students are in primary care practices, and those countries consistently have better health outcomes and provide care more efficiently than in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAmong the major factors that students consider when choosing which specialty to pursue, student loan debt is actually the least important, according to an Association of American Medical Colleges survey released in February. But most of the 14,000 survey respondents did say future salary is a major part of the decision.\n\n\u201cMoney and the lifestyle that goes with it do play a role in people\u2019s decisions,\u201d said Berry, 24. \u201cStudents may enjoy their family practice rotation just as much as cardiology, but if you look at the long hours for not as great of a reimbursement, it\u2019s easy for students to lean toward a specialty instead.\u201d\n\nA sense of place\n\nFor Clay Hartley, location is what matters most. Born and raised in southwest Georgia, he plans to practice there and has already asked for rotations in that area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most severe areas in terms of the shortage of primary care doctors and doctors in general,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to go back and help.\u201d\n\nHartley, 24, is still deciding what this means in terms of specialization, but as long as he\u2019s in the right location, he\u2019ll be happy.\n\n\u201cThis is the thing you\u2019re going to do in the morning and even in the middle of the night sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, it\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\n\nIf Hartley steers his career toward primary care, he may be eligible for incentive programs aimed at bringing more doctors to rural areas. The American Medical Association offers some financial incentives, including loan interest caps and several tuition assistance and loan-forgiveness programs.\n\nIn February 2013, $10 million in federal funding helped 87 medical students repay their loans if they worked full time for three years or part time for six years under the National Health Service Corps Program.\n\nAs long as certain specialties \u2014 such as surgery or emergency medicine \u2014 help families as a whole, Hartley believes they should be considered part of the solution to the primary care shortage.\n\n\u201cThese fields may not fall under the textbook definition of primary care, but they all deal with annual visits, blood pressure, and cholesterol,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, primary care should be about what your everyday people need, and they need all kinds of doctors and surgeons.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Carolyn Crist is pursuing her master\u2019s degree in health and medical journalism from the University of Georgia.
