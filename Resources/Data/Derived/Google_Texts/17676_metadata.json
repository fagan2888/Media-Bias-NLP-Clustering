Ted Cruz, in Iowa on Monday, rebuffed criticism that heated anti-abortion rhetoric may have helped motivate a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs last week that killed three.\n\nCruz condemned suspected shooter Robert L. Dear, but accused the media of \u201cbending over backward to try to use this horrible crime to advance a political agenda.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports by several news outlets, Dear told authorities \u201cno more baby parts\u201d after Friday\u2019s shooting, which killed a police officer and two civilians.\n\n\u201cThis man is a despicable murderer and should be punished to the full extent of the law, but none of that changes the reality that Planned Parenthood is in the business of buying and selling the body parts of unborn children,\u201d Cruz, 44, told reporters after a town-hall meeting.\n\nOne of Cruz\u2019 priorities is defunding Planned Parenthood, which reports it allocates 3 percent of its health services for abortion services.\n\nAbout 150 people came to hear Cruz at the Kirkwood Regional Center at the University of Iowa on the last of a three-day, nine-stop tour of Iowa. Cruz\u2019s support is surging in Iowa. He has moved into second place at 23 percent, doubling his support from four weeks ago, and is within the margin of error of front-runner Donald Trump, according to the most recent Quinnipiac University Poll released Nov. 24.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of his supporters identify themselves as \u201cvery conservative,\u201d according to the poll, which has been a recipe for success in the Iowa caucuses but not the general election.\n\nCruz spoke for about 20 minutes and took another 45 minutes of questions from a mostly supportive crowd in one of Iowa\u2019s most liberal counties \u2014 Johnson County.\n\nCruz hit on key campaign platforms: repealing the Affordable Care Act, dismantling the Internal Revenue Service, defending the right to bear arms and ending Common Core standards.\n\nCruz addressed the Syrian refugee crises, calling allowing \u201ctens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees\u201d into the United States \u201cutter lunacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want us to believe they are all widows and orphans,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe know at least one of the Paris terrorists came among the refugees, and we know that ISIS plans to infiltrate the country using refugees, and we know the head of the FBI ... told Congress the Obama Administration cannot vet the refugees.\u201d\n\nThe first-term senator spoke about his foreign affairs outlook, describing himself as in the mold of President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cThe best way to avoid a war is to be strong enough that no one wants to mess with the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weakness and appeasement of Obama is provocative and invites military conflict.\u201d\n\nHe accused President Barack Obama of sending $100 billion to Ayatollah Khameini, which he said if not stopped will fuel Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. He called preventing Iran and jihadists from getting nuclear weapons his top two priorities, followed by bolstering the U.S. missile defense.\n\nIn response to an audience question about whether he and other GOP candidates should condemn inflammatory comments by Trump, Cruz defended declining \u201cdaily invitations\u201d to blast Trump, saying he likes Trump and thanks him for \u201cframing the central issue of the campaign ... standing up to Washington.\u201d But said he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will be the nominee.\n\nDave Southard, of North Liberty, said Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina are on his shortlist, but said Monday\u2019s event solidified his support of Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe sincerity. The knowledge. The self-deprecating humor,\u201d Southard said. \u201cPeople came in today to challenge him, and he disarmed them. He is the whole package.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CORALVILLE - Republican presidential candidate and Texas Sen.
