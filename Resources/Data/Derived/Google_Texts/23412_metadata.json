They treat people with issues ranging from the common cold to diabetes and kidney failure.\n\nFounded by Wei Kuo, a fourth-year biology major at UCI, the Free Clinic Project is a partner of Lestonnac Free Health Clinic which operates other free clinics in Orange and Los Alamitos.\n\n\u201cWe really want to be there because some things really can\u2019t wait. You should go see a doctor and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for,\u201d Kuo said.\n\nAnd just as importantly, the clinic is a training base \u201cfor the next generation of doctors,\u201d said the project\u2019s Medical Director Dr. Baotran Vo, a family medicine and primary care doctor with UC Irvine Health.\n\nBy treating uninsured patients only, Dr. Vo said she hopes the clinic will inspire students to become heath care providers who are \u201ccommunity conscious and really want to give back.\u201d\n\nVolunteers at the clinic learn about the logistics of running a health center, setting up appointments, and approaching and treating patients. Currently, the clinic staff sees between three and six people a day, but hopes to significantly increase its patient load in the coming months.\n\nThere are many who need the services. While Covered California, the state\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), may have helped increase Medi-Cal enrollment statewide by a total of 2.2 million applicants in 2014, the ACA excludes undocumented residents, who now make up a greater portion of the uninsured population.\n\n\u201cUsually people have the option to go to another clinic to get another opinion, but our choices are very limited,\u201d said an undocumented woman living in Costa Mesa who did not want to be named for fear of deportation.\n\nThe woman uses the plight of her father to illustrate the daily struggle of many undocumented people who suffer from health issues that would be treatable if they had affordable access to healthcare.\n\nAlready suffering from untreated diabetes, the man broke his arm after falling off a ladder at a side job in the spring of 2013. He went to Share Our Selves (SOS), a community health center in Costa Mesa, and was referred to a hospital, but decided not to go.\n\n\u201cHe knew the hospital bills would be super expensive,\u201d the woman said. Her father continued to work with the broken arm, and self-treated the injury with arm exercises and massage therapy.\n\nStories such as this reveal the limitations of the free clinics, Vo said.\n\nWhile the free clinics are able to provide primary care, \u201cthe referral system is very limited,\u201d Vo said, and there is a need for more doctors who are willing to perform pro bono specialty procedures.\n\n\u201cWe see people with tumors that are 6 centimeters in size who have not been seen before,\u201d Dr. Vo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who travel 2 hours to get here when they hear there\u2019s a clinic available. Those are the people we are trying to reach out to.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, undocumented California residents may qualify for Medicaid under Prucol Status, said Dr. Michael Gusmano, who co-directed the \u201cUndocumented Patients Project\u201d at the Hastings Center in New York. Prucol status refers to residents who are not legal citizens, but are eligible for public benefits. But there are some restrictions.\n\n\u201cIf you are Prucol in California you may be eligible for Medi-Cal, but you can\u2019t use federal dollars to cover your care,\u201d Gusmano said.\n\nThis is a hurdle for those seeking care at the clinics. Even though doctor visits are free, patients are responsible for the cost of lab work and medication. However, lab costs can be discounted up to 90 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hoping to do here is catch those patients early to give them the service we can with our limited resources,\" Dr. Vo said. \"Hopefully we can catch that diabetic early on, hopefully we can pick up that tumor earlier. We are hoping to do as much as we can, but we see our limitations.\u201d\n\nTo make an appointment at the UCI Free Clinic Project call (714) 633-4600\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article mischaracterized the relationship between the UCI Free Clinic Project and the Lestonnac Free Health Clinic.
