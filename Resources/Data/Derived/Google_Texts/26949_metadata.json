The Bill of Rights Institute, funded by the Koch family and whose Board includes Koch employees, received a contract to help develop materials for North Carolina public school teachers to use in a course, required for all students, about America\u2019s founding principles.\n\nAs Ian Millhiser, Senior Constitutional Policy Analyst at the Center for American Progress Action Fund and author of the article, notes this could have been a great opportunity for North Carolina students to learn about important areas of American history that are often ignored by high schools. However, rather than present a balanced view, the materials push a clear Koch-sponsored agenda.\n\nThey present a selective view of history, exaggerate conflicts that have largely been resolved, emphasize subjects congenial to a conservative worldview and ignore entirely major threads of constitutional law and history. The students who learn from these materials are likely to emerge more skeptical of federal power and more sympathetic to a libertarian view of property rights. They are likely, in other words, to emerge more like Charles and David Koch.\n\nThere are many examples of how the Koch brothers\u2019 own political views are represented in the material. The module on property, for instance, focuses on matters of particular concern to well-moneyed groups such as land developers. Another unit, concentrating on whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions embrace a broad or narrow vision of federal power, paints a decision upholding Obamacare to be a broad expansion of federal power (even though in reality it reduced Congress\u2019 ability to legislate). But, perhaps the most absurd examples are where the material debates matters that are generally uncontroversial, such as whether the Bill of Rights applies to states.\n\nParts of the Institute\u2019s materials rely on a tactic that will be familiar to anyone who has debated a climate change denier, teaching students that a controversy exists over a question that has largely been resolved. The Seventeenth Amendment, for example, is put up for debate . . . Today, this amendment is almost entirely uncontroversial. A 2013 poll found that only 16 percent of American adults believe that it should be repealed.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the article in its entirety on Policy Watch\u2019s main page.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Another unit, concentrating on whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions embrace a broad or narrow vision of federal power, paints a decision upholding Obamacare to be a broad expansion of federal power (even though in reality it reduced Congress\u2019 ability to legislate).\nThere are many examples of how the Koch brothers\u2019 own political views are represented in the material.\nThe students who learn from these materials are likely to emerge more skeptical of federal power and more sympathetic to a libertarian view of property rights.\nHowever, rather than present a balanced view, the materials push a clear Koch-sponsored agenda.\nThey present a selective view of history, exaggerate conflicts that have largely been resolved, emphasize subjects congenial to a conservative worldview and ignore entirely major threads of constitutional law and history."}
