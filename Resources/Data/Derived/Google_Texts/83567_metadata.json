A ribbon-cutting will be held Monday.\n\nThe design and technology of the 15,500-square-foot department aim to make it easier to handle more patients, cut the \u201cdoor-to-provider\u201d time that takes place between arrival and treatment, and speed up treatment and processes so patients can leave.\n\nFor example, the 20 acute-care rooms that ring the core facilities for clinical staff are largely identical, so they can handle almost anything that comes through the door with portable equipment, or necessary equipment that is duplicated, including cardiac monitors in every room.\n\n\u201cWe will bring things to the patient rather than taking patient to specialized rooms,\u201d said Karen Beinhaur, a registered nurse who is clinical director of emergency services for St. Joseph.\n\n\u201cIf somebody comes in with a laceration, and there\u2019s already (a patient) in the laceration/suture room, you won\u2019t have to wait,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThe two extra rooms and expected improved flow of patients will help during the busy times, which are par for the course in emergency departments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full pretty often,\u201d Beinhaur said. \u201cWith this, we won\u2019t have to put patients in hallways.\u201d\n\nSt. Joseph Hospital has been preparing to upgrade its 20-year-old emergency department for years.\n\nIn 2012, it shifted the physical therapy unit to a separate building on Northeastern Boulevard to make room for a temporary emergency department, and in June 2013, it shifted the emergency department to the temporary facility so the existing department could be gutted and rebuilt.\n\nThe process cost about $8 million, which includes moving costs, Martin said.\n\nIt\u2019s a coincidence that the ribbon-cutting will occur just as the Affordable Care Act moves past its first big sign-up deadline, but the two events aren\u2019t unconnected.\n\nA big part of the effort to control health care costs involves shifting patients away from expensive emergency rooms when trauma or other critical care isn\u2019t needed, yet St. Joseph Hospital hopes its new ER will attract more patients. The key will be to differentiate among patients who come in through the door, which isn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cProbably a majority of people (who come to an ER) don\u2019t qualify as true emergencies, and that has been the case for decades,\u201d Martin said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the effect of expanded health insurance through the Affordable Care Act will have. A Portland, Ore., study found that expanding Medicaid coverage actually increased the use of emergency rooms, because it drew patients who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have gone to any medical provider. Public health was improved, but costs were not.\n\nWhatever happens, Martin said St. Joseph Hospital knew it had to upgrade the emergency department, which was last rebuilt two decades ago.\n\nTwo of the new acute-care rooms are oversize and can hold more than one patient at a time; another room contains decontamination equipment to clean toxins off people after accidents \u2013 the old facility was outdoors, which made things tough in winter. In addition, three rooms were made more secure for patients with mental health issues, designed to increase safety for patients and staff.\n\nTechnology is everywhere; even the timepieces on the wall are atomic clocks, so everybody is synchronized.\n\nIt will be staffed by an emergency department physician on a \u201c26-hour\u201d schedule, meaning three shifts that overlap for two one-hour periods each day; three to eight nurses, depending on the time of day; and other clinical and support staff, including per-diem clinicians who can be called in as necessary.\n\nNo new positions have been created for the department, but decisions may change as patient traffic patterns become known.\n\n\u201cDepending on what happens, we will judge what we need,\u201d Beinhaur said.\n\nAbove and beyond the treatment and medical practice improvements, working in new, modern surroundings has a psychological benefit, Martin and Beinhaur said.\n\n\u201cI recruited two new physicians to start this summer \u2026 and I\u2019m sure this helped,\u201d Martin said.\n\nBeinhaur said that even the temporary facility produced an effect, thanks to some new equipment and the ability to experiment with different layouts and patterns.\n\n\u201cIt really did change how patients felt, how the staff felt,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the new emergency department will be even better.\n\n\u201cEverything is crisp and new,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been a long time coming.\u201d\n\nDavid Brooks can be reached at 594-6531 or dbrooks@nashua\n\ntelegraph.com.
