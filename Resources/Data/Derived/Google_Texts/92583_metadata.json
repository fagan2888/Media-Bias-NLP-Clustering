Now scientists from the University of Montreal say they have pinpointed the exact gene responsible \u2014 the POC5 gene. The team has published their findings in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.\n\nScoliosis affects upward of seven million people in the U.S., according to the American Chiropractic Association (ACA). Despite its widespread incidence, science hasn\u2019t been able to establish a cause for more than 80 percent of scoliosis cases, otherwise known as idiopathic scoliosis. The remaining 20 percent stem from a mix of neurological dysfunction, tumors, or trauma.\n\nThe POC5 gene discovery holds long-term potential, says co-author Dr. Pierre Drapeau, professor and director of the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at the University of Montreal. \u201cThis crucial first step will open the door to future studies that will identify the complementary genes and pathways that play a role in scoliosis in other populations,\u201d Drapeau said in a statement.\n\nHe and a team of colleagues looked a population of zebrafish to collect their data, as the animal can offer a reasonable genetic model, and, unlike other models \u2014 like worms \u2014 zebrafish have spines. Through genetic testing they found a mutation in the POC5 gene, which encodes for a protein in control of microtubule organization. The mutation produced a rotational deformation in roughly half the fish, which mirrored scoliosis in humans.\n\nTheir tests revealed more complexity than previously thought. It now seems to be the case that idiopathic scoliosis finds its root in the brain, given the protein\u2019s strong expression among particular midbrain structures. \u201cThis is a very heterogeneous disease and probably more than one gene is required for disease expression,\u201d co-lead author Dr. Florina Moldovan said. \u201cThis discovery has enabled the identification of the first causative gene and represents an important step towards decoding its genetic causes.\u201d\n\nScoliosis is defined by the ACA as a curvature of the spine no less than 10 degrees off-center. Typically it crops up in children between the ages of 10 and 15, and mostly in girls. Familial scoliosis is slightly different. As part of their study, Moldovan and her team tracked the members of a large French family, many of whom suffered from idiopathic scoliosis. Both non-relatives and members of the family expressed different variations of the POC5 gene, further lending to its complexity, said co-author Dr. Patrick Edery, of CHU de Lyon hospital.\n\nDrapeau echoed Edery\u2019s sentiments. While the overall picture of what causes scoliosis may not be totally solved, researchers seem to be getting a better sense of which questions to ask. \u201cIn particular,\u201d Drapeau said, \u201ca full portrait of genetic events would enable the perfecting of effective preventative methods and strategies for understanding scoliosis.\u201d\n\nSource: Moldovan F, Edery P, Drapeau P, Patten K.
