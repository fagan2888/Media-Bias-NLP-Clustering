But how do they expect us to follow through with that when, as soon as we turn on the news, we are shown a constant live stream of news regarding Ebola \u2014 with videos of people in hazmat suits in West Africa \u2014 and its rapidly increasing death rate? Aymon Faizi\n\nWhitestone: Just remember that the southern border is as secure as the White House. If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. There is not even a smidgen of evidence that the IRS is corrupt. A self-admitted militant Muslim who advertises such on his Facebook page and then goes out and cuts the head off of a middle-aged woman in Oklahoma did not commit a terrorist act. And there is absolutely no threat of Ebola spreading in the United States. Jake McNicholas\n\nCause for concern\n\nBronx: Over two months ago, Voice of the People published my letter about the seriousness of the now widely known Ebola virus. Although I\u2019m a mere commoner with no expertise on this subject whatsoever, what I do have, along with most Americans, is something called common sense. Right from the start, everyone from the President on down should have prepared the country for protecting ourselves from the virus\u2019 ravages. Now that Ebola is here, Americans are told the government has things under control. When a person walks into a hospital, says he just came from West Africa and is sent home to contaminate others, I would not call that \u201cunder control.\u201d Two things for our President and Congress members to remember: One, every year we are told to be careful because it is easy to catch the flu, which is a virus like Ebola. Two, viruses do not discriminate. Matthew Galcik\n\nConnecting the dots\n\nBrooklyn: ISIS. Ebola virus. Coincidence? What\u2019s next? Nikia Charles\n\nSpeak up\n\nScarsdale, N.Y.: Re Alton Nolen (\u201cBeheader\u2019s kin: Pray for \u2018a good kid,\u2019\u201d Sept. 30): When teachers see troubling behaviors, they know that intervention is needed immediately. Teachers reach out to supervisors, guidance counselors and families for assistance. However, many children fall through the cracks. Early effective intervention can prevent some horrific incidents from happening in the future. When you see something, say\n\nsomething. Phyllis C. Murray\n\nNo-clue Lupica\n\nManhattan: Mike Lupica out-stupided himself with \u201cNice try, Sox, but Jeter\u2019s OUR Captain\u201d (column, Sept. 29). I guess he saw a different game than most of us, missing all the Yankee fans wearing their team logo proudly in the stands and chanting \u201cDerek Jeter!\u201d And so what if Red Sox fans chimed in? It was a day for the baseball history books. Mary Jo Pane\n\nProfessional jealousy\n\nStaten Island: If you read between the lines, Mike Lupica\u2019s columns hint at the possibility that he was the last kid picked for games. That undercurrent broke the surface and gushed all over Derek Jeter in comments about \u201cJeter Inc.\u201d and Jeter\u2019s venture into the Players Tribune (\u201cSuddenly, cat no longer has Derek\u2019s tongue,\u201d column, Oct. 2). Jeter took the scathing wrath not only because he\u2019s a symbol of the athlete Lupica couldn\u2019t be, but also a player who had the audacity to keep Lupica at bay. If, in Lupica\u2019s view, Jeter never gave enough of himself, Lupica is conversely and unmistakably transparent. No need to read between the lines on that article. Glenn Ramanauskas\n\nThe final score\n\nManhattan: I salute Derek Jeter for all he\u2019s done for the Yankees. Now, we start to hear about A-Rod. Is this all noise just to cover up the real issue \u2014 that the aging and expensive Yankees and their 84-78 record did not make the playoffs again? Felix Baez\n\nLet me mourn in peace\n\nBrooklyn: After hearing about the three retired NYC firefighters who died, one of whom was a close friend, I decided to visit the 9/11 Memorial. As I strolled around the reflecting pools and waterfalls, I encountered a very harassing security guard. This man was annoyingly reminding people that they could not lean on, or rest their hands on, or in any way touch the names engraved on the memorial. He went so far as to tell one elderly couple with canes that they couldn\u2019t stop for a minute and catch their breath. When I asked him about this rule, the man intimidatingly said to me, \u201cSir, do you want to have a problem with me?\u201d This is when I lost it. For years I have seen people make etchings of their loved ones\u2019 names and knew this wasn\u2019t prohibited. So I found a supervisor and said, \u201cSir, as I see my friends\u2019 names, I stop and touch them and lose myself for a minute or so, reflecting about their lives. Is this wrong?\u201d He looked puzzled for a second, shook his head and said he would have a talk with his men, which he did. My first visit to a solemn place of remembrance was ruined by an overzealous rent-a-cop. Has anyone else out there had this experience? Robert Fiorello\n\nWin-win situation\n\nHoward Beach: To Voicer Kaitlin Sullivan: Research has consistently shown that quality pre-kindergarten programs benefit not only individual students but school districts as well. Children who attend these programs score higher on reading and math tests. I find this to be true with my own two children. Carol Franklin\n\nHealth deform\n\nForest Hills: I was so happy to read Voicer Linda Smith\u2019s letter regarding the Affordable Care Act. I was waiting to hear from someone like me who has employer-sponsored health care. My coverage also declined after the ACA was implemented. I went from having no annual deductible to a $6,000 deductible, plus out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, I pay for my family to be covered under my plan. So not only am I paying half of the premium, I have this huge deductible to meet. It has had a tremendous negative effect on my family\u2019s budget this year and will only get worse when premiums go up. Libby Gurgis\n\nClarifying light\n\nForest Hills: To Voicer Jo-Ann Maginnis: I\u2019m pretty certain the Empire State Building is never lit up in connection with religious events, persons or observances. That is a choice made by the private owners of the building. Linda Sperling\n\nOverexposure\n\nVerona, N.J.: My compliments on Linda Stasi\u2019s piece \u201cGrace and disgrace\u201d (Oct. 1). What Stasi fails to include is the fact that writers like herself, and newspapers like the Daily News, continue to give undeserved fame to the \u201cdisgrace\u201d of Kanye and Kim. Nancy Juniper Wands\n\nWhere the buck stops\n\nSouth Amboy, N.J.: Let me start off by saying I am a huge Rex Ryan fan. But I heard him on \u201cThe Michael Kay Show\u201d not answering a question on whether or not he makes the decision to take out a QB. What? If you are not making the decisions on the field, then what the hell are you doing there? Please, Rex, you are killing me here. Say it ain\u2019t so. Lorraine Dietz\n\nWatch the hands\n\nStaten Island: To Voicer Michele Corelli: Perhaps you should look at the picture of President Bush saluting with his dog in his arms. Please notice that Bush is holding his dog in one arm and saluting with his other hand. Susan Esposito\n\nCheck the mirror\n\nManhattan: When I hear the left-wing media claim Republicans who criticize the poor performance of the Secret Service are doing so as a diversion to make themselves look good politically, I can\u2019t help but feel that the left is, once again, projecting what they would be doing if the circumstances were reversed. Jim Bitros\n\nObama fatigue\n\nBrooklyn: Maybe the Secret Service has finally grown weary of President Obama\u2019s act, and they don\u2019t care anymore. Just like the rest of the country. Tommy Mitchell\n\nPart of the picture\n\nPiscataway, N.J.: I have some news for citizens who like recording police officers: You may not like it, but the law says police have a right to use force to effect arrests or if they are being assaulted. My question to you is: Do you record when the civilian is spitting on or assaulting an officer, or do you start recording only when the officer is defending himself or herself, then claim police\n\nbrutality?
