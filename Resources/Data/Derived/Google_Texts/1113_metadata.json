If we put the doctors in charge and paid them for value, we could transform the economy.\u201d Obamacare, he said, \u201chelps enormously\u201d with this drive toward a better healthcare system.\n\nThis also crosses over into consumer applications, he revealed.\n\n\u201cThe most recent investment I made was in MyFitnessPal,\u201d Doerr said. \u201cThey built a profitable business on their own savings.
