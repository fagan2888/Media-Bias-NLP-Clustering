(Library of Congress / Wikimedia Commons )\n\nToo often these days, journalists are afraid to challenge those in power.\n\nThe risks and costs associated with adversarial journalism have reduced 'the job' to that of a loyal state- and corporate-aligned journalist.\n\nWhen I went into journalism, one of the first things I was told as a freshman is that journalism is different from stenography. It is supposed to be\u2014or at least has been\u2014about using rights granted under the First Amendment to be a check on government and corporate power.\n\nYet, the hedge in that last sentence is deliberate\u2014and appropriate. That's because a new survey from the Indiana University suggests things are fast changing in the news industry\u2014and not for the better.\n\nThe latest in 42 years worth of surveys of journalists, this one polled more than 1,000 reporters in the latter half of 2013. That timeframe is significant\u2014it was right when revelations about the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance were being published.\n\nYou might think such an historic time period in the annals of journalism would only strengthen reporters\u2019 belief in the necessity of responsibly\u2014but fearlessly\u2014publishing information, even if the powers that be do not authorize such publication. Instead, it seems the exact opposite has happened.\n\nAs IU researchers note, \u201cthe percentage of U.S. journalists endorsing the occasional use of \u2018confidential business or government documents without authorization,\u2019 dropped significantly from 81.8 percent in 1992 to 57.7 percent in 2013.\u201d\n\nTo really understand the implications of this shift, think back to almost every famous investigative scoop. Then ask yourself: What would have happened to those stories had they only come to one of those 4 in 10 reporters who oppose the use of \u201cconfidential business or government documents without authorization\u201d?\n\nThe answer, most likely, is that those stories would never have been published, and history might have unfolded in an entirely different way. Maybe \u201cThe Jungle\u201d would never have been written, and then the most basic food safety standards would never have become law. Maybe Richard Nixon would have served two full terms. And maybe we would still know very little about just how much our own government is surveilling us.\n\nNoting all this isn\u2019t to dismiss the trepidation that comes with doing real investigative journalism. After all, when you do that kind of work, you inevitably run the risk of legal threats and intimidation. You are also all but guaranteed to face the scorn of state-aligned or corporate-aligned journalists\u2014i.e. those reporters who predicate their work on echoing, amplifying and pleasing those in power.\n\nBut all of those costs are an unavoidable part of the job, at least if you think \u201cthe job\u201d is reporting information, without fear or favor, in the public interest.\n\nThat definition, though, may not be so sacrosanct anymore. \u201cThe job\u201d is now defined differently depending on where you may be in the news ecosystem. And in much of that ecosystem, the risks and costs associated with adversarial journalism have reduced \u201cthe job\u201d to that of a loyal state-and corporate-aligned journalist. This is why so many Washington reporters publicly slammed the NSA disclosures. It also explains why financial journalists so often defend Wall Street.\n\nSimply put, the path that avoids regular confrontation with power is often far easier, less risky and more lucrative in the news business. Thus, it has become the preferred path du jour, to the point where almost half of the news business does not support reporting news that the government and corporations don\u2019t want reported. And who knows? Maybe the next IU survey 10 years from now shows a full-on majority of journalists saying news outlets shouldn\u2019t publish without the express consent of the corporations and governments.\n\nThat would no doubt make the CEOs and politicians quite happy, but it would be a tragedy for the rest of us.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/16710/journalism_without_guts", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/articles/Sirota_Journalism_Study_500_348_s.jpg", "description": "Too often these days, journalists are afraid to challenge those in power.", "title": "Journalism Without Guts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98a4\"", "article_summary": "When I went into journalism, one of the first things I was told as a freshman is that journalism is different from stenography.\nThe risks and costs associated with adversarial journalism have reduced 'the job' to that of a loyal state- and corporate-aligned journalist.\nMuch has changed in journalism since these New York Times reporters and editors worked on their stories in 1942.\nAnd in much of that ecosystem, the risks and costs associated with adversarial journalism have reduced \u201cthe job\u201d to that of a loyal state-and corporate-aligned journalist.\nNoting all this isn\u2019t to dismiss the trepidation that comes with doing real investigative journalism."}
