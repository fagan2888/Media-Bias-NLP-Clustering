He made the opening-night roster and was given a one-year, two-way deal paying him $675,000 in the NHL and $150,000 in the minors.\n\nBy being told to get a place, the Avs told Skille he won\u2019t likely be sent down to San Antonio of the American Hockey League. Skille is playing right wing on the fourth line, but has the ability to play in a top-six role. He has two goals and three points in 22 games and is a primary penalty-killing forward.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not secure by any means,\u201d Skille said after Saturday\u2019s morning skate at the Pepsi Center. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to face every single day. It is nice to kind of have a little bit more freedom, and be able to cook meals and stuff like that. But the on-ice (work) doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nAgozzino debut. Left wing Andrew Agozzino was recalled from San Antonio on Friday and made his NHL season debut Saturday against Winnipeg. It was his second career NHL game, having made his debut Nov. 22, 2014, against Carolina.\n\nAgozzino, 24, leads the Rampage with seven goals and 16 points in 13 games. He played on the fourth line with Skille and center Chris Wagner against the Jets.\n\nAgozzino traded places with Dennis Everberg, who was demoted to the Rampage.\n\nFootnotes. Avs defenseman Nate Guenin was a healthy scratch for the fifth consecutive game. Forwards John Mitchell (oblique) and Alex Tanguay (knee) continue to skate with the team and will likely play during the upcoming four-game road trip beginning Monday at the New York Islanders. Mitchell has missed 10 of the past 12 games and Tanguay the last nine consecutive. \u2026 Avs coach Patrick Roy said forward Jesse Winchester, who has battled a head injury for more than a year, currently has no contact with the team and \u201cwill call\u201d if his condition dramatically improves. Winchester has yet to play a game with the Avs since signing a two-year free agent contract on July 1, 2014.
