Virtual reality simulation technology has come a long way in recent years, most notably with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset for 3D gaming. Due to the success of Oculus Rift among, how do I put this lightly, people who don’t get out much, it was only a matter of time before this state-of-the-art technology was used in some deplorable fashion. A video gamer in Japan has created the “Boobie Squeezing Simulator” that provides users with the experience of touching a female anime character’s breasts. People residing in their parents’ basement rejoice.

"This is a pretty creepy implementation of virtual reality tech, and while Ryuto should get points for his DIY skills, the fact that the digital dame is programmed to appear unappreciative at your actions just makes its purpose even more questionable,” wrote the tech site The Daily Dot. "If your fantasy is to walk around grabbing boobs and making girls uncomfortable, your name should probably be added to a list somewhere."

A video posted by someone with the user name Ryuto shows exactly what you would expect upon reading a description for the so-called Oculus Rift Boobs Simulator (ORBS). A gamer wearing the Oculus Rift headset, most likely in his parent’s basement, is seen groping a virtual set of boobs at the urging of a creepy robotic voice. One can only wonder what’s next for the “practical” uses of virtual reality simulation technology.
