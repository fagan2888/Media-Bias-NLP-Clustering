ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- It’s a sweet story of success. Bissinger’s Chocolates are well known and well enjoyed in St. Louis, but the company’s history dates back to 17th-century France where European nobility enjoyed their confections. Karl Bissinger left France in 1845, taking with him his Master Confectioner and all the family secrets. He settled near Cincinnati, Ohio, where he opened the very first Bissinger’s store.

In 1927, Karl Bissinger’s son, also named Karl, moved to St. Louis and opened his own shop on McPherson Avenue.
