(Just last year, for example, following a spate of deaths on the subway, the city\u2019s Transit Workers Union 100 planned to hand out blood-spattered Metrocards to straphangers.) But if the tactics were textbook, the reaction from the mayor\u2019s office was an expression of real concern, implying that the grim advice might be taken seriously.\n\nHow did America become afraid of New York? Sure, the city was dangerous, relative to its recent history \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t more dangerous than other American cities of the era. The credit, at least in part, lay with Hollywood. On-location filming in the city tripled during the Lindsay administration, between 1966 and 1974. Doomed Gotham became not just the setting of the era\u2019s great films, but their subject. \u201cAs reflected in good movies and bad, serious ones as well as forthrightly foolish,\u201d the critic Vincent Canby wrote in 1976, \u201cNew York City has become a metaphor for what looks like the last days of American civilization.\u201d\n\nWithin the extended metaphor, there was no more potent symbol of danger than the New York City subway.\n\nThe year of \u201cFear City,\u201d for example, saw the release of two Hollywood films about murder and mayhem on the subway, \u201cDeath Wish\u201dand \u201cThe Taking of Pelham 123.\u201d Three years earlier, \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d a drug trafficking thriller with a famous subway chase, became the first R-rated movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. Its poster showed a murder on the familiar covered stairs of a Brooklyn elevated station. Four years later, in \u201cThe Warriors,\u201d director Walter Hill transformed the city\u2019s proud transportation system into a deserted and fantastic gangland.\n\nThese movies prompted public conversations about reality and cinema. After \u201cDeath Wish,\u201d a gruesome vigilante flick in which Charles Bronson\u2019s character murders four muggers on the subway (and six above ground), smashed the house record set by \u201cThe Godfather\u201d at an Upper East Side movie theater, the cultural critic John Corry confessed he felt \u201ca tension on the subways now that there never was before.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cPelham\u201d was released, New York Times reviewer Nora Sayre wrote that it had captured the city\u2019s \u201ccrisis mentality.\u201d \u201cThe hijacking seems like a perfectly probable event for this town,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPerhaps the only element of fantasy is the implication that city\u2019s departments could function so smoothly together.\u201d\n\nRevisit the \u201970s subway films, as I have at the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s \u201cRetro Metro\u201d series, and these cinematic developments start to seem inevitable \u2014 inherent to the subway, rather than a product of the time. Straphangers are helpless, confined and exposed to the madness and violence of their companions. For the lawless, the underground is a playground and a ready-made escape route. The spatial peculiarities of the subway seem designed to host the dark dramas of the age.\n\nAdd to that the system\u2019s lack of spatial or temporal context \u2014 midnight at a station in Queens looks exactly like morning in Manhattan \u2014 and you can see how any subway image seems to have come right from your local station. The subway is every New Yorker\u2019s \u201csecond neighborhood.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Hollywood created an unsettling Big City underworld to magnify our deepest fears", "title": "\u201cThe last days of American civilization\u201d: How the NYC subway became a potent (but erroneous) metaphor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How Hollywood created an unsettling Big City underworld to magnify our deepest fears", "title": "\u201cThe last days of American civilization\u201d: How the NYC subway became a potent (but erroneous) metaphor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/05/the_last_days_of_american_civilization_how_the_nyc_subway_became_a_potent_but_erroneous_metaphor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/subway_graffiti.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How Hollywood created an unsettling Big City underworld to magnify our deepest fears", "title": "\u201cThe last days of American civilization\u201d: How the NYC subway became a potent (but erroneous) metaphor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/subway_graffiti.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1970s, Death Wish, Dream City, mass transit, New York City, nyc, Subway, the french connection, The Taking of Pelham 123", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac9f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs reflected in good movies and bad, serious ones as well as forthrightly foolish,\u201d the critic Vincent Canby wrote in 1976, \u201cNew York City has become a metaphor for what looks like the last days of American civilization.\u201dWithin the extended metaphor, there was no more potent symbol of danger than the New York City subway.\n(Just last year, for example, following a spate of deaths on the subway, the city\u2019s Transit Workers Union 100 planned to hand out blood-spattered Metrocards to straphangers.)\nSure, the city was dangerous, relative to its recent history \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t more dangerous than other American cities of the era.\nThe spatial peculiarities of the subway seem designed to host the dark dramas of the age.\nFour years later, in \u201cThe Warriors,\u201d director Walter Hill transformed the city\u2019s proud transportation system into a deserted and fantastic gangland."}
