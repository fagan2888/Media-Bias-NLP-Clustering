There are countless medical tests doctors can suggest for their patients. But how do you know which ones you really need? Dr. Andy Dunn, from MESA Primary Care in Casper says, first, check your family history. If an immediate family member had a disease you should be screened for it too.

Next, be aware of aches and pains, but also of any other symptoms that go along with them like fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite. If aches and pains are accompanied by other symptoms it's probably a good time to get checked out.

Dr. Dunn can't make decisions for his patients. So he tries to tell them everything he can so they can make an informed decision on their own when deciding if they'll get tested.

“I usually do tell patients that if you were my brother, my sister, my mom or my dad what would I recommend and even to myself. No one wants a colonoscopy but again it's important and you need to weigh the potential risks of not doing the procedure.” – Dr. Andy Dunn, MESA Primary Care
