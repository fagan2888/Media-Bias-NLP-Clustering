(See County Group 5: Franklin and St. Lawrence)\n\nThe Erie, Niagara Counties' average Platinum premium was the lowest of the county groups ($516), while the Capital region's Platinum level average premium costs nearly $200 more ($695).\n\nSome notes on the data from Kev Coleman, Head of Research and Data at HealthPocket, Inc.\ufeff\n\n\"Each row in the attached spreadsheet lists average premium, deductible, and MOOP (i.e. Maximum Out-Of-Pocket expenditures for covered medical services within a calendar year) for every county zone and every metal level. New York is the only state to my knowledge that bans age rating for individual health insurance premiums and uses a \u201ccommunity rating\u201d for premiums*. Consequently, we used a single age profile for this market since it would not affect the results. The census profile for the quotes that underly the averages was an individual with a birthday on 1984-01-01. The effective dates for the health insurance plans was 2014-09-01. If the deductible was listed as \"No Maximum\", then we used the MOOP value as the deductible. If the deductible was listed as \"Not Applicable\", then I used $0 for the deductible.\"\n\n*Healthcare.gov describes \"community rating\" as: a rule that prevents health insurers from varying premiums within a geographic area based on age, gender, health status or other factors.\ufeff\n\nOther analysis by Kaiser Health News shows that care costs can vary widely within counties, something which the \"community rating\" of New York's system mitigates against.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office which provides non-partisan analysis for the U.S. Congress says that factors affecting health insurance premiums include the costs of administering health plans and,\n\n..an insurer\u2019s costs for covered services in turn reflect the scope of benefits that are included, the plan\u2019s cost-sharing requirements, and the health status of the plan\u2019s enrollees.\ufeff\n\nThe healthcare.gov website has more on the factors that influence premiums.\n\nResearch by the Leonard Davis School of Health Economics also points to \"lack of economies of scale and lack of competition among providers\", as influencing differences particularly in more rural areas.\ufeff\n\nFor more on rural healthcare, listen to this discussion from the Healthy Friday edition of Connections with Evan Dawson.\n\nThis hour focuses on delivering healthcare to people living in rural communities. We discuss how the Affordable Care Act affects those living in rural areas. We spoke with Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about the impact of the ACA. Our other guests were: Dr. Daniel Mendelson, Highland Hospital, James Kennedy, Finger Lakes Community Health and Erika Ziller, Maine Rural Health Research Center.\n\nBelow are the zip codes used to quote for each county zone.
