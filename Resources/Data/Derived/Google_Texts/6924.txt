Tying patient satisfaction to reimbursement of hospitals and physicians continues to be one of the more complicated parts of the Affordable Care Act. Ever since the bill was signed in 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has been issuing final rules and guidelines explaining just how much a disgruntled patient may affect reimbursement. In 2012, there were nearly 50 million Medicare enrollees in the United States , and that number will continue to grow as the Baby Boomers march towards retirement.So while CMS continues to measure how much hospital cleanliness and physician interaction play into patient satisfaction, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in Princeton, NJ, looked at patient satisfaction a bit differently. They asked patients if they thought they had received the best care possible in the previous 12 months, and broke it down between those enrolled in managed care Medicare programs and those in fee-for-service programs.The following are the states (including the District of Columbia) that had the most – and fewest – Medicare beneficiaries rate their care as “best” in the previous 12 months. The rankings are broken up by type, with rankings by fee-for-service beneficiaries coming first, followed by rankings by managed care beneficiaries.This study data comes from 2009, so we also are including the state’s overall hospital approval scores most recently released by CMS, the October 2012-September 2013 HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) scores.
