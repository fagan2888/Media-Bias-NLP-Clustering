European Pressphoto Agency\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) on Monday pointed to Ronald Reagan as an example of a president who believed in forceful foreign policy but relied on diplomacy as well, as he criticized GOP lawmakers who he said have taken Russia\u2019s occupation of Ukraine as an occasion to \u201cbeat their chest.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul brought down the house at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week with a speech that offered a stinging indictment of President Barack Obama, and subsequently won the CPAC straw poll. The speech focused on civil liberties but didn\u2019t address Ukraine or other foreign policy issues.\n\nMr. Paul, known for being wary of overseas military actions, turned to foreign-policy issues in an op-ed published on Breitbart on Monday. Mr. Paul touched on the crisis in Ukraine, recommending the U.S. implement sanctions and \u201cincreased economic pressure\u201d on Russia. More broadly, the senator called for the \u201cstrategic use of soft power\u201d and compared his approach to that of Mr. Reagan. But he also criticized fellow Republicans who he said have incorrectly characterized Mr. Reagan\u2019s actions to gain political traction.\n\nHere is more from his op-ed:\n\n\u201cEvery Republican likes to think he or she is the next Ronald Reagan. Some who say this do so for lack of their own ideas and agenda. Reagan was a great leader and President. But too often people make him into something he wasn\u2019t in order to serve their own political purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t claim to be the next Ronald Reagan nor do I attempt to disparage fellow Republicans as not being sufficiently Reaganesque. But I will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous Republican nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of Reagan, that splintering the party is not the route to victory.\u201d\n\nOn Russia\u2019s occupation of Ukraine: \u201c[S]ome politicians have used this time to beat their chest. What we don\u2019t need right now is politicians who have never seen war talking tough for the sake of their political careers.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Republicans should concentrate on establishing their own identities and agendas, as opposed to simply latching onto Ronald Reagan\u2019s legacy\u2014or worse, misrepresenting it.\u201d\n\nFollow @wsjwashington on Twitter.\n\nVideo: Jerry Seib on the U.S. and Russia: It\u2019s Complicated\n\nVideo: CPAC Attendees Pick Their Top 2016 candidates", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Sen.
