SOLVANG, Calif. -

The Rancheros Visitadores began their 85th annual ride with a festive parade through the streets of Solvang to the Mission Santa Ines on Saturday.

For the fourth year in a row, 700 cowboys sported pink in partnership with Wrangler Jeans and the Tough Enough to Wear Pink Foundation.

This year, the Rancheros raised $100,000 for the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara with Sansum Clinic.



"The Rancheros have been returning to Santa Barbara County and the Santa Ynez Valley for 85 years. Though our members come from far and wide, this is the Rancheros' home, and we have found a cause we believe in. We understand it is important to give back to the community we return to year after year," said Ranchero Steve Beneto.



After a special blessing at the Mission Santa Ines, the cowboys head into the back country for a week-long retreat.
