Click here to read out interview with Nurse-Family Partnership CEO Roxane White. NFP and other home visitation models saw increased federal support in recent years thanks to the Affordable Care Act and a subsequent extension of the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV).\n\nWendy\u2019s Wonderful Kids\n\nWWK is funded by and through the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. The program trains and supports the hiring of adoption specialists that focus on youth who have languished in foster care.\n\nIn 2011, Child Trends published an impact study on the Wendy\u2019s Wonderful Kids program, a huge undertaking that assessed the outcomes of all WWK sites and also used a smaller sample in a randomized control group study.\n\nThe study found that WWK-supported recruiters worked with 9,680 children, and that work has led to 3,708 adoptions. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a high rate of success, consider the following:\n\nThese were mostly children who statistically have horrific odds of getting adopted. Seventy percent were over nine years old; 45 percent were over 12; 45 percent had a disability; and 23 percent had more than one disability. The control group comparison showed that WWK-supported recruiters were 1.74 times more likely than others to successfully place a child with an adoptive family. In the parlance of researchers: Highly significant impact.\n\nYouth Villages\n\nYouth Villages is a Memphis, Tenn.-based multi-service provider that operates child welfare and juvenile justice programs in 13 states and Washington, D.C. The organization has slowly moved from a residentially focused operator to one with a continuum of care more focused on community-based services.\n\nA recent impact study on its transitional living program, conducted by social research firm MDRC, found the following:\n\nBoosted earnings by 17 percent.\n\nIncreased housing stability and economic well-being (including a 22 percent decrease in the likelihood of experiencing homelessness).\n\nThe program did not significantly improve outcomes in the areas of education, social support, or criminal involvement.\n\nYouth Villages is no stranger to game-changer-sized grants; it received $42 million from The Day Foundation in 2011 to expand its transitional living program.\n\nHealthy Steps for Young Children\n\nHealthy Steps ,operated by national nonprofit Zero to Three, puts \u201chealthy steps specialists\u201d in place with pediatric doctors and centers to assist parents with gaining access to early childhood resources and services.\n\nAn evaluation of Healthy Steps published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that \u201cpractice-based interventions can enhance quality of care for families of young children and can improve selected parenting practices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle of Social Change", "description": "As\u00a0Youth Services Insider reported earlier this month, a small group of youth- and family-serving organizations will soon\u00a0change forever thanks to massive investments from Blue Meridian Partners, a capital aggregation project...", "title": "Four Youth-Serving Orgs In Line for the Blue Meridian Billion - The Chronicle of Social Change", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 362, "identifier": "https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/YSI-MB-Page.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2016-02-19T12:35:06-07:00", "url": "https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/child-welfare-2/four-youth-serving-orgs-in-line-for-the-blue-meridian-billion/15889", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/YSI-MB-Page.jpg", "description": "As\u00a0Youth Services Insider reported earlier this month, a small group of youth- and family-serving organizations will soon\u00a0change forever thanks to massive investments from Blue Meridian Partners, a capital aggregation project...", "card": "summary", "title": "Four Youth-Serving Orgs In Line for the Blue Meridian Billion - The Chronicle of Social Change"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-19T12:09:28-07:00", "article": {"section": "Adoption", "tag": "Zero to Three", "published_time": "2016-02-19T12:09:28-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T12:35:06-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd869a\"", "article_summary": "Nothing is official yet, but an update to the partnership\u2019s website this week suggests that four organizations stand a strong chance of becoming Blue Meridian grantees.\nThe program trains and supports the hiring of adoption specialists that focus on youth who have languished in foster care.\nThe control group comparison showed that WWK-supported recruiters were 1.74 times more likely than others to successfully place a child with an adoptive family.\nThe study found that WWK-supported recruiters worked with 9,680 children, and that work has led to 3,708 adoptions.\nA recent impact study on its transitional living program, conducted by social research firm MDRC, found the following:Boosted earnings by 17 percent."}
