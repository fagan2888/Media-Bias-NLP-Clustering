Cruz claims shutdown vindication\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz told conservative activists in a speech Thursday that his vigorous attempts to derail Obamacare \u2014 including leading the effort to shut down the government \u2014 were being vindicated in the wake of the health reform plan\u2019s botched roll-out. He also offered encouragement to a group that faced fierce criticism following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.\n\n\u201cBoy, it\u2019s amazing how things can change in a few weeks in Congress,\u201d Cruz, a potential 2016 Republican presidential hopeful, said at a summit hosted by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council. \u201cJust a few weeks ago, people in Washington were saying, \u2018Why on earth are you fighting so hard against Obamacare?\u2019 Now, nobody\u2019s saying that. Over and over again you run into people who say, \u2018Now I understand what this is all about.\u2019\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\n\nThe senator\u2019s support for shutting down the government as part of a fight to defund the health care reform law drew deep ire from not only Democrats but also some fellow Republicans this fall. Cruz was blamed for diverting the public\u2019s attention from Obamacare to the 16-day closure, which took a deep toll on the GOP in polls.\n\nBut once the government re-opened, attention shifted to the massive problems with the Healthcare.gov website and other aspects of the law\u2019s rollout, and Cruz said the national conversation about Obamacare has changed dramatically.\n\nHe drew rounds of laughter when he referenced several of television host Jay Leno\u2019s jokes about the health care law, changing tones to impersonate the TV host.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Cruz's dad rips RINOs, Obamacare)\n\nIn his wide-ranging, 30-minute speech, the senator also pushed back on a recent controversy concerning ALEC. The organization is tied to support for \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, which give citizens a relatively broad right to use lethal force to defend themselves in situations where they feel their life is threatened. The shooting death of Martin, a 17-year-old African American in Florida, sparked national scrutiny of such laws.\n\nCruz slammed critics of ALEC, singling out Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, who was a vocal opponent of the group this summer.\n\n\u201cMy advice to ALEC is very, very simple,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cStand. Your. Ground.\u201d\n\nThe tea party-favorite seemed to relish his status as a lightning rod during a high-energy, passionate speech that was often punctuated by applause. He struck a populist note as he named the \u201closers\u201d in the Obama era, singling out several demographics that have been key supporters of Democrats along with small businesses that he said have suffered under \u201cjob-killing regulations\u201d and new taxes.\n\n\u201cIf you were flying a private jet five years ago, you\u2019re still flying a private jet,\u201d he said. The \u201closers,\u201d Cruz continued, are \u201cYoung people, they\u2019re Hispanics, they\u2019re African Americans, they\u2019re single moms.\u201d\n\nCruz said the solutions to many of today\u2019s policy problems lie in part with grassroots efforts.\n\n\u201cIf you look at my brief and very quiet tenure in the Senate, on issue after issue, the American people rising up made a difference,\u201d he said. He pointed to support for the drones-related filibuster by Sen. Rand Paul, a fellow Republican and potential presidential contender, as well as opposition to gun control measures and, of course, to Obamacare.\n\nCruz spent the bulk of his speech slamming the health care law, warning that there are many more \u201cshoes to drop\u201d beyond the troubled website.\n\n\u201cThe website\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s still a disaster. But eventually they\u2019re going to get it right. I mean, it was a demonstration of manifest incompetence, but eventually they will get the website right,\u201d he said, charging that \u201cthe media\u201d is eager to write that story. \u201cThe problem with Obamacare was never the silly website.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, the law is \u201cabsolutely destroying\u201d the health care system. He predicted that, going forward, Americans will lose access to the doctors of their choice, see increases in their premiums, and that ultimately many will lose their insurance.\n\n\u201cThe most reasonable, pragmatic, middle-of-the-road, common-sense thing to do is to acknowledge it\u2019s not working and start over,\u201d Cruz said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Texas senator says people now understand his fight against Obamacare.", "title": "Cruz claims shutdown vindication", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/ted-cruz-government-shutdown-100740.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/25/131023_ted_cruz_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (1139),Government Shutdown (854),Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Texas senator says people now understand his fight against Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ecc\"", "article_summary": "Cruz says Obamacare is 'absolutely destroying' the health care system.\nCruz spent the bulk of his speech slamming the health care law, warning that there are many more \u201cshoes to drop\u201d beyond the troubled website.\nHe drew rounds of laughter when he referenced several of television host Jay Leno\u2019s jokes about the health care law, changing tones to impersonate the TV host.\nCruz claims shutdown vindicationTexas Sen.
