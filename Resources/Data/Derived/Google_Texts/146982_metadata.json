Legislators return to Raleigh on Monday to start budget negotiations between the House and Senate.\n\nCurrently, it would take a city or town board to end the special tax districts through a majority vote in open session. Now that power may switch hands, if the measure passes.\n\nIn some areas of the state, the service district tax is used to raise money for downtown development. In Greensboro, where the proposal is coming from, the money is used to improve historic neighborhoods.\n\nIn Carteret County, the oceanfront and non-oceanfront special district taxes along Bogue Banks raise money for costly future beach nourishment projects.\n\nThe problem is that with the general absence of state and federal money for beach nourishment these days, Carteret County and Bogue Banks town officials have come to rely almost completely on local money for multi-million projects they feel are essential to maintaining the tourism industry that has come to drive the local economy.\n\nGregory \u201cRudi\u201d Rudolph, County Shore Protection Manager, said the legislation didn\u2019t take him completely by surprise, but quickly commanded his attention once it became a potential reality.\n\n\u201cOur antennae are certainly up,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Joe Biden once said, this is a big, uh, deal,\u201d referring to the vice presidents comment on the signing into law of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe potential change could be considered unfair to owners of second homes along the beach, many of whom are unable to vote in a Bogue Banks district, since their primary home is located elsewhere. They would not be able to vote in referenda under the proposal from Sen. Trudy Wade, R-Greensboro, even though they pay those taxes here, too.\n\n\u201cThese second-home owners have always felt to some degree that they are not sufficiently represented in the beach towns, and this would just add to that,\u201d Mr. Rudolph said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all struggled with that at times.\u201d\n\nBrian Kramer, town manager of Pine Knoll Shores, informed the town board of commissioners of the Senate proposal at the regular board meeting Wednesday at town hall.\n\nMr. Kramer said the N.C. League of Municipalities is in the process of contacting the General Assembly to address the issue, but he recommended the town\u2019s mayor, Ken Jones, contact the state legislature, as well.\n\nMr. Jones told the News-Times Friday that he\u2019s been in touch with the General Assembly on the Senate bill, in particular, Sen. Norm Sanderson, R-Pamlico, who also represents Carteret and Craven counties.\n\nMr. Jones believes part of the problem is how the proposal was made and why.\n\n\u201cThis was introduced in the budget bill by a senator from Greensboro,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they should have done a local bill. (S)he\u2019s doing something to fix something locally that isn\u2019t statewide. They (the legislature) do things like this and don\u2019t understand the impact statewide.\u201d\n\nCommissioner John Brodman said at the Wednesday meeting because this is the first draft of the bill, he expects to see significant alterations to it before it becomes law.\n\nThe Bogue Banks special tax districts are an essential part of beach nourishment plans for the present and the future.\n\nThey are included in the county\u2019s master plan developed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 concerning beach nourishment projects over the next 50 years.\n\n\u201cWhat the plan shows is that we\u2019ll get anywhere from 66 to 75 percent of our money for projects from the county\u2019s occupancy tax, and anywhere from 25 to 33 percent from these special tax districts,\u201d Mr. Rudolph said. \u201cThe exact numbers vary, depending upon the needs at the time, but those (25 and 33) are very high percentages to lose.\n\n\u201cThen you factor in that everyone likes that plan and knows that it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Mr. Rudolph said. \u201cThere is a lot of work that has gone into this to get it to the point where everyone is comfortable with it. It\u2019s frustrating to see this included in something that should have been specific to Greensboro.\u201d\n\nAlthough homeowners here once pushed back against the special district taxes, the concept has become more accepted over the years, according to Mr. Rudolph.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it historically, back in the beginning, in the 2001 to 2003 time period, when the countywide referendum for beach nourishment funds failed and the towns did their own districts with a \u2018sand tax,\u2019 the numbers were high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what they were, but in Emerald Isle, Pine Knoll Shores and Indian Beach, I think they were in the range of 45 to 48 cents per $100 valuation along the oceanfront.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-2000s though, there was a countywide property revaluation that dramatically hiked property values, so to remain revenue-neutral, or as close to it as possible, the towns dropped those rates, Mr. Rudolph said, to somewhere around 15 or 16 cents per $100.\n\nEventually, the rates dropped even more, to 3 cents or even lower in some cases, in some of the districts.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is, we found rates that work and that don\u2019t put too much of a burden on anyone, and people understand how it works and how important it is,\u201d Mr. Rudolph said. \u201cThen we get this, possibly.\u201d\n\nSince Indian Beach and Pine Knoll shores have two special tax districts \u2013 one for oceanfront property owners and one for non-oceanfront owners who still benefit from beach nourishment but pay lower tax rates \u2013 each of those districts would have its own referendum.\n\nThat means that in towns that already have very small populations, a tiny number of people would be able to change policy that affects the economic vitality of those towns.\n\nMr. Rudolph said the county is already working with Sen. Sanderson and state Rep. Pat McElraft, an Emerald Isle resident who represents Carteret and Jones counties, to fight the proposed change and is hopeful that they and others will be able to work out a favorable outcome.\n\nEmerald Isle Manager Frank Rush said Friday that the town had two special tax districts for about a decade but eliminated one of them a couple of years ago.\n\nNow, the one district taxes oceanfront property owners and a few property owners adjacent to Bogue Inlet at a rate of 4 cents per $100 of assessed value.\n\nIt\u2019s expected to raise about $270,000 this year, Mr. Rush said, which is more than one-third of the roughly $700,000 the town needs to set aside to pay for beach nourishment projects it expects to be necessary.\n\nMost of the rest comes from the general fund, which is mostly generated by the town\u2019s property tax rate, which is 15.5 cents per $100 of valuation.\n\n\u201cIf we were to lose that (special tax district) revenue, we\u2019d have to make it up somewhere else,\u201d Mr. Rush said, and the most likely place would be an increase in the property tax rate for all property owners. That would most likely be a 1-cent hike, since, coincidentally, a penny of property tax generates about $270,000 this year.\n\nMr. Rush said he\u2019s hoping that the proposed change won\u2019t get through the General Assembly and has already been in touch with Rep. McElraft.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a strong supporter of beach nourishment and understands how important this is to us,\u201d Mr. Rush said.\n\nHe\u2019s also hoping for some help from Sen. Sanderson, although as of Friday he had not been in direct contact with him.\n\n\u201cI understand that this was mostly intended as a measure for Greensboro, and maybe she (the Senator) didn\u2019t understand the implications this would have for the beach towns,\u201d Mr. Rush said. \u201cBut any time something like this comes up formally, either as legislation or as a part of the budget, it\u2019s very concerning, and you have to take it seriously. We\u2019re of course very much opposed to it.\u201d\n\nThe beach nourishment money is important not only for the obvious reason \u2013 paying for nourishment \u2013 but also because it figures prominently in two other programs the town counts upon heavily, Mr. Rush said.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the town\u2019s beach monitoring and maintenance plan, which is necessary in order to ensure the town can get money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay for sand lost during hurricanes. Emerald Isle has used that source of money several times, including to pay for sand to be placed on the beach after hurricanes Irene and Isabel. To participate in that program, a town must have a plan, and it must be able to show that there are reliable funds available for that plan.\n\nSecond, Mr. Rush said, the town must show the state that it has a solidly funded beach nourishment plan in order to get what\u2019s called a \u201cstatic line exception\u201d from the state Division of Coastal Management.\n\nNormally, for the purposes of determining how far a structure must be set back from the ocean, the state measures from the first line of stable vegetation.\n\nBecause Emerald Isle\u2019s beaches have been successfully and repeatedly nourished, that line is seaward of the old frontal dunes, where the first line of vegetation is found.\n\nIf the town couldn\u2019t show it had a solidly funded nourishment plan, it might lose that \u201cexception,\u201d and the setback would have to be measured from landward of the current line.\n\nThat would almost surely make some oceanfront houses on the eastern, more erosion-prone end of town nonconforming, which means they could not be built back if damaged beyond 50 percent of their values.\n\nAll-in-all, Mr. Rush said, the tax district is a key part of the town\u2019s short and long-term plans to keep a healthy beach and a healthy economy.\n\nAtlantic Beach Mayor Trace Cooper, who is chairman of the county\u2019s beach commission that oversees nourishment projects, was contacted for comment, but could not be reached by presstime.\n\nAnna Harvey contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "PINE KNOLL SHORES \u2014 The future of a special district tax to nourish Bogue Banks\u2019 beaches \u2013 a tourism mainstay \u2013 may be in jeopardy under a Senate budget proposal.", "title": "Sand tax alarm goes off", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_306f3f44-280a-11e5-9ffc-bf2860a3809f.html", "image": {"width": 337, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a5/7a5934f2-280a-11e5-aa70-e371f65494c4/55a17bf9e6336.image.jpg?resize=337%2C432", "height": 432}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "PINE KNOLL SHORES \u2014 The future of a special district tax to nourish Bogue Banks\u2019 beaches \u2013 a tourism mainstay \u2013 may be in jeopardy under a Senate budget proposal.", "keywords": "beach nourishment,sand tax,special districts,taxes,ballot referendum,news_times,news,editors_pick,featured", "news_keywords": "beach nourishment,sand tax,special districts,taxes,ballot referendum,news_times,news,editors_pick,featured"}, "article_summary": "That would most likely be a 1-cent hike, since, coincidentally, a penny of property tax generates about $270,000 this year.\nThe Bogue Banks special tax districts are an essential part of beach nourishment plans for the present and the future.\nMost of the rest comes from the general fund, which is mostly generated by the town\u2019s property tax rate, which is 15.5 cents per $100 of valuation.\nRush said, and the most likely place would be an increase in the property tax rate for all property owners.\nCurrently, it would take a city or town board to end the special tax districts through a majority vote in open session."}
