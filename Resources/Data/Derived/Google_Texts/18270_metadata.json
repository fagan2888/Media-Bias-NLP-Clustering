Minimum bids for the home were set at $250,000. US marshals are now working out the details for the next auction, while warning that the property could contain landmines or other hidden explosives.\n\nEd Brown retreated to the home in January 2007, after a judge convicted him and his wife of hiding $1.9m in income from 1996 to 2003. Elaine Brown joined her husband in the standoff in April 2007, after the couple were ordered to serve a 63-month sentence. In October 2007, the Browns were arrested without incident.\n\nIn 1997, Brown told the Internal Revenue Service he would not pay taxes until the agency could prove it was a legal practice. Courts rejected his argument that collecting taxes was illegal.\n\nIn 1994, Brown told the New Hampshire Sunday News he believed in a wide-ranging conspiracy, involving politicians including Bill Clinton, George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, to \u201cdeprive Americans of their liberty\u201d. He predicted a violent \u201crevolution\u201d in the US.\n\nThe couple, armed with assault rifles and pipe bombs, entertained like-minded visitors during the standoff and even held a picnic, which ultimately led to their arrest.\n\nUndercover US marshals, pretending that they were supporters delivering goods from Elaine Brown\u2019s dental practice, were invited into the house. Ed Brown initially kept an assault rifle trained on the marshals as they unloaded items, but lowered the weapon once he became comfortable, according to court documents. The group shared beer and pizza before additional marshals were called in to make the arrest.\n\nFollowing the couple\u2019s arrest, a court said the property was host to \u201ca vast supply of explosives, firearms, and ammunition, including rifles, armor piercing bullets, pipe bombs, and bombs nailed to trees\u201d.\n\nIf the house is sold, proceeds will go to the municipalities of Plainfield and Lebanon, which are owed part of the unpaid taxes. In January 2012, the US first circuit court of appeals rejected an appeal by the Browns.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "US marshals try again to sell house of man who claimed tax was illegal after minimum price of $250,000 failed to attract bidders in August", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "US marshals try again to sell house of man who claimed tax was illegal after minimum price of $250,000 failed to attract bidders in August", "title": "For sale: hilltop New Hampshire home, fine views, possibly booby-trapped", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/29/for-sale-new-hampshire-home-booby-trapped", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408127757237/d9e8afc9-2403-43f1-8ca0-8f1dcbee274f-620x372.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=28313f6dc2f43b57441880b0182621d1", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@guardian", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/29/for-sale-new-hampshire-home-booby-trapped?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/29/for-sale-new-hampshire-home-booby-trapped", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/29/for-sale-new-hampshire-home-booby-trapped?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408127757237/d9e8afc9-2403-43f1-8ca0-8f1dcbee274f-620x372.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@holpuch"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/29/for-sale-new-hampshire-home-booby-trapped?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "New Hampshire,US crime,US taxation,US news,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-29T17:48:52.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T17:48:52.000Z", "tag": "New Hampshire,US crime,US taxation,US news,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/15/1408127757237/d9e8afc9-2403-43f1-8ca0-8f1dcbee274f-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0e7376871ec13875726f295798609295", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "New Hampshire,US crime,US taxation,US news,World news"}, "article_summary": "Undercover US marshals, pretending that they were supporters delivering goods from Elaine Brown\u2019s dental practice, were invited into the house.\nElaine Brown joined her husband in the standoff in April 2007, after the couple were ordered to serve a 63-month sentence.\nFederal officials expect to hold a second auction to sell a secluded hilltop home in New Hampshire that has failed to attract bidders \u2013 and possibly contains hidden explosives.\nIn January 2012, the US first circuit court of appeals rejected an appeal by the Browns.\nIf the house is sold, proceeds will go to the municipalities of Plainfield and Lebanon, which are owed part of the unpaid taxes."}
