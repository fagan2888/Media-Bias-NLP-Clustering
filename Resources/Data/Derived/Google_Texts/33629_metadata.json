And the big topic will be \u2014 are you ready for it? \u2014 the Affordable Care Act. Can you hardly wait? I know I can\u2019t.\n\nAny fresh opportunity to talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare is like dipping into a warm bath. Toss in a breathtaking view and the smell of fresh-cut grass and \u2014 pinch me.\n\nBut didn\u2019t we just do this not long ago? With two Supreme Court rulings in favor of the ACA and five years of entrenchment, can there really be anything more to say? You bet. In fact, you can say that only 30 percent of enrollees in Obamacare are satisfied, according to a recent survey by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.\n\nAnd Donald Trump had this to say to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash: \u201cRepeal and replace with something terrific.\u201d Well, that\u2019s helpful. Because all along we\u2019ve wondered what Republicans would replace the ACA with, exactly.\n\nThis was quintessential Trump \u2014 and is the secret to his success. He\u2019ll do GREAT things, TERRIFIC things! Everybody LOVES him. Because he\u2019s the GREATEST!\n\nHe says such things so often with such certitude that people begin to believe him \u2014 because it just feels so GREAT to be so POSITIVE and, yes, yes, yes! We\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having.\n\nBut is the United States ready to take him seriously? If some have found his can-do attitude contagious, others may be awaiting further policy illumination during Thursday night\u2019s debate. Don\u2019t count on it. It seems highly unlikely that Trump has binders full of policies. Even better, he has people. He has fellow billionaire and business magnate Carl Icahn, for instance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say \u2018Carl, congratulations, handle China.\u2019 I\u2019d get other guys like Carl. I\u2019d say, \u2018Good luck, here\u2019s Japan.\u2019 Believe me, we will do so well. We will make so much.\u201d\n\nTerrific!\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet whom he\u2019d tap to \u201chandle\u201d Obamacare, but for a man consistently focused on extracting the United States from its $18.6 trillion debt , returning the nation\u2019s health care to a competitive, free market model is on his To-Do list. As well as of every single Republican candidate.\n\nCutting the debt means cutting spending, which brings us back to the ACA, which, despite its goal of reducing costs, hasn\u2019t. In fact, costs are rising faster than inflation, thanks in part to a large, aging population \u2014 and the simple fact that more is being done. Meanwhile, rates, which President Obama promised would decrease by $2,500 per year, are poised to spike for some insurance plans by as much as 20 percent to 40 percent in 2016. It turns out that people were sicker than anticipated.\n\nBut is repeal-and-replace really an option? The disruption across the board would be significant, says Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, chief executive and president of the Cleveland Clinic. Cosgrove will join me Wednesday in Cleveland for The Post\u2019s pre-debate panel about the ACA in 2016, which I\u2019m moderating. Other panelists are Michael Carvin, the attorney who argued both challenges to the ACA before the U.S. Supreme Court, and lawyer and Republican political consultant Benjamin Ginsberg. The program, including two other panels, will be live-streamed on The Post Web site beginning at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nAlthough Cosgrove has adapted his clinic to the ACA and cites overall improvements in terms of health care, his diagnosis and prognosis doesn\u2019t make one race to peal the bells. Health care\u2019s total bill will continue to rise, he predicts, and there are only two ways to control cost: Efficiency of care, which has been a major thrust of the ACA; and a decrease in the incidence of chronic disease such as cancer, diabetes and obesity.\n\nBut prevention requires behavior modification on a massive scale, doesn\u2019t it? Yes, says Cosgrove, and \u201cthe private sector will have to lead the way by pushing people into wellness.\u201d His clinic, for example, doesn\u2019t hire smokers, which has had an influence on the community, where smoking has decreased.\n\nThere may be other confounding factors that led to this decrease, but you get his point. We\u2019re talking about living healthier lives to avoid disease so that our health care and insurance costs will go down or at least stabilize. This sounds rational but not quick. And it doesn\u2019t consider the confounding-est factor of all \u2014 human beings.\n\nSince people seem unable to resist deliciousness, how do you get them to eat healthier \u2014 and less? Tune in for answers.\n\nI\u2019ll be terrific.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thursday\u2019s first Republican debate showdown puts the Affordable Care Act in the spotlight.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Thursday\u2019s first Republican debate showdown puts the Affordable Care Act in the spotlight.", "title": "How will the GOP candidates tackle Obamacare on the debate stage?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/positively-crackling-with-pre-debate-excitement/2015/08/04/91b217d2-3ae2-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/04/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump_Charity-01a66.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/positively-crackling-with-pre-debate-excitement/2015/08/04/91b217d2-3ae2-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, gop debate, affordable care act, obamacare, donald trump, carl icahn, 2016 presidential campaign, republican presidential debate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "91b217d2-3ae2-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, gop debate, affordable care act, obamacare, donald trump, carl icahn, 2016 presidential campaign, republican presidential debate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd53\"", "article_summary": "He says such things so often with such certitude that people begin to believe him \u2014 because it just feels so GREAT to be so POSITIVE and, yes, yes, yes!\nWe\u2019re talking about living healthier lives to avoid disease so that our health care and insurance costs will go down or at least stabilize.\nAny fresh opportunity to talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare is like dipping into a warm bath.\nAnd Donald Trump had this to say to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash: \u201cRepeal and replace with something terrific.\u201d Well, that\u2019s helpful.\nNo doubt you have butterflies just thinking about Thursday\u2019s first GOP debate."}
