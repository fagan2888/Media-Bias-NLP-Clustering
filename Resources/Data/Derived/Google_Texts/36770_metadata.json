The overnight low is expected to be near 28.\n\nThe forecast on Christmas Day calls for partly sunny skies with a high of 41 and winds 5 to 10 mph with gusts as high as 16 mph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut by mid-afternoon, snow is expected to begin falling, with the weather service calling for a 90 percent chance of snow with 4 to 8 inches of accumulation expected.\n\nLocal meteorologist Matt Kelsch said the cold front could make driving tricky on Christmas night along the Front Range.\n\n\"With falling temperatures and the possibility of some brief moderate to heavy snowfall rates, road conditions may deteriorate rapidly near or after nightfall on Christmas,\" Kelsch wrote in an email. \"Accumulation should be lighter out on the high plains, but blowing snow will likely be a hazard there. To the west, winter travel conditions are likely to develop on Christmas Day, especially at the passes.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service has also issued a winter storm watch for Boulder County from 6 p.m. Thursday to 8 a.m. Friday.\n\nTemperatures are expected to plummet on Friday as the snowfall continues, with the forecast calling for cloudy skies with a high of 22 and a 60 percent chance of snow before noon.
