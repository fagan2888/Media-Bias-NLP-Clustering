However, I had no choice. Mr. Obama has taken bullying to a whole new level not seen since, maybe, Hugo Chavez (another liberal darling).\n\nThe protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, are waiting their place in line, hoping to get next week\u2019s award, but in the mean time, the unmitigated gall shown this week by Mr. Obama is nothing short of terrifying.\n\nOn Nov. 20, 2014 - Mexican Revolution Day (coincidence?), Mr. Obama made promises that he has no legal authority to keep; granting amnesty for more than 5 million \u201canchor baby parents\u201d and illegal immigrant children.\n\nAs someone who is a supposed to be a constitutional scholar, Mr. Obama has conveniently forgotten about that pesky Separation of Powers thingy written very clearly in U.S. Constitution. I expect that from some Third World country, maybe a dictator or a king. But not in United States of America! Not now, not ever! This is a very bad precedent, and one even Democrats will regret.\n\nLet\u2019s say it\u2019s 2016. It\u2019s a cold, wintry January morning. Newly elected President Dick Cheney rides into office on a wave of anti-Obama sentiments, just like what happened in this year\u2019s midterms. President Cheney has an agenda he wants to push through, but has neither the votes nor the authority he needs to do what he wants right away \u2014 repeal Obamacare, gut Common Core and build a big ol\u2019 uncrossable fence at the border. Hmmm, what to do, what to do? Follow the lesson learned from President \u201cBully\u201d Obama? Stroke of the pen, law of the land!\n\nWhy not? Congress can be a real pain. It takes time for the representatives of the people to do things. Why not just get rid of Congress and let President Cheney do whatever is he thinks is best for the country, his power and his party?\n\nHollywood elites agree with this weeks Bully. In 2010 Woody Allen said, \u201cIt would be good \u2026 if he [Obama] could be dictator for a few years because he could do a lot of good things quickly.\u201d Earlier this year, actress Gwyneth Paltrow said, \u201cIt would be wonderful if we were able to give this man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass.\u201d\n\nIf Woody Allen and Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s pal get to have those kinds of powers, why not President Dick Cheney or President Rand Paul or President Scott Walker or President Rick Perry, etc.?\n\nMegyn Kelly, host of \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d on Fox News, interviewed a gleeful Geraldo Rivera, who said in a stereotypical, hypocritical response, \u201cI don\u2019t care what Obama said before \u2026 The Republicans had it coming.\u201d Another example of the left embracing the \u201cjustifying of the means.\u201d\n\nThe president may be losing far more political capital than he thinks. Just hours after his speech on Thursday, I attended an early screening of the new blockbuster \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.\u201d (It\u2019s very good by the way.) Ironically, much of the film centers on an out-of-control president who stops at nothing to keep power and inflict his will on everyone. Before the preview began, a PSA ran featuring a number of Hollywood types. Near the end of the spot, Vice President Joe Biden speaks, and the sold-out crowd immediately roared with laughter, (not the intended response, I promise you). A few moments later Mr. Obama appeared and the audience exploded in boos and jeers. Anecdotal, sure, but the president has a far more difficult task ahead of him if this trend continues.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions are very dangerous and the \u201cBully from The Bully Pulpit\u201d is ramming down laws he has no power to create while stealing authority from Congress, all with the intent to increase the power for himself and his party \u2014 and at the expense of the American people and the Constitution he swore to defend.\n\nAs we have learned from the past, when it comes to promises of border security, Democrats always \u2014 let me be clear, always \u2014 willfully drop the ball and endanger our safety, security and jobs. We must not fall for the lie again.\n\nEvery American, no matter party affiliations, should be against this amnesty move. Even if you agree with amnesty, this is not the way to do it.\n\nSo, for your lawless behavior, intentional lying to the American people and all-around dangerous, aggressive behavior toward Congress and the U.S. Constitution, President Barack Hussein Obama, you (once again), are the Liberal Bully of the Week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To quote the band Styx from the classic 1977 song \"Come Sail Away\": \"I tried ...
