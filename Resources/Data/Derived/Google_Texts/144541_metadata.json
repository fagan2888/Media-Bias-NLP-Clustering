Andrew Kelly for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBillionaire Leon G. Cooperman, chairman and chief executive of Omega Advisors, a New York hedge fund, has committed $25 million to St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. N.J.\n\nThe gift, timed to the hospital\u2019s 150th anniversary in 2015, will fund a 200,000-square-foot pavilion for patient care, which will include a neonatal intensive care unit. Mr. Cooperman formerly served as chairman of the hospital\u2019s foundation.\n\nThe gift follows several Mr. Cooperman and his wife, Toby, have made in recent years, including a gift of $25 million in 2012 to Columbia Business School, his alma mater, to fund buildings at the school\u2019s new Manhattanville Campus in West Harlem.\n\nAnother $25 million was given in 2013 to Hunter College, part of the City University of New York. The couple attended Hunter College and became sweethearts while students. The gift, that college\u2019s largest, is to benefit the school\u2019s library and to fund scholarships.\n\nThe couple\u2019s family foundation, based in Clifton, N.J., has assets of roughly $200 million.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. and Mrs. Cooperman joined the Giving Pledge, a public commitment started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in which billionaires agree to dedicate the majority of their wealth to charity.\n\nIn an interview last August in advance of the gift to Hunter College, Mr. Cooperman, who grew up in the Bronx and is the son of a plumber, denied that he was on a \u201cgiving spree\u201d with his philanthropy.\n\n\u201cI intend to give away more than I make and reduce my wealth,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe trouble is that there are more worthwhile organizations than I have money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Billionaire Leon G.
