Islamic State sympathizers appear to have hacked another government website, this time the website for a Virginia county.

Officials in Isle of Wight — population 35,000 — say the county’s website was hacked Friday night by a group calling itself Team System DZ, a local NBC affiliate reported.

The message “I love ISIS” was posted at the top of the website and pro-Islamic State messages and a video of profanity took up the rest of the web page, the station reported.

“They’ve hacked into some of the best computers in the world,” the county’s information resource manager, Don Robertson, told the station. “So … while we are certainly disappointed, we are going to take every step that we can to clean it up and make sure the public is not impacted by it.” He added that the website, which he said is run by a third party, has been targeted by hackers in the past.

The hack is reminiscent of this week’s defacement of the U.S. Central Command’s Twitter and Youtube accounts. A group calling themselves the “Cyber Caliphate” posted “I love ISIS” banners on the accounts and sent out false tweets just as President Obama was giving a speech on cyber security on Monday.

Following the hack CENTCOM had to change the passwords for 50 of its social media accounts. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the hack a “violation” but added it “wasn’t a big deal.”
