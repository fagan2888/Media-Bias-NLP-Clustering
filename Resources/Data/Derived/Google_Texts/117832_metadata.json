Racing fans could find all those things Saturday at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Blue Cross Blue Shield set up shop at the NASCAR race to tell people about how health care laws are changing, and find new customers in the process.\n\nJust past a booth selling Ole Smoky Tennessee Moonshine, the smells of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Bojangles\u2019 fried chicken mix together right before you come across North Carolina\u2019s largest health insurance company.\n\nWelcome to the Bank of America 500.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to start it up - Health Care 500 going down here in just a few short seconds,\u201d a Blue Cross Blue Shield DJ said. The Health Care 500 is what the company called the game show it hosted area where fans hung out before the race.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be denied health insurance due to a preexisting medical condition,\u201d the DJ said once the game started. \u201cIs that A: true or B: false?\u201d\n\nOK, it wasn\u2019t the most exciting game at the speedway. But people played to get free swag and win a chance to meet NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson at a later race. A recorded message from Johnson greeted them.\n\n\u201cThis is an important time for all of us,\u201d Johnson said in the message. \u201cHealth care is changing and it will be different for everyone.\u201d\n\nNext year most Americans will be required to get health insurance or pay a penalty. And this month, online marketplaces opened up where you can shop for coverage.\n\nBoth changes are part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. And both create an opportunity for insurance companies to find new customers.\n\n\u201cWell, you think about NASCAR racing \u2013 all walks of life, everything from corporate executives to everyday Americans really enjoy auto racing, and so we kind of look at, this is a pretty broad demographic mix for us,\u201d said Michael Parkerson, vice president of marketing for Blue Cross.\n\nParkerson said his company will set up at other sports events too, like Panthers and Bobcats games.\n\nAt the speedway, Blue Cross estimated about 200 people got insurance quotes. One of them was Toni Noles.\n\n\u201cEveryone has to get insurance right now, and what better place to do it than at the racetrack where you\u2019re having fun, and everybody\u2019s calm, and you\u2019re not going to reach across the table and slap somebody for giving you an outrageous estimate,\u201d Noles said with a laugh.\n\nShe\u2019s been on Medicaid and may still qualify for it, but she wants to check her options. She was with her fianc\u00e9e, who drank a beer as an agent walked them through the process.\n\nThe agent pulled up a mid-level plan that would cost Noles $40.93 a month.\n\n\u201cThat includes a possible subsidy of $271,\u201d the agent said. The subsidy is based on Noles\u2019 low income.\n\nThe result is a plan Noles said she can afford.\n\n\"Cool deal - $40.93, that\u2019s not bad at all,\u201d she said.\n\nNoles traded contact information with the agent and said she\u2019ll get back in touch about buying a plan. First, she had a race to watch.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "Fast cars, greasy food, cold beer and a health insurance quote.
