By showing the autocomplete suggestions generated after typing \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t,\u201d \u201cwomen need to,\u201d and so on, the results seem to reveal a ghastly sexism in our collective consciousness. When the top autocomplete suggestion for \u201cwomen need to\u201d is \u201cwomen need to be put in their place,\u201d it\u2019s hard to deny that women have it tougher than men, whose top autocomplete suggestion is the comparatively innocuous \u201cmen need to feel needed.\u201d\n\nDavid Auerbach David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York, and a fellow at New America.\n\n\n\nIt is a brilliant campaign, one that makes use of the hive-mind nature of Internet discourse to make a case that sexism, latent and otherwise, isn\u2019t a thing of the past. Yet the complicated algorithms of autocomplete\u2014whose results not even Google can predict with full certainty\u2014point out a subtler issue that deserves some thought: Google can easily treat a link or a quote as an endorsement.\n\nMake no mistake, I don\u2019t have a problem with the ad campaign, which makes a striking case for a very significant issue. But the cause of equal rights will be served even better with a deeper understanding of the algorithmic forces at work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor starters, Google no longer returns many of the autocomplete results in the ads. There are a number of factors involved here. Autocomplete constantly changes as a result of the volatility of the Web and based on how people use autocomplete itself. And Google removes some hot-button suggestions. (Disclosure: I used to work for Google, though not on autocomplete.) Top autocompletion results like \u201cJews are not white/rude/smart/awesome\u201d and \u201cMuslims are coming/the worst/exempt from Obamacare/not terrorists\u201d suggest that some vastly more offensive notions have been removed. Indeed, Google\u2019s policies state that they will remove hate speech completions, among others. Google steadfastly refuses to autocomplete even the final letters of \u201cMuslims are terroris\u201d\u2014autocomplete has been tweaked to never complete that phrase, albeit only on google.com and google.co.uk (google.fr and google.com.eg, for two, complete it immediately). Other prevailing bigotries, which I won\u2019t repeat here, also fail to complete.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding human language, computers are still pretty stupid.\n\nFor some terms, autocomplete is turned off altogether. \u201cBisexuals are\u201d and \u201clesbians are\u201d have no autocomplete suggestions. On the other hand, there are suggestions for \u201cGays are bullies/the new blacks/wrong/born that way\u201d and other, more bigoted permutations, so the restrictions are somewhat piecemeal and arbitrary. My best guess here is that \u201cbisexuals\u201d and \u201clesbians\u201d don\u2019t autocomplete because they are terms more closely associated with porn than \u201cgays.\u201d (Most sexual terms don\u2019t autocomplete.) And as we saw above, different restrictions are applied on different international Google portals.\n\nIn contrast to a few weeks ago, Google now refuses to complete \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t have righ\u201d and \u201cwomen need to be put in their plac\u201d up to the final letter. So some of those autocomplete suggestions in UN Women\u2019s ads have now been quashed, presumably as a result of the ad campaign. In fact, the campaign may have forced Google\u2019s hand. After seeing the ads, countless people no doubt searched for the phrases in the ads and clicked on the sexist completions, setting up a nasty feedback loop that reinforced the popularity of the searches\u2014not what UN Women intended.\n\nWhile the autocomplete restrictions may imply that Google is masking just how bad things are, there are also causes for hope. The top search results for \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t have rights,\u201d if you type it in completely, are now dominated by pages about the ad campaign. The sheer volatility and self-modifying nature of the Web makes it difficult to pin down prevailing notions for any great length of time. Autocomplete and search results are very sensitive to so-called \u201cfreshness,\u201d\u2014all the better to pick up sudden trends\u2014so they use less long-term hysteresis (the dependency of a system on its past states) than you might think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf the top results that aren\u2019t about the UN Women ad campaign, not one of them unequivocally promotes an anti-woman position. Some are websites attacking the anti-woman positions, such as an atheist blog on Patheos that quotes and ridicules a Baptist preacher\u2019s misogynistic sermon at great length. Others are debate websites that tend to come down on the equal rights side. One is a Yahoo question, \u201cReasons why women shouldn\u2019t have equal rights?\u201d posted by a high school girl looking for anti-woman arguments for a school debate. (\u201cBeing a girl, I obviously don\u2019t agree with this.\u201d) Most of the respondents say they\u2019ve got nothing. The worst it gets is a troll-infested forum on bodybuilding.com, which, despite being described by poster KingOfChaos as \u201cheavily populated by males who like to think of themselves as 'alpha' or dominate over women,\u201d still has a number of sentiments such as \u201cIRL most sane ppl think that women should have equal rights.\u201d\n\nThe bodybuilding forum is more the exception than the rule, however. Consider \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d a phrase whose results have been less impacted by the ad campaign. The top result is a relentlessly dumb but reasonably civil article on ultraconservative Catholic website Fix the Family, which defensively gives the reasons why a woman going to college is a \u201cnear occasion of sin.\u201d Most of the rest of the results on the first page are devoted to quoting and ridiculing Fix the Family. (However, Emily Yoffe\u2019s controversial column about college women drinking shows up, too, if you don\u2019t put the search phrase in quotes.)\n\nThe No. 2 result is Lindy West\u2019s article in Jezebel critiquing the Fix the Family article. It is significant. First, let\u2019s put things in perspective. In terms of site popularity, Alexa ranks Fix the Family deep in the high 300,000s, a bit below independent academic publisher Prometheus Books and significantly below Web magazine the Public Domain Review. So this is not a well-known website. Jezebel, on the other hand, is ranked three orders of magnitude up at an enviable 527, right around Daily Kos (503) and approaching Salon (374), though still a ways behind Slate (229).\n\nBy quoting from and linking to Fix the Family, Jezebel vastly raised Fix the Family\u2019s Google profile. West\u2019s piece helped elevate \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t go to college\u201d far higher into the autocomplete results. Google\u2019s automated algorithms do not easily distinguish different motivations for putting text on a webpage, because when it comes to understanding human language, computers are stupid. If \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t go to college\u201d appears three times in a Jezebel article, regardless of the disapproving context, then that phrase will become more salient in Google\u2019s algorithms. Google does not distinguish an approving link from a disapproving link; it just sees that Jezebel has linked to Fix the Family. The link from an important site to an obscure site makes the obscure site more important, lifting it up in search results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere is a way to mitigate this effect: You can use the \u201crel=nofollow\u201d attribute in links, which tells search engines that the link should not have an effect on the link target\u2019s ranking. In other words, you don\u2019t want to pass your site\u2019s reputation onto the target. (Wikipedia and YouTube use nofollow on most outgoing links.)\n\nStill, Jezebel played a significant role in raising the autocomplete likelihood of \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t go to college\u201d\u2014possibly a greater role than Fix the Family itself. There is not a clear-cut answer here. While it\u2019s good to call out occasions of bigotry, it should be weighed against the danger of raising the profile of the bigots and their views.\n\nIn my best estimate, just in terms of gaming Google, Jezebel\u2019s West made the wrong call in quoting the Fix the Family site so extensively and devoting a whole article to it. The cost of raising their profile outweighed the benefits of exposing their troglodytic views. From a purely strategic point of view, it would have been better to write up a story concerning female empowerment rather than female subjugation.
