That\u2019s up from 15 percent a decade ago.\u201d\n\nFor this detail, Robert Reich is quoting an August 2015 Gallup finding in which 24 percent of Americans said they were concerned about not having enough hours or being furloughed by their employer.\n\nThe sharing economy is built around bypassing regulations like paying taxes, health codes, labour laws, worker rights, discrimination. \u2014 Liz England (@lizardengland) December 12, 2015\n\nSo what\u2019s the answer? Robert Reich believes that America should take a step away from the complicated criteria of whether employees are being \u201cmisclassified\u201d as independent contractors and instead \u201caim\u2026 for simplicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoever pays more than half of someone\u2019s income, or provides more than half their working hours should be responsible for all the labor protections and insurance an employee is entitled to,\u201d Reich says, adding that the country needs to back away from unemployment insurance and instead embrace \u201cincome insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, for example, your monthly income dips more than 50 percent below the average monthly income you\u2019ve received from all the jobs you\u2019ve taken over the preceding five years. With income insurance, you\u2019d automatically receive half the difference for up to a year.\u201d\n\nBut, is it practical? Especially with so many companies refusing to hire full-time staff based on their fears of government regulation? Is it, in other words, a genie that can be put back into the bottle, and what would it do for some people in the sharing economy who can earn much more than they ever could for a staff job in their area?\n\nNew sharing economy: Main competition for corporations won\u2019t be another business, it will be the workers themselves. https://t.co/ZUy08ZvvZ6 \u2014 Elizabeth Frisch (@elizabethfrisch) December 13, 2015\n\nCase in point, a friend who is an independent contractor makes around three times what he could get for doing the same work in a full-time capacity for a single company. According to him, it\u2019s because he has more time to work and more flexibility in the work that he decides to take on.\n\nGiven the robust nature of the sharing economy, he\u2019s also able to up his rates when he needs to and refuse certain work that would not be worth the time effort. This has led to a bigger return on his time, an explosion in his earning power, and security in how he manages multiple contracts.\n\nBut what do you think, readers? Is the sharing economy ultimately a good thing for Americans\u2019 income and stability, or is Robert Reich correct to call it into question?\n\n[Image via Robert Reich Facebook]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Reich, the political economist/commentator, professor, author, and former Secretary of Labor in President Bill Clinton's administration, has a doom-and", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Robert Reich, the political economist/commentator, professor, author, and former Secretary of Labor in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, has a doom-and", "title": "Robert Reich Says \u201cSharing Economy\u201d Will Be End Of U.S.: Does He Have A Point?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2630739/robert-reich-says-sharing-economy-will-be-end-of-u-s-does-he-have-a-point/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Reich-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T14:18:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-13T14:39:18+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Reich-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-12-13T14:18:51+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "independent contractors,robert reich,sharing economy,news analysis", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Reich-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Robert Reich, the political economist/commentator, professor, author, and former Secretary of Labor in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, has a doom-and"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Is the sharing economy ultimately a good thing for Americans\u2019 income and stability, or is Robert Reich correct to call it into question?\nThe \u201csharing economy\u201d will be the end for the nation if something doesn\u2019t happen to reverse course.\nRobert Reich, the political economist/commentator, professor, author, and former Secretary of Labor in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, has a doom-and-gloom message for America.\nThe sharing economy is built around bypassing regulations like paying taxes, health codes, labour laws, worker rights, discrimination.\nJust what is the sharing economy?"}
