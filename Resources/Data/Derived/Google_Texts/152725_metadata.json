His signature legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is a slow-motion train wreck. His poll numbers have tanked.\n\nNow, things have gotten so bad for Obama that former president Jimmy Carter has called President Obama incompetent in the family-friendly pages of Parade magazine.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done the best he could under the circumstances,\u201d Carter said of Obama in an interviewed published on Thursday. \u201cHis major accomplishment was Obamacare, and the implementation of it now is questionable at best.\u201d (RELATED: Jimmy Carter: America no longer has a functioning democracy)\n\nCarter presided over what was, until the current recession, the longest period of economic stagnation since the Great Depression. There was runaway inflation, high unemployment and an ongoing energy crisis. There was a hostage crisis in Iran involving the capture and imprisonment of 52 Americans for 444 days.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, Carter gave one of the least effective speeches any president in the history of the American presidency. The deeply unpopular \u201cCrisis of Confidence\u201d speech became widely known as Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise\u201d speech.\n\nCarter lost his 1980 reelection bid to Ronald Reagan by an electoral vote total of 489 to 49. He won only six states, along with the District of Columbia.\n\nThe 39th president\u2019s Parade interview touched on several subjects in addition to Obamacare including his grandson\u2019s role in a hidden camera video of Mitt Romney, the Middle East, the Trayvon Martin case and the recent tribulations of fellow Georgian Paula Deen.\n\nCarter\u2019s wife Rosalynn was also present at the interview and contributed to it.\n\nWhen asked \u201chow he hopes history will remember him,\u201d Carter joined the rest of America in preferring to skip over his presidency. \u201cI\u2019d like to be judged primarily by our work at the Carter Center for the last 32 years,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to exclude the White House. But in my more self-satisfied moments, I think about our unwavering promotion of peace and human rights.\u201d\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter and on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Owens", "description": "Things have gotten so bad for Obama that former president Jimmy Carter has called President Obama incompetent in the family-friendly pages of Parade magazine", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "It's been a disastrous couple of weeks for President Barack Obama.
