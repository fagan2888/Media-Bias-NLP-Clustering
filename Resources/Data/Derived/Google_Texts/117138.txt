Two reports issued Thursday shed new light on trends in job-based health insurance before the launch of Obamacare, and what happened to the ranks of the uninsured after that health-care reform law kicked into high gear.

The first report, by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, suggests the recession accelerated an ongoing trend of declines in the percentage of private-sector American workers who get health insurance through their employer.

The second study, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that there were 11 million newly insured adults who had received coverage as a result of Obamacare by last month.

But that report also noted that almost half of the remaining 30 million people without insurance were eligible for either Medicaid or tax credits to buy Obamacare plans, but still failed to get covered, for a number of reasons.

Kaiser's study underscores the difficulty Obamacare advocates have predicted they will face in getting remaining uninsured Americans to buy into the program.
