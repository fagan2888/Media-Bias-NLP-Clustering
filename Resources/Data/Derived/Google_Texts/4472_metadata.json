Rosh Hashanah starts a 10-day period of introspection & contemplation culminating in Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement. Rosh Hashanah is marked with a special rituals. Prior to the arrival of the day it is customary to send new years greetings to friends, to buy new clothing & to examine ones behavior. On Rosh Hashanah eve you eat apples dipped in honey signifying a sweet year. At Rosh Hashanah services the day is marked with a special liturgy in which we pray for the whole world. A highlight of the Rosh Hashanah service is the sounding of the Shofar a ram's horn which is meant to shock the listener into self-examination. For a few years now there\u2019s a LGBT inclusive prayer book for Rosh Hashanah & Yom Kippur. The contemporary text for Conservative congregations acknowledges LGBT relationships by making references to \"partners\", faltering faith, depression, loneliness & financial difficulties has been hailed as \"an extraordinary event\" by the Rabbinical Assembly the New York-based organization of Conservative rabbis that is behind its creation. Rabbi Jacob Luski of Congregation B'nai Israel states that the new prayer book brings a sensitivity to \"issues of the 21st century\" with its gender-neutral language & practical approach. \"Yom Kippur is a fast day, yet some of us have medical issues. There is a prayer for those unable to fast. There is a prayer for caregivers. It's a sensitivity we've always had, but here there is a prayer just for that. There is a prayer for remembering a hurtful parent during the Yizkor, or memorial service, on Yom Kippur.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "2x9xpZqCOoojKTePitOIGfaLcDnsxEnI0mV8-pPOtFs", "generator": "Blogger"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96e0\"", "article_summary": "L'shanah tovah (\"for a good year\") to all our LGBT Jewish Families especially to all our Jewish LGBT newlyweds!!\nFor a few years now there\u2019s a LGBT inclusive prayer book for Rosh Hashanah & Yom Kippur.\nA highlight of the Rosh Hashanah service is the sounding of the Shofar a ram's horn which is meant to shock the listener into self-examination.\nRosh Hashanah starts a 10-day period of introspection & contemplation culminating in Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement.\nOn Rosh Hashanah eve you eat apples dipped in honey signifying a sweet year."}
