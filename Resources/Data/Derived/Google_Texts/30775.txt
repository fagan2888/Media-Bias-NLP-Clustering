CNBC's John Harwood talks to Republican presidential candidates John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie about their position on Medicaid.

Of the two landmark health-policy achievements of Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, Medicaid has always been more vulnerable than Medicare to Republican attacks.

As a universal national program for retirees, Medicare enjoys broad support within both parties even though conservative icon Ronald Reagan fought its creation in the 1960s. As a joint federal-state program serving the poor — a Democratic-leaning constituency — Medicaid stands on narrower, shakier ground.

That's especially true in the 2016 Republican presidential race.
