A panel on the Republican National Committee (RNC) recommended Tuesday that the party’s 2016 national convention be held in Cleveland, Ohio, beating out Dallas, Texas for the nod.

The recommendation of the site selection committee will be presented to the full RNC when they meet in Chicago in early August. The recommendation remains contingent on successful contract negotiations and a final vote by RNC members.

“A Cleveland convention offers our party a great steppingstone to the White House in 2016, and I’m encouraged by the committee’s recommendation,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “The team from Cleveland has gone above and beyond the call of duty and I think they’re representative of a city eager to show the country all the fantastic things they have to offer.”
