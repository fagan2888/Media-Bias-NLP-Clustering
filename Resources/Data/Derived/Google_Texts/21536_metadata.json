The participants were in a movie, the \u201cMatrix Revolutions.\u201d Love being a human emotion was the subcontext.\n\n\u201cNo, it is a word,\u201d the character, Rama-Kandra, said to the leading character, Neo. \u201cWhat matters is the connection the word implies.\u201d\n\nIt might be a stretch to say Nuggets players love their new coach, Michael Malone, but through the first week of training camp it\u2019s fair to say they like what they have seen.\n\n\u201cI love Coach\u2019s energy,\u201d forward Darrell Arthur said. \u201cI love his knowledge about the game and how he approaches it.\u201d\n\nMalone\u2019s approach is personal.\n\nHis first Denver playbook after he was hired in June was not full of X\u2019s and O\u2019s. It was a manual on building relationships. So his first course of action upon taking over was meeting with as many players as he could get to, rather than doing it in phone conversations. He met with players in Denver. And in September he traveled to Italy to meet with Danilo Gallinari, who was playing with the Italian national team. Denver\u2019s players wanted to know about the new system, their role in it, and how their new boss was going to run things.\n\nMalone wanted to know about them, their lives, their likes and dislikes, their families and what in general makes them tick.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that we use in the coaching profession: The players don\u2019t care how much you know until they know how much you care,\u201d Malone said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little bit corny, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nMalone opened training camp in Colorado Springs last week to rave reviews from Nuggets players \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t conducted his first drill. Veteran forward Kenneth Faried has been most outspoken about how impressed he\u2019s been. And, as previous Nuggets coaches can attest, Faried is not an easy player to quickly get on your side.\n\nGallinari glowed about Malone taking the time to come see him in Italy.\n\n\u201cI really appreciated the fact that he came to Italy to spend three or four days with me,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cWe had a great time. He was able to see how I was practicing and working with the national team, and we were able to spend a lot of time together. And I think he put on some weight in those three or four days. We were going to lunch or dinner almost every day.\u201d\n\nMalone took over a team that became dysfunctional last season under coach Brian Shaw, who was fired in March. Melvin Hunt, as the interim head coach replacing Shaw, helped calm a tumultuous locker room with his positive outlook. Utah general manager Dennis Lindsey, a good friend of Hunt\u2019s, spoke generally about what he says players look for in a coach.\n\n\u201cWhat are the most common things an NBA player wants?\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cIt sounds pretty simple, but they want a head coach that will tell them the truth as soon as they know it. It may not necessarily be what they want to hear, but it\u2019s what they need to hear. And in a timely fashion. \u2026 I think the average NBA player wants to know that a coach will not put them in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nMalone, fired last year as Sacramento\u2019s head coach, said players will play hard if they know the head coach has their best interests in mind.\n\n\u201cIf you care about them as players, they are going to run through a wall for you,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIf they think you just care about them as an asset or a chip, they\u2019re not willing maybe to go above and beyond. I\u2019ve been lucky in my career as an assistant and as a head coach, to always have good relationships with players because I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m up front, and I do make it a point to get to know them as people first. That\u2019s helped me out throughout my career.\u201d\n\nAt no point was that better illustrated than when news got out that the Nuggets were hiring Malone. Sacramento center DeMarcus Cousins, who historically has been a difficult player for coaches to handle, tweeted, \u201cCan\u2019t hold a good man down for long.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s early in the relationship between coach and players, many Nuggets already agree.\n\n\u201cHis whole thing is defense and chemistry,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cHis approach to the game is amazing, it\u2019s kind of like (Brooklyn coach) Lionel Hollins \u2014 an old-school guy. He knows what he wants, knows what he\u2019s going to get and from what I heard he\u2019s going to keep people in line.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes each other. Everyone wants to be around each other. And that\u2019s a big key.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Malone goes to great lengths to know his Nuggets players", "title": "Michael Malone goes to great lengths to know his Nuggets players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/michael-malone-goes-to-great-lengths-to-know-his-nuggets-players/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003_045335_SP29BKNNUGGETS_AC28249x-459.jpg", "height": 1346}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003_045335_SP29BKNNUGGETS_AC28249x-459.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T16:54:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:53:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaafb\"", "article_summary": "Melvin Hunt, as the interim head coach replacing Shaw, helped calm a tumultuous locker room with his positive outlook.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little bit corny, but it\u2019s true.\u201dMalone opened training camp in Colorado Springs last week to rave reviews from Nuggets players \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t conducted his first drill.\n\u201cIt sounds pretty simple, but they want a head coach that will tell them the truth as soon as they know it.\n\u201cWhat are the most common things an NBA player wants?\u201d Lindsey said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that we use in the coaching profession: The players don\u2019t care how much you know until they know how much you care,\u201d Malone said."}
