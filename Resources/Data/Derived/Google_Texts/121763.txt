Saturday marked day three of the investigation into a decades-old cold case out of Port Charlotte.

Earlier this week, deputies pulled a car from a canal. The owner was reportedly missing for the last 26 years.

Neighbors gave a glimpse into what the street was like in 1986.

"I love mysteries, but not so close to home," said Port Charlotte resident Terry Bisbano.

Walking past the corner of the scene a little faster these days, Bisbano is on edge about the case on her street.

"It's overwhelming. You never know what goes on in your backyard," said Bisbano.

Crime scene tape still surrounds the canal on the corner of Rampart Boulevard and Navigator Road.

That is where the decomposing Corvette was pulled out of the water on Wednesday.

Investigators say it belonged to 26-year-old Terrance Beghin, who disappeared without a trace in 1986.

"I'm happy they found it to try and get some closure for the family," said Bisbano.

Day three of the investigation and a small team of forensic scientists were out sifting through piles of dirt hoping to find any clue to bring closure to the case and Beghin's family.

"These guys are professionals. They're digging through it, going through the muck," said resident Michael Slattery.

Twenty-six years ago, neighbors say the community looked nothing like it does now. They described it as dark, desolate â€“ a place people would go to hunt.

"No lights. Dark," described resident Lianne Gray. "They could drive straight into that canal and never know."

Preliminary reports from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office suggest something suspicious may have happened on Halloween night back in 1986.

Beghin was on his way to pick up a friend and never made it.

The mystery continues.

"Waiting to see what happens," said Slattery, "All they need is the bits and pieces, and they're gonna put the puzzle together."



Crews will be back at the scene on Monday.
