Murphy.\n\nWhat makes me a former sports figure? Well, I was an award-winning sports writer for seven years at two daily newspapers, including the Times-Union, and I was the last person to interview Bob Hayes, the only man to win a Super Bowl ring and a Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe camp also featured Dedrick Dodge, who won two Super Bowls in San Francisco and Denver. He talked to the athletes about the importance of getting an education because the average NFL career only lasts 3-4 years. And the odds favor a player being a school administrator than a professional athlete because there are 120 schools in the area and each school has a principal and two vice principals, totaling 360 administrators while there have only been a handful of NFL players to come out of the Polk County-Lakeland area, including 12-time NFL Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis.\n\nMurphy, a Jacksonville native who played receiver in Tampa under Tony Dungy, shared his story of overcoming his troubled past to warn the young athletes, who live in the inner city, of the cost of trying to fit in and joining a gang. He shared how he used to be part of a gang and once went to jail as a teenager before turning his life around to make good grades and become a junior college star before getting called to the NFL.\n\nLearn about Murphy's brush with death shortly after being drafted into the NFL, about a player who was one of America's Most Wanted and read the money tips I shared with the young athletes, including how long it takes an NFL player to go broke and Shaq's financial advice on this link to the full article on my blog, www.mytensense.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A handful of former sports figures, including myself, poured into the minds of aspiring young football players at a football and leadership camp on Saturday in Lakeland, hosted by former NFL receiver Frank D.
