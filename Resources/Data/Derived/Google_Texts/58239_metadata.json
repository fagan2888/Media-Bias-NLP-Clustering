The scale is meant to get companies to revaluate assets soon.\n\n\"Asset revaluation will increase firms' capacity,\" said Coordinating Minister for Economics Darmin Nasution, adding that bigger assets would lift their leverage.\n\nYustinus Prastowo, an analyst at Center for Indonesia Taxation Analysis, said the incentive would make it cheaper for firms to revaluate assets if they want to go public or issue debts.\n\n\"But to get corporates to do that, it needs more than just incentives. There need to be conducive conditions in the stock market,\" Prastowo said.\n\nThe tax office said having more companies revalue assets can boost tax collection. Indonesia expects tax revenue to be nearly $11 billion below its 2015 target.\n\nThe government is also encouraging the setting up of REITs by removing double taxation that may apply to such businesses.\n\nNasution said many Indonesians invest in REITs in Singapore, which in turn invest in Indonesian property assets.\n\nIndonesia currently has one small REIT, but the business area has not been developed.\n\nFinance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said the government will impose a single tax for REIT business, removing both dividend taxes and one on property sales.\n\n\"We hope to attract back to Indonesia the offshore money invested in REITs,\" Brodjonegoro.\n\nThe Financial Services Authority also said it would relax rules to open sharia bank branches to boost that sector.\n\n(Additional reporting by Cindy Silviana, Fransiska Nangoy and the Jakarta bureau; Editing by Richard Borsuk; Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday announced tax incentives aimed at getting co", "title": "Indonesia offers incentives to spur asset revaluations, REITs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/22/Indonesia-offers-incentives-spur-asset-revaluations-REITs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-economy-policy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/22/Indonesia-offers-incentives-spur-asset-revaluations-REITs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-economy-policy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday announced tax incentives aimed at getting co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcada\"", "article_summary": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday announced tax incentives aimed at getting companies to revalue their fixed assets and to create real estate investment trusts (REITs).\nThe tax office said having more companies revalue assets can boost tax collection.\nThe government is also encouraging the setting up of REITs by removing double taxation that may apply to such businesses.\n\"Asset revaluation will increase firms' capacity,\" said Coordinating Minister for Economics Darmin Nasution, adding that bigger assets would lift their leverage.\n\"We hope to attract back to Indonesia the offshore money invested in REITs,\" Brodjonegoro."}
