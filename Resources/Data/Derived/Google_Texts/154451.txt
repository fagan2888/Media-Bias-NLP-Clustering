It seems former Sen. Rick Santorum is not a fan of Sen. Ted Cruz, who is leading presidential Republican polls in Iowa.

“Ted Cruz is wonderful at reading children’s fairytales on the Senate floor,” the narrator says as a new ad features footage of Cruz reading Green Eggs And Ham during his Obamacare filibuster.

The ad highlights Santorum’s record in the Senate with eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee reminding voters that he was a “leader” and a “fighter” before losing his Senate re-election bid in 2006.

“You want someone to read one helluva bedtime story, Ted Cruz is your guy,” the ad continues, using footage of Cruz’s family from one of Cruz’s campaign videos. “If you want to protect America, and defeat ISIS, Rick Santorum’s your President. Because serious times need serious people.”

Santorum technically won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, but the announcement of his victory was delayed that year. He’s running again for president in 2016. Cruz is currently leading in the polls while the former Pennsylvania Senator is polling at one percent.
