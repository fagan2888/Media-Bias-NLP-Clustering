The big business cases of 2014

2014 was a year in which long-simmering legal controversies over Obamacare, same-sex marriage and a state law governing businesses with public contracts reached pivotal trial court orders or appellate decisions.



Some of these disputes are not over, and legal experts believe they will either reshape public policy through upcoming rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court or its counterpart in Michigan, or generate future litigation.



Cases included here could also become guideposts in future cases involving environmental contamination, theft of trade secrets and more.
