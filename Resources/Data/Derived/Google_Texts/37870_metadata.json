Cost can sometimes take a backseat to these considerations. But with few insurance policies covering home birth and prices varying dramatically across the country, expectant parents planning a home birth can\u2019t afford to make cost an afterthought.\n\n\u201cIt had a huge bearing on our decision,\u201d says Jessica Goldstein, 39, a family physician, an assistant professor of family and community medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and a mother of three. \u201cI considered it for my first birth, and I think the fact that it wasn\u2019t covered by insurance led me to say I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\n\nLess than 1 percent of U.S. births take place in the home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But that percentage has been rising, climbing from 0.56 percent in 2004 to 0.92 percent in 2013.\n\nGoldstein, who recently documented her home birth experience in the medical journal Health Affairs, said the second time around was different, in outcome if not in potential cost. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t going to be covered. But when I got pregnant again, I had more time to think about it and went, \u2018You know, this is something I really want to do.\u2019 And I talked to my husband about it, and said, \u2018We\u2019re just going to pay for it,\u2019 and so we did.\u201d\n\nCost comparison\n\nThe cost of having a baby at a hospital is far from set in stone. A 2013 study found that vaginal births produced an average of more than $32,000 in charges to employer-based insurance companies. Another study, from the University of California, San Francisco, found that charges for vaginal births ranged from $3,296 to $37,227 in California alone.\n\nREAD MORE: How Much Does Having a Baby Cost?\n\nHome birth costs are typically based on the price of midwifery services, as 67 percent of home births in the U.S. were attended by a midwife in 2013. In most cases, insurance aside, uncomplicated home births are cheaper, costing an average of one-third the price of a hospital birth.\n\n\u201cI paid $4,500 out of pocket,\u201d Goldstein says. Working in a hospital herself, she knew it was much cheaper than the total charges for an in-hospital birth.\n\n\u201cWe originally balked at our midwife\u2019s total fee of $3,500,\u201d says Frances Manfrey, 35, a small-business owner and mother of two in the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cThat all had to come out of pocket in regular payments, but we budgeted and made it work.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Your Guide To the Price Of an Ultrasound\n\nKnow your coverage\n\n\u201cHad we went with the hospital, it would have cost me about $600 out of pocket,\u201d Goldstein says. Her insurance covers labor and delivery in a hospital, but not at home.\n\nManfrey was more fortunate. She made payments to her midwife throughout the pregnancy. Afterward, the midwife\u2019s billing service filed with her insurance, and Manfrey received a check for 90 percent of the costs.\n\nREAD MORE: Where To Find Affordable Health Insurance\n\nDiffering state laws on the licensing of midwives, paired with differences in insurance companies and policy nuances, means there\u2019s no single right answer to whether a home birth will be covered by your insurance.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires that health insurance companies offer certified midwives the opportunity to join networks, but insurers might only cover their services in a hospital or birthing center. If you have Medicaid, the ACA requires midwife coverage but not necessarily in your home. And some states don\u2019t even recognize midwives as legal practitioners.\n\nREAD MORE: The Pros and Cons Of Obamacare\n\nIn short, a local midwife may be able to help you understand the laws and general practices in your state, but you\u2019ll ultimately need to contact your insurance company.\n\nMake an informed decision\n\nIf home birth is even a possibility, take steps to ensure your costs will be manageable:\n\n\u25cf Talk with a local midwife about laws and limitations in your state that may affect your insurance coverage.\n\n\u25cf Call your insurance company to find out whether your plan covers all or part of home birth costs, and whether there are any in-network midwives in your area.\n\n\u25cf Have a plan in place so that if an emergency happens and you have to be transferred to the hospital, you are sent to a hospital in your insurance network, helping to avoid unexpected and expensive medical bills.\n\n\u25cf If you\u2019re uninsured, talk with your midwife about payment plans.\n\nFinally, budget for a potential emergency transfer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t look closely into the potential cost of a hospital transfer,\u201d Manfrey says. \u201cLooking back on that, I\u2019m even more grateful for the uncomplicated births we had.\u201d\n\nMore and more families are exercising greater choice in where they have their babies. And as these families weigh the personal and safety concerns of home births, cost should similarly be at the forefront of their minds.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Pregnancy,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Children's Health,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-06 08:45:42 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Choosing to have your baby at home is a deeply personal decision, one often rooted in moral beliefs and weighed carefully against safety concerns.", "twitter": {"description": "Choosing to have your baby at home is a deeply personal decision, one often rooted in moral beliefs and weighed carefully against safety concerns.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1421940085204.jpg?ve=1", "title": "How much do home births actually cost?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Pregnancy\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Children\\\\u0027s Health\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"How much do home births actually cost?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1421940085204.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-03T09:00:54Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b40b7181-126c-4ec4-9095-72acd3a498c4\",\"section\":\"health\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Choosing to have your baby at home is a deeply personal decision, one often rooted in moral beliefs and weighed carefully against safety concerns.", "dc.identifier": "b40b7181-126c-4ec4-9095-72acd3a498c4", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "preg,chlth,healthcare", "description": "Choosing to have your baby at home is a deeply personal decision, one often rooted in moral beliefs and weighed carefully against safety concerns.", "prism.section": "health", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "NerdWallet", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "How Much Do Home Births Actually Cost?", "dcterms.created": "2015-07-06 08:45:42 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Choosing to have your baby at home is a deeply personal decision, one often rooted in moral beliefs and weighed carefully against safety concerns.", "title": "How much do home births actually cost? | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1421940085204.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-07-03", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Pregnancy\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Children\\\\u0027s Health\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"How much do home births actually cost?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1421940085204.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-03T09:00:54Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/07/03/how-much-do-home-births-actually-cost.html\",\"post_id\":\"b40b7181-126c-4ec4-9095-72acd3a498c4\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"health\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80db\"", "article_summary": "And as these families weigh the personal and safety concerns of home births, cost should similarly be at the forefront of their minds.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t look closely into the potential cost of a hospital transfer,\u201d Manfrey says.\nIn most cases, insurance aside, uncomplicated home births are cheaper, costing an average of one-third the price of a hospital birth.\nGoldstein, who recently documented her home birth experience in the medical journal Health Affairs, said the second time around was different, in outcome if not in potential cost.\nA 2013 study found that vaginal births produced an average of more than $32,000 in charges to employer-based insurance companies."}
