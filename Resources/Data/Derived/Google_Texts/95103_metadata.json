That era may be coming to an end as the Raiders played perhaps their final game ever in Oakland on Thursday night against the San Diego Chargers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re human, so it\u2019s hard not to think about it,\u201d Raiders fullback Marcel Reece said. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ll tell those guys when I talk to them is if it\u2019s the last game here in Oakland, make it the best.\u201d\n\nWith prospects for a new stadium in Oakland remaining bleak, the Raiders are one of three NFL teams \u2014 the other two are the Chargers and St. Louis Rams \u2014 expected to apply next month for the right to relocate to the Los Angeles area.\n\nRaiders owner Mark Davis and Chargers owner Dean Spanos are seeking to partner on building a stadium in Carson, which could lead to an unusual partnership between teams that have been fierce rivals for more than half a century.\n\n\u201cIt could be an odd marriage,\u201d Reece said. \u201cThere\u2019s mutual respect but never any love. Business is business. For us as players, that\u2019s way above our pay grade. No matter what, when we see each other on the field, you\u2019ll hear a whole lot of helmets cracking and there will be a lot of fire.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are looking to build their stadium in Inglewood, near Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nThe three teams are expected to apply to relocate in early January with a possible vote to be held on which teams will be approved to move during the Jan. 12-13 meetings in Houston.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the plans are. That\u2019s not my area,\u201d said Raiders coach Jack Del Rio. \u201cI let Mr. Davis handle that stuff. I just continue to coach the football team and work on having our guys as prepared as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders already left Oakland once, departing for Los Angeles after the 1981 season. The NFL tried to block that move, only to have late owner Al Davis sue his way south. The team spent 14 years in Los Angeles before returning to Oakland amid much fanfare for the 1995 season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Oakland Raiders\u2019 stadium may be in rearview mirror", "title": "Oakland Raiders\u2019 stadium may be in rearview mirror", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/oakland-raiders-stadium-may-be-in-rearview-mirror/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__39d0e2e1c71c83398b0f6a706700ba07p1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__39d0e2e1c71c83398b0f6a706700ba07p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T21:50:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:44:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The team spent 14 years in Los Angeles before returning to Oakland amid much fanfare for the 1995 season.\nThat era may be coming to an end as the Raiders played perhaps their final game ever in Oakland on Thursday night against the San Diego Chargers.\nI just continue to coach the football team and work on having our guys as prepared as possible.\u201dThe Raiders already left Oakland once, departing for Los Angeles after the 1981 season.\nThe NFL tried to block that move, only to have late owner Al Davis sue his way south.\nA relic from the era of multipurpose stadiums, the Coliseum is the only venue remaining that hosts the NFL and big-league baseball."}
