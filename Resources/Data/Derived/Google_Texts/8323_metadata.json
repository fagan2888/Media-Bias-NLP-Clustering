It\u2019s an enviable task that\u2019s sure to have gotten easier with the onset of Obama-mania in the U.S. media.\n\nThe winner of the dubious 2014 \u201cQuote of the Year\u201d honor is CNN anchor Carol Costello, who could not contain her glee while setting up a recording of Sarah Palin\u2019s daughter, Bristol, describing to police how she was physically and verbally attacked by a man at a party.\n\nCostello said:\n\n\u201cOK. I\u2019m just going to come right out and say it: This is quite possibly the best minute and a half of audio we\u2019ve ever come across \u2014 well, come across in a long time anyway. A massive brawl in Anchorage, Alaska, reportedly involving Sarah Palin\u2019s kids and her husband. It was sparked after someone pushed one of her daughters at a party\u2026.And now police have released audio of that interview. It does include some rather colorful language from Bristol. Here now is Bristol\u2019s recollection of how that night unfolded. So sit back and enjoy.\u201d\n\nTo quiet the critics, Media Research Center has put together an arduous process to select the winners, including tapping a panel of 40 radio talk show hosts, magazine editors, columnists, editorial writers and expert media observers.\n\nThe runner-up for the \u201cQuote of the Year\u201d award is Eleanor Clift, a writer for The Daily Beast, for her claim that Ambassador Christopher Stevens was not murdered. She said:\n\n\u201cEvery media organization has investigated this [Benghazi] to death. This animates the right wing of the Republican Party. And I would like to point out that Ambassador [Chris] Stevens was not murdered. He died of smoke inhalation in the safe room in that CIA installation.\u201d\n\nAnd no such list would be complete without MSNBC, whose frequent contributor Michael Eric Dyson made second runner-up for comparing President Obama to Jesus Christ.\n\nIncredibly, Dyson said:\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m a Christian preacher, and God finally said, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t send nobody else. I got to go myself.\u2019 And I ain\u2019t saying that Obama is Jesus, but for many of his followers he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the liberal media, 2014 was a banner year \u2026 of failure,\u201d Media Research Center President Brent Bozell said, according to Newsbusters. \u201cThey celebrated violence against conservative women, downplayed the global terror threat, overlooked and suppressed news reports about the utter devastation Obamacare wrought on our health-care system, and peddled the race card as an explanation for any opposition to President Obama\u2019s lawlessness and failed policies.\u201d\n\nFor additional category winners, see the full report HERE.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Each year, the Media Research Center presents the \u201cWorst of the Worst\u201d awards for the year\u2019s worst reporting, a\u00a0compilation of the most outrageous and/or humorous quotes uttered by media representatives.
