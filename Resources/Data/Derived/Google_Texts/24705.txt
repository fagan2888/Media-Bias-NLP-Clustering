Leonard Marshall had a few crucial sacks of his own in the the New York Giants' first two Super Super titles.

Marshall, however, points to his former teammate's sack against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI as the most impactful.

"When George Martin sacked Elway just before the second half," Marshall told NJ.com's Charles Curtis. "We sacked Elway in the end zone to, I believe, take a 10-9 lead at halftime and we all celebrated over the top of Elway in Super Bowl XXI.

"It was almost like we were burying him in the end zone, it was just sick. That was one of my favorite pictures, I know that. If you go look a the picture, there's Lawrence [Taylor], myself and Erik Howard, and we're standing there making the sign of a safety."

The Giants went on to win Super Bowl XXI, 30-29, and Marshall finished with two sacks and a fumble recovery.

Marshall also had a sack in the Giant's 20-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV.

"We didn't say nothing to him," Marshall said on his sack of Buffalo's Jim Kelly. "The deal was, you never piss 'em [off] when they needed to be. They didn't need any more motivation, they were already motivated enough. Bill Parcells would always say, 'Act like you've been there before.'"
