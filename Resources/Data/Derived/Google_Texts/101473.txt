(“eHealth” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:EHTH) between October 31, 2014 and January 14, 2015, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

eHealth is a technology company that provides online health insurance services, and facilitates the matching of insurance carriers with individuals, families and businesses. The Complaint alleges that defendants made false and/or misleading statements regarding the Company’s operations, finances and future prospects, including statements claiming that eHealth was uniquely poised to benefit from the insurance marketplaces promoted in the U.S. Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).

On January 14, 2015, eHealth announced disappointing preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The Company reported that it expects quarterly revenues of $43-45 million, and losses per share of $0.47 to $0.56, well below the consensus of revenues $52.6 million and per-share losses of $0.11. The Company also reported a 41% year-over-year decline in submitted applications, and higher marketing costs in its Medicare segment. Following this news, the Company’s shares fell over 50% on January 15, 2015, on heavy volume.

If you are a member of the Class described above, you may move the Court no later than March 27, 2015, to serve as lead plaintiff, if you meet certain legal requirements. To be a member of the Class you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the Class. If you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Lesley Portnoy, Esquire, or Casey Sadler, Esquire, of Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067, at (310) 201-9150, by e-mail to shareholders@glancylaw.com, or visit our website at http://www.glancylaw.com.
