It also said the design brief needed a high-density development to meet housing needs identified by the council.\n\nA statement presented to the local authority by Oliver & Robb Architects said the north gable had been designed to create a feature on the prominent corner of Bruce Street and Ladyburn Place and the building would act as a gateway to the village.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cIt will be a contemporary response to the planning requirements of the site, while also satisfying the client\u2019s brief and the local housing needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i2.wp.com/www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/04/image.jpg1_.611096.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "sailthru.author": "Reporter", "sailthru.image.wp-medium": "https://i2.wp.com/www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/04/image.jpg1_.611096.jpg?fit=300%2C179&ssl=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier", "description": "A \u201cmonolithic\u201d block of flats would harm the setting of a two-centuries-old building recently rescued from dereliction, it is feared.
