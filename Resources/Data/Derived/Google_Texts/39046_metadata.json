The school board at the beginning of this month voted to send letters home to parents informing them of their right to pull their children from Smarter Balanced, a policy urged by critics of the test and the larger Common Core State Standards on which it is based.The board reluctantly voted to adopt Smarter Balanced in February after a months-long fight with state education officials over the city\u2019s efforts to develop its own academic standards and use an assessment test of its choosing.Nearly every school in the district has received the written refusal notices, which could be conveyed in a letter or email, but by far the greatest number \u2014 195 \u2014 went to Memorial High School. The principal at Memorial held a rally before the test that included a prize raffle for those who took the test...Some parents had also complained that the principal wasn\u2019t honoring refusal notices sent via email. After Memorial, the greatest number of refusal notices were sent to Central High School and Southside Middle School, which both received 51. Hillside Middle School received 45 refusals; West High, 27; and the Smyth Road and Highland Goffe\u2019s Falls elementary schools each received 25.The number of parents pulling their children from the test represents a small but significant percentage \u2014 approximately 5 to 10 percent of the students in grades 3-8 and 11 \u2014 and the rapid increase in the early weeks of the testing period raises the possibility that the percentage will grow.Under the policy adopted by the school board, students not taking the test are to be assigned other activities outside the testing room.....", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of students whose parents have refused to let them take the Smarter Balanced assessment test has swelled to more than 500 since the district began administering the exam earlier this month.", "title": "Smarter Balanced test refusals keep growing in Manchester | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The number of students whose parents have refused to let them take the Smarter Balanced assessment test has swelled to more than 500 since the district began administering the exam earlier this month.", "title": "Smarter Balanced test refusals keep growing in Manchester | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150330/NEWS04/150339995/-1/newhampshire706", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Education", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "date": "2015-03-30 00:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "keywords": "Education, Politics, Social issues, Manchester, Top Section Stories,", "twitter": {"description": "The number of students whose parents have refused to let them take the Smarter Balanced assessment test has swelled to more than 500 since the district began administering the exam earlier this month.", "title": "Smarter Balanced test refusals keep growing in Manchester | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150330/NEWS04/150339995/-1/newhampshire706", "image": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae41\"", "article_summary": "After Memorial, the greatest number of refusal notices were sent to Central High School and Southside Middle School, which both received 51.\nThe principal at Memorial held a rally before the test that included a prize raffle for those who took the test...Some parents had also complained that the principal wasn\u2019t honoring refusal notices sent via email.\ntsiefer@unionleader.com\u2014 The number of students whose parents have refused to let them take the Smarter Balanced assessment test has swelled to more than 500 since the district began administering the exam earlier this month...The principals at 21 schools received 531 parent refusal notices as of Thursday, according to information released by the Manchester School District.The number is close to triple the number of refusal notices the district had tallied a week earlier.\nHillside Middle School received 45 refusals; West High, 27; and the Smyth Road and Highland Goffe\u2019s Falls elementary schools each received 25.The number of parents pulling their children from the test represents a small but significant percentage \u2014 approximately 5 to 10 percent of the students in grades 3-8 and 11 \u2014 and the rapid increase in the early weeks of the testing period raises the possibility that the percentage will grow.Under the policy adopted by the school board, students not taking the test are to be assigned other activities outside the testing room.....\nThe school board at the beginning of this month voted to send letters home to parents informing them of their right to pull their children from Smarter Balanced, a policy urged by critics of the test and the larger Common Core State Standards on which it is based.The board reluctantly voted to adopt Smarter Balanced in February after a months-long fight with state education officials over the city\u2019s efforts to develop its own academic standards and use an assessment test of its choosing.Nearly every school in the district has received the written refusal notices, which could be conveyed in a letter or email, but by far the greatest number \u2014 195 \u2014 went to Memorial High School."}
