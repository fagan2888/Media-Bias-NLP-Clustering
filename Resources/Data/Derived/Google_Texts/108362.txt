First, legalized marijuana sweetened the pot for school construction, and now comes two proposed ballot initiatives to expand gaming and pour millions into K-12 education.

No, thanks. We have long been opponents to gaming expansion in Colorado, and so have voters who in 2003 resoundingly defeated a similar proposal to add gambling terminals to five Front Range racetracks.

Nevertheless, a Rhode Island company is trying again with the needy K-12 education fund as one benefactor. Two ballot initiatives would ask voters to approve gambling’s expansion into Arapahoe, Pueblo and Mesa counties with mega-sized casinos.

The initiatives would add slots, table games and video lottery terminals at the Aurora racetrack and “two future horse racetracks” in Pueblo and Mesa counties, according to an article in The Gazette.

The casinos, at a minimum, would have 2,500 slot machines. The state’s largest casino in Black Hawk now has 1,500 slots.

To entice voters, 34 percent of the casinos’ profits and a one-time payment of $25 million would go to K-12 education. Also, host communities would get a one-time payment of $10 million and 2 percent of annual profits.

Colorado doesn’t need any more gaming.

Casinos on the Front Range would effectively kill the mountain towns where casinos were approved by voters in the 1990s.

Also lost would be gaming tax revenues from those casinos — which in 20 years have provided $1.3 billion for programs ranging from historic preservation to the state’s general fund, and more recently to community colleges as well, which get proceeds from gaming thanks to Amendment 50 passed by voters in 2008.

But the downsides of expanded gambling would be greater than any monetary benefit, even if it were for such a worthy cause as our children’s education.
