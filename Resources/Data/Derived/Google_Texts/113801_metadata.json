But most of his campaign promises are implausible, experts say\n\nSo far the most memorable moments of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign have been his claim that Mexico is sending \u201crapists\u201d to the US and his description of senator John McCain, a man permanently crippled after five-and-a-half-years as a Vietnamese prisoner of war, as \u201cnot a war hero\u201d.\n\nJust imagine if any of Trump\u2019s contenders had said either of these things. Just imagine if they\u2019d managed, during a month-long political career, to alienate one of the most important voting demographics in the US. Or if they\u2019d set up a Veterans coalition in their own honour, only for it to emerge that several alleged members had never even heard of the group they were supposedly supporting.\n\nThey would be ridiculed. They would be ostracised. They would be described as moronic.\n\nBut for Trump it seems to be working. He\u2019s leading the polls . He will take centre stage at Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\nThe one-time Apprentice host might find that things will begin to get a bit more difficult, however, now that he has to articulate his actual policies. So far we\u2019ve heard that he\u2019ll bring back jobs. That he\u2019ll put up walls. That he\u2019ll take down China and make America great and do a super cool spinning karate kick.\n\nSo what would Trump actually do as president? He can\u2019t just spend four years upsetting Latinos and veterans and talking about how tough he is.\n\nWell, one thing is that he would tax other countries. All of them. But especially Mexico and China, for whom he reserves particular venom.\n\nAs MSNBC has reported , Trump has promised to get rid of corporate taxes and replace them with a 20% tax on imports and a 15% tax on companies which outsource. There\u2019s only one problem: that would be illegal.\n\n\u201cThat 20% tax would be an absolutely straightforward violation of probably every trade law the United States has with any other country,\u201d Joshua Meltzer, a fellow in global economy and development at the Brookings Institution, told MSNBC. Two other economic experts agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s not going to happen, then.\n\nTrump has also said he would have prevented Ford from building new manufacturing plants in Mexico by imposing a 35% tax on vehicles made in the country. But as USA Today pointed out , this would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Oh, and only Congress can impose taxes anyway.\n\nHealthcare, and specifically Obamacare, is an easy win for a Republican presidential hopeful. Trump made all the right noises on this when he described the Affordable Care Act as a \u201cbig fat horrible lie\u201d and a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d in Iowa in January.\n\nHe undid the good work, however, when it turned out his proposal to replace Obamacare was pretty similar to Obamacare. As Bloomberg reported , Trump\u2019s ideas included competing private plans, protecting hospitals and government plans for low-income people who get sick options. Obamacare does all these things.\n\nOh, and just for good measure Trump has said he wants \u201chealthcare for everybody\u201d. Like his views on Hispanic rapists and war heroes not being war heros, this would have sunk any other candidate. But still he ploughs on.\n\nWhat else? China. Trump likes to talk about China. It\u2019s his thing. In July he told a crowd in New Hampshire that the country would be in for it under a Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cOh, would China be in trouble. The poor Chinese.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the business mogul has said he will \u201cbring back our jobs\u201d from China. (And Mexico and Japan, but mainly China.) He has said the country has stolen US jobs through currency manipulation \u2013 a common claim, if an unproven one ; the Chinese yuan has actually strengthened against the dollar in the last decade. He has not specified exactly how to bring the jobs back, which is problematic because a series of economists have said it cannot be achieved .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely implausible,\u201d former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who has studied the offshoring of American jobs, told the Associated Press .\n\nFor one thing, China and other countries are losing the jobs Trump claims he will bring back, according to the AP. To countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nFor another thing, there is no space for those prodigal jobs Trump wants see return to home. The US lost 5m manufacturing jobs between 1999 and 2011, but technology has replaced many of these roles. And with unemployment at 5.3%, there would not be enough people to fill the jobs anyway. Ironically, the US would need immigrants to help.\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2015", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/trump3-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "What would Donald Trump actually do as president?
