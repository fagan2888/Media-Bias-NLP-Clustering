Sweet of U.S. district court for the southern district of New York barred CoinLab Inc. from delivering the virtual currency to any other parties before it meets its obligation to Bitvestment LLC.\n\nThe dispute underscores the frenzy surrounding bitcoin, a virtual currency that isn\u2019t backed by a central bank. It is produced electronically using computers, and enthusiasts trade it on exchanges and privately. Some merchants are now accepting bitcoin as a method of payment.\n\nBitvestment sued CoinLab last week for breach of contract, contending that the Bainbridge, Wash.-based company isn\u2019t living up to its obligation to provide 8,000 bitcoin under an August arrangement between the two firms. One bitcoin was worth $295 Thursday afternoon on the volatile Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange on Thursday, giving the disputed 8,000 bitcoin a value of $2.36 million.\n\nThe process of generating bicoin is known in the industry as \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nCoinLab Chief Executive Peter Vessenes has said that the lawsuit was a contributing factor in last week\u2019s bankruptcy filing of CoinLab\u2019s mining unit, which is called Alydian Inc. Mr. Vessenes is also chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit trade group that promotes the virtual currency.\n\nMr. Vessenes noted in an email on Thursday that CoinLab itself has no mining operations, but \u201cof course we will comply (with the judge\u2019s order) as well as we\u2019re able.\u201d It isn\u2019t clear if Alydian is still generating bitcoin while it is under bankruptcy protection.\n\nHe also said that CoinLab was pleased that the judge denied other requests from BitVestment, such as seeking certain financial data from officers of CoinLab and Alydian.\n\n\u201cWe continue to treat this as a simple contract dispute case, and feel confident on the merits of the case,\u201d Mr. Vessenes said.\n\nBryan Reyhani, a lawyer representing Bitvestment in the case, declined to comment on the judge\u2019s ruling.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A well-known bitcoin company has been ordered by a judge to produce and deliver the virtual currency to a New York investment firm that accused it of reneging on their contractual agreement.", "title": "Judge Orders CoinLab to Give Bitcoin to Bitvestment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/07/judge-orders-coinlab-to-pay-up-in-bitcoin/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AC884_1023_2_G_20131023212523.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Judge Orders CoinLab to Give Bitcoin to Bitvestment", "description": "A well-known bitcoin company has been ordered by a judge to produce and deliver the virtual currency to a New York investment firm that accused it of reneging on their contractual agreement.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Robin Sidel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "A well-known bitcoin company has been ordered by a judge to produce and deliver the virtual currency to a New York investment firm that accused it of reneging on their contractual agreement.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-07T22:56:11-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/07/judge-orders-coinlab-to-pay-up-in-bitcoin/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-11422", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A well-known bitcoin company has been ordered by a judge to produce and deliver the virtual currency to a New York investment firm that accused it of reneging on their contractual agreement.", "title": "Judge Orders CoinLab to Give Bitcoin to Bitvestment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/07/judge-orders-coinlab-to-pay-up-in-bitcoin/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AC884_1023_2_G_20131023212523.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-11422", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-08T00:09:41-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The dispute underscores the frenzy surrounding bitcoin, a virtual currency that isn\u2019t backed by a central bank.\nHe also said that CoinLab was pleased that the judge denied other requests from BitVestment, such as seeking certain financial data from officers of CoinLab and Alydian.\nJudge Robert W.
