Examples of the challenges with industry interactions included struggling to ensure sales representatives adhered to hospital policy, biased information sources, the introduction of unapproved devices, lack of accountability for product failure, and threats to patient safety and privacy.\n\nWhy market to nurses?\n\n\"Most study participants - 64 per cent - cited examples where nurses had influenced treatment and purchasing decisions,\" Dr Grundy said.\n\nAbout one third of interviewed nurses (36 per cent) were standing members of institutional purchasing committees. Furthermore, interviewed industry professionals viewed nurses as a key audience because they had direct contact with industry's ultimate marketing targets - patients, prescribers and purchasers.\n\n\"The scope of practice of nurses in Australia is similar to nurses in the United States,\" Dr Grundy added. \"They have similar decision-making and influential roles within healthcare so they are desirable marketing targets.\"\n\nMedicines Australia, the pharmaceutical industry's peak body, requires member companies to publicly disclose all payments for 'educational' events - a major marketing strategy for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIn 2009 Medicines Australia reported that nurses were present at 26 per cent of 14,649 pharmaceutical-sponsored educational events hosted in the first 6 months of that year.\n\nExplore further: Interaction of nurses, pharmacists, and other non-physician clinicians within pharmaceutical industry is common", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Hospital based nurses have high levels of contact with pharmaceutical and medical device industry sales personnel but have little corporate or professional guidance about managing purchasing decisions in the context of these ...", "og": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-medical-drug-device-companies-nurses.html", "image": "http://cdn.medicalxpress.com/tmpl/v5/img/medx308px.png", "type": "article", "description": "Hospital based nurses have high levels of contact with pharmaceutical and medical device industry sales personnel but have little corporate or professional guidance about managing purchasing decisions in the context of these interactions, a new study in Annals of Internal Medicine reveals.", "title": "Medical and drug device companies target nurses to influence hospital purchasing decisions"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-medical-drug-device-companies-nurses.html", "title": "Medical and drug device companies target nurses to influence hospital purchasing decisions", "description": "Hospital based nurses have high levels of contact with pharmaceutical and medical device industry sales personnel but have little corporate or professional guidance about managing purchasing decisions ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 287568380}, "ROBOTS": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 325486637469240}, "Keywords": "Medicine Research News, Medicine Research, Health Research News, Health Research, Health Science, Medicine Science", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "article_summary": "\"For example, nurse educators coordinated in-service education with sales representatives on every newly purchased product, nurse managers relied heavily on sales representatives when selecting products for purchase, and staff nurses worked alongside sales representatives on a daily basis during surgery,\" she said.\nMedicines Australia, the pharmaceutical industry's peak body, requires member companies to publicly disclose all payments for 'educational' events - a major marketing strategy for the pharmaceutical industry.\nExplore further: Interaction of nurses, pharmacists, and other non-physician clinicians within pharmaceutical industry is common\n\"Most study participants - 64 per cent - cited examples where nurses had influenced treatment and purchasing decisions,\" Dr Grundy said.\nHowever, most nurses (70 per cent) reported challenges with these relationships."}
