The incentives could be enormous, amounting to 50 percent of monthly premiums, according to an article by Sharon Begley. Some workers could pay half of what other workers paid just for filling out health questionnaires, participating in medical screening, weight loss programs, and the like.\n\nBut now the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing several employers for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Begley quotes an employment law attorney as saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t make medical inquiries unless it\u2019s consistent with job-necessity, or part of a voluntary wellness program.\u201d The \u201cincentives\u201d in Obamacare are so punitive that participating in these programs is no longer \u201cvoluntary\u201d but coerced, he argues.\n\nThe Business Roundtable is, of course, furious. They supported Obamacare and now are threatened with damages simply for complying with the law they supported.\n\nCorporate Wellness Programs Are Bunk I\u2019m tempted to say something about chickens coming home to roost, but that ain\u2019t the half of it. The really funny part is, the evidence is mounting that corporate wellness programs don\u2019t work. They don\u2019t save money and they don\u2019t improve health. A study recently published in Health Affairs concludes, \u201cthere is no clinical evidence to support the conclusion that three pillars of workplace wellness\u2014annual workplace screenings and/or annual checkups for all employees (and sometimes spouses), and incentivized weight loss\u2014are cost-effective.\u201d The study by Al Lewis, Vik Khanna, and Shana Montrose says the information that got the wellness incentive included in Obamacare has since been discredited and that more reliable studies actually show a negative return on investment.\n\nAnother article by Michelle Andrews in Kaiser Health News cites another researcher: \u201cDespite employers\u2019 enthusiasm for wellness programs, \u2018there\u2019s no good research that shows these programs actually improve health outcomes or lower employer costs,\u2019 says JoAnn Volk, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\u201d\n\nEven so, corporate CEOs remain blindly enthusiastic about wellness programs. I don\u2019t know what it is about health care that seems to turn smart people dumb. The notion that these programs were a waste of money has been obvious for a very long time.\n\nThe Universal Desire to Control Other People It might also be just the universal desire to control other people. I once had a meeting with the medical director of a Fortune 100 company. He was bemoaning that he couldn\u2019t follow employees home to make sure they used their weed whackers properly on the weekend. I pointed out to him that he isn\u2019t running a plantation. He doesn\u2019t own his employees, and that the cost of replacing exasperated workers would be higher than anything saved by his meddling in their lives.\n\nWellness, like prevention, can work well when targeted at a high-risk population, but the cost of applying such provisions to the general public outweighs any possible savings. By definition, people who are active at work are healthier than the general population. The people who are most likely to participate in these programs are the very people who are already healthy and health-conscious. They don\u2019t cost much to insure because they don\u2019t file many claims, and they are unlikely to improve their health status because they are already healthy. Plus, reward programs can be easily manipulated: crash diet right before a weight loss weigh-in, and pig out the rest of the time.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 09 Dec 2014 07:49:32 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Corporate wellness programs were a waste anyway, but Obamacare has predictably made them even worse.", "title": "Obamacare Makes Corporate Wellness Programs Even Worse", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_134988143.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/12/09/obamacare-makes-corporate-wellness-programs-even-worse/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Corporate wellness programs were a waste anyway, but Obamacare has predictably made them even worse.", "title": "Obamacare Makes Corporate Wellness Programs Even Worse", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_134988143.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Americans with Disabilities Act,CEO,corporate wellness,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,health incentive programs,human resources,Obamacare,wellness programs", "published_time": "2014-12-09T07:49:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Corporate wellness programs were a waste anyway, but Obamacare has predictably made them even worse."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2a6\"", "article_summary": "Corporate wellness programs were a waste anyway, but Obamacare has predictably made them even worse.\nOne of the many curious features of Obamacare was an incentive to get employees to participate in corporate wellness programs.\nThe really funny part is, the evidence is mounting that corporate wellness programs don\u2019t work.\nCorporate Wellness Programs Are Bunk I\u2019m tempted to say something about chickens coming home to roost, but that ain\u2019t the half of it.\nAnother article by Michelle Andrews in Kaiser Health News cites another researcher: \u201cDespite employers\u2019 enthusiasm for wellness programs, \u2018there\u2019s no good research that shows these programs actually improve health outcomes or lower employer costs,\u2019 says JoAnn Volk, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\u201dEven so, corporate CEOs remain blindly enthusiastic about wellness programs."}
