Collins, a business consultant from suburban Chicago, in most cases has accumulated such a lead by Final Jeopardy that she\u2019s mathematically impossible to defeat. At this point, tuning into \u201cJeopardy!\u201d is rather like watching the Harlem Globetrotters, and every player not named Julia Collins is the Washington Generals.\n\nThere\u2019s something compelling in Collins\u2019s sheer mastery, but it\u2019s about time we made \u201cJeopardy!\u201d competitive again. The five-game cap should be reintroduced to the game.\n\n\u201cJeopardy!\u201d has many strengths, but its ability to let us get to know personalities isn\u2019t really one of them. Unlike, say, \u201cSurvivor,\u201d won or lost on the basis of personal interactions, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in almost all cases measures straightforward skills \u2014 reaction time when buzzing in, broad-based knowledge, strategic wagering.\n\nAnd so it is that, twenty wins into her reign, Julia Collins has given the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d audience little to grab onto but her sheer mastery. \u201cI have no questions for her. I don\u2019t know what to talk about in the conversation segment,\u201d host Alex Trebek joked in his opening remarks during Collins\u2019s most recent appearance. (Trebek, when it came time, asked Collins what she wanted to talk about. She replied \u201cOh, boy,\u201d and then Trebek said he\u2019d recently learned that Collins\u2019s high school mascot had been the snail. Pulse-pounding stuff!)\n\nLike Ken Jennings before her, Collins is just dominating in a manner at once remarkable and banal. There\u2019s nothing to say about it \u2014 she\u2019s just the best one out there. And like Jennings\u2019s, her ongoing success seems to build upon itself. Collins has had 20 days of practice using the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d buzzers, an incumbency advantage that, if it\u2019s not insurmountable, would take a pretty extraordinary competitor to overcome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She's won twenty times in a row.
