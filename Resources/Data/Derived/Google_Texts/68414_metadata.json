We had operated under the assumption we would be in the network.\u201d\n\nSansum Clinic\u2019s primary and specialty care services handle 61,000 patient visits every month, and neither type of provider is included in the exchange\u2019s insurance plans.\n\nThat means, if nothing changes, people who buy plans through the state exchange won\u2019t be able to use their insurance to see doctors at Sansum Clinic next year.\n\n\u201cTrust me, we\u2019re every bit as frustrated as anybody with the uncertainty and the possibility of a disruption of service,\u201d Ransohoff said.\n\nSansum is negotiating with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield \u2013 the only two insurance companies with plans on the state exchange for Santa Barbara County \u2013 to agree on the terms of participation.\n\nThe issue is over reimbursement rates \u2013 how much the insurance companies will pay Sansum providers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware that there\u2019s a need to lower health-care costs, so we have offered to take a significant discount to participate,\u201d Ransohoff said. \u201cOur definition of a significant discount and their definition of a significant discount are different.\n\n\"We\u2019re a nonprofit community organization with a very narrow margin; They\u2019re a very large multi-billion-dollar insurance company.\u201d\n\nHe hopes to have an agreement in place by January, but says the current offerings are unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe would be unable to offer the services that we offer to the community at the rates that they\u2019re suggesting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur board has authorized us to try and work it out, to be willing to cut into our very thin margin to be able to serve the needs of the community. If we cut all the way through our margin and go into an unsustainable financial situation, that\u2019s not going to help anybody.\u201d\n\nThe exchange goes into effect in January, and group plans aren't expected to change; The coverage issue is with people who will buy on the exchange or have individual policies now.\n\nThe exchange opened for pre-enrollment this week, along with the government shutdown as a result of a budget stalemate after Republican legislators in the House of Representatives tried to defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which Democrats in the Senate and the White House said they would not accept.\n\nPeople can start browsing plans and benefits on the website.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty about what providers will be included in the exchange plan networks, which are expected to be \u201cvery narrow,\u201d Ransohoff said.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, will the people with individual policies now continue to have access to the broader network, or will they only have access to this narrow network? We don\u2019t have the answer to that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still early, and there may be more clarity even a few weeks down the road, Ransohoff said.\n\n\u201cIt might be good to shop and look around now, but if I were encouraging someone, I would tell them to wait to purchase until they have a better idea of what they\u2019re purchasing.\u201d\n\nSansum Clinic started in the 1920s, and has been taking care of patients through every kind of insurance change.\n\n\u201cWhatever kind of insurance the community wants to get, we figured out a way to provide it. That\u2019s our intention, but this is new terrain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Giana Magnoli can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
