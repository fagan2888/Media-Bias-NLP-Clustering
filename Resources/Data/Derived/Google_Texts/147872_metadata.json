Hagan, whose seat is up for re-election, is not on the ballot.\n\nFour Democrats and four Republicans have been endorsed for Tuesday\u2019s primary, though each candidate has cross-filed and will be on the ballot for both parties.\n\nIncumbents Robert Gockley, Marge Lotter and Mark Opalisky are joined by Joseph Wade on the GOP side. Theresa E. Brown, Judy Fry, Charles R. Horner III and Susan Shinton are the Democrats seeking the four-year seats.\n\nBrown and Shinton each sought a place on the board two years ago but fell short.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve devoted my entire life to education,\u201d said Brown, who\u2019s been a day care director, worked in preschools and was a counselor in the Palisades School District. \u201cI feel that through my background I know schools and would work for the best interest of the total system, which includes the community at large.\u201d\n\nAs a board member, Brown said she would demonstrate to school employees that she cared for them and would encourage their growth. \u201cYou have to create a vision for them to believe in and guide them to that vision,\u201d she said.\n\nShinton said she\u2019d advocate for videotaping school board meetings and posting them on the district website. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a whole lot of communication between the board and the public,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Hatboro-Horsham students receive a good education, Shinton expressed a desire for \u201cnew faces, new ideas\u201d on the board. \u201cIt has been an all-Republican board for more than a decade,\u201d she said. \u201cLike any other organization, you get better ideas, a stronger board in general, if people come from different backgrounds.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper was unable to reach Democrats Fry and Horner for comment.\n\nOpalisky, seeking his third term, has been president and vice president of the board. He\u2019s been a leader in pushing to increase technology based learning and the district\u2019s technical department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so critical to the future of our students,\u201d he said.\n\nOpalisky said he\u2019s \u201cconscientious following-up\u201d when residents reach out to him and believes that \u201cover the years I have contributed a lot to the district and its growth. I know the system very well, the budget process and the curriculum.\u201d\n\nLotter, chairwoman of the Policy Committee and liaison to the Hatboro-Horsham Education Foundation, said her goal is to \u201cmake sure we maintain our excellent reputation as a top-notch school in a fiscally responsible nature.\u201d\n\nShe said politics has no place in the board room. \u201cWe are neither Republicans nor Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not part of the equation. We are for everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI enjoy being a school board director because I feel that I am contributing to the betterment of the students and the Hatboro and Horsham communities.\u201d\n\nGockley, a Bristol Township School District counselor, was appointed to the board in January as a replacement for Barbara LaSorsa. He developed Bristol Township\u2019s alternative education program.\n\n\u201cI want to keep Hatboro-Horsham the stellar school district that it is,\u201d he said.\n\nWith a background in business and construction, Gockley maintains his experience aids the board when discussing building projects. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been very helpful in a relatively short time and want to help Hatboro-Horsham meet its present and future challenges.\u201d\n\nWade, retired following a successful career in the insurance industry, said he is running as a way to \u201cpay back to my community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had six children go through Hatboro-Horsham, and thank God they\u2019ve all been very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love Horsham. We love Hatboro. This is payback for all the blessings given me. I have nothing but praise for the district.\u201d\n\nA former federal investigator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wade contends his management and financial skills would be an asset to the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been impressed with way Hatboro-Horsham has handled things financially,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll look at everything through an objective point of view with the focus on maintaining this excellent quality of education for generations to come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Intelligencer", "description": "With only three incumbents running for four seats on the Hatboro-Horsham School Board, at least one new director is certain to be sworn in next January.", "title": "8 vie for 4 seats in Hatboro-Horsham", "url": "http://www.theintell.com/news/local/election/vie-for-seats-in-hatboro-horsham/article_f415ce66-dfdf-566f-959f-6b2d339791ce.html", "image": "http://theintell.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/fb-share/iconintellv2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheIntellNews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With only three incumbents running for four seats on the Hatboro-Horsham School Board, at least one new director is certain to be sworn in next January.", "msvalidate.01": "D8575C90B3B4CCE6B6A7C9F0086B7312", "fb": {"app_id": 579115282248617}, "keywords": "united states department of agriculture,board of directors,board of education,dvd region code,democratic party united states,school district,american institutes for research,arkansas,arkansas democrat-gazette,arkansas department of education,horsham,hatboro pennsylvania,education,joseph wade,incumbents robert gockley,mark opalisky,school board,marge lotter,politics,susan shinton,theresa e. brown,counselor,charles r. horner iii,judy fry,director,hatboro-horsham school board,thomas j. hagan,municipal primary,republican party,palisades school district,day care director,board member,district web site,videotaping school board,democrats,president and vice president,leader,hatboro-horsham education foundation,policy committee,chairwoman,barbara lasorsa,bristol township school district,bristol township,stellar school district,insurance industry,federal investigator,u.s. department of agriculture", "google-site-verification": "8nckBxTQwgRuj2o3n2pyWZlSYU8Q818IpV17p1FQOGI", "news_keywords": "united states department of agriculture,board of directors,board of education,dvd region code,democratic party united states,school district,american institutes for research,arkansas,arkansas democrat-gazette,arkansas department of education,horsham,hatboro pennsylvania,education,joseph wade,incumbents robert gockley,mark opalisky,school board,marge lotter,politics,susan shinton,theresa e. brown,counselor,charles r. horner iii,judy fry,director,hatboro-horsham school board,thomas j. hagan,municipal primary,republican party,palisades school district,day care director,board member,district web site,videotaping school board,democrats,president and vice president,leader,hatboro-horsham education foundation,policy committee,chairwoman,barbara lasorsa,bristol township school district,bristol township,stellar school district,insurance industry,federal investigator,u.s. department of agriculture"}, "article_summary": "With only three incumbents running for four seats on the Hatboro-Horsham School Board, at least one new director is certain to be sworn in next January.\nWhile Hatboro-Horsham students receive a good education, Shinton expressed a desire for \u201cnew faces, new ideas\u201d on the board.\n\u201cI want to keep Hatboro-Horsham the stellar school district that it is,\u201d he said.\nTheresa E.
