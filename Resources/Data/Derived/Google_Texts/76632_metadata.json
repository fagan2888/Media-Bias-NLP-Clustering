Rezaian has been a correspondent for The Washington Post in Tehran for two years, covering stories from a growing baseball scene in Iran to local corruption.\n\nIn 2014, Rezaian was detained for questioning, along with his wife.\n\nRezaian has been kept in Evin Prison, while his wife was released on bail, for the charges of espionage, working with hostile governments and \u201cpropaganda against the establishment.\u201d\n\nRezaian has been held for long periods of time in solitary confinement while his trial has already gone through multiple hearings. He could be convicted of 10 to 20 years in prison for his \u201ccharges.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe knew the trial would have to start before there would be an end to it,\u201d his mother, Mary Rezaian, told The New York Times. \u201cWe have no idea how many sessions this trial will take. It seems to be going quite slowly.\u201d\n\nRezaian has had the shortest length of imprisonment out of these American captives, as he has been held for a year. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are currently 30 journalists imprisoned in Iran.\n\nRobert Levinson\n\nWorking for the government does not always have its perks.\n\nRobert Levinson was kidnapped in 2007 from Kish Island off of Iran, where he was working for a rogue CIA operation.\n\nThe 67-year-old grandfather from Florida was hired as a contractor for the Office of Transnational Issues at the CIA when he disappeared. The CIA paid the Levinsons $2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit due to the sensitive nature of this case.\n\nThe Iranian government denies being responsible for Levinson\u2019s disappearance, but many believe they are aware of his location.\n\nThe Levinson family was sent proof of life pictures in 2011 that taunted the family and the United States for failing to secure his release.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw these photos, I realized how unrecognizable my father had become \u2026 It was clear that on a daily level, he has been living through hell,\u201d Levinson\u2019s son, David, wrote for CNN.\n\n\u201cI believe in my father, and I know how determined he is to get home. There is no doubt in my mind that one day he will succeed, that one day we will see each other again and he will meet my future wife,\u201d David Levinson said. \u201cShe is hopeful for that day as well, and longs to meet the man I am constantly trying to emulate each day.\u201d\n\nAccording to CBS News, Levinson is the longest-held American hostage in the history of the U.S., as he has been missing for over eight years. The FBI has increased its reward from $1 million to $5 million for any \u201cinformation leading directly to his safe location, recovery, and return.\u201d\n\nSaeed Abedini\n\nPastor Saeed Abedini met his wife in Tehran, shared his faith in Tehran, and is now imprisoned in Tehran.\n\nAbedini had traveled to Iran multiple times starting in 2009 in the efforts to construct an orphanage.\n\nThe 35-year-old pastor from Idaho was abruptly taken into custody by Iranian officials in 2012 under the guise of undermining national security.\n\nAbedini was convicted a year later to serve eight years in Evin Prison for starting local home churches.\n\nHe is frequently subjected to beatings by prison guards, psychological torture and long periods of solitary confinement.\n\nThere has been a global campaign started by the American Center for Law and Justice that has reached over one million signatures asking for Abedini\u2019s release.\n\nNaghmeh Abedini wrote a letter to her husband on their anniversary, detailing how life has been without him.\n\n\u201cFor 1,007 days I have remembered you in prayer and felt your pain. For 1,007 days I have been in prison with you as your wife and soul mate. Each night I have struggled with anxiety and a sense of urgency that we need to get you out,\u201d Abedini wrote. \u201cEach night that I have laid my head on our bed, I have hugged your empty spot and have wept myself to sleep. Each morning I have woken up with an excruciating pain to my new reality without you. I have prayed. Oh how I have prayed.\u201d\n\nAmir Hekmati\n\nVisiting aging relatives led to the death penalty for the then 28-year-old ex-Marine.\n\nAmir Hekmati, a dual citizen of Iran and the United States, served the United States from 2001 to 2005 as a Marine specializing in linguistics.\n\nHe visited Iran for the first time in 2011 in order to celebrate Ramadan in Tehran with his extended family.\n\nHekmati never made it to the celebration, however, as he was taken by Iranian authorities and wasn\u2019t heard from until a week later.\n\nAfter a forced confession of espionage, Hekmati was sentenced to death after a three hour, closed-door trial.\n\nThree months later, the case was repealed based on shaky evidence, and a new trial was ordered. His new crime was \u201ccooperating with hostile governments\u201d and Hekmati was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cWe were worried about him a lot when he was in Iraq,\u201d Hekmati\u2019s mother, Behnaz, said. \u201cBut he was free. He wasn\u2019t in prison. We worry now because I can\u2019t talk to him. I\u2019m more worried now, more than when he was in military.\u201d\n\nObama commented on the status of these prisoners when asked during a press conference last week about why the hostages were not connected to the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cNow, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSuddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals\u2014makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on the nuclear deal.\u201d\n\nWhile support and recognition for these Americans trapped in Iran continues to grow, the mood remains ever hopeful of securing their freedom.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s content, and our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nuclear deal with Iran does not affect the four Americans being held hostage by the Iranian government.
