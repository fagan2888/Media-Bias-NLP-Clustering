The dogs were in a locked building on her farm, which lies at the end of a roughly quarter-mile driveway.\n\n\u201cNo solid leads yet,\u201d Diekman said. \u201cEverybody has been looking on Facebook, on Craigslist.\u201d\n\nThe puppies were 13 weeks old and could be sold for as much as $1,500 each.\n\nDiekman, who is offering a $2,000 reward for the dogs, says the puppies are a rare breed that need a special diet and have unique medical needs.\n\n\u201cI think somebody just heard about them or found out about them,\u201d she said of why they were taken.\n\nDiekman has filed a report with the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office and has been searching nationally for the pups, which do have identifying microchips. The office confirmed the investigation Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re everything.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Greeley dog breeder searching for 5 stolen English Bulldog puppies", "title": "Greeley dog breeder searching for 5 stolen English Bulldog puppies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/21/greeley-dog-breeder-searching-for-5-stolen-english-bulldog-puppies/", "image": {"width": 367, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140921__puppiesp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140921__puppiesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-21T16:44:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:24:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Greeley dog breeder is searching for five English Bulldog puppies she says were stolen from her farm early Saturday morning.\nKandace Diekman says the puppies were taken between about 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. and that she suspects three people were involved in the heist.\nThe dogs were in a locked building on her farm, which lies at the end of a roughly quarter-mile driveway.\n\u201cEverybody has been looking on Facebook, on Craigslist.\u201dThe puppies were 13 weeks old and could be sold for as much as $1,500 each.\nDiekman has filed a report with the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office and has been searching nationally for the pups, which do have identifying microchips."}
