The Palestinians say the barrier has turned out to be a land grab because it slices off almost 10 percent of the West Bank.\n\nThe route of the barrier in the Battir area is before Israel's Supreme Court.\n\nThe lawyer representing village residents, Ghiath Nasser, said Saturday he hopes that the UNESCO recognition will help sway the judges to rule in favor of them.\n\nFriends of the Earth Middle East, an Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian group that joined the high court appeal against the barrier, said Israel needs to find another solution in this part of the West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli military \"failed to strike the needed balance between the interest of security and cultural heritage preservation,\" said Gidon Bromberg, a member of the group. \"We have been saying we can strike another balance. We can meet the need for security through electronic means, without building a physical barrier.\"\n\nIsrael's Defense Ministry, which is responsible for the barrier route, was not immediately available for comment. Foreign Ministry spokesman Paul Hirschson said it's not clear if the barrier route will now be changed.\n\nFILE - In this Sunday, May 6, 2012 file photo, Palestinian farmer Elayan Shami, 62, stands near his field in the West Bank village of Battir.
