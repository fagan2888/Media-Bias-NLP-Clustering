Investigators were canvassing a North Charleston neighborhood for leads Friday morning after a man was killed and another wounded while standing in a yard.

John Robinson II, 29, died at the scene, Charleston County Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin said. It was unclear Friday where Robinson was from, Martin said.

The shooting on Leslie Street was reported shortly before 1:30 a.m., according to North Charleston Police Department spokesman Spencer Pryor. The neighborhood is off Dorchester Road west of Interstate 526.

An initial investigation found that three men walked up to two men in the yard, started shooting and fled in a black Ford Mustang and a gray car, Pryor said. Officers found Robinson in the yard and another man walking around with a gunshot wound in a shoulder.

The three suspects were described by Pryor only as black.

The death was the 14th slaying in North Charleston’s jurisdiction this year and the 68th in the tri-county area, according to The Post and Courier’s homicide database.
