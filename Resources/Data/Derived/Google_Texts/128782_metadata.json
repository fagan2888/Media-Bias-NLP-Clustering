State and federal policymakers should look carefully at the decades-long success of the Wisconsin State Employee Health Plan (WSEHP) in controlling the rapid rise of health insurance costs in Dane County\u2014where Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s state capital, and the University of Wisconsin, are located\u2014as they seek to improve the effectiveness of the ACA\u2019s marketplaces and health insurance costs in general.\n\nThe WSEHP consistently obtains substantially lower health insurance premiums in Dane County than in Wisconsin\u2019s 71 other counties. In 2013, an individual plan in the WSEHP was about $1,400 cheaper annually in Dane County, or 16 percent less than the average in the rest of the state; and a family plan was about $3,500 cheaper, also a 16 percent difference. This Dane difference has existed for at least a decade, with the gap slowly widening over that time.\n\nWhy does WSEHP get much lower premiums in Dane County than in the state\u2019s 71 other counties, and what lessons can policymakers learn from this difference?\n\nExhibit 1. Lowest Individual Monthly Premium Difference from Dane County\n\nBackground\n\nThe WSEHP is one of the longest-running health insurance exchanges programs in the United States, predating the Massachusetts Connector by over 25 years. Since 1983, the WSEHP has provided health insurance for over 72 health insurance exchanges\u2014one exchange for each county in Wisconsin. While it could be argued that the WSEHP operates a single exchange that uses 72 bidding areas, plans are free to choose the individual counties or clusters of counties in which they want to bid. Participating HMOs have historically selected and modified their bidding regions in ways that frequently overlap. These facts make it reasonable to describe Wisconsin\u2019s structure as consisting of 72 separate exchanges. Whether the WSEHP is defined as operating a single exchange with 72 bidding areas, or as overseeing 72 separate exchanges, the analysis that follows is the same.\n\nSince 2003, the operational structure of the WSEHP has remained essentially unchanged. Over 70,000 state employees (which amounts to more than 210,000 covered lives) make an annual choice of a health insurance plan via the \u201cIt\u2019s Your Choice\u201d decision guide. The guide presents the standard benefits package, the health insurance options available in each county, information on cost, plan descriptions, and a quality report card.\n\nThe HMOs available in each county are organized into three cost tiers. Employees pay the least to enroll in the lowest-cost Tier 1 plans. They must pay significantly more if they select a higher-cost Tier 2 plan, and even more if they choose to enroll in a highest-cost Tier 3 plan. Therefore, most state employees select lower-cost Tier 1 plans; very few select a more expensive (to them) and more costly (in terms of total premium) Tier 2 plan (if available) or Tier 3 plan.\n\nIn the few counties where no private HMO has submitted a bid that qualifies for Tier 1, state employees may enroll in a State Maintenance Plan HMO administered by an insurance company that is placed in Tier 1. There is also a statewide PPO that, because of its cost, is placed in Tier 3. Thus, as state employees in any Wisconsin county shop among the available plans and make their selections, their choices are driven by the cost to them of picking a particular plan, the competing plans\u2019 network of providers, and the plans\u2019 reputation for quality.\n\nWhat Could Account For The Dane Difference?\n\nAfter carefully studying the WSEHP\u2019s structure, assessing the premiums bid in all 72 counties, and conducting detailed bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses, we identified and tested seven variables that may explain why the Dane exchange produces such dramatically lower HMO premiums than in the rest of the state: (1) the relative size of the insurance pool, (2) the risk profile of the insurance pool, (3) provider characteristics, (4) the quality of the plans, (5) integrated delivery systems, (6) the intensity of the competition, and (7) program management.\n\nThe relative size of the insurance pool. The Dane County exchange has a much larger pool of purchasers as a share of the county\u2019s population, which may explain why the Dane exchange commands lower premiums. The number of state employees, their spouses, partners, and dependent children who buy health insurance through the WSEHP\u2019s exchange in Dane County constitutes 26.5 percent of the county\u2019s total potential market for individual and group health insurance (private insurance market), far higher than in any other county\u2019s exchange. Only seven other counties even achieve double-digit percentage shares, while enrollees in the WSEHP account for less than 10 percent of the private insurance market in the other 64 counties.\n\nIn short, the WSEHP exchange in Dane County results in a very big volume of buying power while each of the WSEHP\u2019s other 71 exchanges results in only small-scale buying power. Since a big buy typically commands lower prices, the Dane exchange\u2019s big buy may contribute to its lower premiums. Our analysis shows the high level of the WSEHP\u2019s market share in Dane County was one of the variables that may help explain the Dane difference.\n\nThe risk profile of the insurance pool. It is often hypothesized that the population of Dane County is younger, wealthier, and healthier, and that Dane residents have better health behaviors than the rest of Wisconsin. Thus, it is suggested, the risk profile of the WSEHP exchange in Dane County is better than the rest of the state, and therefore cheaper to insure.\n\nIn our multivariate analysis, median income of the county\u2019s entire population emerged as a potential explanatory factor for the Dane difference. It is possible that median income acts as a proxy for education level, health knowledge, and health behaviors. However, other factors, including the county\u2019s average age, differences in gender, overall health ranking, diabetes rate, cancer rate, and low birth weight rate, had no statistically significant explanatory value for the Dane difference.\n\nThese conclusions are limited to the counties\u2019 entire populations. We did not specifically analyze the risk profile of the pool of WSEHP enrollees, though this is an area for future research.\n\nProvider characteristics. As with most states, Wisconsin\u2019s counties vary when it comes to physician-to-population ratios, the number of hospitals per county, and hospital reimbursement rates. Did the Dane exchange achieve better premiums because it differed significantly from the other 71 counties on these measures? For example, the Dane exchange\u2019s premiums might be lower if, for exogenous reasons, Dane hospitals simply charged lower rates.\n\nOur analysis indicates that differences among providers are not explanatory factors. Neither the ratio of physicians to population, nor the number of hospitals in a county, nor hospital reimbursement rates, explain why the Dane exchange got lower premiums than the state\u2019s other 71 exchanges.\n\nThe quality of the plans. The Dane County exchange has four \u201chomegrown\u201d health care plans: Dean Health Plan, Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin, Physicians Plus, and Unity. Each achieves high quality ratings from the members of the WSEHP and from outside evaluators. The WSEHP presents consumers with an \u201coverall quality score\u201d for each plan that is based on composite quality measures gathered by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys and the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) in the areas of wellness and prevention, mental health, disease management, and consumer satisfaction and experiences.\n\nThe Dane County plans scored a non-weighted average of 3.25 out of 4.00 (higher being more satisfactory). This was the highest average quality rating of any county in the state. Twelve counties achieved the next highest score of 3.00. Of the twelve 3.00 scores, six counties offered a Dane County plan. Our research indicates that the relatively higher quality of the Dane exchange\u2019s HMOs may help explain its lower premiums.\n\nIntegrated delivery systems. Only integrated delivery systems compete in the Dane County exchange, and the HMO plans in Dane County are four of only seven integrated health delivery systems that compete in the entire WSEHP. Integrated delivery systems coordinate providers and insurers\u2014that share a bottom line\u2014to achieve lower premiums. The plans competing in Dane County may thus be inherently more cost-effective in delivering health care services. While some of the other 71 exchanges offer some (but not all) of the Dane County HMOs, our analysis suggests that the Dane exchange\u2019s unique structure of competition among integrated delivery systems only\u2014as well as its greater number of competing integrated delivery systems compared to the other 71 exchanges\u2014may explain why the Dane exchange gets lower premiums.\n\nThe intensity of the competition. Dane County\u2019s exchange may achieve lower premiums because of more health plan competition, period. This increased competition is evident in both the absolute number of plans the Dane exchange offers (four), and the ratio of HMOs to the number of state employees or covered lives in the county in general. A simple difference in the number of competing plans, regardless of the quality of the plans or the integrated structure of the plans, might trigger competitive forces that have a positive impact on holding down the Dane exchange\u2019s premiums.\n\nOur research indeed suggested that the greater level of competition found in Dane County may contribute to its lower premiums.\n\nProgram management. It is possible that the Dane exchange benefits from the WSEHP administrators\u2019 putting more effort into controlling costs in Dane County than in the other 71 counties. Approximately half of state employees live in Dane County. Cost control efforts there could produce bigger paybacks. It is conceivable that the WSEHP staff, while on the surface treating all exchanges alike, nonetheless applied more \u201celbow grease\u201d or \u201carm twisting\u201d in the Dane exchange.\n\nWe saw little evidence that the management of the exchange by Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Employee Trust Funds was an explanatory factor. The one potential exception is the managers\u2019 risk adjustment methodology, which has a regional component that may impact premium pricing. The data underlying this and other adjustments were not available to us; thus, this is an issue for further research.\n\nSumming Up: The Policy Implications\n\nIn short, Dane County\u2019s lower premiums appear to stem largely from the Dane exchange\u2019s very high share of the private health insurance market; the relatively higher median income of the Dane County population (and thus, presumably, Dane County members of the WSEHP); and the Dane County exchange\u2019s use of a large number of integrated delivery systems of high quality.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s experience in creating and operating 72 health insurance exchanges over the last several decades provides several important\u2014indeed, compelling\u2014lessons for policymakers. Our research into the Dane difference is particularly useful for state and federal policymakers who are looking for ways to refine the ACA\u2019s marketplaces to better control costs and improve quality.\n\nInterestingly, all four integrated delivery systems that compete in the WSEHP in Dane County have also competed for two years in Wisconsin\u2019s federally facilitated ACA Marketplace in Dane County (which itself comprises one of the Marketplace\u2019s bidding regions in Wisconsin). Our analysis of silver plan premiums for 2014 for a 27 year-old individual shows that the ACA exchange in Dane County also achieves significantly lower premiums than the ACA\u2019s exchanges in Wisconsin\u2019s other counties. The same pattern holds regardless of age.\n\nExhibit 2. ACA Premium Difference Between Dane County\u2019s Lowest-Bidding Plan and Other Counties\u2019 Lowest-Bidding Plan for 2014\n\nBased on the strength of our evidence, it would be reasonable for policymakers to conclude that an exchange is far more likely to hold down premiums and costs, without sacrificing quality, if the exchange also has at least one, and optimally more than one, of the following features:\n\nThe exchange\u2019s pool comprises a very large percentage of the privately insured lives in the exchange\u2019s bidding region; The exchanges offers a large number of high-quality plans; and Those plans are integrated delivery systems.\n\nThese conclusions assume that the exchange provides pooled members with a standard benefit package, and that it offers them a clear economic incentive to choose a low-premium health care plan by requiring them to pay a portion, if not the full extra cost, of a plan that offers a higher premium.\n\nFor additional information, including tables and charts that present the specific results of the bivariate and multivariate analyses we conducted, see our full report.
