The goal is to produce a consensus report by the end of 2016.\n\nGenome editing has excited scientists for its potential to benefit the world, such as altering insects\u2019 ability to carry malaria or dengue fever, making crops hardier and correcting genetic defects in animals.\n\nIt also is viewed as a way to one day disrupt or recode human genes that cause illnesses like Huntington\u2019s disease, sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and possibly even cancer and dementia.\n\nThe questions are about where to set boundaries, identify what is safe and decide what is ethical \u2014 especially since altering a group of cells called the germ line would affect all descendants.\n\nGroups like the Center for Genetics and Society are urging scientists to just say no to gene editing in human embryos and reproductive cells.\n\n\u201cThe controversy about germ line gene editing often downplays important points, including that we have other ways to avoid transmitting serious genetic diseases to future generations,\u201d said Marcy Darnovsky, the center\u2019s executive director and a speaker on a summit panel Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOthers have warned of a future in which people use gene editing to \u201cdesign\u201d their children\u2019s physical characteristics, revive eugenics-style reproduction to target \u201cundesirable\u201d types of people and create partially human creatures to provide organs for human transplant.\n\n\u201cWe are at a critical juncture in genetic research,\u201d the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said in an explanation about its efforts to provide an international consensus study of human gene editing.\n\nIts study is expected to examine the clinical, ethical, legal and social implications of the new technologies, offer advice to Congress and other U.S. leaders and provide a framework for guidelines that other countries can use.\n\nAmong the summit\u2019s speakers: John P. Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Jennifer A. Doudna, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at University of California, Berkeley; Emmanuelle Charpentier, director at the Max Planck Institute of Infection Biology in Berlin; and Feng Zhang, professor of biomedical engineering at the Broad Institute of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMs. Doudna, Ms. Charpentier and Mr. Zhang are known for their roles in developing genome-editing techniques.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As scientists gather Tuesday to discuss the possibilities &mdash; and ethics &mdash; of \"editing\" human genes, advocacy groups are urging them to ban the practice if it involves human reproduction.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As scientists gather Tuesday to discuss the possibilities \u2014 and ethics \u2014 of \u201cediting\u201d human genes, advocacy groups are urging them to ban the practice if it involves human reproduction.", "title": "Gene \u2018editing\u2019 ethics questioned for human reproduction", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/30/gene-editing-ethics-questioned-for-human-reproduct/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/Gene_Editing_News_Guide.JPEG-0a664.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/Gene_Editing_News_Guide.JPEG-0a664.jpg", "description": "As scientists gather Tuesday to discuss the possibilities &mdash; and ethics &mdash; of \"editing\" human genes, advocacy groups are urging them to ban the practice if it involves human reproduction.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gene \u2018editing\u2019 ethics questioned for human reproduction"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma"}, "article_summary": "As scientists gather Tuesday to discuss the possibilities \u2014 and ethics \u2014 of \u201cediting\u201d human genes, advocacy groups are urging them to ban the practice if it involves human reproduction.\nBeginning Tuesday some 500 scientists, scholars, ethicists and policymakers from 20 countries are gathering in Washington for an international summit on human gene editing.\nGroups like the Center for Genetics and Society are urging scientists to just say no to gene editing in human embryos and reproductive cells.\nOthers have warned of a future in which people use gene editing to \u201cdesign\u201d their children\u2019s physical characteristics, revive eugenics-style reproduction to target \u201cundesirable\u201d types of people and create partially human creatures to provide organs for human transplant.\nThat news prompted the National Institutes of Health to say it would not fund any research into genome editing of human embryos."}
