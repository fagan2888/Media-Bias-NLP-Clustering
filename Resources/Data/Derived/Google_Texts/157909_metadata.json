(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nOn Wednesday, labor unions, immigrant groups and environmental activists gathered in the bowels of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center for the latest of many news conferences decrying a request by President Obama to speed up approval of a massive free trade deal.\n\n\u201cHow dumb do you think we are?\u201d asked Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California AFL-CIO. \u201cWall Street got rich off free trade, and now they\u2019re coming back for more.\u201d\n\nThe White House and congressional Republican brass are allied in a full-court press for lawmakers to pass \u201ctrade promotion authority,\u201d or \u201cfast track,\u201d for a series of international trade agreements. Populist Democrats are pushing back \u2014 but so are some on the far right. These unlikely political partners share some of the left\u2019s objections to Obama\u2019s push on free trade. The groups diverge on other issues: some on the right, for example, worry whether the president will make trade free enough.\n\n[Critical of Obama\u2019s executive actions, GOP now wants to give him more power on trade]\n\n\u201cWe have had wonderful working relationships with everybody, even people we\u2019re not too sure about, right, Rosa?\u201d asked Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.), in her speech to the hundreds of gathered steelworkers and tree huggers, speaking to ringleader Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) \"I mean, people we don\u2019t even talk to.\u201d\n\nSlaughter knows they need those \u201cpeople we\u2019re not too sure about\u201d -- tea partyers, really -- to round up enough votes to kill the bill, which the administration has said it needs to make the trade deal happen at all. But with this strange-bedfellows alliance, the two factions stay separate, like oil and water.\n\n\"We count our side, but we have good reason to believe there are a lot of people on the Republican side who feel the same way,\u201d Slaughter said, in the hallway after her speech. \"It\u2019s not that we\u2019re not talking to them, we just don\u2019t put any pressure on them.\u201d DeLauro, however, confirmed that cross-party communication was minimal. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to my Republican colleagues,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have had wonderful working relationships with everybody, even people we\u2019re not too sure about, right, Rosa? I mean, people we don\u2019t even talk to.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Louise Slaughter\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s difficult to determine how many conservatives will actually buck their leadership and vote against fast track. In 2013, 23 House Republicans sent a letter opposing it, and Rep. Walter Jones (D-N.C.) now figures it's up to \"30 or 40.\" But a spokeswoman for Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) says she expects to release a letter endorsing fast track, with 27 Republican House freshmen signing on. (Still, that leaves 16 who didn\u2019t.)\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to hold together a coalition when you\u2019re able to keep track of everyone\u2019s votes. When you\u2019re not, because the two sides detest each other on almost every issue, it becomes darn near impossible. But this time, there might be enough energy from Congress's far left and far right flanks to stop the deal from happening \u2014 if they can defeat the moderates within their own parties.\n\n----\n\nWith the exception of a sparsely attended news conference by a collection of libertarian groups at the end of January, the tea party opponents to fast track authority don\u2019t really have the manpower of their allies on the left.\n\nRather, they have people like Stephani Scruggs, the Florida-based former co-chair of Glenn Beck\u2019s 912 Project, who was in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. Brandishing a long list of signatures from tea party groups, she took a few days to tell House Republicans \u2014 especially freshmen \u2014 why they should vote against something they\u2019re supposed to be for: Free trade.\n\nThe first thing they need to know is that this isn\u2019t really about free trade, she says.\n\n\"The bottom line is this,\u201d says Scruggs, sitting in the cafeteria of the Rayburn House Office Building after a long day of canvassing with fellow conservative activists Crista Huff and Dena Espenscheid. \"It\u2019s incredibly hypocritical that Republican leadership that just sued this president for executive overreach now wants to give him constitutional powers. For me it\u2019s a black and white issue. It\u2019s constitutional. And I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Barack Obama or George Bush or Bill Clinton.\"\n\nThe scary thing about fast track authority, for opponents on the left and the right, is that it forces Congress to accept or reject the treaty as negotiated, with no amendments or filibusters. And at the moment, few people know what they\u2019d even be voting on, since the U.S. Trade Representative only allows members of Congress to see the treaty in person, without taking notes, and swears them to secrecy.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly what Scruggs focuses on as a coordinator of an ad hoc coalition called End Global Governance, which seeks to \u201cprotect American sovereignty\u201d from intergovernmental treaties and multinational institutions, and director of Coalition for a Strong America, which aims to counter the influence of \u201cwell financed unions.\" But when Scruggs also dives into the agreement itself, she starts to sound a lot like the liberals she usually fights against.\n\nTake the issue of so-called \u201ccurrency manipulation,\u201d or the strategy of some countries to devalue their currency in order to keep their own exports cheap. Labor groups have pressed the administration to address currency manipulation in the deal, which the White House has resisted out of concerns it could constrain the United States' own monetary policy tools.\n\n\"If we\u2019re not going to address currency manipulation, what are we even talking about?\u201d Scruggs asks. \"You can talk about tariffs all you want, but all Singapore has to do to recoup the losses that they would\u2019ve had under tariffs, is tweak their currency.\"\n\nOr take the Investor State Dispute Settlement, a provision that allows foreign companies to sue governments if they feel wronged, which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried in a Washington Post op-ed (the White House countered that attack, but in another sign of the mixed-up politics of trade, the Cato Institute sided with Warren).\n\n\"Let\u2019s say the Honda plant gets upset with Alabama\u2019s water quality standards. All they have to do is go before a world court and say that it impeded their expected profits,\u201d Scruggs says. \u201cWe could potentially have cities and states go bankrupt overnight over one judgment, and turn into Detroit.\u201d (That\u2019s probably hyperbole, but you get the point.)\n\nOverall, the tea party trio in the Rayburn cafeteria espouses the same thing as labor groups have for years: Demand that other countries raise their standards before throwing open the doors to trade.\n\n\"You tell them, 'When you get your act together, then we will consider doing business with your country,\u2019 \u201d Huff said. Espenscheid even used the term \u201cfair trade,\u201d a typically liberal talking point, saying that labor standards are so low in some of the developing countries that are party to the agreement that there\u2019s no way American businesses can compete.\n\n\"I\u2019m all for the free market,\u201d Espenscheid says. \u201cBut nobody knows what that means anymore.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m all for the free market. But nobody knows what that means anymore.\" \u2014 Dena Espenscheid\n\nIn fact, some of the anti-fast track conservative groups worry that the Obama administration, even by negotiating greater access to foreign markets, is actually engaging in \u201cmanaged trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica wins because we do a better job of creating those products, we have better innovation and we have smarter marketers. That\u2019s what we think of when we think of free trade,\u201d says Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of, 'you\u2019re allowed to sell another 100,000 chickens into Japan.' That\u2019s just cutting a deal for how much of a market you\u2019re allowed to infiltrate.\u201d\n\nManning has tried to bring other tea party groups into the anti-fast track campaign by arguing that Obama shouldn\u2019t be trusted negotiating trade deals in secret \u2014 calling it \u201cObamatrade,\u201d in a reference to the derisive term for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and got most of the major organizations to sign on to a letter to that effect in mid-January. But when it comes to burning up the phone lines on Capitol Hill, they just don\u2019t care about trade as much as they do about things like immigration and the national debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a real hot issue, frankly,\u201d said Tea Party Patriots spokesman Kevin Broughton.\n\n----\n\nPart of the problem that fast track\u2019s tea party opponents face is that many of their one-time allies on Capitol Hill have abandoned them this time around.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), for example, was once a tea party hero for his efforts to cut the budget. That faded when he started compromising with Democrats, and in recent months he\u2019s become one of the loudest proponents of trade promotion authority on the Hill. Even the filibustering Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) expressed support for fast track, saying it\u2019s a structural shift in order to facilitate free trade agreements being negotiated and adopted.\"\n\nThen there are the think tanks: The tea party-friendly Heritage Foundation has been guardedly in favor of granting trade promotion authority to the president, arguing that it could be tightly tailored to make sure the agreement comports with free trade ideals (i.e., doesn\u2019t have too many labor or environmental protections baked in). The Heartland Institute, which helped get the tea party started, thinks fast track is fine as long as Congress indicates it\u2019s actually willing to kill an unsatisfactory deal.\n\n\u201cThat is the very threat that keeps a president from overstepping his bounds in tailoring an agreement,\u201d says research director S.T. Karnick.\n\nThe problem is, renegotiation according to the U.S. Congress\u2019 desires is no easy feat with 13 countries involved; rejecting the agreement the first time could make it fall apart entirely. Legislators recognize that, and if they\u2019re not able to amend the treaty, might accept a lot of distasteful things just to allow it to happen at all.\n\nThat\u2019s why, for Manning, getting conservatives to focus on the part of their brains that opposes executive overreach and what he calls \"crony capitalism\" rather than the part that favors free trade can be a challenge.\n\n\u201cFree trade, it\u2019s the shiny object. You say, 'Yes, that\u2019s good,' and it\u2019s kind of built in to our DNA,\u201d Manning says. \u201cWhen you say, 'In this case, it\u2019s not good,' you have to get people to reevaluate core principles.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with further information about those for against trade promotion authority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're both trying to stop the Obama administration from fast tracking a deal -- but they don't coordinate to make it happen.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "They're both trying to stop the Obama administration from fast tracking a deal -- but they don't coordinate to make it happen.", "title": "On free trade, tea partyers and the left want the same thing", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/06/on-free-trade-tea-partyers-and-the-left-want-the-same-thing/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/25/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2015-01-27T170630Z_01_WASC202_RTRIDSP_3_USA-TRADE-FROMAN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/06/on-free-trade-tea-partyers-and-the-left-want-the-same-thing/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "tree trade, congress tree trade, tea party free trade", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "tree trade, congress tree trade, tea party free trade"}, "article_summary": "The first thing they need to know is that this isn\u2019t really about free trade, she says.\nThat\u2019s what we think of when we think of free trade,\u201d says Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government.\nThese unlikely political partners share some of the left\u2019s objections to Obama\u2019s push on free trade.\nThe groups diverge on other issues: some on the right, for example, worry whether the president will make trade free enough.\nTea partyers haven't used the same tactics as left-wing populists, but a few of them are working against fast track, too."}
