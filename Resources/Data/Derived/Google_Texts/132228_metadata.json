The theme tonight seemed to be \u201cplatitudes and happy talk.\u201d It did not lack bromides: \u201cThe future we want \u2013 opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2013 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.\u201d What did we learn?\n\nFirst, the president is either utterly unaware of or unwilling to admit his own role in perpetuating divisiveness and polarization. After seven years of accusing Republicans of everything from \u201csocial Darwinism\u201d to putting party above country, he now insists we \u201cneed to fix our politics.\u201d It seems that is what he promised to do seven years ago, and obviously was exceptionally unsuccessful. Instead of compromise and conciliation, he rebuffed a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d and jammed through Obamacare on a party-line vote and abused executive power to go around Congress on immigration, guns and the environment. Instead of making an effort to woo Congress, he ignored even his own party. When he now says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic\u201d, it is hard to take seriously.\n\nSecond, the president chooses not to recognize reality on the international scene, where insults and challenges to the U.S. are commonplace. He insists our enemies aren\u2019t getting stronger. He should ask our allies. In his view, \u201cas we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into [terrorists\u2019] hands.\u201d Even worse, he repeated aloud that the Islamic State \u201cdoes not threaten our existence.\u201d That was greeted with dead silence. Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t dare adopt that nonchalant view, nor I suspect with Democratic lawmakers running in 2016.\n\nHe still swings at straw men: \u201cWe also can\u2019t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It\u2019s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq \u2013 and we should have learned it by now.\u201d He ignores calls even within his own party for a more robust foreign policy. His surreal declaration about Syria \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace\u201d \u2014 ignores the massive suffering, the encampment of the Islamic State and presence of pro-Assad and Russian forces. He seems entirely oblivious to the disasters, unmoved by our loss of influence. The hundreds of thousands dead in Syria got no mention.\n\nThird, despite Tuesday\u2019s seizure of Navy boats and multiple provocations from Iran he insists that \u201cwith sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\u201d Avoided another war?! We have wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere. The brevity of his remarks on Iran however suggest it has not turned out to be the historic deal he painted it to be.\n\nFourth, he is out of material. There is no new content to his vision of the future. Free college, free pre-K, and keeping Obamacare. There is, it is said, there is nothing new under the sun. Or in his speech and agenda. He defines the problems (e.g. globalization), but his solutions consist of more government with no connection to the challenges at hand. His big idea \u2014 eradicating cancer \u2014 is noble but has been proceeding apace without VP Joe Biden, whom he named to lead the effort.\n\nFifth, he knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is getting heaps of credit for focusing on poverty. With zero ideas of his own, he essentially said, \u201cMe too!\u201d (\u201cI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I\u2019d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.\u201d)\n\nSixth, Democrats are ready to play another round of \u201cgranny over the cliff\u201d scare tactics. (\u201cSocial Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn\u2019t weaken them , we should strengthen them.\u201d) You would never know we have a massive debt. He\u2019s given up on that, and has no plans to address it.\n\nSeventh, he really does not understand how his policies affect the private sector. He seemed genuinely concerned that regulations and \u201cred tape\u201d crimp business. Of course, he has thrown massive regulations \u2014 from EPA to Obamacare \u2014 onto the backs of business.\n\nEighth, it wasn\u2019t short, running well over an hour.\n\nFinally, his cheery tone and \u201ceverything is getting better\u201d tone is totally at odds with the national mood. Most Americans think the economy is not vibrant, watch the U.S. getting kicked around the world, and have seen no real effort to address cronyism. (Break up the big banks? End energy subsidies?) The contrast between his serenity and candidates on both sides channeling public anger is dramatic.\n\nSome might think that with his bland final State of the Union, Obama is going out with a whimper. But our enemies won\u2019t let up. Never have so many hot spots popped up with so many aggressive foes and disheartened allies. International turmoil and puny growth threaten minimal gains. If only reality weren\u2019t such a drag. Unfortunately, the next president will have a heck of a mess to clean up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A president who lost his mojo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A president who lost his mojo", "title": "State of the Union: A president out of touch, out of ideas", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/01/12/state-of-the-union-a-president-out-of-touch-out-of-ideas/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/13/National-Politics/Images/RIC_902614526510791452651611.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/01/12/state-of-the-union-a-president-out-of-touch-out-of-ideas/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama sotu, obama state of the union, obama fix politics, fix iran", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama sotu, obama state of the union, obama fix politics, fix iran"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe191d\"", "article_summary": "In his last State of the Union address, President Obama took shots at Republican presidential candidates, expressed one of his \"few regrets,\" and said he's \"as confident as I have ever been that the state of our union is strong.\"\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)We were promised a \u201cthematic\u201d State of the Union address.\nSome might think that with his bland final State of the Union, Obama is going out with a whimper.\nFirst, the president is either utterly unaware of or unwilling to admit his own role in perpetuating divisiveness and polarization.\nSecond, the president chooses not to recognize reality on the international scene, where insults and challenges to the U.S. are commonplace."}
