But after failing to include relief language in the December budget deal, Congress returns this week with a Puerto Rico bill near the top of its agenda.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) wants legislation on the floor by the end of March. The House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees U.S. territories, plans a hearing on Tuesday to consider establishing a powerful financial-control board to restructure debt and oversee finances without taking away the island\u2019s self-government. The committee hopes to have a bill ready for mark up by the end of February.\n\nThe White House has been asking for a package of relief for months to no avail. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew flew to Puerto Rico on Jan. 20, and President Obama talked it over with Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last week.\n\nDemocrats late last year coalesced around the idea that Puerto Rico, like Detroit, needed to have the Chapter 9 bankruptcy option to reach a deal with the most-recalcitrant bondholders. The administration also called for additional transfer payments and for the idea that many Republicans support: a financial-control board with the power to help restructure all of the commonwealth\u2019s debts.\n\n\u201cMy administration has put forward a comprehensive proposal to give Puerto Rico the necessary tools to address its crisis, create a path to recovery,\u201d Obama told Democrats at their retreat in Baltimore on Thursday. \u201cAnd the most urgent tool that we need right now \u2014 a comprehensive restructuring authority \u2014 costs taxpayers nothing and will help more Americans regain control of their own economic security. That\u2019s the kind of thing Democrats believe in.\u201d\n\nWith roughly 1 million Puerto Ricans living \u2014 and voting \u2014 in Florida, a solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis is becoming the kind of thing all politicians believe in.\n\nMeanwhile, running out of cash in the face of new debt payments, the island\u2019s negotiators are inching forward on their own.\n\nIn a meeting Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s government floated a proposal that would restructure about $49 billion of the commonwealth\u2019s crushing $72 billion in debt, covering bonds issued by 17 government entities.\n\nThe deal would suspend principal repayments for five years, reduce interest rates that the territory is paying for five years, and swap existing debt for new 35-year bonds backed by all of the island\u2019s tax revenues instead of specific streams of taxes, according to a person briefed on the proposal. The territory would issue $26.5 billion of the new \u201cbase bonds,\u201d a figure roughly valued as the same as the old ones, on average, in the market. Creditors holding higher quality bonds would get larger portions.\n\nIn a novel twist, the deal also could give bondholders a way of capturing part of the upside of any recovery that may outstrip forecasts. If a recovery is greater than the 4.5 percent annual nominal rate that\u2019s anticipated, the commonwealth would give creditors a quarter of the extra revenues, but not for the next decade. To do this, Puerto Rico would issue $22.7 billion of \u201cgrowth bonds\u201d that would expire after 35 years.\n\nThe likelihood of that sort of upside, though, is remote. Puerto Rico is hemorrhaging money and people; about 3,000 a week are fleeing its sinking economy. And now tourism could take a hit. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently advised pregnant women to postpone travel to the island because of the spread of the Zika virus there. The virus is suspected as a possible cause of congenital brain abnormalities in newborns. Puerto Rico is among 24 countries and territories now listed on the CDC\u2019s Zika travel alert.\n\nTurning around the island\u2019s decade-long economic decline will take years, even though the government has boosted taxes and cut spending to get its fiscal house in order. On Jan. 18, advisers to the Puerto Rican government said that the commonwealth\u2019s shortfall for meeting debt payments had grown to $16 billion over the next five years, up about $2 billion from September estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating economic conditions and delays in a solution.\n\n\u201cOur crisis is real and getting worse as time passes,\u201d said Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico.\n\nTo complete any restructuring deal, the Obama administration and negotiators for the island continue to press Congress to give Puerto Rico the option of filing for bankruptcy protection or to create a financial-control board to corral bondholders reluctant to accept lower terms. As a territory, Puerto Rico lacks those options.\n\nLately the administration\u2019s rhetoric has omitted Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which would cover only about a third of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and is opposed by many Republicans. But it stresses the need for an authority to enforce debt restructuring.\n\n\u201cThe people of Puerto Rico are sacrificing, but unless that sacrifice is shared by creditors in an orderly restructuring, there is no path out of insolvency and back to growth,\u201d Lew said in prepared remarks made in Puerto Rico. \u201cWithout congressional action, Puerto Rico will face a long and difficult recovery that could have harmful consequences for the American citizens who call the island home.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico could become a politically contentious issue this election year. With a population of about 3.5 million people, and about a million Puerto Ricans living in Florida, lawmakers in both parties want to avoid seeming deaf to the pleas for assistance there.\n\nOne sign of the obstacles that still lie ahead is the trouble sealing a deal reached in December to restructure the debt of the badly managed Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Although negotiators for the territory were able to persuade the bulk of bondholders, including two reluctant bond insurance firms, to agree to new terms, that deal has been mired in controversy in Puerto Rico, where local politicians \u2014 anxious about what they might give away \u2014 balked at adopting legislation blessing the deal.\n\nOne bondholder said sarcastically that Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature \u201cmade our Congress seem downright competent.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, Pedro R. Pierluisi, the territory\u2019s sole member of Congress, said on Tuesday that there had been only one hearing on the PREPA deal in Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature, which he said needs more time. He said the bill \u2014 called the PREPA Revitalization Act \u2014 \u201cappears to be full of defects or areas that need to be revised.\u201d He said the amendments take up 35 or 36 pages.\n\nHe said that the bill would undercut a recently appointed energy commission that oversees the utility, even though bondholders prefer a new board to run the utility more independently. And Pierluisi said that he feared the restructuring deal would raise the island\u2019s already high rates and limit investment, whereas the dealmakers say that the restructuring would have the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because this negotiation with PREPA has already taken 18 months,\u201d he said, \u201cand it could serve as a template for other similar restructuring deals.\u201d\n\nThough negotiators had set a Jan. 22 deadline for Puerto Rico to adopt legislation approving the deal, the bondholders group on Wednesday agreed to extend the date to Feb. 16 and linked the legislation to a $111 million payment.\n\n\u201cHearing from the politicians on the island that they want to get the deal done and that this extension would give them the time they needed was key for us,\u201d said Dan Zacchei of Sloane & Co., a communications firm representing major bondholders. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do but the goal now is for everyone to stay on the same page and get this across the finish line.\u201d\n\nHarder problems lie ahead. Even if Puerto Rico, the White House and Congress agree on a financial-control board, Republicans and Democrats still differ on other parts of a package that the administration is seeking.\n\nThe administration has said it wants a special allocation to balance Medicaid funds that Puerto Rico doesn\u2019t get; Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) wants to pay for that by taking funds from Obama\u2019s health-care plan. Half the Puerto Rican population, or about 1.6 million people, are on Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act provided funds that run out in fiscal 2018.\n\nThe administration also wants to extend the earned-income tax credit to Puerto Rico, which doesn\u2019t pay federal income taxes and therefore doesn\u2019t currently get the EITC. Republicans have adamantly opposed anything they say might resemble a bailout of Puerto Rico.\n\nTime is running short. The government has not paid tax refunds, it has raided state pension funds, and it owes money to suppliers and contractors. In May, the island\u2019s Government Development Bank is supposed to pay $400 million to bondholders, and in July, the government must pay $1 billion more. One of the government\u2019s advisers said they \u201cdid not have tricks left up our sleeve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where suppliers are stretched as far as we can stretch them,\u201d said Jim Millstein, a former Treasury official and a restructuring expert advising Puerto Rico\u2019s governor. During a Jan. 18 conference call, he said that would mean no more supplies for hospitals or schools and further blows to the economy.\n\n\u201cWhen we don\u2019t give taxpayers their money, that means that\u2019s money they aren\u2019t spending,\u201d he said. Money paid to bondholders is flowing out of the territory, hurting growth further. Millstein said, \u201cWe have to get something done with creditors; otherwise, there will be widespread defaults.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House begins consideration of a relief plan this week.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steven.mufson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The House begins consideration of a relief plan this week.", "title": "Washington tries to weigh in as Puerto Rico struggles to find a solution to its debt crisis", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/washington-tries-to-weigh-in-as-puerto-rico-struggles-to-find-a-solution-to-its-debt-crisis/2016/02/01/1821955a-c516-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/01/National-Economy/Images/05114130-1127.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@StevenMufson"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/washington-tries-to-weigh-in-as-puerto-rico-struggles-to-find-a-solution-to-its-debt-crisis/2016/02/01/1821955a-c516-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steven.mufson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1821955a-c516-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "business"}, "article_summary": "There is one thing that Republicans and Democrats can agree on in this partisan period: Puerto Rico is in deep economic trouble.\n\u201cOur crisis is real and getting worse as time passes,\u201d said Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico.\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing Democrats believe in.\u201dWith roughly 1 million Puerto Ricans living \u2014 and voting \u2014 in Florida, a solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis is becoming the kind of thing all politicians believe in.\nPuerto Rico is hemorrhaging money and people; about 3,000 a week are fleeing its sinking economy.\nLately the administration\u2019s rhetoric has omitted Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which would cover only about a third of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and is opposed by many Republicans."}
