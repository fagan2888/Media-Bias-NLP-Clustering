I thought the last thing I’d write for TMT would be my farewell letter to all of my fans, but due to the economy and Obamacare, I had no choice but to renew my contract with this fine organization. My first new assignment was delivered to me by my manager, Skarl Poogers, who slammed his genitalia on my desk yesterday. On his erect shaft, it read: New Selena Gomez announces new video and album. Write about it, dipshit.

So this is my life again. I quickly found out that if you pre-order the new Selena Gomez album, Revival, which is due October 9 on Interscope Records, you get a download of the single “Same Old Love.” Album options include a deluxe edition, Target deluxe version with 16 tracks, and a limited-edition deluxe version with an autographed journal, a forward by Gomez, color vinyl, and unreleased photos. Pre-orders also include advance ticket access for Gomez’s upcoming U.S. tour.
