Kelsey McKinney draws my attention this morning to the latest USDA report on the kinds of foods we eat, and the chart on the right shows what it has to say about vegetables.\n\nIs this for real? Since when are potatoes vegetables? I mean, I'm delighted by this news since it means my mother has been wrong all these years when she badgers me about not eating enough vegetables. Hell, it turns out that the bag of potato chips in my pantry apparently counts too. I'll be sure to have some with my lunch today.\n\nStill, I suspect that mom is right, which makes this a pretty depressing chart. Regardless of how the USDA classifies them, I'll continue to put potatoes (and corn) into the starch food group. Aside from that, it appears that we eat plenty of salad (head lettuce, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes) but not much of anything else. All the things we traditionally think of as vegetables (broccoli, peas, beans, etc.) are consumed in such tiny quantities they don't even show up.\n\nThat's terrible. Eat your vegetables, America!", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "But we sure eat lots of potatoes.", "title": "America sucks at eating vegetables", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/06/america-sucks-eating-vegetables", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_usda_vegetable_consumption_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "America sucks at eating vegetables", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/06/america-sucks-eating-vegetables", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_usda_vegetable_consumption_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_usda_vegetable_consumption_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Food", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb176\"", "article_summary": "Since when are potatoes vegetables?\nEat your vegetables, America!\nI mean, I'm delighted by this news since it means my mother has been wrong all these years when she badgers me about not eating enough vegetables.\nAside from that, it appears that we eat plenty of salad (head lettuce, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes) but not much of anything else.\nRegardless of how the USDA classifies them, I'll continue to put potatoes (and corn) into the starch food group."}
