Actor and comedian Will Ferrell has come under fire after helping pitch the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to millions of uninsured Americans.

The ‘Anchorman’ actor was pitching the program to the “young invincible” crowd. It is that crowd that needs to sign up en masse in order for Obamacare to become a success. Without their participation there is simply not enough people funding the Affordable Health Care Act to make it work.

The post titled #GetCovered was posted to Facebook on Monday. Almost immediately after it was posted Facebook users began to attack the comedians decision. The biggest problem Ferrell fans have with his post? The fact that he was wading into a sea of politics.

Users have directed most of their anger at the post by linking to right-wing muckraking sites that include World Net Daily and Townhall.

Here are a few examples of the comments being made against Will Ferrell:
