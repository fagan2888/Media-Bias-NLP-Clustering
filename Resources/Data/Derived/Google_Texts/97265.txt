NEW YORK (AP) — “Downton Abbey” won’t be the only place fans can see Elizabeth McGovern this winter: The show’s star is heading on a tour with her folk-rock band in December.

McGovern is the lead singer for Sadie and the Hotheads, which embarks on its first U.S. tour Dec. 4 in Washington. The 10-date tour wraps Dec. 14 in Hartford, Connecticut.

McGovern plays the role of American heiress Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham, on the hit “Downton Abbey,” which has its fifth season premiere on Jan. 4. The timing of the tour and the show’s return is a coincidence, McGovern said.

“It’s a slightly funny experience for fans of the show to come hear the music because it’s such a different world to the show itself,” McGovern told The Associated Press on Sunday. “When we first started touring there would be a lot of people carrying ‘Downtown Abbey’ books … and I could see a look of surprise on their faces because it isn’t what you expect. I mean it’s not a classical quartet of violins.”

The PBS series has earned the 53-year-old actress Golden Globe and Emmy nominations.

Sadie and the Hotheads have performed in Europe. The seven-member group released their debut album in 2007 and dropped their third album, “Still Waiting,” earlier this year.
