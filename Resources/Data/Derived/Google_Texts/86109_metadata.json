The stretch would run between Lewis and Las Posas roads in Camarillo, near where Kostiuchenko was hit and killed Oct. 28.\n\nKostiuchenko, 41, was wrapping up a traffic stop on the northbound side of the highway near the Lewis on-ramp when Kevin Hogrefe, 25, of Camarillo, hit him with his vehicle, police said. The suspect, who is free on bail, kept driving but was arrested near Las Posas, authorities said.\n\nHogrefe is suspected of driving under the influence and was charged with murder and felony hit and run. He is scheduled to return to court July 15.\n\nKostiuchenko was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and had a master\u2019s degree in linguistics. He served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and was fluent in four languages. While with the Sheriff\u2019s Office, he worked in detention services and eventually became a patrol deputy in Camarillo. He had aspirations of becoming a canine handler and a member of the sheriff\u2019s bomb team.\n\nHe was an avid runner who had participated in a 120-mile race from Baker to Las Vegas with other local officers.\n\n\u201cDeputy Kostiuchenko is truly missed by all who had the pleasure and honor of knowing him, and this designation will serve as a fitting tribute to an extraordinary deputy and gentleman,\u201d Long said in a letter to her fellow board members.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take up the matter at 3 p.m. Tuesday during its meeting in the Hall of Administration, 800 S. Victoria Ave., Ventura.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Supervisor wants highway dedicated to Camarillo deputy killed in crash", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/camarillo/supervisor-wants-highway-dedicated-to-camarillo-deputy-killed-in-crash-ep-1068669291-345079762.html", "image": {"width": 384, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/kostiuchenko_17842178_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long will ask her fellow board members Tuesday to adopt a resolution dedicating a portion of Highway 101 to a Camarillo sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy killed in the line of duty last year.", "title": "Supervisor wants highway dedicated to Camarillo deputy killed in crash"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/kostiuchenko_17842178_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long will ask her fellow board members Tuesday to adopt a resolution dedicating a portion of Highway 101 to a Camarillo sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy killed in the line of duty last year.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supervisor wants highway dedicated to Camarillo deputy killed in crash"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The stretch would run between Lewis and Las Posas roads in Camarillo, near where Kostiuchenko was hit and killed Oct. 28.\nThe suspect, who is free on bail, kept driving but was arrested near Las Posas, authorities said.\nWhile with the Sheriff\u2019s Office, he worked in detention services and eventually became a patrol deputy in Camarillo.\nBy Cindy Von Quednow of the Ventura County StarVentura County Supervisor Kathy Long will ask her fellow board members Tuesday to adopt a resolution dedicating a portion of Highway 101 to a Camarillo sheriff\u2019s deputy killed in the line of duty last year.\nKostiuchenko, 41, was wrapping up a traffic stop on the northbound side of the highway near the Lewis on-ramp when Kevin Hogrefe, 25, of Camarillo, hit him with his vehicle, police said."}
