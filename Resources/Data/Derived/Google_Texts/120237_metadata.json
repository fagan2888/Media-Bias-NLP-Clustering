Extroverts tend to be talkative, lively, easily bored, assertive, opinionated, and outspoken. If one person on a crew always wants to talk, while others are less social, \u201cit could actually get pretty annoying,\u201d study researcher Suzanne Bell, an associate professor of psychology at DePaul University in Chicago, told LiveScience.\n\nThe vehicles designed to travel to Mars are very tiny, and each person has little to no privacy. For the NASA-funded study, Bell and her colleagues reviewed previous research on teams who lived in environments similar to that of the Mars mission, including simulated spacecraft missions of more than 100 days and missions in Antarctica.\n\nOne virtual 520-day Mars mission isolated six volunteer astronauts for nearly a year and a half to simulate a mission to Mars and back to Earth. During this mission, an extroverted team member did not get along well with two of the other, introverted members. \u201cThey thought he was too brash, and would speak his mind too much, and talk too much,\u201d Bell said.\n\nIf all goes as planned, and the extroverts aren\u2019t too annoying on the way to Mars, what will they do once they arrive on the red planet? According to the Mars One website, the astronauts will be doing research, construction, and maintenance on the new settlement, and will have time to relax and enjoy activities down on Earth, like reading, playing games, watching TV, using the Internet, and contacting friends and family at home.\n\nHowever, the astronauts will be surrounded by the same people and things that they may get bored. \u201cPeople who are extroverted might have a hard time coping because they want to be doing a lot; they want to be engaged in a lot of things,\u201d said study researched Shanique Brown, a graduate student in industrial and organizational psychology at DePaul. \u201cAnd [on these missions], there won\u2019t be that much to do \u2014 things become monotonous after a while, and you\u2019re seeing the same people.\u201d\n\nDespite this new study, this does not mean extroverts can\u2019t go to Mars. More research and space-simulation environment experiments need to be done to find the perfect balance of extroverts and introverts.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an introvert or extrovert, do you want to head to Mars? As long as you\u2019re 18 or older, psychologically stable, physically healthy, and OK with possibly never returning to Earth, you can apply.
