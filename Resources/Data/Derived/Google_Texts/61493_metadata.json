Russian President Vladimir Putin approved delivery of the air defense missile system in April 2015.\n\nIran has also shown interest in buying more advanced, S-400 missile systems, which are currently deployed at Russia\u2019s airbase in Syria, but no formal talks have reportedly been held.\n\nThe news of the S-300\u2019s imminent delivery comes on the heels of an announcement last week on Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense web site that the Islamic Republic will sign a contract with Russia for the purchase of Sukhoi-30 fighter jets. The fighter jet, which is part of Moscow\u2019s military arsenal in the war in Syria, is said to be comparable to the American F-15E fighter-bomber.\n\nRelated: Putin Sends Russia\u2019s Deadly New Fighter Jet to Syria\n\nWhile the exact number of fighters and the timeline for signing the deal remain unknown, an Iranian defense official said that Iran would be involved in the production of the aircraft.\n\nIran needs to \"seriously focus on the air force and fighters,\" the official said. \"We are moving toward a contract. We told them that we need to be involved in the production (of the plane) as well.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition, and Iranian involvement in the production, mark a significant step for the country as it seeks to become an even greater regional power in the already volatile Middle East.\n\nIran's air force relies on domestically altered versions of outdated warplanes, including former Soviet Union-era MiGs. At the same time, Tehran is backing forces in conflicts in Syria and Yemen; if those allies begin demanding more support, or Iranian leaders want to expand their influence, the nation\u2019s military arsenal would benefit from a massive upgrade and from the technical knowhow gleaned from helping build the new equipment.\n\nRelated: Putin Flexes His Muscles in the Pacific with the New Su-35 Fighter\n\nRussia also stands to benefit economically and diplomatically from turning Iran into a client. Moscow\u2019s economy has been walloped over the last several years, thanks to international sanctions over its aggression toward Ukraine and the tumbling price of oil. Arms sales offer an easy cash infusion into Russia\u2019s economy.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Russia\u2019s foray into Syria was motivated by Moscow\u2019s concern over losing a major arms partner in Damascus.
