Just in time for the holiday season, a controversial publisher has released a new coloring book for children about Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).

The Missouri-based publisher, Really Big Coloring Books, describes its book as “a non-partisan, fact-driven view of how Texas Sen. Rafael Edward ‘Ted’ Cruz became a U.S. senator and details, through his quotes and public information his ideas for what he believes will help America grow.”

The book states that Cruz supports the Second Amendment, unlike Obama who has a “consistent disregard” for constitutional rights. It invites children to color-in the Ten Commandments on a page devoted to the United States national motto, “In God We Trust.”

The book also references Cruz’s 21-hour anti-Obamacare speech, saying that “millions of citizens believe Obama Care is worse than any war.”

“At least American soldiers have weapons with which to defend themselves,” the book adds.

Really Big Coloring Books sells a variety of coloring books for children. But some of its books have sparked controversy.

On the brink of the tenth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center, the company announced it was releasing a 9/11 coloring book. The book, “We Shall Never Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” was accused of being Islamophobic and inappropriate for small children.

The company later released a coloring book about the “Occupy Wall Street” protests.

“Many the US citizens denounce this product; our company aspires to be accurate in description even when upopular [sic] and this book generated hate mail. Surprisingly, the Occupy book sold well in China, France, Eastern Europe and some middle eastern countries; in total outselling the US audience,” Really Big Coloring Books wrote on its website.

Really Big Coloring Books publisher Wayne Bell told Fox News earlier this year that the White House emailed profanity to his company.
