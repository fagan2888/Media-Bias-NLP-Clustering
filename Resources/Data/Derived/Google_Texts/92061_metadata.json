The new center will add dental services as well, according to Debby Harrison-Zarkis, chief operating officer of River Valley Family Health Center.\n\nAs a federally qualified health center, River Valley offers health care to an underserved segment of the population, including patients on Medicaid and the uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe take anyone and everyone, so (the Health Resources and Services Administration) is really seeing the need in the country, especially with the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, for clinics to see these newly insured patients, or uninsured patients,\u201d Harrison-Zarkis said.\n\n\u201cAs the feds are seeing more and more the value we\u2019re providing, they\u2019re putting more money toward us \u2014 to help us with expansion, to help us meet our clinical measures, (and) open and start new programs to serve our communities. They\u2019re just very supportive of community health centers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cProviding funding to help health centers renovate their facilities will allow them to provide care to more patients,\u201d said HRSA Acting Associate Administrator Jim Macrae, in a press release announcing the funding awards.\n\nHarrison-Zarkis said a recent report pegged the number of people in Montrose who are on Medicaid and without a primary care physician at 4,000 to 5,000. She said the estimate for Delta is about 3,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of folks out there who are not being served,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to the three major areas of service to be offered at River Valley \u2014 primary care, mental health, and dental services \u2014 the health center also provides numerous other health-related programs and services. Among the list are cooking classes, chronic disease classes, mental health support groups, preventative health education, even outreach and enrollment specialists who can help people on site to sign up for insurance or navigate the center\u2019s sliding-fee scale.\n\nAccording to HRSA, more than 1,400 health centers serve 23 million people each year. The program doled out nearly $4 million in the funding round this week, which is in addition to more than $2.2 million distributed in September 2015. The money comes from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Community Health Center Fund.\n\nWhen the new health center in Montrose is complete, the current clinic at 100 Tessitore Court, Suite B, will be folded into the new facility. River Valley\u2019s Olathe location, at 308 Main St., will remain open because of the need in that community, Harrison-Zarkis said.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - A division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced an influx of federal funding this week for community health", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - A division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced an influx of federal funding this week for community health", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/montrose-clinic-gets-1-million-from-feds/", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-02T16:54:25-0600", "DC.creator": "Duffy Hayes", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "keywords": ",montrose,olathe,river valley family health center,u.s. department of health and human services", "DC.date.created": "2016-05-06T05:32:27-0600", "DC.subject": ",montrose,olathe,river valley family health center,u.s. department of health and human services", "DC.date.modified": "2016-05-06T16:50:28-0600", "DC.title": "Montrose clinic gets $1 million from feds  |  GJSentinel.com"}, "article_summary": "Montrose clinic gets $1 million from fedsA division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced an influx of federal funding this week for community health centers across the country, including $1 million that will go to fund a sprawling new health center in Montrose.\nWhen the new health center in Montrose is complete, the current clinic at 100 Tessitore Court, Suite B, will be folded into the new facility.\nThe money will go to the River Valley Family Health Center, which currently operates centers in both Olathe and Montrose.\nWhen complete, the new health center will largely continue the integrated services offered by River View \u2014 primary health care as well as mental health services.\nAs a federally qualified health center, River Valley offers health care to an underserved segment of the population, including patients on Medicaid and the uninsured."}
