I mean, our various Secret Service mishaps, or the scandals of the IRS and the NSA,\u201d Pharaoh said.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you guys remember, but the Obamacare website had some pretty serious problems too. In fact, if you look at all the stuff that\u2019s happened my second term, this whole Ebola thing is probably one of my greatest accomplishments.\u201d\n\nPharaoh then introduces new \u201cEbola czar\u201d Ron Klain, played by Taran Killam, who takes questions from the media.\n\n\u201cMr Klain, you have no actual medical training or background in dealing with infectious diseases is that correct?\u201d asks a reporter played by Cecily Strong.\n\nAnother reporter played by Aidy Bryant suggests that Klain has been appointed to handle the situation purely for politics as the midterm elections approach. Kilam\u2019s response is classic.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m not worried about winning elections, however, there are a few safety tips that people should know heading towards election day. For example, the Ebola virus actually flourishes in warmer climates\u2026\u201d said Kilam. \u201cIf you live in a Southern state such as Louisiana, Arkansas or Kentucky, you actually may want to avoid any large public spaces like, say, a polling booth. One exception, however, is that we believe Latinos in red states may actually have an immunity to Ebola, so they\u2019re good to go.\u201d\n\nKilam then introduced Al Sharpton, played by Kenan Thompson, as the only New York Democrat willing to be seen with the unpopular president.\n\nWhen a liberal outfit like SNL begins to lambaste a Democrat president this way, it\u2019s pretty clear that even they realize the American public see this as a failed administration.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Saturday Night Live opened this week\u2019s show with a brutal roasting of President Obama\u2019s entire second term agenda \u2014 and especially his handling of the Ebola crisis.
