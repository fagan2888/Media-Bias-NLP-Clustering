And I would say this in the best way possible, he was kind of a cowboy. He was somebody who took a lot of risks and he did so knowingly. He wanted the US image in Libya to be one that was fearless and upfront. He would go jogging around Benghazi without any security protection. He was trying to let the local people there know, you know, that he didn\u2019t look at them as enemies. And when you take risks like that, you know, terrible things can happen, and that\u2019s what happened here. But Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to raise that issue, because then it sounds like you\u2019re blaming him for what happened.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "HuffPo's Grim: Amb Stevens 'Kind of a Cowboy,' 'Took a Lot of Risks,' And 'Terrible Things Can Happen'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "HuffPo's Grim: Amb Stevens 'Kind of a Cowboy,' 'Took a Lot of Risks,' And 'Terrible Things Can Happen'", "title": "HuffPo's Grim: Amb Stevens 'Kind of a Cowboy,' 'Took a Lot of Risks,' And 'Terrible Things Can Happen' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Grim-1024-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/24/huffpos-grim-amb-stevens-kind-of-a-cowboy-took-a-lot-of-risks-and-terrible-things-can-happen/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HuffPo's Grim: Amb Stevens 'Kind of a Cowboy,' 'Took a Lot of Risks,' And 'Terrible Things Can Happen'", "title": "HuffPo's Grim: Amb Stevens 'Kind of a Cowboy,' 'Took a Lot of Risks,' And 'Terrible Things Can Happen' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Grim-1024-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ambassador chris stevens, Benghazi, Chris Stevens, Ryan Grim,Breitbart TV,Stevens", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Ryan Grim", "published_time": "2015-10-24T10:44:06-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And when you take risks like that, you know, terrible things can happen, and that\u2019s what happened here.\nHe was somebody who took a lot of risks and he did so knowingly.\nHe was trying to let the local people there know, you know, that he didn\u2019t look at them as enemies.\nAnd I would say this in the best way possible, he was kind of a cowboy.\nBut Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to raise that issue, because then it sounds like you\u2019re blaming him for what happened.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
