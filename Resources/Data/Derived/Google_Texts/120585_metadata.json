Ed Henry, R-Hartselle, told AL.com that he doesn\u2019t want children to see protestors on both sides of the issue on their way to or from school.\n\n\u201cIt is a volatile atmosphere that our children shouldn\u2019t be exposed to,\u201d Henry said.\n\nRev. James Henderson, a co-pastor at Ex Nihilo Church and the former executive director of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, was part of the effort to bring the bill to the legislature.\n\nHenderson told The Daily Signal that the bill is \u201cappropriate for more reasons than one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good to have an abortion facility across the street from a public school,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the bill is in the interest of the safety of young women.\n\nHenderson, who is also a member of the Alabama Republican Party\u2019s executive committee, expressed optimism that the bill will be approved by the state\u2019s Senate and signed into law by the governor.\n\nHenderson said he is new to politics and that it was \u201cinteresting to see what happened\u201d when the bill was debated in the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe left is all stirred up on their blogs,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that he views the work of the pro-life movement as a \u201cministry,\u201d and that he hopes that the one remaining abortion facility in Huntsville will close.\n\n\u201cWomen who have had abortions who testified, you can see the pain in their eyes,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cmore determined to pray for them than ever.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the bill object to restrictions on abortion facilities.\n\nAlabama Reproductive Rights Advocates said in a statement that they stand \u201cfirmly against HB 527 and the targeted attack on women\u2019s health care in Alabama.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy likening a health care facility to a sex offender in the wording of the bill it is clear that the intent is not to make women safer, but to deny access [to abortion],\u201d they said.\n\nThey added that the bill would \u201ccreate an ongoing legal battle by violating the constitutional rights of Alabama citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Alabama House of Representatives has passed legislation that would prevent new abortion facilities from opening near schools.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Alabama House of Representatives has passed legislation that would prevent new abortion facilities from opening near schools.", "title": "Alabama Bill Keeps Abortion Clinics Far From Schools", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150529_AlabamaBill.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GK8q55"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Alabama House of Representatives has passed legislation that would prevent new abortion facilities from opening near schools.", "title": "Alabama Bill Keeps Abortion Clinics Far From Schools", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150529_AlabamaBill.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-05-29T16:19:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, Alabama, Alabama bill, house bill 527, pro-life, prolife"}, "article_summary": "The Alabama House of Representatives has passed legislation that would prevent new abortion facilities from opening near schools.\nIf signed into law, House Bill 527 would prohibit the Alabama Department of Public Health from renewing or granting a license to an abortion facility within 2,000 feet of a public school.\nHe said that he views the work of the pro-life movement as a \u201cministry,\u201d and that he hopes that the one remaining abortion facility in Huntsville will close.\nThey added that the bill would \u201ccreate an ongoing legal battle by violating the constitutional rights of Alabama citizens.\u201d\nHenderson told The Daily Signal that the bill is \u201cappropriate for more reasons than one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good to have an abortion facility across the street from a public school,\u201d he said."}
