Their frustration during Tuesday night\u2019s home game against the Los Angeles Clippers seemed a distant memory.\n\nBut there was work getting to this point of contentment.\n\n\u201cAfter the game, just being very honest, very heartfelt when I apologized to them,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cI have to be better for them. One thing I always do is before I assign or cast any blame, I look at myself first. And I think the players respect that. So, I apologized for the whole thing with Blake (Griffin). I apologized (to Emmanuel Mudiay) for jumping him in that manner in a public forum.\u201d\n\nMudiay said the situation was \u201cover with\u201d the night it happened.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great person and I have all the respect in the world for him,\u201d Mudiay, a rookie guard, said of Denver\u2019s first-year coach.\n\nMalone apologized for getting into it with Griffin, a Clippers star, but Denver players told him not to worry about it. Because, in a nice twist for Malone, him sticking up for them was gratifying.\n\n\u201cRight, wrong or indifferent I\u2019m going to fight,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019m true to myself; I\u2019m going to fight, scratch, claw. I\u2019m going to do whatever I have to do for this team. And I do have their back.\n\n\u201cEven with Emmanuel. (He) knows, \u2018I know Coach cares about me. And I know that he\u2019s on me, and he wants the best for me.\u2019\n\n\u201cEverything I do is in the best interest of all these guys. But whether it\u2019s Blake or anybody else (with the opposing team), we have to protect each other.\u201d\n\nProtecting the Pepsi Center is foremost on the Nuggets\u2019 minds now. Three of their four straight losses have come at home. And though those losses all came to teams residing among the top seven in the Western Conference, getting back in the win column is preferable to shrugging at the difficulty level of the opposition.\n\nThe Nuggets may be getting some help. Joffrey Lauvergne, a center who hasn\u2019t played since the third game of the season because of a back injury, was a full participant in practice Thursday. He has missed 12 consecutive games.\n\nLauvergne said he was free of pain Thursday, and will push to play against the San Antonio Spurs if he wakes up Friday with no pain and gets through a pain-free shootaround.\n\n\u201cInitially the plan was for me to play in Dallas,\u201d Lauvergne said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going faster than what we thought, so maybe (against the Spurs).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see how I feel when I wake up. If I feel the same, if I feel very good, I\u2019m going to tell them and try to play (Friday) night. If not, then Dallas.\u201d\n\nGetting him back would boost the Nuggets\u2019 interior offense and defense, give them much needed size and return one of the team\u2019s best rebounders to the lineup.\n\nLauvergne\u2019s presence at practice Thursday contributed to the good mood in the building.\n\n\u201cThe mood, the energy, the excitement, if you came into this practice today you wouldn\u2019t know that we lost four games in a row,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know that, maybe some people would say \u2018Coach and Emmanuel got into it, is there an issue there?\u2019 No. We\u2019re a very together group, and I\u2019m very excited about that.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSAN ANTONIO AT DENVER 7 p.m. Friday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Patty Mills:\n\nThe last time the Nuggets and Spurs met, San Antonio\u2019s point guards did a lot of damage. Mills, one of the NBA\u2019s best backups, was right in the middle of the fray \u2014 scoring 17 points and hitting three 3-pointers. He has cooled off since, averaging just 6.8 points and shooting only 35.7 percent from the field, but he\u2019s capable of being the difference-maker on any given night.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nVeteran forward Kenneth Faried (ankle) did not practice Thursday and will not play Friday against San Antonio. Faried has declined to talk about his injury, which has kept him out of Denver\u2019s last two games. \u2026 Joffrey Lauvergne was a full participant in Thursday\u2019s practice, and the center is hoping to return Friday against San Antonio or Saturday against the Mavericks in Dallas.\n\nSpurs:\n\nSan Antonio has won three consecutive games, including Wednesday\u2019s victory over Dallas. San Antonio held the Mavericks to 88 points, 17 under their season average. \u2026 Veteran guard Manu Ginobili has two games under his belt since returning from a sore hip, which caused him to miss the season\u2019s first matchup against the Nuggets. He has averaged 8.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists since he\u2019s been back.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets focused on snapping losing streak, not on recent frustration", "title": "Nuggets focused on snapping losing streak, not on recent frustration", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/nuggets-focused-on-snapping-losing-streak-not-on-recent-frustration/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123__nuggets-curryp1-1.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123__nuggets-curryp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T20:34:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:30:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m true to myself; I\u2019m going to fight, scratch, claw.\nI\u2019m going to do whatever I have to do for this team.\nIf I feel the same, if I feel very good, I\u2019m going to tell them and try to play (Friday) night.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see how I feel when I wake up.\nSan Antonio held the Mavericks to 88 points, 17 under their season average."}
