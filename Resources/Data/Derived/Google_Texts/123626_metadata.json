The technique, investigators and experts say, has become ever more common as small companies seek to gain contracts in an intensely competitive market by holding labor costs down.\n\nIn the complex, rapidly expanding oil and gas industry, much of the day to day work done on oil rigs and gas wells is sub-contracted out to smaller companies. For instance, on one gas rig alone, the operator might hire one company to construct the well pad, another to drill the well, a third company to provide hydraulic fracking services and yet another to truck water and chemicals for disposal.\n\nBut for the thousands of workers in the hundreds of different companies, a single standard is supposed to apply: by law, they must be paid more than minimum wage and they must be fairly compensated for any overtime accrued.\n\nIn 2012, the DOL began a special enforcement initiative in its Northeast and Southwest regional offices targeting the fracking industry and its supporting industries. As of August this year, the agency has conducted 435 investigations resulting in over $13 million in back wages found due for more than 9,100 workers. ProPublica obtained data for 350 of those cases from the agency. In over a fifth of the investigations, companies in violation paid more than $10,000 in back wages.\n\nOne of those companies was Morco Geological Services, a company providing mud logging services for other oil and gas drilling companies. In 2013, the DOL found that Morco was paying some workers $75 daily for working virtually round-the-clock shifts. The company eventually agreed to pay $595,737 in back wages to 121 workers following the DOL\u2019s investigation. In another significant case, Hutco, a company providing labor services to the oil and gas industry, ended up paying $1.9 million to 2,267 employees assigned to work in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n\n\u201cThe problem of misclassification has become pervasive,\u201d said Dr. David Weil, a former economics professor at Boston University who today heads the DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division. \u201cEmployers are looking for opportunities in a changing business landscape at the employee\u2019s expenses to cut corners as much as possible, leaving room for wage and hour violations.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, the oil and gas industry has seen tremendous growth. Between 2007 and 2012, when average employment in all U.S. industries fell by 2.7 percent, employment in the oil and gas industry increased by over 30 percent. According toresearch conducted by Annette Bernhardt, a scholar on low-wage work, 84 percent of workers in the oil, gas and mining industry were employed by contractors in 2012.\n\nAt the same time, the industry has also seen an increase in fatalities and injuries on the job. There is, so far, no evidence to suggest that these accidents are a result of inadequate training or overworked laborers. But accounts from other industries that heavily outsource work suggest those risks could be present.\n\nFor example, a 2012 investigation by ProPublica and PBS Frontline showed that cell phone carriers often contract out the dangerous job of climbing towers to smaller firms, which don\u2019t provide the necessary training and equipment to climbers. As a result, the death rate was 10 times higher among cell tower climbers than other construction workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Department of Labor investigations have uncovered hundreds of cases in which workers are being cheated", "title": "For oil and gas companies, rigging involves wages too", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "U.S. Department of Labor investigations have uncovered hundreds of cases in which workers are being cheated", "title": "For oil and gas companies, rigging involves wages too", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/for_oil_and_gas_companies_rigging_involves_wages_too_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_149100686.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Department of Labor investigations have uncovered hundreds of cases in which workers are being cheated", "title": "For oil and gas companies, rigging involves wages too", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_149100686.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Naveena Sadasivam", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gas, Oil, ProPublica, wage theft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2955\"", "article_summary": "In the complex, rapidly expanding oil and gas industry, much of the day to day work done on oil rigs and gas wells is sub-contracted out to smaller companies.\nOne of those companies was Morco Geological Services, a company providing mud logging services for other oil and gas drilling companies.\nBetween 2007 and 2012, when average employment in all U.S. industries fell by 2.7 percent, employment in the oil and gas industry increased by over 30 percent.\nAccording toresearch conducted by Annette Bernhardt, a scholar on low-wage work, 84 percent of workers in the oil, gas and mining industry were employed by contractors in 2012.\nIn over a fifth of the investigations, companies in violation paid more than $10,000 in back wages."}
