Total savings reportedly top $20 billion \u2014 or an average of $1,945 per beneficiary.\n\nLast year, over 5 million seniors and the disabled saved over $5.4 billion alone, CMS said.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries are also utilizing many recommended preventive services without coinsurance, CMS stated.\n\nCMS estimated over 39 million people last year, including those enrolled in Medicare Advantage, took advantage of one or more preventative services without copays or deductibles.\n\nThis number is \u201cslightly more\u201d than the year before, CMS said.\n\nAnd nearly 9 million Medicare beneficiaries last year, including Medicare Advantage enrollees, reportedly partook in an Annual Wellness Visit.\n\n\"Medicare consumers are now more engaged and empowered in their own health thanks to the Affordable Care Act,\" said Andy Slavitt, CMS\u2019s Acting Administrator.\n\n\u201dMillions are now able to access more affordable prescription medicine for their chronic conditions and millions more are staying healthier by accessing preventive services, especially vital for people living with disabilities or growing older.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have saved upwards of $20 billion on prescription drugs over the past six years, according to new information from CMS.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/affordable-care-act-saved-medicare-beneficiaries-20-billion", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/CMS_Logo_3.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "Affordable Care Act Saved Medicare Beneficiaries $20 Billion"}, "twitter": {"description": "Over 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have saved upwards of $20 billion on prescription drugs over the past six years, according to new information from CMS.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Saved Medicare Beneficiaries $20 Billion", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/CMS_Logo_3.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "And nearly 9 million Medicare beneficiaries last year, including Medicare Advantage enrollees, reportedly partook in an Annual Wellness Visit.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has saved over 10 million Medicare beneficiaries upwards of $20 billion on prescription drugs over the past six years, according to new information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\nSince the ACA\u2019s implementation, a total of 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have received prescription drug discounts, CMS confirmed.\nBeneficiaries in the \u201cdonut hole\u201d saved money the following year on covered brand-name and generic drugs, CMS explained.\nUnder the ACA, anyone with a Medicare prescription drug plan in 2010 who hit the \u201cdonut hole\u201d was paid a $250 rebate."}
