The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and the pace of infrastructure expenses is outpacing it, as cars become more fuel efficient.\n\nThe federal government typically spends approximately $50 billion per year in road and transit spending, but the gas tax is only bringing in about $34 billion per year.\n\nTransportation advocates have suggested a switch to a mileage-based program, but critics have raised concerns about government officials tracking the movements of drivers.\n\nOfficials in Oregon have moved to test the mileage-fee system in their state, but lawmakers turned to a package of $70 billion of offsets in the recent highway bill to supplement gas tax revenue for the next five years.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The measure includes $95 million to study future alternatives to the existing gas tax.", "description": "The measure includes $95 million to study future alternatives to the existing gas tax.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The measure includes $95 million to study future alternatives to the existing gas tax.", "title": "Mileage-based gas tax backers tout $305B highway bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262365-mileage-based-gas-tax-backers-tout-305b-highway-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/odometer_071114wikimedia.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262365-mileage-based-gas-tax-backers-tout-305b-highway-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-07T17:39-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization, Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act, FAST Act, Gas Tax, Vehicle Miles Traveled, VMT,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T17:39:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262365-mileage-based-gas-tax-backers-tout-305b-highway-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The measure includes $95 million to study future alternatives to the existing gas tax.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mileage-based gas tax backers tout $305B highway bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Mileage-based gas tax backers tout $305B highway bill"}, "article_summary": "\"This is welcome assistance to states, the majority of which are actively looking for viable alternatives to the gas tax,\" he continued.\nThe gas tax has been the normal source for transportation projects since it's inception in the 1930s.\nADVERTISEMENT\"This bill does what no prior bill has done: authorizes $95 million dollars for states to conduct research and testing of alternatives to the gas tax,\" Basso said in a statement.\nTransportation advocates in Washington have suggested moving to a mileage-based fee system, as receipts from the gas tax have dwindled in recent years \u2014 but to no avail.\nThe federal government typically spends approximately $50 billion per year in road and transit spending, but the gas tax is only bringing in about $34 billion per year."}
