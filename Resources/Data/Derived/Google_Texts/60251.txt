Prepare for the 2014-2015 influenza season with a flu shot.

Penn faculty and staff are welcome to attend Student Health Service (SHS)-sponsored flu vaccine clinics on Thursday, October 23 and Wednesday, October 29

from 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in Houston Hall’s Bodek Lounge.

No appointment or pre-registration is necessary for the SHS clinic. Please present your valid PennCard at the clinic to receive the vaccine—no cash required and no reimbursement needed.

On Monday, November 10 and Tuesday, November 18 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Health Advocate will be on campus to provide flu shots to faculty and staff.

(Note: Be in the Know biometric screenings will be held concurrently with these flu vaccine clinics.) Advanced registration is required for the November flu shots.
