26 organizations urge Congress to pass Conscience Protection Act

April 21, 2016

Twenty-six religious, pro-life, and healthcare organizations, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, have called upon Congress to pass the Conscience Protection Act of 2016.

The legislation, the organizations noted, “would be an enormous step forward in assuring Americans who serve the sick and needy that they can do so without being forced by government to violate their most deeply held convictions on respect for innocent human life.”

Absent from the list of signatories was the Catholic Health Association, which lent its support to the passage the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
