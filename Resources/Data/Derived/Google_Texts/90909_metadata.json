Cannon - February 23, 2014\n\nJudging from their February programming decisions, the producers, suits, and talking heads at MSNBC consider New Jersey Gov. Christie Christie\u2019s ill-fated foray into traffic management a story so big it makes Watergate look like a picnic.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s parent network has come under criticism for being more interested in prompting American skier Bode Miller to cry on camera about his brother\u2019s death last year than covering the real-time slayings of pro-democracy demonstrators in Ukraine. Could the $775 million NBC paid for exclusive U.S. rights to the Winter Olympics have something to do with it?\n\nIf you watched CNN in recent days, you might think it was open season on black kids in Florida. (It wasn\u2019t; the middle-aged white man who shot Jordan Davis in the \u201cloud music\u201d killing was convicted of serious felony charges and faces a long prison term.) Meanwhile, at Fox New they can\u2019t get enough of the latest Obamacare fail\u2014and the network\u2019s talking heads seem to think that Hillary Clinton changed her middle name from Rodham to \u201cBenghazi.\u201d\n\nSo who can bring order to all this chaos? Well, if you don\u2019t think Obama administration federal appointees have raised their big grasping paws to volunteer, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nYes, until it reversed course on Friday amid public outcry, the Federal Communications Commission wanted to know how and why broadcasters\u2014especially local stations\u2014make editorial decisions, and was apparently planning to dispatch \u201cinvestigators\u201d into the field to find out. Sample questions for owners of broadcast outlets: \u201cWhat is the philosophy of the news station?\u201d \u201cHow much does community input influence news coverage decisions?\u201d\n\nWhere was Edward Snowden when we needed him? Oh, right, ensconced in the heart of the old Soviet Union where programs titled \u201cMulti-Market Study of Critical Information Needs\u201d\u2014that\u2019s actually what the FCC calls this fishing expedition\u2014wouldn\u2019t seem out of place. But I digress.\n\nAccording to the research design presented to the FCC by a government contractor named Social Solutions International Inc., it wasn\u2019t just television stations, either: Internet news organizations and newspapers were to be included in this information sweep, as if that were actually in the FCC\u2019s purview.\n\nIn foreign policy, that would be called \u201cmission creep.\u201d Mission creepy is more like it. Think of these sample questions Social Solutions proposed asking professional journalists.\n\n--Have you ever suggested coverage of what you consider a story with critical information for your customers (viewers, listeners, readers) that was rejected by management?\n\n--If so, can you give an example?\n\n--What was the reason given for the decision?\n\nIn other words, the government was looking for ideologically motivated\u2014or, perhaps, merely disgruntled\u2014employees to rat out their bosses on partisan grounds. This study was announced last spring, but it took a while for the details to leach out. Last December, 16 Republican members of Congress wrote a letter to new FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler urging him to intercede in the FCC\u2019s effort to become \u201cthe news police.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were shocked to see that the FCC is putting itself back in the business of attempting to control the political speech of journalists,\u201d wrote the Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cIt is wrong, it is unconstitutional, and we urge you to put a stop to [it].\u201d\n\nThey received no formal response until after FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed to the bipartisan body by President Obama, wrote a Feb. 10 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal raising the same concerns.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, Chairman Wheeler sent a respectful, if noncommittal response, saying that the terms of the study were not final, and would be revisited. He reiterated the FCC\u2019s previous stated reason for undertaking the study: a statutory requirement that the agency report back to Congress every three years on potential barriers keeping small business people out of the communications industry.\n\nCommissioner Pai, for one, found that rationale \u201cpeculiar.\u201d He wondered how news judgments could possibly impede entrepreneurship in the media. He also wondered why the study includes newspapers and online publications, which the FCC has no authority to regulate.\n\nIn a statement Friday, commission spokesperson Shannon Gilson said that a pilot version of the study would be suspended and redesigned, noting that Wheeler \u201cagreed that survey questions in the study directed toward media outlet managers, news directors, and reporters overstepped the bounds of what is required.\u201d\n\nStill, the press coverage so far has tended to characterize the controversy as a protest by conservatives. That\u2019s distressing on a couple of levels. First, it mainly has been conservatives who\u2019ve objected to this crude intrusion into the First Amendment. (Where is the ACLU when you need it? Speaking of which, in an age when all one needs is a laptop, a domain name, and a smartphone to launch a political website, do we still need an FCC?)\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s imagine how the establishment media might respond if George W. Bush-appointed FCC commissioners had proposed digging into the editorial practices of liberal outlets.\n\nFox News executives feared they were the ultimate target of this exercise, and who can blame them for that suspicion? From the beginning of the Obama presidency, White House communications officials and Obama political advisers have leveled attacks on Fox, even going so far as to proclaim that it is not a \u201ca legitimate\u201d news organization.\n\nThey are reading from an old hymnal. In the early days of television \u2014 in 1949, to be precise \u2014 Congress and the FCC cooked up \u201cthe Fairness Doctrine.\u201d Ostensibly, its purpose was to ensure that (publicly owned) airwaves didn\u2019t carry monolithic public opinions.\n\nThat very name was always a sort of Rorschach test: Liberals found the \u201cFairness Doctrine\u201d to be the very definition of good government: What decent or thoughtful person could oppose presenting both sides of a question to the citizenry? To conservatives, it always had this Orwellian ring to it. Time would show that conservatives were closer to the mark.\n\nDuring the 1964 Republican National Convention, Democratic Party operatives cooked up a scheme to use the Fairness Doctrine as a way to muzzle disciples of Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater.\n\n\u201cOur massive strategy,\u201d former Kennedy administration official Bill Ruder later acknowledged, \u201cwas to use the Fairness Doctrine to challenge and harass the right-wing broadcasters, and hope that the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too costly to continue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judging from their February programming decisions, the producers, suits, and talking heads at MSNBC consider New Jersey Gov.
