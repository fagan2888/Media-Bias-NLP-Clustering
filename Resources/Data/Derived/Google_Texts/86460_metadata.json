In July, 2015, he filed a resolution to remove Boehner as Speaker.\n\nHe said at the time that Boehner \u201cuses the power of the office to punish Members who vote according to their conscience.\u201d\n\nAfter Meadows publicly called for Speaker Boehner to vacate his chair, Cruz texted him telling the Congressman that he had his back.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t forget the people who stood with you\u201d when it was deeply unpopular to do so, he explained, adding that Ted Cruz was one of only a few legislators to back him when he publicly called for Boehner\u2019s ouster.\n\nMeadows knocked on several doors, advocating for the man he says is best equipped to be President of the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between saying the right thing and doing the right thing,\u201d Rep. Meadows told an undecided voter. \u201cI\u2019ve served with Ted and I can tell you. Here\u2019s the reality: There are people who campaign like eagles, then get to DC and act like tweety birds. Ted Cruz continues to back up his talk in DC, and refuses to make unprincipled choices there.\u201d\n\nA staffer for Keep The Promise says that the pro-Cruz outfit has the best ground game in the state of South Carolina, having set up shop there in November, beating out every other Presidential campaign in getting to The Palmetto State. A volunteer for the Super PAC who accompanied us said he had personally knocked on 2,500 doors.\n\nKeep The Promise volunteers are equipped with sophisticated technology \u2013 an iPhone app that provides them with extensive information on the current neighborhood, including where undecided voters may be located.\n\nThough polling continues to indicate that Donald Trump is the frontrunner, the pro-Cruz Super PAC volunteers insist that their man has a shot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ground Game: Canvassing South Carolina With Rep.
