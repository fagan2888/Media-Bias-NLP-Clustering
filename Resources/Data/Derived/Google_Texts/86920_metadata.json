Mr. Carter, a Democrat, is running for governor of Georgia, a position Jimmy Carter held for a term before moving on to the White House. Jason Carter is willing to say pretty much whatever it takes to win. When someone asks his opinions on homosexual demands, he dodges, weaves and deflects, eager not to offend religiously conservative Georgia. But his gay supporters are saying it for him.\n\nGeorgia remains committed to traditional marriage. The left-leaning Public Policy Polling discovered last year that 6 of 10 Georgia voters want to keep the thousands-of-years-old definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. If Jason Carter yearns to come out in support of the full rainbow agenda, he knows better than to do it before the election.\n\nThat\u2019s the dishonest scheme that worked for Mark R. Herring in Virginia, the Democrat who was elected attorney general last year in a squeaker of an election. The first thing Mr. Herring did after taking the oath of office in January was to announce that he had no intention of doing his bounden duty to defend the state\u2019s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage against a fierce legal challenge. Had Mr. Herring told the truth about what he really thought, the outcome of his race \u2014 which he won by 907 votes out of 2.2 million cast \u2014 would surely have been different.\n\nThe pro-homosexual website Project Q Atlanta doesn\u2019t like the sneaky approach, either. \u201cJason Carter collects gay cash, but stays mum on LGBT issues,\u201d the site noted earlier this month about a fundraiser held for Mr. Carter. The event, organized and hosted by homosexual activists, raised nearly $90,000 for the Carter campaign. Reporters were barred from the fundraiser, lest the secret leak.\n\nMr. Carter\u2019s campaign website makes no mention of homosexual issues or of same-sex marriage. Instead, it posts the ritual photograph of the candidate and his smiling wife and two kids. But earlier this month Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas confirmed that Mr. Carter does in fact support what liberals euphemistically call \u201cmarriage equality.\u201d\n\nThe organizers of Mr. Carter\u2019s July 31 fundraiser were in on the plan to keep his real views a secret, open as the secret may be. \u201cIn Georgia, we have to be smart enough to understand that [the Carter campaign] can\u2019t use us a leading issue if they want to get elected statewide,\u201d says Ken Britt, described by Project Q as the \u201cgay politico\u201d who organized the event. \u201cI\u2019m more pragmatic about this.\u201d\n\nOne man\u2019s pragmatism is another man\u2019s dishonesty. Voters deserve to know, loud and clear, what they\u2019ll get if they put another Carter in the governor\u2019s mansion on Nov. 4. Gov. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent running for re-election, should pressure Mr. Carter to say unequivocally whether he would be prepared as governor to fully defend Georgia\u2019s state constitutional amendment, enacted by the people, that defines traditional marriage.\n\nIf he won\u2019t say, Jason Carter deserves to see his bid for high office end the way his father\u2019s did. Jack Carter ran for the U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost. Or the way his grandfather\u2019s attempt for a second term as president did. Truth can be badly abused, but it will out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jason Carter wants to follow in his famous grandfather's footsteps.
