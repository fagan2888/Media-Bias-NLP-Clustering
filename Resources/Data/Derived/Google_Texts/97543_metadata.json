He was not belted in, but his wrists and ankles were shackled, making him \"at risk for an unsupported fall during acceleration or deceleration of the van.\"\n\nThe autopsy report would seem to lend credence to the involuntary manslaughter charges against some of the officers. As Reason\u2019s Jacob Sullum wrote in May:\n\nAnother charge [Officer Caesar] Goodson faces, involuntary manslaughter, is easier to prove, since it includes deaths caused by negligence, an unlawful act (other than a felony), or failure to perform a legal duty. Based on Mosby's allegations, that charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, also seems appropriate for Lt. Brian Rice, Officer William Porter, and Sgt. Alicia White, who are accused of repeatedly failing to belt Gray in and repeatedly failing to help him when it became clear he needed medical attention. Their alleged inaction may very well have amounted to negligence or failure to perform a legal duty.\n\nRead more from Reason on the death of Freddie Gray here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Involuntary manslaughter?", "title": "Freddie Gray Autopsy: \u2018High-Energy\u2019 Ride Killed Him", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/23/freddie-gray-autopsy-high-energy-ride-ki", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14350932178754.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Involuntary manslaughter?", "title": "Freddie Gray Autopsy: \u2018High-Energy\u2019 Ride Killed Him", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14350932178754.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-23T21:05:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b91\"", "article_summary": "The autopsy report would seem to lend credence to the involuntary manslaughter charges against some of the officers.\nRead more from Reason on the death of Freddie Gray here.\nAlicia White, who are accused of repeatedly failing to belt Gray in and repeatedly failing to help him when it became clear he needed medical attention.\nTheir alleged inaction may very well have amounted to negligence or failure to perform a legal duty.\nThough Gray was loaded into the van on his belly, the medical examiner surmised that he may have gotten to his feet and was thrown into the wall during an abrupt change in direction."}
