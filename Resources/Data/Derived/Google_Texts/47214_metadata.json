I used to think Paul had traded his endorsement of McConnell for Senate for McConnell\u2019s promise that he\u2019d endorse Paul for president. But after watching this very solid defense of a guy who\u2019s very unpopular with Paul\u2019s target audience, I\u2019ve gotta believe that Mitch the Knife\u2019s \u201cRand for president!\u201d ad has already been recorded, cut, and is just waiting to be rolled out at the appropriate moment. He\u2019s gone beyond the call of establishment-ingratiating duty on this one.\n\nHis point about McConnell not being Specter isn\u2019t wrong, either.\n\n\u201cMcConnell has offended conservatives by stabbing Ted Cruz in the back and cutting deals that ran contrary to every principle he says he stands for. The Conservative Establishment is backing unknown Matt Bevin. Bevin has no track record. McConnell has a Heritage Action rating of 80. When the average Republican score is 67 that is not something to ignore,\u201d [Tea Party Nation founder Judson] Phillips said. McConnell scored even better with the Club for Growth, nabbing an 87 percent rating on the free market group\u2019s issues. This cycle, the club has endorsed Republicans who are challenging incumbents in Senate primaries, but Bevin is not among them. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a strong supporter of McConnell who has criticized Bevin, was at 96 percent on the Heritage Action for America scorecard. Bevin has never served in elected office\u2026 The Senate Conservatives Fund, said a Republican operative backing McConnell, is making the same mistake with Bevin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee made in 2009 with Charlie Crist.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s ACU rating, referenced by Paul in the clip, was 96, 85, and a perfect 100 from 2010-12, respectively. However you feel about Rand riding to his defense (at a moment, do note, when Ted Cruz is wading into other races to help tea partiers), explain to me how it came to be that defeating McConnell is a bigger cause among conservatives than defeating Lindsey Graham. Grahamnesty is perilously close to not only winning his primary in the redder-than-red state of South Carolina \u2014 Jim DeMint\u2019s home state, I hasten to remind you \u2014 but he might do it with a clear majority, avoiding any chance of the sort of run-off upset that David Dewhurst suffered at the hands of Cruz. It\u2019s as if John McCain was running for election in, say, Texas and righties simply couldn\u2019t muster the interest to give him a competitive primary. It\u2019s unthinkable \u2014 and yet, somehow, here we are. How did that happen?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Endorsements.", "title": "Rand Paul defends Mitch McConnell: C\u2019mon, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about Arlen Specter here", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/26/rand-paul-defends-mitch-mcconnell-cmon-its-not-like-were-talking-about-arlen-specter-here/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-27T00:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T23:08:08+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014, 2016, bevin, conservative, GOP, Kentucky, mcconnell, midterm, republican, Senate, specter,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d54\"", "article_summary": "Rand Paul defends Mitch McConnell: C\u2019mon, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about Arlen Specter hereposted at 7:21 pm on February 26, 2014 by AllahpunditMan oh man.\n\u201cMcConnell has offended conservatives by stabbing Ted Cruz in the back and cutting deals that ran contrary to every principle he says he stands for.\nI used to think Paul had traded his endorsement of McConnell for Senate for McConnell\u2019s promise that he\u2019d endorse Paul for president.\nSen.
