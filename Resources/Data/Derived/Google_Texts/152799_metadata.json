If elected, Lessig has said he would only serve as president until he passes the reforms, called the Citizens Equality Act 2017, he is championing through both houses of Congress. He will then immediately resign and let his vice-president assume office. Lessig\u2019s campaign website is running a public poll about who should be Lessig\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cRight now Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are leading in my VP polls,\u201d said Lessig. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is not running for president.\n\nLessig doesn\u2019t have any previous political experience other than running the Mayday Pac, a crowd-funded and nonpartisan Super Pac that backs candidates committed to campaign finance reform in the November 2014 elections.\n\n\u201cCertain types of households know me and I have a niche group of voters based on the work I did with Creative Commons, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, at Stanford, and on internet freedom,\u201d Lessig said.\n\nEven Lessig\u2019s most ardent supporters concede he is a \u201clongshot\u201d to actually win the race.\n\nBut already, Lessig\u2019s issue-based campaign has managed to engage a group of highly educated individuals who have historically opted out of the voting process altogether.\n\nThat niche includes Bay Area engineers, scientists, and venture capitalists who contributed to Lessig\u2019s $1m crowdsourcing campaign in August, which led to Lessig announcing his candidacy.\n\n\u201cLessig has long said every bit and bite is equal in his fight for net neutrality and now he is taking that fight to Washington and saying every vote should matter and be equal,\u201d said Marc Krejci, a 35-year-old resident of San Jose and pastor at Venture Christian Church.\n\nKrejci, who says his comments are his personal views, is a pastor of Innovation at the Los Gatos church, a title he says you\u2019ll only find in Silicon Valley. His job is to lead technology initiatives for the church and \u201cuse their tech skills to act out their faith\u201d.\n\nKrejci has never donated to a presidential campaign and he\u2019s never met Lessig. But he\u2019s known about Lessig\u2019s work on Mayday and Rootstrikers, a grassroots nonprofit fighting political corruption, and so last month he donated to Lessig\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cA collection of individuals supporting a cause is more important than corporations and I contributed not necessarily to Larry himself but to the principle of what he represents,\u201d said Krejci.\n\nHe said Lessig\u2019s commitment to resign after passing the Citizens Equality Act 2017 shows him that Lessig\u2019s run is not for greed and power.\n\nRelated: Democratic candidate Lawrence Lessig decries 'catch-22' TV debate eligibility\n\nShannon Kealy, a 37-year-old librarian at Santa Clara University, said Lessig\u2019s strength is not just in his platform but in his persuasive lecturing style.\n\n\u201cAfter I heard Larry speak so passionately about campaign finance reform in Portland in March, I was hooked. So when I heard he was running I wanted to show my support,\u201d said Kealy, who donated $50 to Lessig\u2019s campaign.\n\nShe calls him a lecture and presentation guru but says he need work on his image.\n\n\u201cIn order to get more people to listen to him he needs to have a less egg heady approach. Hillary announced her candidacy in a beautiful video,\u201d said Kealy, referring to the democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s video campaign announcement released on 12 April and featuring a diverse group of middle class working Americans. Clinton\u2019s campaign announcement video has had 4.8 million views on Youtube since her announcement, whereas Lessig\u2019s announcement video has had some 58,000 views since August 10.\n\nWhile they are not as flashy as Clinton\u2019s videos, Lessig says millions of people have watched the more than 800 talks he\u2019s given on everything from corruption in the US Congress to copyright law and he says he is working to get those people to support him in the polls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have $10 billion and I can\u2019t \u2018trump\u2019 this,\u201d says Lessig. But Lessig did speak at an event in August held by Steve Jurvetson, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist.\n\n\u201cIn Silicon Valley there are people who make small bets to change the world and that is what I am presenting here,\u201d said Lessig, who spent almost a decade at Stanford University\u2019s School of Law and founded the school\u2019s Center for Internet and Society.\n\nLessig has only been included in one national poll so far \u2013 a September survey by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling (PPP) that found 1% of likely Democratic primary voters supported the Harvard professor. He has complained publicly that his omission from other national polls might mean his exclusion from the Democratic debates, which require polling of at least 1% in three national polls.\n\nHe says he will build on his Bay Area connections in the coming months as his campaign picks up steam.\n\nKrejci says Lessig\u2019s deep knowledge of the internet and how to create digital communities is his strength.\n\n\u201cLessig\u2019s sweet spot is in the digital economy. He understands that political communications are different now and people participate differently,\u201d said Krejci, who offers Lessig\u2019s appearance on Reddit\u2019s AMAs on 25 August as an example of how the internet lawyer is different from other candidates.\n\n\u201cThe general public could log in and ask him questions directly,\u201d said Krejci.\n\nLessig remains confident that his supporters are out there and he gives the example of the outpouring of sadness and support his friend and internet activist Aaron Swartz received after his death he committed suicide in January 2013. Swartz was under indictment for breaking into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and downloading a large number of academic journal articles through the university\u2019s computer network.\n\n\u201cMillions of people came out of the woodwork and he [Swartz] didn\u2019t even know how many people knew about him,\u201d said Lessig.\n\nStill, there are many people in the Bay Area who\u2019ve never heard of Lessig, but who can name Clinton, businessman Donald Trump and longtime Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to care about either side [Republicans or Democrats] because they are all crooks,\u201d said 48 year old Lisa Taber from Boulder Creek.\n\nWhen asked about the loss of hope in the political process as expressed by Taber, Lessig said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I am about one single issue and that is fixing this system so people will care again.\u201d\n\nHe says that is his critical difference with Sanders, whose platform takes on a range of issue including income equality and climate change.\n\nSome political experts also question the premise of Lessig\u2019s campaign that campaign finance is the crux of other public policy problems.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that money in elections facilitates the transfer of economic inequality into political inequality\u2026 At the same time it is foolish to imagine that campaign finance is the only route for private wealth to influence public policy or that its reform will dramatically transform the policy process,\u201d said Thomas Mann, a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution and a scholar at University of California Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS), in a recent IGS blog post.\n\nRelated: Presidential wannabe Larry Lessig could teach British politicians a few tricks | John Naughton\n\nMann writes that campaign finance reform won\u2019t be a critical factor on other key issues.\n\n\u201cMoney did not prevent the major legislative enactments of 2009-2010 \u2013 including the stimulus, student loans, the Affordable Care Act, and financial services reform. Nor is it likely to be the critical factor on climate change, immigration, infrastructure or jobs and wages; which party wins the White House and whether control with Congress is unified or divided is key,\u201d wrote Mann.\n\nBut Michael Eisen, a biologist at the University of California Berkeley and a co-founder of the Public Library of Science (PLOS), a nonprofit publishing project trying to make content in scientific journals free to the public, said Lessig is good at getting to the core of technical and policy related issues and getting people to understand and care about them.\n\n\u201cIn the early 2000s people were already thinking about net neutrality and free culture but he [Lessig] was the best person to reach into the Zeitgeist and pull out the things that synthesized what people were feeling,\u201d said Eisen.\n\nLessig served on the board of PLOS from 2003 to 2007 and Eisen says he sees Lessig reaching into his scientific toolkit again but this time to architect a solution to election and campaign finance problems. Eisen contributed less than $100 to Lessig\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cLarry is telling Americans to stop focusing on politics and fix the infrastructure of politics,\u201d said Eisen.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s supporters concede he is a \u2018longshot\u2019 but his single-issue focus on reforming campaign finance has got people listening", "application-name": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s supporters concede he is a \u2018longshot\u2019 but his single-issue focus on reforming campaign finance has got people listening", "title": "How Larry Lessig\u2019s one-year presidency platform is winning over Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/27/larry-lessig-democratic-presidential-candidate-campaign-finance-reform", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0017d0799880b3e09ecdc68f6ea06b9288fc4601/744_7_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=66139ed94664898f603e6ea748582115", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/27/larry-lessig-democratic-presidential-candidate-campaign-finance-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/27/larry-lessig-democratic-presidential-candidate-campaign-finance-reform", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/27/larry-lessig-democratic-presidential-candidate-campaign-finance-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0017d0799880b3e09ecdc68f6ea06b9288fc4601/744_7_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/27/larry-lessig-democratic-presidential-candidate-campaign-finance-reform?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Democrats,Silicon Valley,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "US news", "tag": "Democrats,Silicon Valley,US news", "published_time": "2015-09-27T11:00:06.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-27T11:00:06.000Z"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0017d0799880b3e09ecdc68f6ea06b9288fc4601/744_7_2499_1499/2499.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=c3f54224290f43b30d6ab02f9cf3f95d", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Democrats,Silicon Valley,US news"}, "article_summary": "Lessig\u2019s campaign website is running a public poll about who should be Lessig\u2019s running mate.\n\u201cAfter I heard Larry speak so passionately about campaign finance reform in Portland in March, I was hooked.\nSome political experts also question the premise of Lessig\u2019s campaign that campaign finance is the crux of other public policy problems.\nBut he\u2019s known about Lessig\u2019s work on Mayday and Rootstrikers, a grassroots nonprofit fighting political corruption, and so last month he donated to Lessig\u2019s campaign.\nEisen contributed less than $100 to Lessig\u2019s campaign."}
