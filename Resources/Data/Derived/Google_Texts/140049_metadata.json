They quantify and define.\n\nTake the Star Wars canon. Episode V rocked. Episode I sucked. They\u2019re back on track with Episode VII.\n\nTurning 18 means something. So does turning 21.\n\nAnd numbers can tell you a lot about the 114th Congress. Perhaps one number in particular. A digit that\u2019s likely to be close to zero.\n\nDespite all sorts of things to do on Capitol Hill this year and big expectations with a Republican majority in the Senate and new House Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress may wind up doing practically nothing.\n\nLawmakers will sure exert themselves on a range of issues. But many major legislative initiatives appear destined for hollow outcomes.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nMost will look immediately at promises from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. They\u2019ve erected a blockade against considering any Supreme Court nominee to succeed the late Antonin Scalia until the next president assumes office. Still, senators and the Obama administration will engage in an epic tussle.\n\nCongress faces basically one \u201ccliff\u201d this year. Lawmakers must reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by March 31. House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., has authored a bill to re-up the FAA. The legislation would also privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.\n\nPrivatization of air traffic control operations is controversial. The controllers support it. Pilots oppose it. Most carriers, with the exception of Delta Airlines, are in favor. But there\u2019s little hope Shuster\u2019s bill will hit the floor.\n\nEven if there was widespread support in the House to sign off on the privatization approach, there\u2019s no speedy path through the Senate before the deadline. That means Congress must approve an interim extension \u2013 or face a partial shutdown of the FAA come April.\n\nRepeal ObamaCare? That won\u2019t happen as long as Mr. Obama is president. An alternative to ObamaCare? Ryan promises one this year. We\u2019ve heard that before. A bill that can pass? That remains to be seen.\n\nThe House Budget Committee was scheduled this week to ink a spending blueprint for the year. But that budget isn\u2019t quite ripe yet. The Budget Committee postponed a lengthy session to prep the budget slated for today until at least mid-March.\n\nRyan\u2019s curbed expectations for passing a budget \u2013 despite extolling the virtues of budgeting during his years as Budget Committee Chairman. The problem is that conservatives want to torch a deal forged between President Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner. That accord established a spending topline for the next two years. Any move to blow up the Obama/Boehner agreement is sure to infuriate Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Ryan secured a promise from Reid to allow spending bills to come to the floor this year \u2013 but under the premise Congress adheres to the Obama/Boehner pact.\n\nRyan and House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., are challenged to find unity in GOP ranks to adopt a budget. If they stick to the Obama/Boehner number, they lose conservatives. If they drop the spending figure to court conservatives, moderates and defense hawks could vote no.\n\nRyan & company face an even stiffer climb this year \u2013 to say nothing of duplicity which lurks if they fail to approve a budget. They were apoplectic when the then-Democratic-controlled Senate repeatedly refused to approve a budget. If Republicans fail this time, they may cough up excuses and platitudes. But that won\u2019t match the GOP\u2019s holier-than-thou rhetoric emanating from the House when it approved Ryan\u2019s budgets and the Senate took a pass.\n\nFinally, there are appropriations bills to fund the government.\n\nIt helps if Congress OKs a budget ahead of time to establish spending allocations for each of the 12 appropriations bills. However, it\u2019s not absolutely necessary. One of Congress\u2019s most-influential tools to set policy lies in appropriations. Lawmakers can decide to flood various programs with money or dam it up in appropriations. That dictates a political outcome through legislating.\n\nBut \u2026\n\nIf the House and Senate don\u2019t both approve the same spending bills and earn Obama\u2019s signature, then there\u2019s not much congressional impact. A failure to finish all 12 bills by Oct. 1 (the start of Washington\u2019s fiscal year) means the government either closes or Congress must approve an interim spending bill.\n\nStopgap bills are called Continuing Resolutions or \u201cCR\u2019s.\u201d A CR simply renews the spending at current levels. If Congress can\u2019t approve the appropriations bills themselves, lawmakers resort to an \u201comnibus\u201d spending package. That\u2019s where they glom all 12 of bills (and sometimes a few other things) into a massive legislative furball. It\u2019s a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. And an omnibus dilutes legislative authority.\n\nSo perhaps a whole lot of nothing from Congress this year.\n\nExcept for perhaps two things: a CR sometime in September to sidestep a government shutdown and, later, an omnibus spending bill.\n\nThat could be it.\n\nNumbers tell us a lot. And they do the same quantifying the 114th Congress.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.
