Hospital officials have sharply criticized some of the proposals, warning that they could destabilize Connecticut hospitals, set the state back in adapting to changes in care delivery and run counter to market trends occurring nationwide.\n\nThe series of bills proposed by Fasano and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney aim to reduce the advantages large health systems gain by acquiring hospitals and physician practices. They also seek to increase transparency about health care costs and quality, and create infrastructure to allow electronic health records to be shared between medical providers.\n\nAmong the things going for them: The measures are the product of a partnership between the Senate\u2019s Democrat and Republican leaders, two New Haven-area lawmakers who don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye but have teamed up over shared concerns. The House Republican taking a lead role on the matter is Rep. Prasad Srinivasan, a Glastonbury physician who also has significant concerns about consolidation and calls the proposals ambitious but critical.\n\n\u201cThis needs to be done,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cAnd so the only question is how are we going to make it happen?\u201d\n\nAmong the challenges: Nonpartisan fiscal analysts indicated that the proposals, taken as a whole, could cost state agencies more than $1.5 million and hospitals millions more. Legislators on the Appropriations Committee included $1 million per year for the measures in their budget proposal released this week, but that funding must still get through final negotiations in a tight budget year.\n\nThe proposals\u2019 viability in the House also remains unclear, particularly among Democrats, the majority in that chamber.\n\nRep. Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, the House chair of the Public Health Committee, said he\u2019d consider it a successful session if legislators passed a transparency measure that gives consumers more information and options.\n\nWhile other proposals are aimed at addressing concerns about doctors giving up independent practice to work in large groups or for hospitals, Ritter questioned whether legislative action would have an effect on a trend that many see as inevitable, reflecting market forces and the choice of young doctors not to open their own practices.\n\n\u201cThe buzzword that I\u2019m hearing from a lot of people is transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cTransparency in pricing, in costs.\u201d\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\nAs the Public Health Committee considered the latest version of one of the bills Wednesday, Rep. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, raised concerns about the process, saying lawmakers could end up trying to address a very complex set of issues at the last minute by cobbling together multiple bills that might contradict each other.\n\n\u201cThis is really where we cause the most damage,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also not yet clear how Gov. Dannel P. Malloy will come down on the issues.\n\n\u201cA significant amount of work has gone into these proposals, which raise some important questions about health care in Connecticut,\u201d Malloy spokesman Devon Puglia said. \u201cWe are currently reviewing the legislation and look forward to further discussions with its proponents.\u201d\n\nMore tools for the state or setting back progress?\n\nLooney and Fasano have raised concerns about large health care systems raising the price of care and making it harder for independent doctors and hospitals to compete. Size can give hospital systems leverage in negotiating prices with insurance companies, while hospital-owned physician practices and outpatient facilities can command higher prices than the same services would if not connected to a hospital.\n\nAnd Looney and Fasano say the state needs the tools to address the changing landscape.\n\nPaul Bass / New Haven Independent\n\n\u201cAll this effort was to say we are going to make conscious decisions of what we want our health care to look like,\u201d Fasano said. \u201cUp to now it\u2019s been unconscious decisions. Decisions have been made for us by others, either the industry or letting trends go by unchecked.\u201d\n\nBut hospital officials note that consolidation has been occurring nationally. Having more facilities can lead to economies of scale that help trim costs as Medicare reimbursement rates and state funding drop and demands for capital to buy things like costly electronic record systems and medical technology increase.\n\nSize is also viewed as a key factor in adapting to new ways the federal government and insurance companies are expected to pay for care. Those models are expected to tie compensation to providers\u2019 ability to manage patients\u2019 health, something that requires better coordination between hospitals, community physicians, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other providers.\n\nSeveral elements of the Senate leaders\u2019 proposals are aimed at reducing advantages large health systems can gain or stemming the price increases that can come with consolidation. Those include measures that would:\n\nAllow insurance companies to request separate contract negotiations with each of a health system\u2019s hospitals, rather than having to contract with them as a package.\n\nRequire insurers to include \u201csite-neutral\u201d reimbursement policies in their contracts, rather than paying a different rate for the same service based on whether it\u2019s provided at an independent physician office or a hospital outpatient department. Currently, the prices can vary widely.\n\nRestrict the use of \u201cfacility fees\u201d \u2014 charges patients can face when they receive care at outpatient facilities or physician offices owned by hospitals. In some cases, the fees can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars more than if the facility were not part of a hospital.\n\nCreate a health information exchange, the infrastructure that would allow a patient\u2019s health care providers to access the person\u2019s medical records. Currently, there is no central system in the state that facilitates sharing.\n\nAllow health care providers to work together to coordinate patient care and jointly contract with insurers without being part of the same organization.\n\nOther provisions are aimed at increasing transparency. Those include requiring the creation of a website people could use to compare price, cost and quality information for common health care services; requiring insurers, hospitals and outpatient surgical facilities to make information on the cost of care available; and creating a commission to study health care cost trends and analyze potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\nOn some measures, particularly those related to transparency, hospital officials and doctors have said they support the concepts, although they suggested changes to the details.\n\nBut hospital officials have had harsh words for some of the other proposals, particularly the proposed limits on their ability to negotiate payment contracts as systems.\n\nThat bill \u201cdefeats the purpose of being part of a hospital system,\u201d the Yale New Haven Health System said in written testimony. \u201cIt only serves to handicap our ability to comply with the [Affordable Care Act] and become a more efficient healthcare institution that can focus on our mission of providing high-quality healthcare to all our patients.\u201d\n\nAnd the Connecticut Hospital Association has warned that some of the proposed billing restrictions could carry a financial cost to hospitals that are already facing payment cuts under Malloy\u2019s proposed budget.\n\nWhat they'll cost\n\nThe price tag for the proposals, projected by the legislature\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, includes more than $1.5 million for state agencies to handle new regulations and programs \u2014 largely by hiring new staff \u2014 and millions of dollars in costs to UConn\u2019s John Dempsey Hospital.\n\nUConn Health\n\nThe legislative analysts study costs to the state, which is why they examined the fiscal impact on Dempsey. That could offer a glimpse at the costs all hospitals would face.\n\nThe costs to Dempsey stem largely from provisions aimed at restricting how hospitals bill for services at outpatient facilities and electronic health records. In some cases, the exact numbers reflect ambiguity in the way the draft bills were written.\n\nThe bill limiting the use of facility fees, for example, could lead to a significant revenue loss for the hospital \u2014 up to $145 million, analysts wrote \u2014 although that could vary depending on how \u201cfacility fee\u201d is defined.\n\nIn addition, the proposal aimed at expanding the use of electronic health records and building an exchange system for sharing them was projected to require $50 million in bonding, with potentially significant state costs for tax credits for health care providers implementing or upgrading electronic records systems and hospitals that donate equipment to providers.\n\nSrinivasan said the potential costs of the package are a significant consideration to address at a time when many services are facing budget cuts.\n\n\u201cCan we go out and get $50 million in bonds, and do that when\u2026we are slashing the services of patients with disabilities?\u201d he said. \u201cThat becomes a tug-of-war. Not just financially, but even morally, what is the right thing for us to do as a legislature, given the fact that we have this very difficult dance to do?\u201d\n\nLooney and Fasano said they would look to whittle down costs, and have already removed some potentially costly provisions. The proposed budget released by the legislature\u2019s Appropriations Committee this week includes $1 million per year to implement the hospital-related measures.\n\n\u201cObviously in some cases, some money may need to be put in to recognize those needs,\u201d Looney said of the projected costs to state agencies. \u201cIn others, we may ask the department to go back and justify the fiscal note and indicate that in some cases, it might be able to be done within available appropriations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/01/will-lawmakers-take-action-on-changing-health-care-landscape/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, health care roundtable, Hospitals", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/01/will-lawmakers-take-action-on-changing-health-care-landscape/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Senate leaders are pushing forward with a package of controversial proposals aimed at increasing transparency in health care costs and quality, and giving the state more levers to address the growth of large health systems that control multiple hospitals and physician practices.
