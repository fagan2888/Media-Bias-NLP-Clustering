We don\u2019t either but the language of the fast-track bill makes clear he cannot use it unilaterally to supersede American law.\n\nOnce again, the WSJ has been outwitted by the cagey Obama.\n\nI have no proof that this statement comes straight from the White House \u201cwar room.\u201d But it certainly sounds Obama-esque, coming with equal measure of ignorance, arrogance, and dishonesty.\n\nThe section they\u2019re talking about is section 8. It prohibits trade agreement provisions which are \u201cinconsistent with [U.S.] law\u201d and provides that a trade agreement can\u2019t provide the U.S. from modifying its laws. It also provides that a dispute panel decision shall have no \u201cbinding effect on the law of the United States.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much intelligence to realize that this language is a big, fat, hypocritical, useless, deceptive, \u201cnothing-burger.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\nFIRST, the problem, generally, is NOT that new pro-union provisions \u2013 or new \u201cglobal warming\u201d regulations \u2013 or new gun control \u2013 or new immigration rules \u2013 are \u201cinconsistent with [U.S.] law.\u201d They aren\u2019t.\n\nThe problem is that they would do things that Congress has simply not chosen to do yet.\n\nThe sole exception in this list is immigration, in which statutory law seems to explicitly bar naturalization of certain persons. BUT NEWS ALERT: If Obama doesn\u2019t think this stature bars him from granting amnesty by executive fiat, then he isn\u2019t going to believe that immigration statues are inconsistent with \u201camnesty by trade agreement.\u201d And the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of stature isn\u2019t going to save us from that possibility.\n\nSECOND, a trade agreement, when approved by Congress, and signed by the president, becomes THE LAW OF THE LAND. It doesn\u2019t supersede provisions in the Constitution which explicitly prohibit an act. But, under Missouri v. Holland, it allows the government to do things it couldn\u2019t otherwise do. And, under standard legal constructs, is supersedes previous law which is incompatible with it. So here\u2019s a brain teaser: How do the courts come out when pitting an agreement which is automatically preemptive of U.S. law against a provision which it would automatically trump, but for provision saying it doesn\u2019t trump U.S. law?\n\nTHIRD, it is statutorily impossible to draft a statute which prohibits Congress from changing the law in the future \u2013 although the \u201cdeath panel\u201d provisions of ObamaCare attempt this. So saying a trade agreement can\u2019t prohibit future legislation is a big, fat nothing.\n\nFOURTH, to say a dispute panel has no binding effect on the law is not to say it doesn\u2019t have a binding effect on the parties. By analogy, when an agency issues a ruling, it may fundamentally change the regulatory landscape, but it doesn\u2019t amend the statute.\n\nMYTH #2: Trade is inherently good or inherently bad.\n\nOne columnist even quoted a 19th Century \u201cscholar\u201d who, using \u201cMalthusian math,\u201d \u201cdemonstrated\u201d that trade was an inherent good.\n\nYes and no.\n\nAmerica certainly benefited from restrictive trade policies which choked off the Soviet empire.\n\nConversely, when China joined the WHO, it is widely perceived that the PRC used that to thrust its economy ahead of ours. China allows investment, but only when it benefits China. And, with its new crackdown, the PRC is now using its economic strength to threaten the U.S. militarily in connection with disputed waters.\n\nTrade apologists cite job gains, but they usually don\u2019t cite \u201cNET\u201d job gains. And, whatever other benefits we have gotten from trade, the elimination of our \u201cRust Belt\u201d industries is not an unabated good. Except for the K-Street \u201csell them the rope\u201d crowd.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MYTH #1: Comes the May 18 edition of the Wall Street Journal with this pronouncement..05/27/2016 8:12:26AM EST.", "author": "Michael Hammond", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "MYTH #1: Comes the May 18 edition of the Wall Street Journal with this pronouncement.", "title": "- Why TPA Doesn\u2019t Protect US Law\u2014And a Rebuttal to One Other K-Street Myth", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelhammond/2015/05/29/why-tpa-doesnt-protect-us-lawand-a-rebuttal-to-one-other-kstreet-myth-n2005722", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/141/bcff7254-6522-4a1f-9291-1c0742cc4a3c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "MYTH #1: Comes the May 18 edition of the Wall Street Journal with this pronouncement.", "title": "- Why TPA Doesn\u2019t Protect US Law\u2014And a Rebuttal to One Other K-Street Myth", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelhammond/2015/05/29/why-tpa-doesnt-protect-us-lawand-a-rebuttal-to-one-other-kstreet-myth-n2005722", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/141/bcff7254-6522-4a1f-9291-1c0742cc4a3c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Why TPA Doesn\u2019t Protect US Law\u2014And a Rebuttal to One Other K-Street Myth, Michael Hammond, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It prohibits trade agreement provisions which are \u201cinconsistent with [U.S.] law\u201d and provides that a trade agreement can\u2019t provide the U.S. from modifying its laws.\nSo saying a trade agreement can\u2019t prohibit future legislation is a big, fat nothing.\nSECOND, a trade agreement, when approved by Congress, and signed by the president, becomes THE LAW OF THE LAND.\nBy analogy, when an agency issues a ruling, it may fundamentally change the regulatory landscape, but it doesn\u2019t amend the statute.\nTHIRD, it is statutorily impossible to draft a statute which prohibits Congress from changing the law in the future \u2013 although the \u201cdeath panel\u201d provisions of ObamaCare attempt this."}
