I have an hour commute and then I\u2019m at my desk for six hours. In the evening, I sit down for dinner, watch a bit of TV and read. I do get to the gym at least three times a week for an hour. Does that make up for all my sitting? \u2014 Allie G., Indianapolis\n\nA: You may think you\u2019re sitting pretty if you work out three to five days a week; after all, that\u2019s what we keep telling you to aim for, along with taking 10,000 steps a day.\n\n(That\u2019s the goal because 80 percent of the health benefits you\u2019ll get from regular physical activity come from going that distance, along with some cardio and resistance workouts.) But getting all the benefits from that physical activity also requires that you stand up for yourself. A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine says that even if you get regular exercise, sitting for prolonged periods of time increases your risk for cardiovascular disease by 14 percent, cancer by 13 percent and diabetes by an astounding 91 percent. And if you don\u2019t get regular exercise and also sit for prolonged times, your risk for premature death goes up 40 percent. Folks who sit for more than eight to nine hours a day are at highest risk.\n\nHere are a few solutions to the health traps that come with a modern lifestyle:\n\n\u25a0 When you\u2019re at work, stand up for 1-2 minutes every 30 minutes. That increases circulation and cuts the risk of insulin resistance that sitting initiates.\n\n\u25a0 Use a standing desk (or put your computer on books) and work standing up.\n\n\u25a0 Reduce your on-the-butt time at home. Get up every 30 minutes or at every commercial break and walk for two minutes.\n\nYour goal: Two to three hours LESS \u201csit time\u201d daily.\n\n\u25a0 Get good walking shoes so that your feet feel comfortable with your new standup routine. And make sure your posture is good \u2014 shoulders down and back, neck straight and pelvis slightly tucked.\n\nNow you\u2019re standing pretty!\n\nQ: Several of my friends and I are really into cooking, and we want to learn about new foods and experiment with healthier choices. But it\u2019s harder than we thought to get us all together to taste each other\u2019s recipes.\n\nAny suggestions? \u2014 Kay W. Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\nA: We have a great idea for you: Get your pals together for a potluck dinner club.\n\nHost the first one yourself, and then the others can take turns hosting after that.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Assign each member a dish or course: Appetizers, entrees, side dishes, desserts.\n\nDiscuss serving sizes \u2014 limit the chicken or fish proteins to 6 ounce servings; provide 1 cup of grains per person; limit starchy veggies to 1/2 cup with other veggies and fruits pretty much unlimited. Fun twist: Everybody makes a dish that\u2019s red or seasoned with three herbs. Then, everyone agrees to eliminate the Five Food Felons from the menu: That\u2019s all added sugars and syrups, any grain that isn\u2019t 100 percent whole and most saturated and all trans fats.\n\nWhen you avoid the Five Food Felons, you\u2019ll avoid stimulating production of the \u201cI\u2019m still hungry\u201d hormone called ghrelin.\n\nAnd when you prepare meals with walnuts, avocados, olives and olive oil, plus fruits and vegetables, and protein-rich foods like salmon, anchovies and ocean trout, you\u2019ll stimulate the \u201cI feel full\u201d hormone called leptin.\n\nNone of your club members will ever go home hungry.\n\nYour Potluck Club will show everyone that friendly get-togethers don\u2019t have to include unhealthful foods like chicken wings and fried mozzarella. And when you don\u2019t feel sluggish from eating lousy food, you\u2019ll actually have more fun with your friends and family.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
