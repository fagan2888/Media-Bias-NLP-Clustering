The government health insurance program recently expanded to millions of Americans. Although often considered free health insurance for the poor, federal law requires Medicaid to charge recipients for certain services, and they are sometimes billed after they die. Medicaid then charges the expenses to their leftover assets. It\u2019s called estate recovery, and it\u2019s making many people think twice.\n\nSally Schilling, a student at the University of California Berkeley Journalism School, brings us the story.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: The rollout of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid brought hope to people like Ruth and Rod Morgan, who had gone without health insurance for 10 years.\n\nRUTH MORGAN: When I heard about the Affordable Care Act, we were very excited. We were finally going to have health coverage.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: The Morgans live in Stockton, California. They are in their early 60s and are retired, aside from Rod\u2019s occasional construction jobs.\n\nRUTH MORGAN: We were pretty much forced into retirement because of the economic downturn. There just wasn\u2019t any work.\n\nROD MORGAN: And, I mean, we don\u2019t have much. But I would love to give our kids something. I would like to leave them a little something when we\u2019re gone.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: In states that have opted to expand Medicaid, like California, anyone making $16,000 or less per year now qualifies for Medicaid. But the Morgans were hesitant to sign up for California\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. They had heard that Medi-Cal would bill their estate after they die.\n\nROD MORGAN: The first person I asked about estate recovery when we started to sign up said, oh, we can\u2019t possibly charge you \u2014 do something like that for you an insurance policy that we are forcing you to have.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: With that reassurance, the Morgans signed up.\n\nRUTH MORGAN: And then weeks later, we got a letter in the mail saying, congratulations, congratulations! You qualified for Medi-Cal. And then on the back page, this little paragraph says that you are subject to estate recovery, and do not contact your social worker about this.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: In 1993, Congress passed a law requiring states to recover the costs of long-term care services spent on Medicaid recipients over the age of 55 after they die, the exact burden the couple was hoping to avoid.\n\nMATT SALO, National Association of Medicaid Directors: If you have the resources to pay for your own care, to pay for your own nursing home care, to pay for your own home health care, you should.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Matt Salo is executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. Medicaid recovery helps pay back a little for the massive amount spent on nursing homes and long-term care services.\n\nMATT SALO: Medicaid is the largest payer of long-term care in this country. Medicaid shouldn\u2019t and cannot sustain itself if it continues to provide all long-term care to all people, especially those who have the means of paying for some of it on their own.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Medi-Cal\u2019s managed care premiums are typically hundreds of dollars per month. But recipients aren\u2019t notified of how much money is being spent on them. Rod says he asked a Medi-Cal representative how much money he was accruing.\n\nROD MORGAN: And she said, oh, we don\u2019t have any idea. We don\u2019t figure that out until after you die.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Heirs could receive for a hardship waiver, but only if they can show that their parents\u2019 Medicaid bill would cause an undue hardship or that they were a caretaker for their parents in the family home.\n\nJo Ann Bell lives in Oakland, California, in the home her grandparents purchased in the 1940s. It was here that she cared for her mother with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nJO ANN BELL: Where I went, she went. We had a wonderful time.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Bell put her mother in adult day care while she went to work. Her mother\u2019s care was covered by Medi-Cal. Her mother passed away in 2012.\n\nJO ANN BELL: And then I got, bam, this letter from the state of California saying, oh, you owe us $54,000. I was like, what?\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Bell applied for a hardship waiver. But because the family home was entrusted to her and her three brothers, the state only waived her quarter of the recovery fees. The state now has a lien on the house for $43,000 at 7 percent interest. She worries she might have to sell the family home to pay off Medi-Cal.\n\nJO ANN BELL: And I would never be able to come down Adeline Street (ph) again, because the memories would be \u2014 it would be too hard. It would really be too hard.\n\nPAT MCGINNIS, California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform: Having a home is one of the key factors in being able to escape poverty.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Pat McGinnis, the executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, says estate recovery hurts the people who need inheritance the most.\n\nPAT MCGINNIS: What you\u2019re doing, again, destabilizing low-income communities and creating a cycle of poverty that people will never get out.\n\nMATT SALO: In many cases, what we see across this country is people who are trying to \u2014 trying to have it both ways, trying to say the family home and the family estate are super important to me and I need to pass them on untouched to my children, but when the time comes to pay for health care, to pay for long-term care, that should be government\u2019s responsibility. And that\u2019s just not a sustainable policy for Medicaid.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: Last August, health advocates put forward a bill that would have limited estate recovery in California to the federal minimum requirement, recovering only for long-term care.\n\nIt also would have eliminated the rule that allows only portions of a claim to be waived, the problem that Bell ran into. Both houses passed the bill unanimously, but at the advice of his budget staff, Governor Jerry Brown vetoed it. Brown\u2019s office declined an interview request. But in a veto message he said: \u201cAllowing more estate protection for the next generation may be a reasonable policy goal. The cost of this change, however, needs to be considered in the budget process next year.\u201d\n\nPAT MCGINNIS: The money we collect from the Medi-Cal recovery program is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s absolutely nothing compared to the misery and the burdens that it causes on the economy. So, if that\u2019s \u2014 somehow, we can\u2019t seem to get that through to the finance people for the governor.\n\nSALLY SCHILLING: So far, three states have scaled back their recovery programs. Washington, Oregon and Connecticut made these changes, citing concerns over estate recovery being a barrier to enrollment.\n\nCalifornia will hear a new bill aimed at scaling back estate recovery tomorrow.\n\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Sally Schilling in Oakland, California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid is thought of as free health insurance for the poor, but federal law requires that recipients pay for the costs of long-term care.
