Despite the long buildup to the enrollment rollout, there\u2019s plenty of confusion and no accessible way yet for people to plug in their specific information and find out exactly what their coverage would cost.\n\nMarketplace Resources \u25a0 Marketplace Web site: www.healthcare.gov \u25a0 Marketplace hot line telephone number:1-800-318-2596 \u25a0 Ohio Department of Insurance Web site: www.insurance.ohio.gov \u25a0 Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services Web site: www.michigan.gov/\u200bdifs\n\nThe marketplace, also known as health-care exchanges, will offer an assortment of insurance plans from private insurance firms. Some who forgo coverage next year may have to pay a penalty when they file their federal income tax returns. \u201cThis is a whole new world for a lot of people. Many of the folks who are going on the marketplace may never have had coverage or may not have had coverage for quite some time,\u201d said Amy Rohling McGee, president of the Columbus-based nonpartisan organization Health Policy Institute of Ohio.\n\nIn Ohio, about 1.3 million people under the age of 65 \u2014 including about 55,000 Lucas County residents \u2014 are uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In Michigan, roughly 1.13 million residents are uninsured.\n\nAbout 916,000 Ohioans are expected to be eligible for help paying for coverage, according to Families USA, a nonprofit group that is promoting the marketplace.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Insurance approved 12 companies that offer 200 individual health insurance plans and 184 plans from six companies offering small-group health insurance options. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will release a final list of approved plans by Oct. 1, a spokesman said.\n\nIn Michigan, 13 insurers offered almost 150 individual and small-group plans for the marketplace; a final list of plans has yet to be released, according to a spokesman with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\n\nSlightly more than half of those surveyed in a poll released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they don\u2019t have enough information about the health-care law to know how it affects them, and about 44 percent are confused about its status, according to the nonprofit organization that provides health-policy analysis.\n\n\u201cPatients are starting to ask questions about the exchange. The most common question is just, \u2018What is the exchange?\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Ken Bertka, chief medical officer of Mercy Medical Partners.\n\nGetting help\n\nFor those who need help answering that question or who don\u2019t know how to proceed, some help will be available.\n\nBut not everyone expected to provide assistance will be ready by Oct. 1.\n\nThe Toledo-based Neighborhood Health Association will receive roughly $860,000 in federal funds to educate people about the marketplace.\n\nThe association will fill nearly 30 positions, the bulk of which will be helpers, or \u201cnavigators,\u201d to assist the public.\n\nChief Executive Officer Doni Miller said navigators will be at community health centers and other sites. They must complete training and be certified by the Ohio Department of Insurance.\n\nShe hopes to have navigators ready to help people \u201cas close to Oct. 1 as we can get.\u201d\n\nAs of late last week, the state insurance department had not received any navigator certification applications.\n\nOfficials said navigators will play an important role in helping people sign up for coverage, especially those who don\u2019t have access to a computer, have trouble reading, or face other obstacles.\n\n\u201cThere will be a ton of people out there who won\u2019t have a clue how to do this and won\u2019t have the access to do it,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\n\nOhio agencies awarded federal funds to provide these services found out about their successful grants last month. That tight time line, training requirements, and uncertainty over state-specific rules made it challenging for some groups to organize quickly.\n\nJust last week, the Hospital Council of Northwest Ohio learned it won\u2019t be eligible to provide navigator services. The council had planned to use some funds from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks \u2014 which received the state\u2019s largest federal grant at roughly $2 million \u2014 to pay for up to five navigators in northwest Ohio.\n\nBut because the council manages a program that includes funding from some insurers who will sell plans in the marketplace, Ohio law prohibits the council from providing navigators, council Vice President Jan Ruma said.\n\nToledo/\u200bLucas County CareNet agreed to work with the program instead to provide local help.\n\nChecking up\n\nThe food bank group\u2019s grant will pay for up to 40 navigators to work throughout the state, Executive Director Lisa Hamler-Fugitt said. Her organization \u2014 one of several in Ohio to be awarded grants \u2014 was among some who received a letter from Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce asking for detailed information about the grant and how it would be used.\n\nMs. Hamler-Fugitt sent a 124-page response plus more documentation. She said she thinks the intent of the request was to deter agencies from providing the services.\n\nRep. Bill Johnson (R. Marietta) was among those who signed the letter, sent shorty after the grant was announced. His spokesman said he did so because he wants to know where the federal money is going and how it\u2019s being used as a matter of \u201cgeneral oversight.\u201d\n\n\u2018Self-serve\u2019\n\nFederal resources will play a key role in informing people, and the marketplace will be mostly \u201cself-serve\u201d in October until local assistance efforts are up and running, Ms. Ruma said.\n\nThe Web site www.healthcare.gov and a telephone hot line will help consumers enroll in marketplace plans. Insurance brokers and agents and other community groups also can offer various levels of help with the application process, said Trey Daly, the Cincinnati-based Ohio state director for Enroll America. The nonprofit group is telling uninsured residents about the marketplace by going door-to-door, making phone calls, and canvassing at events.\n\nMr. Daly visited Toledo recently to speak to a group of roughly 60 people who work with local health-care providers, insurers, and representatives of community agencies.\n\nProMedica, Mercy, and the University of Toledo Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio, have financial counseling services and will offer marketplace information for uninsured patients.\n\nDown to details\n\nMichigan and Ohio residents will use a federally run exchange to compare plans and enroll in coverage.\n\nStarting Oct. 1, insurance shoppers can go online to enter their information and review options in a format that might feel familiar to those who have used Web sites to buy flights or other goods and services.\n\nThe marketplace will allow people to check if they qualify for tax credits to defray the cost. Those with incomes that fall between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four, may qualify for tax credits.\n\nA plan\u2019s price tag can depend on age, tobacco use, where you live, and number of people covered. But, beginning in 2014, those with pre-existing conditions can\u2019t be refused coverage or charged more for insurance.\n\nPeople can choose from four, color-coded coverage levels. Platinum-level plans feature pricier monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs, while a bronze plan means paying a smaller premium but shouldering more of the cost when receiving care.\n\nAll plans must cover, at a minimum, the same \u201cessential benefits,\u201d services that include hospitalization, mental health care, maternity care, and prescription drugs.\n\nA 21-year-old, nonsmoking Lucas County resident who chooses one silver-level plan offered by HealthSpan, an insurer owned by Catholic Health Partners, would pay a monthly premium of $203.57. A 43-year-old on the same plan would have a $276.24 monthly premium, and a 64-year-old would have a $610.89 premium, according to rates provided by HealthSpan. Depending on their income, those plan buyers could be eligible for tax breaks to lower the cost.\n\nThose who receive Medicare, the government insurance program for people age 65 and older and those with certain disabilities, don\u2019t need to enroll in the marketplace.\n\nMedicaid\n\nThose who receive Medicaid, health coverage based on factors such as family size and income, also don\u2019t need to enroll in a marketplace plan.\n\nOhio has yet to decide on expanding Medicaid to cover those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Michigan agreed to expand the program. Without expansion, some low-income Ohioans, many of whom are people without dependent children, would fall through coverage cracks and not receive subsidies for marketplace plans or qualify for Medicaid, according to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.\n\nEmployer plans\n\nThose who have health insurance through a job also don\u2019t need to enroll in a marketplace plan. Some with employer-sponsored insurance may choose to check out marketplace options but may not be eligible for subsidies if their workplace plan is considered affordable.\n\nAbout 51 percent of Ohioans have employer-sponsored coverage. About 14 to 15 percent have Medicare, about the same percentage of those with Medicaid, and 5 percent purchase insurance on their own, according to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.\n\nThose without insurance in 2014 may have to pay a penalty, a fee that jumps each year. Next year, the fee amounts to the greater of 1 percent of one\u2019s annual income or $95 a person. The fee may be waived for religious reasons, for those who can\u2019t afford coverage, and for those who lack coverage for less than three months, among other possible exemptions.\n\nInitial interest\n\nNo one knows for certain whether Oct. 1 will bring a stampede or a trickle of traffic to the marketplace.\n\nSome are preparing for a rush of activity in early October. Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, the group to receive the biggest navigator grant in Michigan, is \u201creadying for an onslaught,\u201d Executive Director Don Hazaert said.\n\nOthers, such as Ms. Miller, expect a slow start that revs up after local groups have trained helpers to educate and assist consumers.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is totally confused. Remember, there has not been any widespread release of information to the public as to how they should be expected to respond,\u201d she said.\n\nContact Vanessa McCray at: vmccray@theblade.com or 419-724-6056, or on Twitter @vanmccray.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2013/09/21/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z/CTY-healthcareXX.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By VANESSA McCRAY <br>BLADE STAFF WRITER", "description": "First in an occasional series On your marks, get set, enroll.
