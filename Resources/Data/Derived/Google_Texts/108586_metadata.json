As it turned out, he lost more than the race. He lost his course record, too.\n\nHais Welday of Eritrea, who came to Denver a week ago, won the race in one hour, 6 minutes, 44 seconds to break the record Rizzo set in 2012 by a minute and 25 seconds.\n\nRizzo, who ran the Los Angeles Marathon (2:21:54) two months ago in 90-degree temperatures, still hasn\u2019t completely recovered from that race and a subsequent bout of giardia that caused him to lose 10 pounds. He finished second Sunday in 1:09:36.\n\n\u201cAt about 5K, I knew I was struggling a little bit more than I really should be for a half marathon,\u201d said Rizzo, 31, a resident of Colorado Springs. \u201cI knew my fitness was going to inhibit me. I\u2019m not out of shape, but I\u2019m not race ready.\u201d\n\nWelday, 25, saw Rizzo early but dropped him easily.\n\n\u201cThere was somebody there, there is good guy that was going with me for three miles,\u201d Welday said. \u201cAfter that I am going alone.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: 10th Annual Colfax Marathon runs through Denver\n\nEven winners humbled \u2014 Nicole Chyr won the women\u2019s marathon for the fourth time in five years but it \u201cfelt awful.\u201d The Highlands Ranch runner finished in 3 hours, 2 minutes, 4 seconds.\n\n\u201cMy legs blew up on me at mile 20, worse than any marathon in a while,\u201d Chyr said. \u201cThe marathon is just a humbling event. You forget how tough it really is. You hit that 20-mile mark and it is just mental at that point.\u201d\n\nRamon Paredes-Becerra, a 20-year-old from Chihuahua, Mexico, won the men\u2019s marathon in 2:36:13.\n\nOlympian going strong \u2014 Nuta Olaru, a 2004 Olympian for Romania who has lived in Longmont since 2006, is still running strong at age 44. Olaru finished second in the masters division at the Boston Marathon last month and she won the women\u2019s half marathon easily Sunday in 1:22:46.\n\n\u201cFirst mile there was some girls near me,\u201d said Olaru, who became a U.S. citizen in 2011. \u201cBut after that I pushed by myself.\u201d\n\nKristin Louderback of Highlands Ranch, who won the Cherry Creek Sneak 10-miler last month, was second in 1:24:23.\n\n\u201cI stuck with her for the first mile or two, and then she pulled away,\u201d Louderback said. \u201cYou have to be smart and realize the talent that\u2019s here and kind of run your own race. She\u2019s in a different class, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Colfax Marathon: Runner from Eritrea breaks half marathon record", "title": "Denver Colfax Marathon: Runner from Eritrea breaks half marathon record", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/17/denver-colfax-marathon-runner-from-eritrea-breaks-half-marathon-record/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__marathonfinalp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__marathonfinalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T13:08:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T05:36:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25e6\"", "article_summary": "Patrick Rizzo knew early in the Colfax Marathon\u2019s half marathon event that it wasn\u2019t going to be his day.\nOlaru finished second in the masters division at the Boston Marathon last month and she won the women\u2019s half marathon easily Sunday in 1:22:46.\n\u201cAt about 5K, I knew I was struggling a little bit more than I really should be for a half marathon,\u201d said Rizzo, 31, a resident of Colorado Springs.\n\u201cMy legs blew up on me at mile 20, worse than any marathon in a while,\u201d Chyr said.\nHais Welday of Eritrea, who came to Denver a week ago, won the race in one hour, 6 minutes, 44 seconds to break the record Rizzo set in 2012 by a minute and 25 seconds."}
