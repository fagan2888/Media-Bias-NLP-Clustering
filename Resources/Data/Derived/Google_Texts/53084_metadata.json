She told the Independent she had \u201cabsolutely no regrets\u201d in defacing the 9/11 memorial.\n\nThe college condemned the incident as vandalism and is investigating, the Daily Caller reported.\n\n\u201cThere is always something to learn from differences of opinion,\u201d Middlebury President Ron Liebowitz told the Caller. \u201cIn this case, the disrespectful methods of the protesters overshadowed anything that might have been learned from the convictions they claimed to promote. We will not tolerate this kind of behavior.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Members of the Abenaki tribe are outraged after protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont uprooted a 9/11 memorial display in their name.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/15/native-americans-outraged-after-protesters-destroy/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Members of the Abenaki tribe are outraged after protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont uprooted a 9/11 memorial display in their name.", "title": "American Indians outraged after protesters destroy 9/11 memorial in their name"}, "twitter": {"title": "American Indians outraged after protesters destroy 9/11 memorial in th", "description": "Members of the Abenaki tribe are outraged after protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont uprooted a 9/11 memorial display in their name.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Middlebury College In Vermont, Middlebury College"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc36f\"", "article_summary": "Members of the Abenaki tribe are outraged after protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont uprooted a 9/11 memorial display in their name.\nClaiming the memorial had defaced Abenaki land in the name of American imperialism, activists uprooted the memorial on Wednesday afternoon, 12 years after the World Trade Center was attacked.\nShe told the Independent she had \u201cabsolutely no regrets\u201d in defacing the 9/11 memorial.\n\u201cPutting flags in the earth to honor bravery would not be disrespectful.\u201dTwo people so far have admitted to destroying the memorial.\n\u201cIn this case, the disrespectful methods of the protesters overshadowed anything that might have been learned from the convictions they claimed to promote."}
