We were sitting on a bus,\u201d my grandmother, Gisa Spektor, recalls in a Polish-Yiddish accent. She holds back tears.\n\n\u201cA lady was sitting by me, and the lady said, \u2018I\u2019m not sitting with a jailbird.\u2019 She saw my number. She didn\u2019t want to sit with us.\u201d\n\nThe lady on the bus thought my bubby had been to prison, but she had gotten it wrong.\n\nGisa Spektor hadn\u2019t been to prison; she\u2019d been to hell.\n\nThat story is one of many my bubby tells in a video she made on Aug. 8, 1990, called \u201cThe Surviving Generations of the Holocaust.\u201d The video, part of a project conducted by Washington state, documents testimonials of Holocaust survivors and their children. It was produced under the direction of Spektor\u2019s son and my uncle, Michael.\n\nSome families have letters, pictures or other artifacts kept through the years to help tell the stories of their lives. Some have antiques, or land, or furniture lasting from generation to generation, priceless heirlooms that parents will pass down to their children and say, \u201cThis belonged to your great-great-grandmother.\u201d\n\nSome families have a big family tree, reaching back through the years, branching out to great-aunts, great-uncles, great-grandparents.\n\nMy family doesn\u2019t get to have that. Our ancestral heirlooms were stolen, our family tree destroyed.\n\nBut we have that video.\n\nI understand the importance of telling my bubby\u2019s story. I tell people about the incredibly shameful and private moment when my bubby, then 21 years old, had to strip naked in front of Nazi soldiers who laughed and shaved her head.\n\nI tell how one of her jobs in the camps was to drag corpses onto wagons, how she\u2019d watch fellow prisoners run into the barbed-wire fence just to avoid dying at the hands of German soldiers.\n\nI tell people that for six years, the only shoes my bubby wore were wooden clogs that didn\u2019t fit, that the only food she ate were bits of stale bread and slurps of soup made from poison ivy leaves, and that in the dead of winter, all she wore was a slip.\n\nOnce in awhile, I tell the very few details I know of how she and her friend, Sylvie, somehow escaped after being locked in a barn set on fire by Nazis.\n\nI sometimes tell about how in Auschwitz, my bubby wept as she hugged the body of her best friend, Libby, who had died from typhus.\n\nBut I\u2019m always left wondering if I shared her memories the right way \u2014 or if I even shared the right ones.\n\n\u201cDid I get the timeline right?\u201d I wonder. \u201cDid it happen in Auschwitz, or was it when she was in Dachau?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should have told the story about my bubby during the Death March.\u201d\n\nTruth is, I don\u2019t know which moments will do her the most justice, or how I could even have the authority to decide.\n\nI do know that every part of any survivor\u2019s story, no matter how atrocious, needs to be told and repeated.\n\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Day, being marked this Tuesday, is about remembering the way that it happened, not disguising the events to cause less grief. It\u2019s about sharing those stories of unthinkable horror so that we don\u2019t forget, and so it never happens again.\n\nToday, I will tell some of my bubby\u2019s more difficult stories \u2014 the ones that are almost too devastating to say out loud \u2014 so that we will always remember.\n\nIn the fall of 1939 \u2014 when Nazi Germany had already begun to occupy Poland \u2014 my bubby stood on the porch of her family\u2019s house in Krakow. Her father sat in a chair, surrounded by German soldiers. She watched as one of the Germans violently sheared her father\u2019s beard until his cheeks bled. The rest of the soldiers stood and laughed.\n\nWe remember.\n\nBubby grew up with her parents, three sisters and a brother. She married at 18, and by 20 had a 2-year-old daughter, Hanna.\n\nOnce the Nazis invaded Poland, they began occupying Jewish homes, and shipped family members off to different ghettos. Two of Bubby\u2019s sisters and her brother were sent away; she never knew to where or what happened to them.\n\nBubby was assigned to live in a ghetto with her parents, her husband, daughter, and a sister, Sally. They all lived in the same small room.\n\n\u201cOne morning at 5 a.m., German soldiers came knocking on the door with a dog while we were sleeping,\u201d Bubby says in the video.\n\n\u201cIt was hot, and the window was open. My sister Sally was in a nightgown, and she got very scared. She jumped from the third floor, and I saw her get killed right away on the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nSally was 21 years old.\n\nWe remember.\n\nFor eight months, Bubby lived in that ghetto, where she and her husband worked in a factory. She ironed uniforms for German soldiers and he sewed their pants.\n\nOne day, Nazis boarded up the doors to the factory from the outside, locking hundreds inside. There was no food, no water.\n\nTwo days later, the doors were opened. Everyone was gone. The ghetto had been liquidated.\n\nAnyone too old or too young to work needed to be exterminated, she had learned. Her mother, father, and her baby girl Hanna had been taken to a gas chamber.\n\nThe next day, anyone left in the ghettos was loaded onto trucks and transported to different concentration camps. My bubby and her husband were split up, and she never saw him again.\n\nWe remember.\n\nIt took my bubby years after the war to no longer feel envious when she\u2019d see another family, even though she remarried soon after. They eventually had two children (my mother and uncle), and then four grandchildren.\n\nI knew very little of Gisa Spektor\u2019s experience in the Holocaust growing up. The woman I knew and loved was a teddy bear. She smelled of Dune perfume, gave me succinct advice in Yiddish, made chicken soup from scratch, and was elegant, magnetic and funny. She always smiled at me, and hugged me, and I insisted on sitting next to her at every meal.\n\nMy bubby died in 2006, at the age of 87. Her family tree may have been destroyed, but she will always remain the root of mine.\n\nContact Francie Swidler at fswidler@denverpost.com, 303-954-1001.
