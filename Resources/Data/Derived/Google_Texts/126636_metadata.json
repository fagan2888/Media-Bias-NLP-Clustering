Bloomberg News\n\nVodafone, the U.K.-based telecom giant, and the computer science department of Imperial College in London are testing whether small data centers placed directly at mobile cell towers can boost data services to data-hungry consumers, a person familiar with the research said.\n\nCurrently, smartphones communicate with carrier networks\u2019 radio towers through radio signal, which is then sent to the carriers\u2019 data server centers. These are often located far away from the cell towers. With increasing data-heavy applications like video streaming happening on smartphones, data quality is a competitive factor, so distance between cell towers and data centers could be an important aspect of a carrier\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThe move comes as operators look for creative engineering solutions to deal with growing data traffic. Bringing data centers closer to the mobile tower, or base station, could allow for accommodation of bigger and faster traffic.\n\nLast February\u2014at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain\u2014U.S. technology group International Business Machines and Swedish telecom gear maker Nokia Siemens Networks said they are jointly working on the world\u2019s first mobile \u201cedge computing\u201d platform that can run applications directly within a mobile base station.\n\nVodafone says it has taken an interest in the hardware and software technology developed by IBM and NSN. \u201cOne of the platforms we have been looking at are the IBM and NSN applications,\u201d said a spokesman for Vodafone. \u201cWe are still in testing phases at the moment.\u201d\n\nVodafone, the world\u2019s second-largest mobile operator by number of subscribers after China Mobile, did not comment on the current stage of the testing or its own hardware innovations in this field. It also said there is no timing as yet for commercial roll-out of the technology.\n\nLondon\u2019s Imperial College, a public research U.K. university, is leading the scientific and technical research for the geo-located mini data centers.\n\nAlexander Wolf, a professor at the department of computing, says unnamed telecom carriers are looking into the market feasibility of placing smaller data centers at their towers, instead of only in their existing locations.\n\nShould the project come to fruition, carriers might also be able to take advantage of reduced latency, or time lag, to users, Mr. Wolf says. This could work, for example, in a mass participation spectacle like a sporting event or concert, he said.\n\n\u201cIf the carrier has an access point near the stadium, then they can think about what images, video and other content they can place there. There will be good response for the tens of thousands of people taking photos and videos and sharing them on social networks, as well as uploading, downloading, and watching videos,\u201d said Mr. Wolf.\n\nMr. Wolf said it was a potentially large investment for the carriers, without saying how much a mini data center would cost to establish and operate.\n\n\u201cFrom a technical and hardware point of view, the technology is quite mature. The software to manage it is a bit less mature, so that\u2019s maybe more in the realm of a few years,\u201d said Mr. Wolf.\n\n\u201cThe consumer is ready for it, but not necessarily the operators,\u201d he added.\n\nVodafone did not comment on whether it is working with Imperial College specifically on the project. It also did not comment on costs.\n\nEE\u2014another mobile operator in the U.K. with owned infrastructure\u2013was immediately unavailable to comment whether it is also involved in the project.\n\nStill, EE said demands on its network are \u201cincreasingly high\u201d at mass spectator events.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Vodafone and the computer science department of Imperial College in London are testing whether small data centers placed directly at mobile cell towers can boost data services to data-hungry consumers.", "title": "Big Data, Little Servers: Vodafone\u2019s Plan to Carry More Mobile Data", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/21/big-data-little-servers-vodafones-plan-to-carry-more-mobile-data/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DT210_mobile_P_20140718021426.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "Big Data, Little Servers: Vodafone\u2019s Plan to Carry More Mobile Data", "description": "Vodafone and the computer science department of Imperial College in London are testing whether small data centers placed directly at mobile cell towers can boost data services to data-hungry consumers.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Amir Mizroch and Simon Zekaria", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Digits Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Digits", "article.summary": "Vodafone and the computer science department of Imperial College in London are testing whether small data centers placed directly at mobile cell towers can boost data services to data-hungry consumers.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-21T12:52:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/21/big-data-little-servers-vodafones-plan-to-carry-more-mobile-data/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DGB-36600", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Vodafone and the computer science department of Imperial College in London are testing whether small data centers placed directly at mobile cell towers can boost data services to data-hungry consumers.", "title": "Big Data, Little Servers: Vodafone\u2019s Plan to Carry More Mobile Data", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/21/big-data-little-servers-vodafones-plan-to-carry-more-mobile-data/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DT210_mobile_P_20140718021426.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Digits", "article.id": "BL-DGB-36600", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-21T13:24:20-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Bringing data centers closer to the mobile tower, or base station, could allow for accommodation of bigger and faster traffic.\nLondon\u2019s Imperial College, a public research U.K. university, is leading the scientific and technical research for the geo-located mini data centers.\nCurrently, smartphones communicate with carrier networks\u2019 radio towers through radio signal, which is then sent to the carriers\u2019 data server centers.\nWith increasing data-heavy applications like video streaming happening on smartphones, data quality is a competitive factor, so distance between cell towers and data centers could be an important aspect of a carrier\u2019s infrastructure.\nWith more video streaming on its networks, Vodafone is looking to the future of its data infrastructure."}
