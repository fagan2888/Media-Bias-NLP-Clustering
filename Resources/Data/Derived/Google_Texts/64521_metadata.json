An old-school politician who literally grew up working in the family bar, his conservatism is of the traditional Midwestern kind \u2014 more Bob Dole, say, than Ted Cruz.\n\nOPINION\n\nMore process and negotiation, that is, than ideological certitude and visionary schemes to purge the nation of sin. To be blunt about it, very few Roman Catholics and none who grew up in a bar could ever believe such a thing possible. Unafraid to let his emotions show as Pope Francis urged lawmakers to compromise for the common good, he may in that moment have recognized his own complete failure.\n\nOn CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Boehner expressed his frustration in theological terms. Asked if the fundamentalist-dominated Tea Party faction that views him as a sellout to President Obama was unrealistic, he almost shouted.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely they\u2019re unrealistic!\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Bible says beware of false prophets. And there are people out there spreading\n\nnoise about how much can get done. I mean, this whole idea that we were going to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013, this plan never had a chance.\n\n\u201cBut over the course of the August recess in 2013, and the course of September,\u201d Boehner added, \u201ca lot of my Republican colleagues who knew it was a fool\u2019s errand, really they were getting all this pressure from home to do this. And so we have got groups here in town, members of the House and Senate here in town who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they \u2026 KNOW are never going to happen.\u201d\n\nNo, and shutting the government down in 2015 to get rid of Planned Parenthood has even less chance of accomplishing anything other than pointless melodrama, TV face time for the aforementioned Sen. Cruz, and the near-certain election of a Democratic president.\n\nThe late Robert F. Kennedy once told a friend of mine that no particular genius was required to succeed in politics, but you do have to be able to count. It\u2019s because Boehner understands that, yet seemingly lacked the intestinal fortitude to abandon the so-called \u201cHastert Rule,\u201d that his speakership came to such a sad end.\n\nRefusing to let the House vote on any bill not supported by a majority of Republicans not only placed party above country, it also permitted Tea Party hotheads to paralyze the government. In consequence, the New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin points out, a 2013\n\nimmigration reform bill favored by GOP leadership that passed 62-38 in the Senate never came to a vote in the House.\n\nSupported by such luminaries as Sens. John McCain and Marco Rubio, the bill would clearly have passed had Boehner allowed a vote \u2014 good for the nation, good for the Republican Party. Alas, to keep his job, Boehner caved to Tea Party nativists. In consequence, Toobin writes, \u201che suffered the fate of all those who give in to bullies; he was bullied some more.\u201d This year it was the highway bill, another popular, badly needed, job-intensive piece of legislation also opposed by the Tea Party.\n\nThe tyranny of the minority, you might call it. If they had their way, we\u2019d all have to buy tractors and bush-hog our own roads.\n\nInstead, Boehner permitted the innumerate faction something like 60 votes to repeal Obamacare \u2014 each as futile and pointless as the last and the very definition of \u201cthings they know are never going to happen.\u201d\n\nAnother consequence of Boehner\u2019s failure, it should be said, is the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, the blowhard billionaire who appears to have convinced millions of voters who failed to master eighth-grade civics that he can solve the nation\u2019s toughest problems by yelling at them.\n\nIn stepping down, Boehner secured the agreement of his GOP antagonists to vote for a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution, keeping the\n\ngovernment funded through mid-December with no demands to defund Planned Parenthood \u2014 the latest extreme right publicity stunt.\n\nAfter that, all bets are off.\n\n\u201cNovember and December are going to be like Dante\u2019s \u2018Inferno\u2019 around here,\u201d New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. told the\n\nNew York Times.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that Republican voters oppose shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood by 56-36\n\npercent. Americans overall oppose the idea by 69-23 percent.\n\nAll that\u2019s needed is a Speaker strong enough to put country above party.\n\nEmail: eugenelyons2@yahoo.com\n\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\n\nTweets by @CSTeditorials\n\nSend letters to: letters@suntimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Nothing so became John Boehner\u2019s tenure as House Speaker as his manner of leaving it.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/gene-lyons-next-speaker-better-dump-hastert-rule/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gene Lyons: Next Speaker better dump \u201cHastert Rule\u201d"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/gene-lyons-next-speaker-better-dump-hastert-rule/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Gene Lyons: Next Speaker better dump \u201cHastert Rule\u201d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd45f\"", "article_summary": "Gene Lyons: Next Speaker better dump \u201cHastert Rule\u201dNothing so became John Boehner\u2019s tenure as House Speaker as his manner of leaving it.\nAsked if the fundamentalist-dominated Tea Party faction that views him as a sellout to President Obama was unrealistic, he almost shouted.\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that Republican voters oppose shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood by 56-36percent.\nAlas, to keep his job, Boehner caved to Tea Party nativists.\nJohn McCain and Marco Rubio, the bill would clearly have passed had Boehner allowed a vote \u2014 good for the nation, good for the Republican Party."}
