Marco Rubio (Fla.), another presidential hopeful, many conservatives have been more receptive of the change in posture.\n\nSens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), White House candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and others have welcomed the thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations.\n\nThe GOP opposition appeared to be in trouble last week when the White House announced it planned to open the embassy in Cuba. The Cuban government said a U.S. Embassy in Havana and Cuban Embassy in Washington would both open their doors on July 20.\n\nStill, Graham\u2019s crusade is not necessarily dead.\n\nHe is going to seek to add an amendment when the bill reaches the full committee later this week, he told reporters, though it is unclear whether he has the support for it to stick.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve anticipated all my career is make sure I\u2019ve got the votes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to offer it tomorrow and whether or not we vote on it will be dependent on how the vote count goes.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Senate, House legislation to fund the State Department would block the creation of the embassy, which could be a stumbling block for the administration.\n\nA new ambassador to Cuba would also need to be confirmed by the Senate, which could be another hurdle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of where the votes are at, and the House has good language, which I support,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSo this thing is not over yet.\u201d\n\nThe Senate appropriations bill provides $49 billion in emergency and discretionary funding for the State Department and other foreign programs \u2014 a $2.8 billion cut from last year and nearly $5 billion below the White House\u2019s request.\n\nIt increases money for some programs meant to promote democracy, boosts aid to Jordan and Israel, and provides new money to aid violence-plagued regions of Central America.\n\nIt also makes money earmarked for an international climate fund conditional on congressional approval, which irked Democrats, and codifies a policy preventing the government from supporting organizations that promote or perform abortions.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The move appears too politically difficult for some GOP critics.", "description": "The move appears too politically difficult for some GOP critics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The move appears too politically difficult for some GOP critics.", "title": "Senators back off plan to block Cuban Embassy", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247094-senate-bill-backs-off-plan-to-block-cuban-embassy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/cubaembassy070215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-07T16:42:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-07T16:42-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247094-senate-bill-backs-off-plan-to-block-cuban-embassy", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-07T16:02-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cuba,Lindsey Graham,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T16:02:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-07T16:42:36-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247094-senate-bill-backs-off-plan-to-block-cuban-embassy", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The move appears too politically difficult for some GOP critics.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators back off plan to block Cuban Embassy"}, "dcterms.title": "Senators back off plan to block Cuban Embassy"}, "article_summary": "The Cuban government said a U.S. Embassy in Havana and Cuban Embassy in Washington would both open their doors on July 20.\nADVERTISEMENTEfforts to amend it to block the embassy appear politically impossible, subcommittee Chairman(R-S.C.) acknowledged, though he opposes the new embassy as much as ever.\nJeff Flake (R-Ariz.), White House candidate Sen.
