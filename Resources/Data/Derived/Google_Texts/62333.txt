Story highlights Republicans are scrambling to build support for legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the November 3 deadline

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, asked what they were planning to do, told reporters they had options but he declined to describe them

Washington (CNN) House Republicans are scrambling to build support for legislation that would raise the debt ceiling before the November 3 deadline in order for the U.S. to prevent a first-ever default.

GOP leaders were eyeing a vote on a plan crafted by the conservative Republican Study Committee that attached a series of spending cut targets and a freeze on new federal regulations to a bill that raised the debt ceiling thorough March 2017. After a closed door meeting on the issue on Wednesday morning, several House Republicans told CNN they expected a vote on that measure on Friday.

Now, leaders are pulling back and trying to come up with Plan B. And they want to get this done before next week's leadership election to replace outgoing House Speaker John Boehner.

"That particular proposal was floated by the RSC, and was an opportunity for leadership to take the pulse of the Conference as we assess all of our options, which we continue to do," one senior House GOP leadership aide, who refused to be identified, told CNN.

Even if House Republicans could pass a bill with the kinds of conditions the RSC plan included, or a mix of others, Democrats in the Senate have the votes to block it. Conversely, it's not clear there are enough GOP votes in the House for a clean bill to pass there. About 30 Republicans would have to join with all the Democrats for a clean bill to pass the House.
