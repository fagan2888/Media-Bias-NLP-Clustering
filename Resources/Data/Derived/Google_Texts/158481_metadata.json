A device developed at San Diego State that helps trainers figure out if an athlete has suffered a concussion is now on the market.\n\nThe device, called BtrackS, measures an athlete\u2019s ability to maintain good balance.\n\nIt looks like a scale you might find in your bathroom. When someone stands on it, it provides an accurate measure of the body\u2019s sway. The information is transmitted to a laptop or tablet computer.\n\nTrainers who suspect an athlete has suffered a concussion usually will give them a balance test. It includes walking in a straight line and standing on one leg.\n\nBut Dann Goble, SDSU assistant professor of exercise and nutritional sciences, said unlike his BtrackS device, the standard balance tests are not precise.\n\n\u201cSo what you end up getting is different trainers who are watching the same person do the test will come up with a different number,\" Goble explained. \"It\u2019s just because there\u2019s so much subjective judgment in that test.\u201d\n\nBalance is just one factor that trainers are concerned about in an athlete who they suspect has suffered a concussion. The others are memory loss and other cognitive problems, and physiological symptoms like headaches and wooziness.\n\nDoctors say proper assessment on the sidelines is critical. If a person who's suffered a concussion goes back into play too soon, they could suffer a secondary concussion which could cause irreparable brain damage.\n\nGoble\u2019s device costs significantly less than others on the market. He hopes the relatively low price will be affordable for high school and youth sports teams.\n\nNationwide, athletes suffer more than 300,000 sports-related concussions every year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A device developed at San Diego State that helps trainers figure out if an athlete has suffered a concussion is now on the market.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "A device developed at San Diego State that helps trainers figure out if an athlete has suffered a concussion is now on the market.", "title": "Concussion-Measuring Device Developed At SDSU Hits Market", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/19/concussion-measuring-device-developed-sdsu-hits-ma/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2014/08/19/balance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "142190 %##% Concussion-Measuring Device Developed At SDSU Hits Market", "keywords": "Health Care, Education, Colleges, Health", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "A device developed at San Diego State that helps trainers figure out if an athlete has suffered a concussion is now on the market.\nBut Dann Goble, SDSU assistant professor of exercise and nutritional sciences, said unlike his BtrackS device, the standard balance tests are not precise.\nTrainers who suspect an athlete has suffered a concussion usually will give them a balance test.\nIf a person who's suffered a concussion goes back into play too soon, they could suffer a secondary concussion which could cause irreparable brain damage.\nThe device, called BtrackS, measures an athlete\u2019s ability to maintain good balance."}
