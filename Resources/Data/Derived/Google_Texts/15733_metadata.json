In an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, the Republican front-runner claims that Ben Carson\u2019s description of his violent temper as a youth makes him unfit for office now, because anything \u201cpathological\u201d must be incurable. Trump then goes on to equate this situation to child molesters, saying since both are incurable, Carson\u2019s temper puts him in the same league.\n\nEr \u2026 what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the book that he\u2019s got a pathological temper,\u201d Trump told \u201cErin Burnett OutFront,\u201d speaking about Carson\u2019s autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem because you don\u2019t cure that \u2026 as an example: child molesting. You don\u2019t cure these people. You don\u2019t cure a child molester. There\u2019s no cure for it. Pathological, there\u2019s no cure for that.\u201d In his 1990 autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d Carson attributes violent behavior in his youth to his \u201cdisease,\u201d a \u201cpathological temper\u201d that the Republican presidential hopeful said caused him to strike one friend with a rock and attempt to stab another. In subsequent accounts of his violent youth, Carson said he once attempted to attack his mother with a hammer. \u201cI\u2019m not bringing up anything that\u2019s not in his book,\u201d Trump told Erin Burnett. \u201cYou know, when he says he went after his mother and wanted to hit her in the head with a hammer, that bothers me. I mean, that\u2019s pretty bad. When he says he\u2019s pathological \u2014 and he says that in the book, I don\u2019t say that \u2014 and again, I\u2019m not saying anything, I\u2019m not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease. And he said he\u2019s pathological, somebody said he has pathological disease.\u201d\n\nTwo points. First, \u201cpathological\u201d does not mean \u201cincurable,\u201d and anyway Carson uses the term as a descriptor, not a medical diagnosis. Second, there is a vast difference between having a violent temper in one\u2019s youth, and molesting children. This is mud-slinging of the most virulent and dishonest manner.\n\nNor is it a momentary lapse. Yesterday, Trump spoke at a rally in Iowa and made the same argument in a meandering, 95-minute speech that appears to show Trump getting rattled by his competition. The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson reports that Trump \u201cappeared to unravel on stage\u201d:\n\nAt first, the audience was quick to laugh at Trump\u2019s sharp insults and applaud his calls to better care for veterans, replace the Affordable Care Act and construct a wall along the Mexican border. But as the speech dragged on, the applause came less often and grew softer. As Trump attacked Carson using deeply personal language, the audience grew quiet, a few shaking their heads. A man sitting in the back of the auditorium loudly gasped. \u2026 He scoffed at those who have accused him of not understanding foreign policy, saying he knows more about Islamic State terrorists \u201cthan the generals do.\u201d He took credit for predicting the threat of Osama bin Laden and being right on the \u201canchor baby situation,\u201d a position he says \u201cthese great geniuses from Harvard Law School\u201d now back. He uttered the word \u201ccrap\u201d at least three times, and promised to \u201cbomb the s\u2014\u201d out of oil fields benefiting terrorists. He signed a book for a guy in the audience and then tossed it back at him with a flip: \u201cHere you go, baby. I love you.\u201d Trump called Republican rival Carly Fiorina \u201cCarly whatever-the-hell-her-name-is,\u201d accused Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton of playing the \u201cwoman\u2019s card\u201d and said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is \u201cweak like a baby.\u201d He then devoted more than 10 minutes angrily attacking his chief rival, Ben Carson, saying the retired doctor has a \u201cpathological disease\u201d with no cure, similar to being a child molester. \u201cIf I did the stuff he said he did, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now. It would have been over. It would have been over. It would have been totally over,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s who\u2019s in second place. And I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nConservative radio host Steven Deace was appalled \u2014 and broken-hearted at the spectacle:\n\nWatch all 9 minutes of this like I did. This broke my heart. I like Donald, and he\u2019s been used in a mighty way to dismantle the GOP establishment in this primary (which we owe him a debt of gratitude for). But this is embarrassing. Maybe the most embarrassing 9 minutes I\u2019ve ever seen from a GOP presidential candidate. And when your last two nominees are Romney and McCain, that\u2019s saying something. There\u2019s no other way to describe this other than a complete meltdown, and if you watch the reaction of most of those sitting in the background it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not comfortable with it, either. This isn\u2019t \u201cTrump being Trump\u201d or \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d This is conduct unbecoming of the highest office in the world. I highly doubt you build a multi-billion dollar, global conglomerate talking to people like this. If his goal was to hurt Ben Carson I suspect it will have the exact opposite impact.\n\nNote that the crowd is not only not cheering this, but they begin looking mighty uncomfortable within the first two minutes. They\u2019re not responding to Trump\u2019s laugh lines like \u201cgive me a break,\u201d so he feels the need at one point to step away from the microphone and mimic a knife attack. The only positive response Trump gets is when he calls the media \u201cscum.\u201d Deace is right \u2014 this is a meltdown.\n\nIt probably isn\u2019t a coincidence that these personal attacks come after Carson attacked Trump on his immigration policies. Trump has responded in the past to attacks from other candidates by ridiculing them, and those stuck because voters in this cycle distrust politicians as part of the status quo. Carson, however, is not a part of the establishment, and furthermore is well liked by the Republican base. In fact, Carson has the highest favorabilities in the field, and Trump among the lowest. Trump might damage Carson marginally, but he\u2019s going to self-immolate if keeps taking this act on the road.\n\nFinally, Trump misses the entire point of Carson\u2019s memoir. He admits to his violent temper as a way of explaining his redemption through faith in Jesus Christ. It intends to inspire young people by showing that they are not \u201cincurable,\u201d but can prevail over difficult circumstances and unhappy childhoods. Whether one supports Carson as a presidential candidate, most people can read his story and find inspiration and hope. Trump, for some reason, only sees child molesters, and that says much more about Trump than it does Carson. Of all the temperaments that need more scrutiny, Donald Trump just proved that his is the most questionable of all.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to include the link to Deace\u2019s Facebook post, but it\u2019s there now.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cMaybe the most embarrassing 9 minutes I\u2019ve ever seen from a GOP presidential candidate.\u201d", "title": "Trump: You know, Carson\u2019s temper problem is like being a child molester, right?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/13/trump-you-know-carsons-temper-problem-is-like-being-a-child-molester-right/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jpZgncFVfk/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/0jpZgncFVfk/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-13T14:21:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T15:05:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "Ben Carson, Donald Trump, mud-slinging, temperament,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s in the book that he\u2019s got a pathological temper,\u201d Trump told \u201cErin Burnett OutFront,\u201d speaking about Carson\u2019s autobiography.\nTrump: You know, Carson\u2019s temper problem is like being a child molester, right?\nSecond, there is a vast difference between having a violent temper in one\u2019s youth, and molesting children.\nHe admits to his violent temper as a way of explaining his redemption through faith in Jesus Christ.\nAnd he said he\u2019s pathological, somebody said he has pathological disease.\u201dTwo points."}
