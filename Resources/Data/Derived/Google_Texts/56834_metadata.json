The complaint alleges that, if the plans are then required to go back and withdraw and repay CMS for any diagnostic code that isn\u2019t fully supported, it could result in as much as a 20 percent reduction in the payments to the plans.\n\nThe insurers claim that this violates the \u201cactuarial equivalence\u201d required by the Medicare Act because it allows traditional fee-for-service Medicare participants to have all their reported health claims paid without requiring a comparison to the underlying medical records while forcing Medicare Advantage plans to do a searching audit and return a significant portion of their payments or be potentially subject to False Claims Act liability.\n\nThe case was filed Jan. 29 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is UnitedHealthcare Ins.

Burwell, D.D.C., No. 1:16-cv-157.\n\nTake a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center to receive industry-leading health law news and analysis.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/unitedhealthcare-takes-aim-b57982066927/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Forty-one companies under the UnitedHealth Group umbrella, led by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., have set their sights on blocking Medicare Advantage regulations governing the returning and...", "title": "UnitedHealthcare Takes Aim at Medicare Advantage Overpayment Rule"}, "csrf-token": "RX_aVTQWedMU6lArbjuySKH_D9g-iCKaith5kAvryB8m9C5W0yJmNrf96ufXQVQztDTvRk4xYrm_dpxxJjEfZamKR7a_XGV5Yv4hTxghai01:mjRTlOp6dsZ_osjVM6_VZ8z-Wu6VEy0MXZFdP2QyuTfiTzn4a2-efucUJIC-zTi2zJPevxmU5_ozTN1jQPrCMZaXi4ubpkmeRwDFXMCeqwI1", "description": "Forty-one companies under the UnitedHealth Group umbrella, led by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "The suit, filed last week claims that the rule on overpayments promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2014 doesn\u2019t follow the text of the Medicare Act, which requires that CMS assess the health status traditional fee-for-service Medicare participants and Medicare Advantage participants similarly.\nAccording to the UnitedHealth entities, this rule will result in vast underpayment for Medicare Advantage plans because their monthly capitation payments are based on the diagnostic codes provided to them in claim forms.\nThe case was filed Jan. 29 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is UnitedHealthcare Ins.\nTake a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center to receive industry-leading health law news and analysis.\nForty-one companies under the UnitedHealth Group umbrella, led by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., have set their sights on blocking Medicare Advantage regulations governing the returning and reporting of overpayments by filing suit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a federal district court in Washington."}
