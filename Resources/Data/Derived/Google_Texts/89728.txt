GE Healthcare is planning to bring a few big product unveilings to HIMSS15. Think interoperability, RCM and workflow solutions.

Shiv Gopalkrishnan, vice president and general manager of health system solutions at GE Healthcare said this year, with its nearly 5,000 square feet of exhibitor space they’ll be focusing on three big areas: payment reform, productivity solutions and better collections.

With the Affordable Care Act in full swing, not to mention the shift toward value-based care, payment reform is “top of mind for CFOs,” Gopalkrishnan said, thus a leading priority for GE Healthcare. Some of the company’s emphasis in this arena has been around financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments and bonuses.

The productivity bucket, as Gopalkrishnan explained, is really a “big deal” for GE Healthcare as healthcare organizations are facing cost pressures when it comes to reimbursement.

“They need to find a way to manage cost,” Gopalkrishnan said. And there’s a way to do it right by combining the clinical with the procedural. What they’re unveiling: a platform Gopalkrishnan described as being for a “newer generation of users.”

And lastly for those HIMSS15 attendees looking for software around improving collections, GE Healthcare is unveiling new tools for improving collections – essentially targeting payments that are traditionally missed, Gopalkrishnan explained.

GE will be at Booth 939 on the show floor.
