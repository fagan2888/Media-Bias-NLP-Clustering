Regular riders will now pay $2.75 per ride when traveling within the Seattle city limits and $3.25 when crossing the city limits. Seniors and disabled riders will pay a $1 fare and new youth fare is $1.50.\n\n\u201cThe ORCA LIFT card is a valuable and a much needed resource that makes public transportation more affordable and accessible for those who need and rely on it the most,\u201d said Amy Samudre of Global to Local, one of the organizations that is helping register people for the program, in an email.\n\nSamudre shared the response of one of the handful of people Global to Local has already enrolled in the program:\n\n\u201cMy family has zero income. Every dollar I save on bus fare can help pay for food and clothing, and all the basics of a household\u2026 Saving money on the bus will help us be self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nOther partner organizations helping to register residents for the discount ORCA cards include Refugee Women\u2019s Alliance and Catholic Community Services. The full list of enrollment locations is available on Metro\u2019s website. Many of the same staff in charge of enrolling 200,000 King County residents in insurance coverage through Obamacare have been trained to process transit fare cards as well.\n\nTo quality for the reduced fare, people should bring documents to verify their income, such as food-assistance cards, Medicaid or other health-benefit cards, a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families award letter; recent paycheck stubs; or federal tax returns. People who bring the required paper work should be able receive the the reduced fare card in a matter of minutes.\n\nKing County Metro expects between 45,000 and 100,000 people to sign up once the program is completely up and running.\n\nThe program is expected to be a huge benefit for low-income immigrant and refugee communities and others. But The Seattle Times reports that it will cost the already cash-strapped King County Metro about $4.75 million a year once the reduced fare is implemented, including a couple million dollars to manage passes, as well as about $3 million in developing software and fare cards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bus fares are going up again March 1st, but low-income riders may qualify for a new discount ORCA card program.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Karina Mazhukhina", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Globalist", "description": "Bus fares are going up again March 1st, but low-income riders may qualify for a new discount ORCA card program.", "title": "Can\u2019t hack fare hikes?
