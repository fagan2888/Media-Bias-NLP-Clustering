Healthcare Job Growth Reflects Aging Population, Newly Insured

Data showing that 2014 had the best job growth since 2008 suggests that hospital leadership is becoming more comfortable with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, says a managing director at PwC Health Research Institute.

The 311,000 new jobs created by the healthcare industry in 2014 represent the largest year of job growth in the sector in the past seven years, and it may suggest that providers are more comfortable with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while acknowledging the challenges of care access for an aging demographic.

Healthcare created 10% of the 2.95 million new jobs in the overall economy in 2014. The 311,000 new jobs in healthcare last year represent 2% of the 14.9 million people employed in the sector at the end of 2014. That includes 6.8 million people in ambulatory care, 4.8 million in hospitals, and 3.3 million in nursing and residential care.

"With healthcare representing about 17% of the U.S. economy, it is not surprising that one-in-10 new jobs would be in healthcare, even if the growth in overall health care spending has slowed," says John Ayanian, director of the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.

Ceci Connolly, Managing Director at PwC Health Research Institute, says she's not surprised either because "healthcare is typically a growth industry and there are a couple of reasons why that's even more the case right now."

"One is in part the Affordable Care Act," she says. "There are many more covered individuals. They are paying customers and so that's required more temporary and fulltime positions to get them signed up and answering their questions and getting them their care."
