I flip through my 50 columns, extract my favorite nuggets of advice from each month and serve up 12 lessons. Here are my top takeaways for the first six months of 2014:\n\nJanuary\n\nWhile researching a column on linen, I interviewed Richard Ostell, a respected fashion and home designer from Westchest-er, N.Y. He made me love linen even more, which I thought not possible. Linen in a home is like a sigh of relief. \u201cLinen is honest, simple, humble, and durable,\u201d he reminded me in an hour-long linen love fest.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, and here\u2019s where I really fell for the classic material, linen never needs to be ironed.\n\n\u201cEver?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt defeats the point of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rumpled look is part of its beauty. It should be left as it is.\u201d I let this sink in: I can get a better look with less effort. I am all over that.\n\nLesson: Linen, like life, is better relaxed.\n\nFebruary\n\nI was awakened to the genius in everyday design when I heard about an exhibit, \u201cHidden Heroes: The Genius of Everyday Things,\u201d opening at the Museum of Design in Atlanta. Laura Flusche, the museum\u2019s executive director, reframed great design for me: It is not some hoity-toity, fancy-pants status symbol reserved for only those who can afford it. It\u2019s the opposite. The exhibit paid tribute to 36 ordinary objects that have become indispensable \u2014 the zipper, bubble wrap, the light bulb, the corkscrew, the rubber band, the paperclip \u2014 items so useful billions have been made.\n\nLesson: Great design blends well, and is so useful we don\u2019t even notice it. Therein lies its genius.\n\nMarch\n\nReaders raised my consciousness. They cried fowl after I wrote a column about how feathers were trending up in interior d\u00e9cor. Feathers are fine when the plumes are a reflected as a motif in, say, wallpaper, fabric or tableware. But when actual feathers from endangered flocks are used for decoration, that is a bird of different color. My dear readers raised their concerns and my awareness, causing me to look into the impact other home d\u00e9cor choices have on our planet.\n\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t thinking about what impact their purchasing decisions have on animal and plant life around the world when they buy home furnishings,\u201d said Craig Hoover, chief of wildlife trade and conservation for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency that protects nature.\n\nItems made of carved ivory or tortoise shell come at a steep price to elephants and sea turtles. Showy pieces of pilfered coral deprive the thousands of species of fish that rely on reefs for food and shelter.\n\nLesson: If a home accessory comes at a cost to our planet or its wildlife, just say no.\n\nApril\n\nI moved for the fourth time in three years. Which awakened me to the importance of patterns in daily living.\n\nThough we take our routines for granted, they are the tracks that ground our days, the rudders that guide and tether. When all your things are in place, you can swiftly get dressed, put on mascara, feed the dog, pay a bill, check Facebook, scramble an egg, floss, set the table, and recycle the newspaper without thinking. When you move, you take every one of your earthly possessions and put them in a new place. Patterns get destroyed.\n\nBut moving also gives you another chance to streamline your acts of daily living and create new, better patterns.\n\nLesson: Living well is less about where you live, and more about how you live.\n\nMay\n\nI found more color courage. On a fear scale of one to 10 \u2014 10 being skydiving naked while speaking in public \u2014 putting big bold color in a room is a 12, for me and lots of others. The idea causes us to dodge tango tangerine or sassy cerulean or marvelous Marsala \u2014 and default to benign beige and safe-harbor gray.\n\n\u201cColor is such an affordable pleasure, yet many people get stuck living in bland spaces because they\u2019re afraid of making a mistake,\u201d said color consultant Barbara Schirmeister. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nOne cure for the color-shy is color blocking, which Schirmeister defines as the unexpected use of color in a large confident way in a spot.\n\nMake you nervous? Try this. Picture a completely white room. Now on top of your neutral background, add a turquoise sofa, a lemon-yellow chair and hot-pink window shades. Don\u2019t worry about using unexpected combinations. Congratulations. You just color blocked.\n\nLesson: Color takes courage. But dive in! Don\u2019t be dull.\n\nJune\n\nI discovered the role of irony in design. My ninth grade English teacher was the first to define the word irony for me. \u201cIrony,\u201d Miss Krisko said, \u201cis the opposite of what you expect to happen.\u201d That word sprang to mind as I looked through a new design book: \u201cThink Home: Everything you need to plan and create your perfect home,\u201d by Judith Wilson.\n\nI expected the usual eye candy. I found instead pages of the unexpected. For instance, the author placed a muted celery green sofa against a wall papered in acid lime. Pairing a subtle color and its electric counterpart gave the room a welcome jolt.\n\nLesson: Next time you decorate, try doing the opposite of what\u2019s expected.\n\nJoin me next week when I share highlights from the second half of 2014.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
