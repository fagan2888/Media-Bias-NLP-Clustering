This is a really big get for the deal\u2019s proponents: Gillibrand is from New York, and this sets up an interesting situation for the other Senator from that state, Chuck Schumer, whose vote is being watched on all sides.\n\nThe pool of undecided Senate Dems continues to shrink, and the math continues to get tougher and tougher for the agreement\u2019s opponents, who are pouring tens of millions of dollars into this battle with little to show for it thus far. \u2014 gs\n\n* If you\u2019re looking for a dead horse to beat, Mitch McConnell is your guy:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday said that language repealing ObamaCare is the most likely choice for a budget reconciliation package expected in the next year. The tactic allows Senate Republicans to pass legislation with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. \u201cThe use of reconciliation is in active discussion by the Senate and the House,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference touting the Senate\u2019s accomplishments of 2015. \u201cWe are looking at ways in which we would deploy budget reconciliation in a way that [President Obama] might not agree with us but that\u2019s still important to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the biggest candidate for that, not surprising to you, would be to try to repeal as much of ObamaCare as is reconcilable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs much of ObamaCare as is reconcilable\u201d will end up meaning \u201ckeeping all the stuff people like, but eliminating the provisions that pay for it.\u201d\n\n* Paul LePage of Maine, America\u2019s grumpiest governor, just got more reason to be grumpy:\n\nThe Maine state Supreme Court said Thursday that the 65 pieces of legislation that Gov. Paul LePage (R) missed the deadline to veto should be considered laws. The justices sided with state lawmakers who refused to take up the vetoes in mid-July because the typical 10 day period the governor has to act on legislation had lapsed. LePage argued that lawmakers had taken a type of adjournment that prevented him from returning the vetoes, and under the state constitution he was allowed to wait until legislators reconvened for more than three days to send back the bills. Statehouse leaders of both parties, as well as most legal experts, had disagreed with the governor\u2019s interpretation of the constitution.\n\nI predict he will grow red in the face, and call some people names.\n\n* Ben Adler explains how a Republican president could undermine the centerpiece of President Obama\u2019s long-term plan to curb carbon emissions.\n\n* Ian Millhiser points out that the Republican Party issued a statement celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, but the statement is full of coded language advocating more vote suppression.\n\n* And it\u2019s even worse than that \u2014 as Rick Hasen notes, the GOP statement specifically lauds early voting, at the same time that GOP legislators in a bunch of states are trying to cut back early voting.\n\n* A new Quinnipiac poll of New York City voters found not only that 73 percent favor raising the minimum wage to $15 for fast-food workers, but 57 percent said they\u2019d be willing to pay more so workers could have higher wages.\n\n* Caitlin MacNeal reports that there\u2019s some funny business in Scott Walker\u2019s past that hasn\u2019t gotten much attention from the media yet.\n\n* Francie Diep explains what would actually happen if Congress defunded Planned Parenthood.\n\n* Kevin Drum argues that the White House has assumed obsessive control over foreign policy in large part because of today\u2019s contentious media environment.\n\n* At The Week, I implored the media not to make too much of tonight\u2019s Republican debate.\n\n* Sean Trende offers some equations that help explain how presidential elections work.\n\n* And Gabriel Sherman reports that the Trump campaign is so beset by infighting that even Ivanka is involved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/06/happy-hour-roundup-663/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/15/National-Politics/Images/2015-05-17T042738Z_01_JEY955_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-REPUBLICANS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/06/happy-hour-roundup-663/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "plum line", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "plum line"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ce3\"", "article_summary": "* Ben Adler explains how a Republican president could undermine the centerpiece of President Obama\u2019s long-term plan to curb carbon emissions.\n* At The Week, I implored the media not to make too much of tonight\u2019s Republican debate.\n* And Gabriel Sherman reports that the Trump campaign is so beset by infighting that even Ivanka is involved.\nStatehouse leaders of both parties, as well as most legal experts, had disagreed with the governor\u2019s interpretation of the constitution.\n* Caitlin MacNeal reports that there\u2019s some funny business in Scott Walker\u2019s past that hasn\u2019t gotten much attention from the media yet."}
