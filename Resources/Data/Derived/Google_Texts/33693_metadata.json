Because we won.\n\nIn Iowa, which seems to bring out the worst behavior in every Republican who visits, Paul told radio host Jan Mickelson how he felt about icky brown people:\n\nWe won the war in Iraq, why would we be giving political asylum to people to come from a country where we won the war? It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re trying to escape Castro or trying to escape communism in Russia or Vietnam or somewhere else or China, I can understand asylum, but when you win the war, why would you give people asylum? And if the 60,000 coming here are friends of the West, wouldn\u2019t you want that 60,000 to be in Iraq helping to form a better country over there? If you let the better people, the people who like the United States leave and come here, then aren\u2019t you diminishing the numbers of folks that would make that country a better place to live? So I think the whole idea of resettling 60,000 people from Iraq over here was a mistake. But I also think that the refugee program as well as the student visa program are some of the highest risks for us to be attacked.\n\nYes, let\u2019s make them stay there where they can be subject to further brutality, and perhaps murdered. It\u2019s what Jesus would have wanted.\n\nThis is the same Rand Paul, by the way, of whom Catholic Online said in 2013, \u201c[E]xplained he believes there will be a time when we will all be judged based on whether or not we defended human life from the first moment of conception.\u201d\n\nThese refugees had their moment of conception. They are post-conception now. But their human lives seem irrelevant to Paul. Maybe he can mansplain that all to God when the time comes.\n\nIn 2014, a real Christian, Pope Francis, spoke up on behalf of refugees, declaring that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a refugee:\n\n\u201cRemember, Jesus was a refugee; he and Mary and Joseph had to go to Egypt to save his life. Pray to Mary who knows the pain of being a refugee.\u201d\n\nBut Francis offered more than prayers:\n\n\u201cLet us be close to them, sharing their fears and their uncertainty about the future and concretely alleviating their suffering.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cconcretely\u201d Francis did not have in mind a bullet (or a sword) in the back of the head. This is how Republicans repay their debts, and people like Paul might as well be standing on the sidelines and applauding the executions.\n\nPaul said in 2012 that, \u201cMy faith has never been easy for me.\u201d No indeed, nor for Iraqi refugees.\n\nWe might as well let the mafia run the country.\n\nIraq is really not a good subject for Republicans. Their president, George W. Bush, is the guy who invaded the country on a fabricated pretext, making the invasion as legal as Hitler\u2019s 1939 invasion of Poland, and then having toppled Saddam Hussein, completely bungled the aftermath.\n\nDespite Republican efforts to blame Obama, it is Republican incompetence that created ISIL, now terrorizing Syria and Iraq.\n\nTo compound that error in judgment, Jeb Bush has revealed not only that the architect of that disaster, Dubya himself, who still defends his decision to destabilize an entire region was a good idea, is his most trusted advisor \u2013 but that he too (more or less) still defends the invasion of Iraq.\n\nContrast with all the false machismo of the chickenhawks, Hillary Clinton\u2019s admission that she was wrong to vote for the Iraq War.\n\nAnd now they want to use the same false excuse they used to attack Iraq in order to attack Iran and create even more instability \u2013 and more refugees \u2013 in the region.\n\nScott Walker wants to treat ISIL like a labor union and Tom Cotton doesn\u2019t even know where Tehran is and Lindsey Graham just wants to hide under his bed. And as Steve Benen wrote at The Maddow Blog yesterday, Marco Rubio has \u201crepeatedly struggled with the basics of international affairs.\u201d\n\nYet Graham is calling Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u201cdelusional.\u201d\n\nWhere does it end? Isn\u2019t this just a topic the GOP should avoid? Every time they open their mouths they make their position more untenable.\n\nWe invaded Iraq. Our actions created those refugees \u2013 some 4.7 million of them \u2013 and they\u2019re arguably the lucky ones, because at least 100,000 and possibly up to another half-million may have died during or as a result of the invasion and the violence of its aftermath.\n\nYet Republicans claim that the Iraq War wasn\u2019t so bad because it didn\u2019t affect people\u2019s lives personally (ALERT: those 4.7 million refugees?), and that the Affordable Care Act is worse than the Iraq War.\n\nBecause Obamacare has killed 100,000 and left another 4.7 million refugees. It should be evident that Republican ideology is more deadly than Obamacare by a wide margin.\n\nIf Rand Paul were smart, he\u2019d just shut his mouth now, while he can claim to be in the running. He would, like Jeb Bush plans to do, stay out of Iowa, where bad things happen to Republican candidates, and he would never, ever, mention Iraq.\n\nHe can\u2019t do that. He had to not only mention Iraq but he had to do it in Iowa. Devotion to ideology is partly to blame, as is a need to appease the racist and bigoted Republican base who love to hear tales of icky brown people dying, especially bigots in Iowa where he is currently polling second to Scott Walker.\n\nBut mostly it\u2019s just that Rand Paul has the same faulty moral compass that has afflicted each and every Republican candidate for president since we left the 20th century behind.\n\nThese refugees have been hurt enough by the United States. I submit to you that they deserve better than another Republican president.\n\nWe all do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The invasion of Iraq and its bungled aftermath created millions of refugees.
