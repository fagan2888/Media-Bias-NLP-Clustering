Even with the addition of ACA fees, we are still seeing slower growth rates for CRG plan premiums compared to prior years.\u201d\n\nThe new rate increase will be effective July 1.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCRG Rate Increases Excluding ACA Fees, 2007-2014:\n\nYear / Rate Increase\n\n2007 \u2013 7.2%\n\n2008 \u2013 9.9%\n\n2009 \u2013 12.5%\n\n2010 \u2013 7.6%\n\n2011 \u2013 3.7%\n\n2012 \u2013 2.6%\n\n2013 \u2013 4.8%\n\n2014 \u2013 4.9%\n\nThe DCCA Insurance Division oversees the Hawaii insurance industry, issues licenses, examines the fiscal condition of Hawaii-based companies, reviews rate and policy filings, and investigates insurance related complaints.\n\nHMSA issued the following statement in response to the state\u2019s action:\n\n\u201cWe know that small business owners are struggling and doing everything they can to make sure their employees have a quality health care plan they can depend on. That\u2019s why we work so hard to responsibly manage every health care dollar we collect from them. \u201cTaking care of their health care needs is our responsibility. And to fulfill that obligation, we must make informed assumptions about the amount of health care benefits our members will need and how much those benefits will cost. The premium increases that we submitted to the state Insurance Division were informed calculations of how much it will cost in the coming year to make sure our members have access to the best quality health care when and where they need it. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the health care market right now. Last minute changes to the Affordable Care Act, such as President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to let small businesses choose between keeping their current health plans or moving to new ACA plans, has contributed to that uncertainty. It\u2019s not surprising that different parties have different opinions in this type of situation. While the Insurance Division\u2019s estimate of what it will cost to sustain the health care needs of our members is lower than our prediction, we\u2019re both committed to working together to do what\u2019s best for small businesses in Hawaii. \u201cWe believe a responsible way to reduce costs is to improve the health of all Hawaii residents, thereby reducing the need for health care services. Our new care model, which focuses on giving more attention to HMSA members who are sick and use the most health care services, will help reduce the amount we spend. And our efforts to get 100,000 people to take the Healthways Well-Being Assessment\u2122 will give us the information we need about Hawaii\u2019s people. This way, we can focus our resources and efforts in the right places, making us more efficient and bringing us closer to our goal of a healthier Hawaii.\u201d\n\n\u2013Dave Smith contributed.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "HMSA group plans' health care costs have gone up an average 6.65% a year since 2007.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2014/06/02/state-oks-reduced-hmsa-rate-hike/", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  State OKs Reduced HMSA Rate Hike", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HMSA-Keaau-rendering-1024x566.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Big Island Now: State OKs Reduced HMSA Rate Hike"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "health insurance,american care act,hmsa,department of commerce and consumer affairs,business", "theme-color": "#57ace2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceeb3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe rate increases significantly declined from 2011 to 2014, when premium increases averaged only 4% per year.\nThat\u2019s why we work so hard to responsibly manage every health care dollar we collect from them.\n\u201cTaking care of their health care needs is our responsibility.\nState Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito on Friday approved an 8.9% rate increase for Hawaii Medical Service Association\u2019s community-rated group plans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the health care market right now."}
