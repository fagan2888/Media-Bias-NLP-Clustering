Along the way they have befriended hundreds of other R.V. aficionados who, as he put it, are also \u201cliving the dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was working, my life was my schedule,\u201d Mr. Myers said. \u201cIt was an endless run of meetings. One thing I wanted when I retired was to not have a schedule and to get to know places I\u2019d only seen from airplanes on business trips.\u201d\n\nThe Myerses are members of a high-octane tribe of retirees who are transforming their golden years into a golden age of adventure on the open road. Inspired by disparate strands of the American way of life \u2014 from don\u2019t-tread-on-me individualism to an it-takes-a-village communitarianism, from a love of nature to a craving for the best creature comforts modernity can offer (or both) \u2014 they are a wildly diverse bunch.\n\nSome live in small trailers that cost a few thousand dollars and are barely larger than a van. Others cruise the country in expensive rigs \u2014 such as those favored by celebrity R.V. enthusiasts like Clarence Thomas and Robert De Niro \u2014 with flat-screen televisions and king-size beds. Some seek the country\u2019s most isolated nooks and crannies; others stay in plush R.V. resorts that offer more activities than costly summer camps for children. Most travel as couples; a few go solo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey include former teachers, lawyers, doctors, firefighters, artists and corporate executives. Not that it matters. In R.V. culture, \u201cno one asks what you\u2019ve done,\u201d said Kathi Vogler, 64, a retired nurse from Pompton Plains, N.J., who has traveled with her husband, John, a retired middle school principal, for five years, \u201cjust where you\u2019ve been, where you\u2019re going, what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nThe best estimates say 750,000 to one million retirees call R.V.s home, according to Kevin Broom, director of media relations for the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. He said independent studies suggested their ranks were growing. Although the recession took a toll on sales of new R.V.s, the number of R.V. owners 55 and older increased 20 percent, to 3.6 million, from 2005 through 2011.\n\nThat is not surprising. \u201cWe are seeing a lot more people, 55, 57, 58, who got laid off and decided they couldn\u2019t handle retirement,\u201d said David Gorin, an industry consultant from McLean, Va. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing more people who can use technology to work from the road and those who have just decided, \u2018Let\u2019s enjoy life while we can.\u2019 \u201d The Affordable Care Act may also make it easier for retirees who do not qualify for military benefits or Medicare to secure health insurance, making health care more accessible on the road.\n\nThe idea of retiring to an R.V. rarely comes in a flash of inspiration. \u201cMost people in the R.V. community come up through camping, starting when they were children,\u201d said Tim Deputy, general manager of the Sun-N-Fun Carefree RV Resort in Sarasota, Fla.\n\nThat camping experience is important because even the most plush R.V.s, with multiple rooms that slide out from the main body, providing up to 450 square feet of space, are smaller than the average home. If sleeping in a tent was your idea of a good time, an R.V. might seem like Versailles.\n\n\u201cIf I drive and I have to go to the bathroom, I have a bathroom,\u201d explained David Woodworth, 74, an R.V. historian who has crisscrossed the country dozens of times. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make it to where we need to at night it doesn\u2019t matter because we still have a comfortable bed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is possible to live quite cheaply in an R.V. Some devotees save big by establishing residency in income-tax-free states like Florida, Texas or South Dakota. Economic necessity, however, does not seem to be a prime motivation for most. Mr. Woodworth said the appeal had changed little since the first R.V.s were introduced around 1910 \u2014 adventure, freedom, spontaneity and community are words R.V. owners use frequently.\n\nBut the R.V. landscape has changed considerably in the last decade because of new technologies and the active lifestyle embraced by baby boomers. When Jaimie Hall Bruzenak, 69, began full-time R.V. living in 1992, cellphones, the Internet and satellite television were nascent technologies. She needed a service to forward her snail mail and an 800 number where friends could leave messages she would answer at pay phones. Now online banking gives her and her husband, George, instant access to Social Security checks; Skype allows them to stay in touch with friends and GPS makes it hard to get lost and easy to find stores. Solar panels help power her rig. Oddly enough, these advances have made it easier for them to live in the wild.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe love boondocking,\u201d or camping without hookups for water or electricity, \u201cin national parks and other public lands, away from everything except nature,\u201d said Ms. Bruzenak, whose books on the lifestyle include \u201cRetire to an RV: The Roadmap to Affordable Retirement.\u201d\n\nParks and other public lands remain among the most popular destinations, said Jeff Crider, an industry consultant in Palm Desert, Calif. \u201cThere are about 6,000 public campgrounds in the country, many of them in the most beautiful places on earth,\u201d he said.\n\nBudget cuts create opportunities for these retirees, as park agencies increasingly rely on volunteers. Called V.I.P.s (volunteers in park), they provide visitor information, patrol trails and present programs in exchange for camping privileges and an opportunity to explore the park in depth. Allen Parsons, 79, a former financial planner, and his wife, Bonnie, 69, a former physician assistant, who lived near Philadelphia, have served as \u201cvolunteer interpretive rangers\u201d at several national parks, including Yosemite, Yellowstone and Petrified Forest.\n\nSince hitting the road in 2007, they have observed bears, bison and many other species while wandering through every state in the lower 48. His voice filled with wonder, Mr. Parsons recalled watching animals congregate at the remaining water holes when the Everglades dried out in the spring. \u201cAs crocodiles lazed nearby, we watched an osprey family in their massive nest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mother is feeding her three young fledglings, as big as the adults, and chases away a vulture, while she\u2019s calling to her mate to provide more fish. On our last day at Flamingo we saw the fledglings fly for the first time.\u201d\n\nFor Wendy Parsels, 50, and her husband, Charles, 65, retiring to an R.V. in 2007 offered the chance to see America, and each other. We \u201chadn\u2019t spent a ton of time together\u201d because of their careers in the military, she explained. \u201cI\u2019d seen a lot of the world but not the U.S.,\u201d added Ms. Parsels. As her husband drove their motor home along U.S. 301 in Florida \u2014 \u201cwe just decided yesterday to go,\u201d she said \u2014 she said that they avoid Interstate highways \u201cat all costs,\u201d preferring \u201ctwo-lane roads\u201d that \u201callow us to go through all the small towns.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140514172010, "twitter": {"description": "Many are trading traditional homes for lives of mobility, freedom and spontaneity.", "title": "R.V.
