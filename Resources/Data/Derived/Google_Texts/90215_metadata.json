Avoid Bad Investments\n\nA single bad investment can quickly negate earnings gained from a lifetime of good investments. Or, in the words of Donald Trump,\u201dSometimes your best investments are the ones you don\u2019t make.\u201d\n\nThe single most common mistake that novice investors make, according to Investopedia, is to buy stock on the way down. Buyers dump money into sinking stocks thinking that the stock has reached an artificial low and will soon rise back up and become more valuable. In reality, the stock often continues its downward slide until the investor either runs out of money or decides to cut his losses.\n\nDon\u2019t chase stocks on their way down. Have an exit plan for when a security starts to tank. Don\u2019t put too much money into one stock at the same time. Although you shouldn\u2019t sell too soon, be sure to cut your losses when declines seem irreversible and never buy stocks you \u201clove\u201d purely on emotion. In short, follow Trump\u2019s advice and make your best investments the terrible ones you avoid.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Presidential Candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Plan for Your Wallet\n\n2. Make Money Doing What You Love\n\nIn an article titled \u201cWhy You Should Quit Your Job And Do What You Love,\u201d Forbes examines the elusive, but attainable, concept of turning your passions into a living. Most people have to pay bills. Most have to keep the landlord away. Those who have found a way to make a living off of doing what they would do for free anyway, however, have found the ultimate work-life balance.\n\nThe concept is summed up neatly in this piece of Donald Trump advice, \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in balancing work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable.\u201d\n\nTake honest inventory of your likes and dislikes, your strengths and weaknesses, and your motivating passions before you decide to quit your job and find a way to make your passions pay. Take risks, but those risks should be measured, calculated and realistic.\n\nHave faith in your talents \u2014 many successful, self-made people attribute their success to an internal belief that they were capable of more than what they were doing. Finally, if you have the courage to change careers in pursuit of your passions, expect setbacks \u2014 be persistent, and always think with the long term in mind.\n\n3. Underpromise and Overdeliver\n\nWhen you\u2019re striking a deal, signing a contract or selling a car, it\u2019s good business to avoid making promises you can\u2019t keep. One classic way to achieve this is to promise less than you\u2019re capable of delivering.\n\nOf all the Donald Trump quotes that address this subject, this one just might be the best: \u201cWhen I build something for somebody, I always add $50 million or $60 million onto the price. My guys come in, they say it\u2019s going to cost $75 million. I say it\u2019s going to cost $125 million, and I build it for $100 million. Basically, I did a lousy job. But they think I did a great job.\u201d\n\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t aim to get overpaid for doing a lousy job, but, as Business Insider pointed out, it is wise to factor hidden surprises into timelines, budgets and agreements. If you overpromise \u2014 or even accurately promise \u2014 a shipping timeline, a price point or a completion date, you are one stalled delivery truck, one computer crash, one unpaid invoice away from a disappointed customer, boss, client or partner. Instead, set expectations low and then smash them.\n\n4. Keep Your Eye on the Money\n\nThe bottom line is a company\u2019s net profits \u2014 the amount of money it has left over after deducting all of its expenses from its revenue. For Donald Trump, it is the only number that matters. \u201cI have made the tough decisions, always with an eye toward the bottom line,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPeople who are financially irresponsible have plenty of excuses never to take control of their finances. \u201cI have to spend money to keep up appearances,\u201d they say, or, \u201cI have plenty of time to make the money back,\u201d or, \u201cYou only live once, I may as well spend and have fun now.\u201d\n\nTaking your eye off of your bottom line is a sure way to end up as one of the millions of Americans \u2014 roughly one in three \u2014 who has no retirement savings, no 401k and no pension for retirement.\n\n5. Invest Your Money\n\nWhen you invest your money, you risk losing it. That can be a frightening proposition \u2014 but with risk comes the potential for reward. For the wealthy, this is an irresistible proposition. One of the best Donald Trump tips is, \u201cThe worst thing you can do is be timid and let your money just sit in your savings account.\u201d\n\nPeople can invest their money \u2014 even modest amounts of money \u2014 in a variety of different ways. Stocks, bonds and real estate are among the most common investments. Start by learning the basics \u2014 the federal government set up Investor.gov to help novices get acclimated before they begin. But don\u2019t waste any time getting some of your money out of that savings account and into the markets.\n\nThe average savings account offers a paltry return of 0.17 percent. The average historical return of stock market, on the other hand, is around 7 percent, including during the Great Depression and most recent recession. Be wise with your investments.\n\n6. Don\u2019t Overpay for Websites\n\nIn order to make it in virtually any industry in the digital age, you have to have a Web presence. If you\u2019re in business for yourself, or moonlighting on the side while your prepare to launch your own startup, you need a great website \u2014 but you don\u2019t necessarily need an expensive website.\n\nThis final piece of Donald Trump advice comes from a critique the vocal billionaire made about the costly and initially buggy website that introduced the U.S. to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The website\u2019s now-notorious rollout was botched from the beginning, with everything that could go wrong seeming going wrong.\n\nTrump stated, \u201cRemember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cA $5 billion dollar website \u2014 I have so many websites,\u201d he said. \u201cI have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3.\u201d\n\nAlthough you likely won\u2019t get a premium website for $3, you probably won\u2019t have to spend $5 billion, either. According to Forbes, websites are difficult to price because they vary so dramatically in functionality, design, security needs and support. An artist showcasing some paintings on a one-page website can expect to pay a lot less for a than a bank that needs a comprehensive system with multiple layers of security and backups. Determine why you need your website and what you expect it to do. Take multiple bids, both by the hour and at a flat rate, and shop not for the cheapest rate, but for the best value.\n\nKeep Reading: What Donald Trump and Jim Cramer Have in Their Wallets", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is the boisterous billionaire who shook the political world by dominating the Republican primaries -- in both the polls and in the media -- while crushing conventional wisdom and...", "original-source": "http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/6-things-donald-trump-says-should-do-money-2015/", "og": {"site_name": "GOBankingRates", "description": "Donald Trump is the boisterous billionaire who shook the political world by dominating the Republican primaries -- in both the polls and in the media -- while crushing conventional wisdom and exhibiting remarkable political staying power.
