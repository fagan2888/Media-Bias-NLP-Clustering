He had earned it.\n\nHis summer league over, it was time to take stock in the four games he played.\n\nRELATED: Denver Nuggets bow out of Las Vegas summer league with 3-2 record\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good summer league,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cWe were 3-0 before we lost. Like I said, I didn\u2019t care how many points, assists, whatever we got as long as we won. But this is where I critique myself the most. I could have had a better game (in the loss). I\u2019m banged up, but I could have been a lot better.\u201d\n\nMudiay, 19, averaged 12 points and 5.8 assists in four games. He also averaged 3.5 rebounds and 1.2 steals.\n\nThat was the good.\n\nMudiay also leaves Las Vegas with a healthy to-do list.\n\nHe shot just 38.5 percent from the field, including 14.3 percent from the 3-point line. First-year Nuggets coach Michael Malone pointed to the types of shots Mudiay was taking as the issue.\n\n\u201cObviously his shooting needs to get better,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThe reason that his shooting percentages are down sometimes is because he\u2019s taking very tough shots \u2014 leaning, fading, off balance, contested. So as he takes better shots, his percentages are going to go up.\u201d\n\nMalone then turned his attention to Mudiay\u2019s defense.\n\nRELATED: Nuggets GM Tim Connelly: Team \u201cfirmly behind\u201d Lawson\n\n\u201cFor me, defensively he\u2019s just got to lock in,\u201d the coach said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s everybody. He has to understand the personnel, who he\u2019s guarding. He has to understand what the game plan is and have discipline. And he has to give the defensive end of the floor the same amount of energy and focus that he gives the offensive end of the floor. And he\u2019s trying. He\u2019s making strides in that area.\u201d\n\nMalone emphasized that \u201cEmmanuel and I talk a lot. We watch film, we look at clips. Offensively, the game comes very easy for him, he has a great feel for the game, has a great poise for such a young kid.\u201d\n\nMudiay said he was not looking to be aggressive offensively more than he was trying to be a playmaker. Yet the No. 7 pick in the NBA draft scored in double figures in three of his four games. His best was 19 points in the Nuggets\u2019 victory over Sacramento. He shot 7-of-15 from the field in that game, but was more pleased with his 10 assists.\n\nRELATED: NBA summer league is like a job fair\n\n\u201cI love playmaking, love making other people better,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cThis week, I wasn\u2019t too focused on the scoring part, just because I wanted to facilitate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work on everything \u2014 even finishes around the basket.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Mudiay satisfied with first NBA summer league", "title": "Emmanuel Mudiay satisfied with first NBA summer league", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/emmanuel-mudiay-satisfied-with-first-nba-summer-league/", "image": {"width": 469, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__BN20150718_B2_BNSP18BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__BN20150718_B2_BNSP18BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T22:36:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T12:52:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1efe\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Denver Nuggets bow out of Las Vegas summer league with 3-2 record\u201cIt\u2019s been a good summer league,\u201d Mudiay said.\nRELATED: NBA summer league is like a job fair\u201cI love playmaking, love making other people better,\u201d Mudiay said.\nHis summer league over, it was time to take stock in the four games he played.\nSo as he takes better shots, his percentages are going to go up.\u201dMalone then turned his attention to Mudiay\u2019s defense.\nFirst-year Nuggets coach Michael Malone pointed to the types of shots Mudiay was taking as the issue."}
