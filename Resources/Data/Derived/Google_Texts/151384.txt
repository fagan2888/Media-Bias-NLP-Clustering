The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, includes the individual mandate, which requires most Americans have healthcare coverage or face a potential fine.

It also includes the employer mandate, which requires employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to their full-time employees or potentially face a fine.

Why am I just getting it?

If you have just received this form in the mail in the last day or two, don't be alarmed.

Your employer is required to send your Form 1095-C for the 2015 tax year on or before March 31, 2016.
