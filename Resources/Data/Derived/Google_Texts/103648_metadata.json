Supporters say the proposed measure is needed in Hawai\u02bbi as many unpaid caregivers are routinely called on to provide complex care in the home for which they are unprepared.\n\n\u201cAdvocates are grateful to Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection and Health Chair Rosalyn Baker for responding to the concerns of family caregivers across the state and supporting a bill that will promote greater family caregiver involvement in hospital discharge processes,\u201d said AARP Hawai\u02bbi State Director Barbara Kim Stanton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAARP representatives say they prefer SB 2397 SD1 to the House version of the bill (HB 2252 HD1). The CARE Act Coalition had called for clarifying amendments to ensure that hospitals adopt discharge procedures that exceed existing and proposed federal rules. Existing rules are \u201cinsufficient,\u201d they say, because they make family caregiver involvement the discretion of the hospitals. \u201cProposed federal rules likewise fall short of the CARE Act, and may not go into effect until 2018,\u201d advocates say.\n\nMeanwhile, AARP representatives say \u201cHawai\u02bbi is falling behind other states\u201d in recognizing the importance of family caregivers to the health of its aging population. Since 2014, 18 states have enacted laws allowing patients to designate caregivers and giving them an opportunity to receive after-care instructions to keep their loved ones safe at home after discharge. Another 23 states have introduced CARE Act legislation in 2016.\n\nAccording to AARP, an estimated 154,000 caregivers in Hawai\u02bbi provide increasingly complex care services \u2013 including injections, tube feedings, and medication management \u2013 to older loved ones at home. Collectively, Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s caregivers provided unpaid care valued at $2.1 billion in 2013 alone.\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization with nearly 150,000 members in Hawai\u02bbi. AARP advocates support of healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "While the bill passed key committees without some clarifying amendments advocates had asked for, supporters say they approach crossover with viable bills in", "og": {"url": "http://mauinow.com/2016/03/03/care-act-clears-key-senate-committees/", "type": "article", "image": "http://mauinow.com/files/2016/03/CARE-Act-Coalition-1024x768.jpg", "site_name": "Maui Now  |  CARE Act Clears Key Senate Committees", "title": "Maui Now: CARE Act Clears Key Senate Committees"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://mauinow.com/wp-content/themes/MauiNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "care act,caregiver bill,sb2397,aarp hawaii,roz baker,maui news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d19\"", "article_summary": "Members of the Hawai\u02bbi CARE Act Coalition this week welcomed the passage of SB 2397 SD1 by the Senate Judiciary and Labor and Senate Human Services Committees.\nThe caregiver bill sometimes referred to as the CARE Act or SB2397 SD1, passed key committees ahead of next week\u2019s crossover deadline.\n\u201cProposed federal rules likewise fall short of the CARE Act, and may not go into effect until 2018,\u201d advocates say.\nAnother 23 states have introduced CARE Act legislation in 2016.\nThe CARE Act Coalition had called for clarifying amendments to ensure that hospitals adopt discharge procedures that exceed existing and proposed federal rules."}
