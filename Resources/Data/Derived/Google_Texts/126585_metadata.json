It\u2019s the same show on which that one guy bought his pregnant girlfriend an engagement ring at Walmart, then returned it later because he wanted to use the money to buy an Xbox.\n\n\u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d, one of MTV\u2019s most infamous reality shows to date, has been creating controversies since 2009. As its self-evident title would suggest, \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d follows the lives of pregnant teenage women and their bumbling male counterparts. Expectedly, the show has garnered a significant amount of criticism.\n\nSome claimed that the show\u2019s popularity seemed to dilute its original message. Today contributor Ashley Majeski wrote that in light of the show\u2019s gargantuan success, many of the previously impoverished teen moms have wound up on the other side of the payscale: \u201cAs the media\u2019s obsession with the moms grew, so did the young women\u2019s paychecks. No longer were they struggling to find money to buy diapers; they were buying houses, breast implants and more, all thanks to their MTV salaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of really helping viewers understand the day-to-day responsibilities of attending to a new infant \u2014 scrubbing poop stains or spit-up out of clothing \u2014 or dwelling on the \u2018mundane,\u2019 MTV chooses to focus on the girls\u2019 volatile relationships with the babies\u2019 fathers or their new body piercings and tattoos,\u201d Parents Television Council Director Melissa Henson wrote on CNN. \u201cThat makes for better TV.\u201d\n\nMany suggested that \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d glorified teenage pregnancy through the fame cast members earned, and others hated it because it was a reality show on MTV. However, in the show\u2019s original, pre-fame form, others feel \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d served as one of society\u2019s most tangible examples of how devastating unplanned pregnancies can be.\n\n\u201cThe way pregnancy and parenthood are portrayed isn\u2019t glorified or glamorous,\u201d said Amy Kramer of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. \u201cIt\u2019s up-front and honest. I don\u2019t think you can sit through any episode and say, \u2018Wow, that looks awesome.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBill Albert, Chief Program Officer for The National Campaign, was reported by The Washington Times as having said, \u201cone could make the argument that these are the best teen-pregnancy-prevention public service announcements ever made.\u201d\n\nToday, the numbers are in.\n\nA study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the polarizing reality show ultimately led to a 5.7 percent reduction in teenage pregnancy 18 months after its television debut. Researchers concluded that this drop accounts for one-third of the overall decline in teenage births.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t due to Obamacare, or better healthcare coverage, or even Juno. Researchers took to the biggest platform for unfiltered, unapologetic, cringeworthy teenage honesty \u2014 the Internet. On Twitter, they tracked the volume of hashtags like \u201c#abortion\u201d and \u201c#birthcontrol\u201d mentioned in tweets about the show. On Google, researchers Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine geographically pinpointed areas with high search and tweet activity for the show and then took the data to Nielsen to verify that such areas had a high volume of viewership.\n\nIn the areas with a concentrated volume of online interest, those who had searched the web for \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d had later searched for things like \u201cabortion,\u201d \u201cbirth control\u201d and the like. Unsurprisingly, it wasn\u2019t reported that a higher volume of searches like \u201cabstinence\u201d or \u201chow the heck can I stop doing this super fun cardio workout\u201d were found. Teens are still having sex, but at least they\u2019re taking the implications more seriously.\n\nUntil there\u2019s a reality show that makes sex out to be some sort of ghastly undesirable that causes warts, dramatic weight gain and painful urination (ironically, all true), we\u2019ll still be living in a world where our youngest citizens are producing even younger ones. Frankly, that\u2019d probably make for excellently crass television. MTV, I demand my fair share of the rights.\n\n\u201cThe results of our analysis indicate that exposure to \u201916 and Pregnant\u2019 was high and that it had an influence on teens\u2019 thinking regarding birth control and abortion,\u201d wrote Kearney and Levine.\n\nThough the news that MTV has had a positive effect on society is groundbreaking enough, Kearney noted that teens\u2019 social media presence served as some of the most captivating evidence: \u201cThe text of the tweets are phenomenal: \u2018This reminds me to take my birth control.\u2019 \u2018Watching \u201c16 and Pregnant,\u201d going to take my birth control,\u2019 \u201d recalled Kearney.\n\nMost don\u2019t have too many ideological issues with birth control, but abortion is a dramatically different story. Though the findings of Kearney and Levine are being widely received as a positive, many will undoubtedly see it as nothing more than an increase in abortions. According to research published by the Guttmacher Institute, roughly half of the pregnancies among American women are unintended, and four in 10 of said pregnancies end in abortion.\n\nAssuming that the rate of teens having sex has stayed the same (the study published no findings on the subject), the results of Kearney and Levine\u2019s work suggest an increase in teenage abortions that isn\u2019t balanced out by a decrease in teen sex. Adoption remains a universally pacifying option, but its popularity has plummeted in recent years. Kristi Burton Brown, correspondent with LifeNews wrote, \u201cAdoption statistics are hard to track, since states are not necessarily required to report domestic adoptions. However, the numbers are grim, and much of it is owing to abortion.\u201d\n\nBusiness Library reported \u201cthere are up to 36 couples waiting for every one baby placed for adoption.\u201d\n\nGuiliana Rancic of E! Entertainment, who has been outwardly public on her struggles with fertility, shared personal difficulty she has enjoying the MTV reality behemoth.\n\n\u201cI would go, \u2018I\u2019m a good person, and I could give someone the greatest life of all, but yet I can\u2019t get pregnant.\u2019 And then you watch these TV shows, \u201916 and Pregnant,\u2019 and these girls who want nothing to do with their babies are pregnant,\u201d Rancic shared. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of that made sense to me.\u201d\n\nSenior staff columnist Cara Smith is a communications junior and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "We all know that one show on MTV (which, as a general reminder to MTV\u2019s production team, stands for Music Television) that\u2019s generated more buzz than \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d \u201cThe Real World\u201d or any of their on-air music videos ever could.
