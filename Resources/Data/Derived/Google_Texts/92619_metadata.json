Citing the tanking economy and changes to the health care business following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, different development groups failed to find businesses for the property.\n\nAfter waiting to see what would happen, Burlington Core Upgrades II, LLC \u2013 led by Tom Stelling and Bill Stone \u2013 came to the CDA last month offering to purchase the land on East Chestnut Street for its appraised value of about $70,000.\n\nThe document approved Tuesday night will give both the development group and the city 90 days to back out of the deal. That was done so if another offer came in, the city could \u201cstart dancing with somebody else, if they so wish,\u201d said City Attorney John Bjelajac.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident, personally, if this deal does close, we are doing the right thing,\u201d he added about the Core Upgrades group. Stelling and Stone have been a part of the potential development almost from the beginning, and have brought several options before the council in the last four to six years.\n\n\u201cIf I were doing a prediction, we\u2019ll be doing the deal with these guys,\u201d Bjelajac added, saying he didn\u2019t expect anyone to come forward with an offer to purchase the parcel.\n\nThe document, Bjelajac said, was drawn up to allow the CDA flexibility in awarding the sale of the land regardless.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "myracinecounty", "description": "By Jennifer Eisenbart Editor With a contract officially approved Tuesday night by the City of Burlington Community Development Authority, the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land in downtown Burli\u2026", "title": "Contract ready for downtown site sale", "url": "http://myracinecounty.com/?p=21063", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-09T12:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T18:31:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0"}, "article_summary": "The CDA approved a document for the sale of the property marked for a retail development when the downtown redevelopment began to move forward in 2009.\nThe document, Bjelajac said, was drawn up to allow the CDA flexibility in awarding the sale of the land regardless.\nBy Jennifer EisenbartEditorWith a contract officially approved Tuesday night by the City of Burlington Community Development Authority, the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land in downtown Burlington will likely move forward.\nComing out of that project was the Hampton Inn and the downtown parking structure, but the retail development adjacent to the parking structure never came to fruition.\nThe document approved Tuesday night will give both the development group and the city 90 days to back out of the deal."}
