Bill Haslam (Photo: Samuel M. Simpkins / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nPretty much everyone agrees that Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s plan to overhaul the Tennessee Board of Regents system is some of the biggest news in higher education this year. But a local expert has a different take.\n\nWill Doyle, a Vanderbilt University professor who researches state and federal higher education policy, said the proposed changes might not be that big at all. Most of the time, he said, plans to split a system of colleges into separate entities \"seem like they\u2019re going to do a lot more than they actually do.\"\n\nThe plan would split off the six universities governed by the Board of Regents and create new local boards for each. If it is approved, schools such as Middle Tennessee State University and Austin Peay State University would have local governing boards that would be free to set tuition, hire or fire a president and approve a budget.\n\nWhen it comes to student success, Doyle said, evidence doesn't show that there is much of a difference between a central college system and individual boards. Doyle said that in Florida, where public colleges have veered between a central system and independent boards, graduation rates and student retention have stayed about the same.\n\nThe changes \u201chave impacts on campuses,\" he said. \u201cBut when you take a big picture and see how the state is doing, you don\u2019t tend to see those big differences.\u201d\n\nDoyle said that the individual boards might affect the way administrators go about making policy changes, but they don't typically have an impact on the student experience on campus.\n\nWhat can change when universities go from a large system to individual boards is tuition. Doyle said centralized systems, such as the Board of Regents in its current form, tend to have lower tuition rates.\n\nIndividual boards are more likely to hike tuition to bankroll projects that are important to university leadership\n\n\u201cIf the state is interested in keeping tuition lower and keeping cost per student lower,\" he said, \"there\u2019s some evidence that a centralized board is going to be better able to do that.\"\n\nHaslam has said his proposal would guard against higher tuition rates under the new boards. If his plan is approved, the higher education commission would be able to set binding limits to annual tuition increases.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1XUN5KY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vanderbilt expert said plans to split a system of colleges into separate entities \"seem like they\u2019re going to do a lot more than they actually do.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Vanderbilt expert said plans to split a system of colleges into separate entities \"seem like they\u2019re going to do a lot more than they actually do.\"", "title": "Expert: Haslam\u2019s college plan might not change much", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2015/12/06/expert-haslams-college-plan-might-not-change-much/76907990/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vanderbilt expert said plans to split a system of colleges into separate entities \"seem like they\u2019re going to do a lot more than they actually do.\"", "title": "Expert: Haslam\u2019s college plan might not change much", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64014e4845692dc7a00f73b2cff781eb0c8f5763/c=954-0-3097-2143&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Expert: Haslam\u2019s college plan might not change much", "author": "Adam Tamburin", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/education", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb7b7f497ad1d1b0b9138f89102776f4595e1022/c=1370-0-2977-2143/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03a4508540ea4c5d963fa82dcd1263efbbdd6aa4/c=954-0-3097-2143/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d428d9c6028272c3ad08e741e69a9f45b387a3f1/c=318-0-3168-2143/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f5c7061740fd5e3ca3be63e502e10dfa17f00cd/c=0-235-3219-2053&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-06T22:44:41.907000-06:00", "shorthed": "Expert: College plan won't change much", "articleid": 76907990, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac4cee42355af7c86af9c211a3cf97364737ad62/c=0-235-3219-2053/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/32dd29217fe22169ea568e4295a473f2a14999bb/c=1683-0-2883-2143/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845716279847282-NAS-COLLEGE-ANNOUNCEMENT-02.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "bill haslam, tennessee, board of regents, mtsu, reorganization, vanderbilt, will doyle"}, "article_summary": "Bill Haslam\u2019s plan to overhaul the Tennessee Board of Regents system is some of the biggest news in higher education this year.\nThe plan would split off the six universities governed by the Board of Regents and create new local boards for each.\nIf his plan is approved, the higher education commission would be able to set binding limits to annual tuition increases.\nWhat can change when universities go from a large system to individual boards is tuition.\nHaslam has said his proposal would guard against higher tuition rates under the new boards."}
