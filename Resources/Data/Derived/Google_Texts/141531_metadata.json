Ted Cruz of Texas said after Thursday evening\u2019s GOP presidential debate that he\u2019s the only candidate in the 2016 presidential race who has consistently opposed \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cIn the Republican field, I am the only person on that stage, the only Republican running, who opposes amnesty, who opposes a pathway to citizenship,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d \u201cMarco Rubio and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2014 all three of them support a pathway to citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Donald Trump, who uses a lot of tough language, says that we should send people home but then let them back in and become citizens. That, as you know, is what\u2019s called touchback, the establishment Republicans \u2014 it\u2019s a form of amnesty, the Trump touchback, where they fly home, they touch the ground and come back as citizens,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI am the only Republican running who has consistently opposed amnesty every single day and will do so as president,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump, who was not at Thursday\u2019s debate, has called Mr. Cruz \u201cvery weak\u201d on the issue of illegal immigration and has said Mr. Cruz is following his own lead on a call to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Rubio, who helped author a 2013 bill that would provide an eventual pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, said during Thursday\u2019s debate that he opposes amnesty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
