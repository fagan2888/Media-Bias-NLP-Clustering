Shell Offshore Inc. sued on April 7, one day after six Greenpeace protesters boarded the Blue Marlin, a heavy-lift ship carrying a Transocean Ltd. semi-submersible drilling unit, the Polar Pioneer, as it crossed the Pacific.\n\nThe injunction establishes buffer zones from 300 feet to about 5,000 feet for all of Shell\u2019s Chukchi Sea fleet, anchor lines and buoys attached to ships.\n\nShell wants to drill this summer in the sea off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast to determine whether there are commercial quantities of oil and gas. Arctic offshore reserves are estimated at 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 130 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates.\n\nShell said it was pleased with the injunction.\n\n\u201cWe cannot condone Greenpeace\u2019s unlawful and unsafe tactics. Safety remains paramount,\u201d Shell said in a statement.\n\nGreenpeace called the ruling disappointing.\n\n\u201cInstead of saying Greenpeace can\u2019t go near Shell, our government should be saying Shell can\u2019t go near the Arctic,\u201d Greenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile in Seattle, Shell wants to park two massive Arctic oil drilling rigs in the waterfront, but it has to get around protesters in kayaks and the city\u2019s mayor.\n\nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray on Monday said the Port of Seattle must get a new permit before it can host Shell\u2019s drilling fleet. The mayor urged the port to reconsider its two-year, $13 million lease with Foss Maritime, a company that has been in Seattle for more than a century and whose client is Shell.\n\nThe 400-foot-long Polar Pioneer is in Port Angeles, Washington, but will head to Seattle sometime in the coming weeks.\n\nProtesters plan to converge by land and in kayaks during a three-day \u201cfestival of resistance\u201d starting May 16.\n\nOnce the rigs are in Seattle, some say they will do what they can to prevent the fleet from leaving to explore for oil.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge has ordered Greenpeace protesters to stay away from Royal Dutch Shell PLC ships.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal judge has ordered Greenpeace protesters to stay away from Royal Dutch Shell PLC ships.", "title": "Judge orders Greenpeace to stay away from drill ships", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/9/judge-orders-greenpeace-to-stay-away-from-drill-sh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/9141bdb67123c414750f6a70670083e4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/9141bdb67123c414750f6a70670083e4.jpg", "description": "A federal judge has ordered Greenpeace protesters to stay away from Royal Dutch Shell PLC ships.", "card": "summary", "title": "Judge orders Greenpeace to stay away from drill ships"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A federal judge has ordered Greenpeace protesters to stay away from Royal Dutch Shell PLC ships.\nU.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason on Friday also prohibited Greenpeace from flying unmanned vehicles over the offshore Arctic area where Shell plans to drill.\n\u201cInstead of saying Greenpeace can\u2019t go near Shell, our government should be saying Shell can\u2019t go near the Arctic,\u201d Greenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols said in a statement.\nShell Offshore Inc. sued on April 7, one day after six Greenpeace protesters boarded the Blue Marlin, a heavy-lift ship carrying a Transocean Ltd. semi-submersible drilling unit, the Polar Pioneer, as it crossed the Pacific.\nArctic offshore reserves are estimated at 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 130 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates."}
