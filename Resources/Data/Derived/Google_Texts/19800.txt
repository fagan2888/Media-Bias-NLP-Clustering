Well well, from the Party that claims voter fraud doesn't exist, I present to you multiple allegations of Clinton campaign voter fraud during the Iowa caucuses last night.

First, this video from Polk County:

Next, 90 precincts just went "missing":

Sanders's camp says that the Iowa Democratic Party has informed the campaigns that the caucus results from 90 precincts are missing. â€” John Wagner (@WPJohnWagner) February 2, 2016

Finally: Hillary Clinton somehow won six coin tosses in a row to put her over the top as a "winner."

Heading into late Monday night, the Democratic Iowa caucus was still in a statistical dead heat, with no official winner declared yet. In at least two precincts, however, Hillary Clinton was able to snag two delegates due to coin flips that landed favorably.



UPDATE: Apparently an additional four precincts were decided via coin flip (for a total of six), with Clinton winning them all.

Onto New Hampshire.
