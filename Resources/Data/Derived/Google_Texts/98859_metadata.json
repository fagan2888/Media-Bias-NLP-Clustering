Ridgeline Blvd., Highlands Ranch \u2022 7 p.m. Sunday, June 21: Central Park Bandshell, 13th and Canyon Boulevard, Boulder Tickets: Free Info: boulderballet.org\n\nAs the Boulder Ballet launches its 11th annual Ballet in the Park today, a staple with the dance company will be launching in a different direction.\n\nPeter Davison had become a well-known face with the local group, mostly because of his quirky, unusual vaudeville performances fused with his training as a professional dancer.\n\nHe juggles unusual objects, such as plastic bags. He's a unicycle master. He balances on chairs and tables in seemingly gravity-defying ways. He dances on trash cans and tells stories without saying a word, through movement that simultaneously feels like a hark back to the silent movie era, and a glimpse into the future of contemporary dance.\n\nNobody dances quite like Davison.\n\nBut starting this weekend, he's taking those movements beyond Boulder's borders.\n\nWhile ballet dancers take to the outdoor stage at the Broomfield Amphitheater today, Davison will be taking the stage at the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival, his first gig as an independent, traveling performer in a new chapter of his career.\n\nDavison resigned from the Boulder Ballet as co-artistic director for more than 10 years. He served with Ana Claire, who now will serve as solo artistic director.\n\nPeter Davison's act includes a variety of props, including a unicycle and bowling pins. (Jonathan Castner / For the Camera)\n\nClaire will be assisted by two new leaders: Lance Hardin was appointed the new associate artistic director; his wife, Amy Earnest, will work as the new assistant school director. The couple have served since 2012 as co-dance directors at the Myles Reif Performing Arts Center in Grand Rapids, Minn.\n\nThe three of them will be involved in replacing a man whose history with the ballet is extensive. He has been involved with production and leadership since 1986. He has served in every role imaginable \u2014 performer, webmaster, marketing director, teacher, graphic designer \u2014 and was the executive director from 2005 to 2010.\n\nSince he took his first class there in the 1980s, he says the Boulder Ballet has changed from being a semi-pro \"pick-up company\" to a full-time, esteemed professional company. Since Davison and Claire took the reins in 2004, the company has tripled in size and doubled annual performances.\n\n\"Behind the scenes has gotten stronger through the learning process of getting to where we are now: a very strong organization all the way around,\" Davison says.\n\nThat's, in part, why he feels now is the time for him to move on.\n\nClaire says she is excited to see where Davison goes and also is eager for some new, fresh perspectives at the ballet. Although she says she will miss working with Davison after so many years, she doesn't expect the change to drastically alter the company.\n\n\"I think the community will still get what they expect. It might be a little fresher, because it'll be two other people, but it'll still be the Boulder Ballet, in that it's eclectic and full of humor and theater,\" Claire says. \"It is still the same quirky, wonderful, fun ballet company that it's always been, what set us apart.\"\n\nAnd Davison says it's time for him to return to his roots in circus, which he infused into Boulder Ballet choreography to help earn its reputation as a creative and nontraditional dance company.\n\nDavison is ready to focus on his one-man show exclusively now.\n\n\"The time is right to really pursue that art form that's more deeply in my bones,\" he says.\n\nLance Hardin is the new associate artistic director of the Boulder Ballet, and his wife, Amy Earnest, is the new assistant school director. (Courtesy photo)\n\nDavison started juggling when he was 12, self-taught from a book in the library. His career actually began on the streets, as a busker in Los Angeles. He moved to Boulder in the late '70s to busk here, amid the \"heyday of street performers,\" before he enrolled in a dance class at Boulder Ballet. He juggled his way up to the top.\n\nHis vision stretches even further now.\n\nHe plans to tour the nation with his vaudeville show, although Boulder will remain his home base. Eventually, he says, he wants to begin teaching his \"dancing with objects art form\" and open a specialized performance company.\n\n\"It's an unusual field,\" he says.\n\nDance companies that perform with objects tend to be more acrobatic or dance-focused, where the props are only secondary. Circus groups tend to perfect certain skills but treat dance as a sideline, a way to move between skills.\n\nHe says he doesn't know of a company that gives dance and object manipulation equal emphasis.\n\n\"It's tough to do,\" Davison says. \"It's two art forms that take a huge amount of training each. First, I will explore that in a one-man show format.\"\n\nAimee Heckel: 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_28302298/peter-davis-leaves-boulder-ballet-replacements-lance-hardin-amy-earnest", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28302298:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-13T11:59:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "When the Ballet in the Park plays Broomfield on June 14 and Boulder on June 21, Peter Davison will be pursuing new opportunities and Lance Hardin and Amy Earnest will be joining Ana Claire at the helm of the dance company.", "title": "Boulder Ballet co-director bows out as troupe opens outdoor season", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_28302298/peter-davis-leaves-boulder-ballet-replacements-lance-hardin-amy-earnest", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__14dcpbalw~6.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "modificationDate": "2015-06-12T14:08:38-0600", "endDate": "2025-06-12T13:49:13-0600", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "byline": "By Aimee HeckelStaff", "pubDate": "2015-06-12T14:10:34-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-13T11:59:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Ballet co-director bows out as troupe opens outdoor season", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__14dcpbalw~6_300.jpg", "description": "When the Ballet in the Park plays Broomfield on June 14 and Boulder on June 21, Peter Davison will be pursuing new opportunities and Lance Hardin and Amy Earnest will be joining Ana Claire at the helm of the dance company.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_28302298/peter-davis-leaves-boulder-ballet-replacements-lance-hardin-amy-earnest", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "When the Ballet in the Park plays Broomfield on June 14 and Boulder on June 21, Peter Davison will be pursuing new opportunities and Lance Hardin and Amy Earnest will be joining Ana Claire at the helm of the dance company.", "title": "Boulder Ballet co-director bows out as troupe opens outdoor season"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__14dcpbalw~6.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1503\"", "article_summary": "\"It is still the same quirky, wonderful, fun ballet company that it's always been, what set us apart.\"\nLance Hardin is the new associate artistic director of the Boulder Ballet, and his wife, Amy Earnest, is the new assistant school director.\nHe moved to Boulder in the late '70s to busk here, amid the \"heyday of street performers,\" before he enrolled in a dance class at Boulder Ballet.\nDavison resigned from the Boulder Ballet as co-artistic director for more than 10 years.\nIt might be a little fresher, because it'll be two other people, but it'll still be the Boulder Ballet, in that it's eclectic and full of humor and theater,\" Claire says."}
