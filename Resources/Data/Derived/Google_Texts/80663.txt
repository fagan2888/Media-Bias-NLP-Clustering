New York Times columnist Paul Krugman attacked his fellow pundits — especially those on the right — who refuse to acknowledge that the dire predictions they made about Obamacare and its effect on the American economy never came to pass.

He labeled them “Obamacare truthers,” and noted that instead of being intellectually honest and admitting that they were wrong about the Affordable Care Act’s economic impact, they are attempting to revise history by claiming, for example, that they always said that more people would be insured, and that the real issue has always been the quality of their new coverage.

In an ideal world, Krugman suggested, strongly predicting disasters that never come to pass would lead the public to start ignoring any future predictions a pundit makes. However, because we choose to live in “an age of unacknowledged error,” they are never punished for being wrong, no matter how gross or inflammatory the error.
