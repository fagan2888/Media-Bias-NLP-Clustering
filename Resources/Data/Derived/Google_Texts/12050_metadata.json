Stephen Ortego, D-Carencro.\n\nComplete but unofficial results show Emerson with 6,149 votes to Ortego\u2019s 5,902.\n\nOrtego was competing for a second term in a district that includes parts of Lafayette and St. Landry parishes.\n\n\"We ran a clean campaign I can be proud of,\" said Ortego, who said his opponent was helped by \"out-of-state money\" in the campaign's waning weeks.\n\n\"Maybe this wasn't in the plan,\" Ortego said. \"Perhaps I can serve our community in other ways.\"\n\nEmerson did not return phone calls asking for comment.\n\nIn House districts 31, 44 and 96, incumbents took huge early leads against nominal opposition and were never threatened.\n\nIn House District 31, incumbent Nancy Landry headed for a runaway win over Evan H. Wright.\n\n\"It's been an honor and privilege to serve the people of District 31 for the past seven years,\" she said as victory appeared likely, adding that she would fight for the benefit of \"families and businesses\" in the next term. \"I'm grateful to the voters.\"\n\nState Rep. Vincent Pierre, D-Lafayette, said of his apparent victory in District 44, \"There is a lot of unfinished business to do.\" He said he would focus on Medicaid expansion in Louisiana and revamping the incarceration system. \"There are too many people going to prison for minor crimes,\" he said.\n\nState Rep. Terry C. Landry Sr. said his victory in District 96 was a \"victory for the people,\" including campaign workers and those who appreciated what he accomplished in his first term. \"I've tried to be a good steward and represent people in a diverse district,\" he said.\n\nHow they voted\n\n*denotes runoff\n\nHouse District 31 (18 of 19 precincts)\n\nNancy Landry: 9,464\n\nEvan H.
