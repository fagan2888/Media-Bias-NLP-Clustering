Collaborations with any of these vendors may qualify for use of the Common Census Benefits Operating System\u00ae with no ongoing cost as part of the Common Census Zero PEPMTM campaign.\n\n\u201cEmployers now have ACA reporting plus benefit administration for just the price of ACA reporting. Common Census has a reputation for impartiality, reliability and high quality service. With this recent ACA reporting expansion we are attracting and serving even more customers,\u201d explained Stephanie Whitman, Marketing Manager for Common Census. \u201cUsers export data with one easy selection and it is sent to any of the cooperating vendors. This is supplemented with any payroll file resulting in the needed ACA reporting.\u201d\n\nWhitman continued with, \u201cThis is a practical extension for our strategy to broaden the use of our platform to employers with as few as 50 employees. Zero PEPM has already been adopted by numerous well known insurance companies and other financial services enterprises.
