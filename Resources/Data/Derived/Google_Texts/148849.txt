Onida, SD

The school year is starting about a week later than usual at a central South Dakota school district as crews work to complete roughly $9 million in construction.



The Pierre Capital Journal reports classes are scheduled to begin Aug. 27 at Agar-Blunt-Onida School District amid the construction. Work includes a new high school, renovations to heating and air conditioning at the elementary school, and demolition of an old school wing that dated back more than 90 years.



Superintendent Kevin Pickner says the construction will be far enough along that they can begin class by the end of the month. He says crews will wrap up "odds and ends" through September.



The district has 260 students, down from roughly 285 students a few years ago.
