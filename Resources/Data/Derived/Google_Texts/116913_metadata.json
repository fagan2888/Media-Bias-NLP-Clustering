That\u2019s true not only of slavery\u2019s legacy, black-white racism, but also when it comes to other kinds of ethno-nationalist resentments.\n\nIndeed, according to new research, one of those other forms of prejudice \u2014 nativism, or distrust of foreigners \u2014 is critical to understanding the vicious backlash we\u2019ve seen to Obamacare. It\u2019s a finding consistent with a wealth of research suggesting racism played a huge role in radically stunting the growth of America\u2019s welfare state.\n\nBenjamin Knoll, a political scientist at Centre College, used a Pew database to sort Americans by their degree of \u201cnativist\u201d sentiment. \u201cStrong nativists,\u201d for instance, agreed strongly with the claim that \u201cour American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence,\u201d whereas \u201csomewhat nativists\u201d \u201csomewhat agreed\u201d and \u201cstrong non-nativists\u201d disagreed. Knoll and his coauthor, Jordan Shewmaker, then plotted the results against reported levels of support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAfter controlling for others factors we know are linked to opposition to Obamacare (age, Republican partisan affiliation, and the like), Knoll and Shewmaker found a clear relationship between nativism and anti-Obamacare sentiment. A huge one, in fact: \u201d nativism,\u201d they write, \u201cwas shown to exert a stronger influence than every other variable in the model with the exception of partisanship.\u201d\n\nWhen they looked more closely at the interaction between nativism and partisanship, they found something else interesting. While there were nativists and non-nativsts across the political divide, nativism was a much stronger predictor of opposition to Obamacare among Republicans than among Democrats. \u201cIndividual nativist attitudes tended to decrease support for the ACA by a factor of about 35 percent\u201d among Republicans, \u201cwhile among Democrats, nativist attitudes decreased support for the ACA by about 12 percent.\u201d Here\u2019s what that looks like graphed:\n\nCREDIT: Benjamin Knoll and Jordan Shewmaker\n\nThey believe the partisan gap stems from the language Republican politicians and media types used to condemn Obamacare (\u201csocialist, un-American\u201d), as well as the coding of President Obama as a foreigner, entwining nativist sentiment with partisan Republican opposition to the law.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly possible. It\u2019s also possible that their methodology isn\u2019t totally sound and their findings are flawed. But their results are consonant with a long-running vein of research that connects nativist panic with Republican partisanship for reasons that long precede Obamacare\u2019s first draft.\n\nThe basic argument here is that the reason the United States doesn\u2019t have a European-sized welfare state, including state-run health care, is our striking racial and ethnic antagonism. Because the United States is more diverse than Europe, the dominant white ethnic group is more likely to be suspicious of generous entitlements, seeing them as handouts to an undeserving other. Entitlements become a racially and ethnically coded issue.\n\nThe most famous paper making this case is titled, simply enough, \u201cWhy Doesn\u2019t The U.S. Have A European-Style Welfare State?\u201d Economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote tested a number of hypotheses for explaining the U.S.-Europe gap against the empirical evidence, finding that it was impossible to account for the gap without taking into account America\u2019s racial legacy. The \u201chistory of American redistribution makes it quite clear that hostility to welfare comes in part,\u201d they conclude, \u201cfrom the fact that welfare spending in the US goes disproportionately to minorities.\u201d\n\nA 2010 book by Donald Kinder and Cindy Kam deepened that argument. Kinder and Kam developed a metric of \u201cethnocentrism,\u201d an inclusive concept designed to include all sorts of prejudice against outgroups rather than just pure racism, and tested its effects on support for welfare state programs. They found that ethnocentrism predicted opposition to means-tested programs like welfare that benefit the poor, but actually correlated with higher levels of support for insurance programs like Social Security that benefited everyone (including older whites).\n\nSince Obamacare is at its heart a transfer program \u2014 taxing the rich to pay for health care for the poor and middle class \u2014 it makes sense that it would inflame passions of people who identify as being concerned with \u201cforeign\u201d threats to \u201cthe American way of life.\u201d That goes double for Republican nativists, who are primed by virtue of their small government commitments to oppose any expansion of the welfare state.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Obamacare's detractors tend to believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Obamacare's detractors tend to believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence.", "title": "How Nativist Fervor Explains The Hatred For Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/21/3318791/nativist-fervor-explains-hate-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare-castro-e1393007743889.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's detractors tend to believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence.", "creator": "@zackbeauchamp", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare-castro-e1393007743889-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Nativist Fervor Explains The Hatred For Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare-castro-e1393007743889.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare-castro-e1393007743889.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-21T14:39:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaab5\"", "article_summary": "Health How Nativist Fervor Explains The Hatred For Obamacare CREDIT: flickr/qwrrtyEven after all of the victories over segregation and racial hatred, race and racism shape American politics in deeply fundamental ways.\nIt\u2019s a finding consistent with a wealth of research suggesting racism played a huge role in radically stunting the growth of America\u2019s welfare state.\nThe basic argument here is that the reason the United States doesn\u2019t have a European-sized welfare state, including state-run health care, is our striking racial and ethnic antagonism.\nBenjamin Knoll, a political scientist at Centre College, used a Pew database to sort Americans by their degree of \u201cnativist\u201d sentiment.\nWhile there were nativists and non-nativsts across the political divide, nativism was a much stronger predictor of opposition to Obamacare among Republicans than among Democrats."}
