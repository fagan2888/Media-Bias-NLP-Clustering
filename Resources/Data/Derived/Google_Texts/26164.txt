Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) announced Monday that he is forming a presidential exploratory committee, and that he would announce his decision about jumping into the 2016 race in the coming weeks.

“For some time now, my wife Supriya and I have been thinking and praying about whether to run for the presidency of our great nation. We’ll make a final decision in June,” Jindal said in a statement.

“While other Republican leaders are talking about change, I’ve published detailed plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, rebuild America’s defenses, make America energy independent, and reform education for our nation’s children,” Jindal added, in a reference to the crowded GOP field will face if he throws his hat into the ring.

Jindal has long been considering a presidential run. A formal exploratory committee will allow him to raise funds to travel and hire staff in support of a White House bid. Should he ultimately declare his candidacy, Jindal will likely make an appeal to social conservatives, tout his school choice program, and highlight efforts to lower taxes in Louisiana.
