MILAN--Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA's (BMPS.MI) Chairman Massimo Tononi ruled out a new capital increase, after the Italian bank tapped investors for 8 billion euros ($8.71 billion) in the last two years.

"This bank has no need for [a capital] increase, either today or after the results," Mr. Tononi said in an interview published on Friday by daily Il Sole 24 Ore.

After extreme market volatility this week during which the bank shed almost half its value in the first three trading days this week, shares rebounded on Thursday, adding 43%.

Its shares were up a further 10.5% in early morning trading Friday.

"The decline of the stock in the last few weeks is absolutely inexplicable," he was quoted as saying.

The bank said it will bring forward the release of its fourth-quarter results to Jan. 28 from Feb. 5.

Mr. Tononi told Il Sole 24 Ore that its 2015 results are likely to be better than those of the previous year, echoing comments from the bank's Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola's earlier this week.

He blamed the share price decline mostly on small investors selling their stakes, saying he wasn't aware of any larger investor having done so.

"The lack of large investors can cause high volatility," he was quoted as saying. "We are effectively vulnerable to takeovers."

According to the newspaper, he said the bank is "actively" working to find a merger partner, in Italy and abroad.

The Tuscan bank has been up for sale since the end of 2014, when it emerged as the worst capitalized in Europe during the continent-wide stress tests carried out by European authorities.
