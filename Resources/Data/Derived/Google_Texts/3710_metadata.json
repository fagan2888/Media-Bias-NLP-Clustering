The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued more new and revised guidance during the second week of September, 2014. First, CMS released a series of slides describing the streamlined application process that it is phasing in for the 2015 open enrollment period. Under this system, all applicants (including for now special enrollment period applicants) will be asked a series of initial screening question.\n\nThose who are identified as having a simple household situation will be directed to a streamlined process with fewer screens and clicks. For example, an early question about income range will help individuals who are unlikely to get financial assistance to decide whether or not to apply for financial assistance, and avoid further financial assistance questions if they decide not to request assistance. Those with more complex situations will be directed to the traditional process. The streamlined process is also only available to first time applicants, not to individuals reporting a change, who will use the traditional application.\n\nThe new process is not only shorter, but also has backward navigation capability and is optimized for mobile users. CMS expects 70 percent of applicants to use the streamlined application; 30 percent the traditional. The new process is being phased in beginning the first week of September and will be fully rolled out for the 2015 open enrollment period in November.\n\nCMS also, on September 12, released revised versions of Guidance Bulletin 10 on grace periods when individuals are terminated for non-payment of premiums and their enrollment through the federally facilitated marketplace spans two benefit years, and Guidance Bulletin 11 dealing with individuals terminated because of data matching errors. The original versions of Bulletin 10, issued on July 16, and Bulletin 11, issued on August 13 were discussed in earlier posts.\n\nIn general, an individual terminated from coverage through the federal exchange for non-payment of premiums is closed out of coverage until the next open enrollment period unless he or she qualifies for a special enrollment period. The individual may enroll in coverage for the next coverage year, however, if he or she reenrolls and pays the first month\u2019s premium. Any premiums paid for coverage for the next year are credited to that year and cannot be claimed by the insurer to cover premiums owing for the previous year.\n\nThis much is clear. But problems arise when the three-month grace period that an individual is afforded to catch up on unpaid premiums spans two years; for example, the individual ceased paying premiums in November and is either auto-enrolled or chooses a plan for 2015 but is not caught up with paying premiums by the end of December. The Bulletin works through a number of possible situations that can arise involving grace periods that span two years or that end on December 31. The revised Bulletin is generally consistent with the original bulletin, but clarifies what transactions are classified as renewals and how the grace period interacts with enrollment transactions that meet the definition of renewal.\n\nBulletin 11 deals with individuals who are terminated from federally facilitated exchange coverage because they fail to produce documentation to resolve inconsistencies involving their citizenship or lawful alien status. Individuals affected by data matching issues had until September 5 to submit required documentation, and will be terminated from coverage on September 30 if they failed to do so. Under the original Bulletin 11, individuals who attested that they had in fact submitted documentation before September 5 that did in fact resolve the inconsistency could qualify for a special enrollment period and retroactive coverage even if that documentation was not received. Individuals who submitted required documentation that resolved inconsistencies within 60 days after termination would qualify for a special enrollment period, but only for prospective coverage, with a likely gap in coverage.\n\nUnder the revised Bulletin 11, any individual terminated because of data matching issues may re-enroll in coverage by producing sufficient documentation to resolve the inconsistency. If found eligible, the individual\u2019s coverage may be reinstated retroactively to avoid gaps in coverage. Alternatively, the individual may request prospective coverage. If the individual selects the same coverage that he or she had previously, any amounts paid out-of-pocket will be credited toward deductibles or out-of-pocket limits. This change effectively allows any individual terminated from coverage for data matching issues to resume coverage if the individual provides appropriate documentation.\n\nOriginal post. The decision of the full D.C. Circuit to review the panel decision in Halbig v. Burwell en banc was clearly the big Affordable Care Act (ACA) court decision of the first week in September, but a September 2 decision of the federal district court of the Middle District of Tennessee, Gordon v. Wilson, is also worthy of note.\n\nThe Medicaid law has long required state Medicaid programs to determine eligibility for Medicaid with \u201creasonable promptness,\u201d defined by the regulations to mean within 90 days for applicants with disabilities and 45 days for everyone else. Applicants whose applications are not determined reasonably promptly are entitled by the Medicaid law and by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution to a fair hearing.\n\nMedicaid Eligibility and Tennessee\n\nTennessee, like all states, was required by the ACA to begin calculating Medicaid eligibility for most recipients using modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI as of January 1, 2014. Tennessee attempted to establish a new computer system for doing this, but when it was not ready by January 1, Tennessee asked the federal exchange to determine Medicaid eligibility until it could get its system operational.\n\nThe system is still not operational, and it is unclear when it will be in effect. The plaintiffs in the Gordon case were unable to get either eligibility determinations or to get fair hearings, and sued for relief. The court certified a class of all individuals in the same situation.\n\nAmong other responses, Tennessee claimed that the problem was caused by the federal exchange, and that they were not responsible. The court rejected this defense. The court found that it was the responsibility of the state to comply with the Medicaid law and that it could not delegate that responsibility to the federal government. As other requirements for a preliminary injunction, such as irreparable injury, were also met, the court entered a preliminary injunction ordering Tennessee to process applications with reasonable promptness and to grant a fair hearing when it failed to do so. As a number of other states are having problems processing Medicaid applications promptly, the decision may well have wider consequences.\n\nSpecial Enrollment Bulletin\n\nWhile the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) seems to have finished the rulemaking it needed to prepare for 2015 open enrollment with the release of its enrollment rule, guidance continues to be posted regularly at the HHS REGTAP website. On September 5, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released an enrollment bulletin establishing another special enrollment period for service area errors as a subcategory of its regulatory \u201ccomplex case\u201d special enrollment period category.\n\nThis bulletin addresses the situation where individuals selected a plan whose service area did not cover their address due to marketplace or insurer error. This enrollment might be rejected by the insurer, in which case the individual may become aware of the error when he or she fails to receive enrollment materials or seeks services. Alternatively, the insurer may itself become aware of the erroneous enrollment through its own internal reviews.\n\nInsurers are encouraged by CMS to contact consumers when service area errors are identified. Consumers have 60 days from the date they are contacted, or from the date that the marketplace determines that there has been an error where the consumer has contacted the marketplace first, to enroll in a new plan.\n\nConsumers who were improperly enrolled in a plan but reenroll in a new plan will have coverage begin in the new plan based on the regular coverage effective date timeline. They may, therefore, have a gap in coverage. Consumers whose initial enrollment was rejected because of a service area error may elect to have retroactive coverage if they pay premiums for it, or may choose to have prospective coverage from the regular coverage effective date. Insurers may not automatically terminate consumers enrolled in a plan that does not cover their service area unless the consumer is enrolled in the wrong state.\n\nCMS FAQs Explained\n\nCMS also continues to issue a steady stream of FAQs at REGTAP.info; dozens every week. Most of these are quite technical but some impact consumers or providers. FAQ 4199, provides that if an employer covered through the SHOP changes its business address and moves to a different rating area during the course of a year, the employer may continue to receive coverage as long as it is in the same state without a change in premiums. FAQ 4220 provides that an employer covered through the SHOP exchange has a grace period of 31 days to make payment after a premium due date before it will be terminated, but if the employer pays up in full within 30 days of termination, it will be reinstated in coverage.\n\nFAQ 4355 addresses the obligations of qualified health plans (QHPs) with respect to Medicare drug coverage. Individuals who become eligible for Medicare but do not enroll in a part D prescription drug plan must pay a penalty for late enrollment. They do not need to pay the penalty if they have delayed Part D enrollment because they have been enrolled in \u201ccreditable prescription drug coverage,\u201d usually through their employment.\n\nCreditable drug coverage has an actuarial value that equals or exceeds that of Medicare Part D coverage. The FAQ clarifies that QHP insurers must determine whether each of their QHPs offers creditable drug coverage and notify their enrollees or potential enrollees whether coverage is creditable or not.\n\nFAQ 4426 explains that if an employee enrolled in the SHOP exchange dies, any dependents must be terminated from the plan because SHOP exchanges may not offer dependent-only coverage. The remaining family members qualify for a special enrollment period through the individual exchange. FAQ 4427 clarifies that agents and brokers who sell SHOP exchange coverage must be paid the same commissions by insurers as they pay for agents selling small group coverage outside the SHOP.\n\nFinally, FAQ 4500 explains that if enrollees with a standalone dental plan changes QHPs during the open enrollment period, the enrollees must also re-select their standalone dental plan. If an enrollee does not return to the marketplace to change plan, the enrollee will be auto-enrolled in the same dental plan he or she was previously enrolled in or the most similar plan according to the enrollment rule.\n\nFinally, on September 8, 2014, CMS announced the award of $60 million dollars to 90 organizations to provide navigator services for the 2015 open enrollment period in states with federally facilitated or partnership marketplaces. A list of grantees is available on the CMS website.\n\nThe amount awarded is a decrease from 2014, when awards totaling $67 million were made. Further information on the navigator program for 2015 was provided in an earlier post.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/09/08/implementing-health-reform-medicaid-eligibility-2015-open-enrollment-and-faqs/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "Implementing Health Reform: Medicaid Eligibility, 2015 Navigator Grants, And FAQs (Updated)"}, "description": "Implementing Health Reform: Medicaid Eligibility, 2015 Navigator Grants, And FAQs (Updated) | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "First, CMS released a series of slides describing the streamlined application process that it is phasing in for the 2015 open enrollment period.\nUnder this system, all applicants (including for now special enrollment period applicants) will be asked a series of initial screening question.\nThe new process is being phased in beginning the first week of September and will be fully rolled out for the 2015 open enrollment period in November.\nThis change effectively allows any individual terminated from coverage for data matching issues to resume coverage if the individual provides appropriate documentation.\nIf found eligible, the individual\u2019s coverage may be reinstated retroactively to avoid gaps in coverage."}
