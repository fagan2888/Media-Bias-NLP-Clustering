These conspirators were also accused of using stolen identities to file false tax returns seeking refunds with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe scheme ran from around March 2012, when Sharapka was deported after serving nearly 7 -1/2 years in federal prison in Massachusetts, to around June 2013, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Sharapka ran the conspiracy with help from Yanovitsky, and Gundersen helped move fraud proceeds. Each faces up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud conspiracy count.\n\nRelated: Runawway Identity Theft - Could You Be Next?\n\nThe Ukrainian defendants remain at large, while Gundersen was expected to answer the charge in court at a later date. Gundersen's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCharges against one of the other defendants, Ilya Ostapyuk of Brooklyn, were dismissed in September, court records show. The other four defendants either pleaded guilty or still face charges, a spokesman for Fishman said.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Sharapka et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 13-mj-06089.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal prosecutors on Monday announced the indictment of three men they accuse of bei", "title": "Ukrainians Indicted on Cyber Crime Charges", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/17/Ukranians-Indicted-Cyber-Crime-Charges", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/17/Ukranians-Indicted-Cyber-Crime-Charges", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal prosecutors on Monday announced the indictment of three men they accuse of bei", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Each faces up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud conspiracy count.\nCharges against one of the other defendants, Ilya Ostapyuk of Brooklyn, were dismissed in September, court records show.\nThe men were among eight people charged, according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey, who announced the indictments.\nThe Ukrainian defendants remain at large, while Gundersen was expected to answer the charge in court at a later date.\nOleksiy Sharapka, 33, and Leonid Yanovitsky, 39, both of Kiev, Ukraine; and Richard Gundersen, 47, of Brooklyn, New York, were each indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud and identity theft, and aggravated identity theft."}
