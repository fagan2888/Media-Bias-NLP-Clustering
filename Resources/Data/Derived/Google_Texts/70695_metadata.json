Technology improved as the industrial revolution took hold \u2014 it kept improving afterward \u2014 and a growing population of fishermen, both domestic and foreign, became more productive as they pursued cod, haddock and other species found near the ocean floor.\n\nToday, that industry faces an uncertain future of depleted stocks, consolidation of the fleet, restrictive regulation and questions about whether species that long sustained some New England fishing communities will ever rebound.\n\nAs the steam-powered trawler and mesh net replaced the schooner and baited fishing line at the start of the 20th century, fishermen and their vessels became, perhaps, too efficient to the point of jeopardizing the resource on which they depended for their livelihood.\n\nRegulations were slow to take hold, but in recent decades, they have become increasingly more restrictive. (Federal regulators last year again drastically slashed Atlantic cod catch limits, for example.) Groundfish stocks, however, have failed to rebound in response.\n\n\u201cHumans have been failing at fisheries management for a very long time, so it\u2019s not a small task\u201d to get it right, said Robin Alden, executive director of the nonprofit Penobscot East Resource Center in Stonington and a former commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.\n\nRegulation of the fisheries today is ever-present whereas a century ago it was absent. But today\u2019s regulatory system leaves much to be desired.\n\nFirst, regulators manage individual species in isolation rather than as part of the intricate ecosystems to which they belong. As a result, regulators react to legally required stock estimates of a single species but don\u2019t necessarily take into account how one species interacts with another and with the broader environment. Second, regulators craft uniform rules to cover vast areas of the ocean \u2014 for example, the entire Gulf of Maine, stretching from Cape Cod to the Canadian border \u2014 as if such a vast area were a uniform ecosystem. And third, there\u2019s far from universal faith in the current regulatory scheme, with fishermen frequently doubting the science behind increasingly restrictive catch limits.\n\n\u201cThe Gulf of Maine is a very diverse place,\u201d said Jim Wilson, a University of Maine professor of marine sciences. \u201cDown East Maine, it\u2019s totally different from Casco Bay, and Casco Bay is totally different from Gloucester and from Provincetown. When we manage fish, we treat all those areas as if they were the same.\u201d\n\nFisheries regulators have a directive from the top \u2014 a 2010 executive order from President Barack Obama \u2014 to transition to ecosystem-based management of the fisheries. \u201cBut the concept isn\u2019t precisely defined,\u201d Alden said.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt an effective ecosystem-based management system will have to be more local in nature than the current system. And a regulatory system that\u2019s more local in nature will have to rely in part on those with the most local knowledge \u2014 namely, those who fish.\n\nMuch work needs to be done before regulators can change the way they manage fisheries. But Maine\u2019s management \u2014 or, more precisely, co-management \u2014 of its lobster fishery over the past two decades could offer an example. Maine\u2019s lobster fishery is divided into zones, and each zone has an elected council of lobster license holders who can recommend rules, within broader state parameters, on four issues to the state commissioner of marine resources: Lobsterman trap limits, the number of traps allowed on a line, when lobstering is allowed and entry into the fishery. The commissioner has the power to adopt or reject the rules.\n\nWhile Maine has become, perhaps, dangerously dependent on the lobster, the lobster\u2019s success can, in part, be owed to responsible, shared management through a system in which lobstermen have buy-in. A federal, ecosystem-based model will have to take into account multiple species and will be more complex, but federal regulators might find a place to start in Maine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colonial America\u2019s first true industry, groundfishing, has followed the path of many others.
