And those comments have not gone unnoticed among Putin\u2019s supporters, particularly in the city of Yalta in Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, which was invaded by Russia last year.\n\nCalling Trump an \u201cextraordinary person,\u201d the mayor of Yalta, Andrey Rostenko, has penned an open letter to the former reality television star, praising his positions and inviting him to come visit occupied Crimea after he is elected president, going so far as to suggest the city might name a street for him.\n\nRelated: The Coming Danger of the \u2018Throw the Bums Out\u2019 2016 Election\n\n\u201cWe are following the elections process in your country with great interest,\u201d he wrote, according to a translation provided by the Kremlin-run media site RT.com. \u201cWe like your election program and we like you as an extraordinary person.\u201d\n\nIt was not completely clear that Rostenko has a particularly nuanced understanding of Trump\u2019s policy positions, which, considering their lack of nuance, is a bit of a feat in itself.\n\n\u201cAfter your victory in the election you plan to establish friendly relations with President Putin \u2013 and this is an excellent decision,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou want to be friends with China, and we want the same thing. You support Russia\u2019s effort in fighting international terrorism and so do we. We have a lot in common and this is a fine excuse to arrange a meeting.\u201d\n\nTrump, for the record, has suggested that he would bend Putin and China to his will, not that he would establish close friendships with either the Kremlin or Beijing.\n\nRelated: Putin to Obama \u2013 I\u2019ll Take Out ISIS Targets for the U.S.\n\nHowever, he has made comments that have been widely interpreted as critical of U.S. Middle East policy and supportive of Putin\u2019s current effort to prop up the government of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cYou can make the case, if you look at Libya, look at what we did there \u2014 it's a mess \u2014 if you look at Saddam Hussein with Iraq, look what we did there \u2014 it's a mess \u2014 it's [Syria] going to be same thing,\" Trump said on Meet the Press last week.\n\nHe has also spoken of how Putin is \u201cbombing the hell\u201d out of ISIS \u2013 a proposition that many in the West would challenge, considering that Russian strikes appear to be targeting rebels opposed to Assad rather than ISIS.\n\nIn any case, Trump has clearly won some admirers among Putin\u2019s supporters.\n\nYalta, the city that hosted the famous meeting of Allied leaders as World War II drew to a close, has a street named for former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Rostenko suggested in his letter that, \u201cone day Yalta might get one more street named after the U.S. leader who made an invaluable input into the improvement of relations between our two peoples.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama and Congress Playing High-Stakes Poker Over War Funding\n\nTASS, another government-run media site, in reporting of Rostenko\u2019s letter described Trump as a \u201cU.S. business tycoon\u201d with \u201can estimated net worth of $1.4 billion.\u201d Trump himself has angrily challenged estimates of his wealth by Forbes and others that place his net worth considerably below the $8-to$10 billion he has claimed.\n\nHowever, Trump will have plenty of time to set the record straight when he visits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Real estate billionaire and loudmouthed GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has made a number of statements in the past week that seemed supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s most recent military adventure in Syria.
