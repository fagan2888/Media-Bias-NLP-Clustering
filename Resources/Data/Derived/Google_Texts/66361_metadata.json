This month, those companies announced some proposed rate increases for insurance policies next year.\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Blue Cross of Idaho has asked for the most rate hikes.\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s] simply because we offer more plan options for people,\u201d says Josh Jordan, manager of Corporate Communications with Blue Cross of Idaho. He says every insurance carrier in the state asked for increases.\n\nBlue Cross talks about what's driving requests for higher health insurance rates.\n\nJordan says the average rate increase for individual Blue Cross plans in 2016 is 24 percent. Last year, the price hike was nine percent. He says there are a variety of things affecting prices.\n\n\u201cMore people have health insurance in the individual market in Idaho than have ever had it before,\u201d says Jordan. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good thing. So those people have tended to have a higher utilization maybe than our existing or previously insured members or than we were anticipating.\u201d\n\nHe says the high utilization of services shows people who got insurance, needed it.\n\n\u201cHopefully it can help people in their health,\u201d he says.\n\nJordan says the rate increases are not limited to Blue Cross or to Idaho.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, Idaho actually is nowhere near the top,\" he says. \"You\u2019re seeing rates across the nation in the 30, 40, even 50 percent increase range.\u201d\n\nJordan says the Affordable Care Act addressed health care reform by increasing access. It also increased some of the services that health insurers needed to cover on their plans.\n\n\u201cOne thing it has not addressed is the underlying causes of these increased utilizations, things like health and wellness,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWhy is it people are needing more and more services. It\u2019s also not addressing anything about cost. Those are things the health industry is going to have to deal with going forward.\u201d\n\nJordan says for every $1 Blue Cross is bringing in in premiums, it\u2019s paying roughly $1.08 out in claims. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a person, a company, or a country, spending more money than you take in is going to lead to some financial problems,\u201d he says.\n\nJordan says higher insurance prices could push some people off insurance. But he says subsidies through the Affordable Care Act can help. And having more people on Idaho\u2019s health exchange would help.\n\n\u201cCost is always a concern, we understand that. People have to make the right decisions for them,\" Jordan says. \"We do everything we can to keep it to the lowest prices possible.\u201d\n\nJosh Jordan says any increase in insurance rates must be approved by Idaho\u2019s Department of Insurance.\n\nCurrently, Blue Cross of Idaho has 49,792 people enrolled in coverage plans through Idaho\u2019s health care exchange. Blue Cross serves more than 89,000 people with plans, both on and off the exchange.\n\nFind Samantha Wright on Twitter @samwrightradio\n\nCopyright 2015 Boise State Public Radio", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "As Idaho gets ready for the third year of using a state health exchange under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are still adapting to the new", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://boisestatepublicradio.org/post/blue-cross-idaho-asks-rate-hike-says-more-people-are-using-health-care", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/idaho/files/styles/medium/public/201506/doctor_office_a_currell_flickr.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As Idaho gets ready for the third year of using a state health exchange under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are still adapting to the new", "title": "Blue Cross Of Idaho Asks For Rate Hike, Says More People Are Using Health Care"}, "story_id": 413476868, "twitter": {"site": "@KBSX915", "card": "summary", "creator": "@samwrightradio"}, "author": "Samantha Wright", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Blue Cross Of Idaho Asks For Rate Hike, Says More People Are Using Health Care"}, "nid": 65919, "datePublished": "2015-06-10", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Blue Cross, Health Care, Health Insurance, Health Insurance Exchange", "wordCount": 540, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Currently, Blue Cross of Idaho has 49,792 people enrolled in coverage plans through Idaho\u2019s health care exchange.\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Blue Cross of Idaho has asked for the most rate hikes.\nBlue Cross talks about what's driving requests for higher health insurance rates.\n\"You\u2019re seeing rates across the nation in the 30, 40, even 50 percent increase range.\u201dJordan says the Affordable Care Act addressed health care reform by increasing access.\n\u201c[That\u2019s] simply because we offer more plan options for people,\u201d says Josh Jordan, manager of Corporate Communications with Blue Cross of Idaho."}
