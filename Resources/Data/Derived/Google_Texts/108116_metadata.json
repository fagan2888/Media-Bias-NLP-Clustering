Whether prominent on the international stage or the home front, these kind spirits touched our lives in a myriad of ways. They were code talkers, ballerinas, actors. Artists, ambassadors, activists and elders. Some were heroes. Others were struck down in the prime of their lives.\n\nNow we take a moment to commemorate their lives. Here is a sampling of the people who passed through Indian country for what seemed, in the end, all too brief a time.
