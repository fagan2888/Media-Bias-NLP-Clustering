It took a lot of tweaking, but it was the first plan that stuck.\n\nThe aspiring executive and entrepreneur shared her notes with coworkers, and then a few friends. Eventually, the former college swimmer and triathlete gave her advice to clients at a personal training business she opened in Southern California. The concept would make for a great diet book, she thought.\n\nBut other endeavors kept getting in the way. There was marriage, then her 2005 reality show adventure on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d spin-off with Martha Stewart, which she won. The subsequent creation of a women\u2019s fitness magazine and a national half-marathon series absorbed immense chunks of time, not to mention the births of her two children.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Stone sold the St. Petersburg-based Women\u2019s Running magazine in 2012 that she put her idea for a diet book back on the front burner. The result, \u201cHealthy You!: 14 Days to Quick and Permanent Weight Loss and a Happier, Healthier You\u201d ($14.99 at dawnastone.com or Amazon.com) will be released Tuesday.\n\nStone, 45, recently spoke of her resolve to self-publish the eating plan she developed as a young adult \u2014 and successfully retested after the birth of her daughter, who is now in kindergarten, and her preschool-aged son.\n\nQ. Most people know you as Martha Stewart\u2019s \u201cApprentice\u201d and may be surprised that you gained 40 pounds after graduating from college in California.\n\n\u201cI had always been fit, and then I graduated from college and I went to New York and worked on Wall Street. From there, it went haywire. I was working till midnight, one in the morning. People were doing pizza runs and Popeye\u2019s chicken runs and runs for foods that I never ever ate before. ... And I was not only feeling unhealthy, I was unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 I remember being in New York City in my apartment, in bed and in tears thinking \u2018I\u2019m smart, I have this great job, I have this great education. Why can\u2019t I control this one thing?\u2019 I mean I was an athlete. I\u2019ve always achieved pretty much everything I ever went after. And I could not achieve weight loss, no matter what. It was the one thing in my life that I couldn\u2019t control at all.\u201d\n\nQ. Programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers didn\u2019t work for you. But you also acknowledge that your concept won\u2019t appeal to everyone. Who is it for?\n\n\u201cI think there are people who need that kind of community, who can go and have that Wednesday weigh-in \u2026 to convince them on Tuesday that they might not want to have that giant piece of cake.\n\n\u201cThis book is for people like me, who struggle constantly and have given up and maybe have tried those other options. ... The specific plan is really about eating healthy. It\u2019s not a program that counts calories. ... The whole goal here is to make you rethink what you are currently eating.\u201d\n\nQ. Your two-week plan uses the first seven days to eliminate a different type of food one day a time: sugar, wheat, daily, highly processed foods, diet soda and artificial sweeteners, red meat and alcohol. In your own experience, which one did you need to eliminate first?\n\n\u201cI started taking away the unhealthy refined sugars \u00ad\u2014 like KitKat bars for me \u2014 and just starting eating in moderation. I remember telling myself, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to completely eliminate sugar, but maybe Monday through Friday when you are at work. ...\n\n\u201cOn the weekends, if I wanted to have an ice cream or a scone, I would ... and I started feeling better and I just started doing the same with other unhealthy things in my diet.\n\nQ. Have people who have tried the plan struggled with giving up certain foods?\n\n\u201cSugar and alcohol. ... A lot of people, even if they are not drinking a lot, don\u2019t want to give up alcohol. My thing is that I\u2019m not asking them to do it in the long-term. I\u2019m asking them to have a clean week to know what it feels like. You may feel not so great that first week when you are not eating sugar and not having caffeine ... but by that second week, you are ready to eat a diet that\u2019s really clean and healthy. And you feel amazing. I want them to feel that.\u201d\n\nQ. There\u2019s a lot of this plan that looks like a cleanse diet, and it focuses on terms such as \u201celimination\u201d and \u201cclean.\u201d How is this book different from cleanse diets that deprive the body of a lot of foods and, subsequently, nutrition?\n\n\u201cThis is about clean eating. If you told me you were doing a cleanse, I would wonder what kind; is it a juice-only cleanse or water cleanse? \u2026 \u2018Healthy You!\u2019 is about getting to a point where you are eating cleaner, healthy, more-natural unprocessed food. There may be people out there who want to call this a cleanse. Do I? I don\u2019t. I see it as a way to eat cleaner and eat healthier.\u201d\n\nQ. As a former fitness magazine publisher, you\u2019ve seen a lot of unhealthy diet ideas. And while you have training in personal fitness and weight management, this book is not written by a medical doctor or licensed dietician. Why is it important that you share your own experience?\n\n\u201cI know that even if I just tell people to eat healthy, I\u2019m going to get criticism. I think I could say that everybody should exercise and I will get criticism ... .and that\u2019s fine. To me, I know the book is healthy, the program is healthy. I\u2019m not saying you should restrict calories. I\u2019m not saying you can only have a certain amount.\n\n\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s hard to overindulge on something that\u2019s really healthy. It\u2019s easy to overindulge on something that\u2019s not so good for you and very calorie dense.\u201d\n\nQ. You don\u2019t have to exercise to do this diet, but exercise is a huge part of your own long-term ability to stay at a healthy weight. Why not write an exercise book?\n\n\u201cPeople who know me know that my outlook is about healthy overall living and that I\u2019ve had an emphasis on food more than anything else. Yes, I owned a fitness magazine and I ran running events and I convinced people to get off the couch and just walk a 5K. ... I think that\u2019s also part of healthy living.\n\n\u201cI will never get rid of the part where I believe exercise is important, and I would love to always get people off the couch to do it. But I think a lot of people, until they lose the weight, may never get up and take that step.\u201d\n\nmshedden@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7365\n\nTwitter: @MaryShedden", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 12 Oct 2013 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Fifteen years ago, Dawna Stone knew she was on to something.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Fifteen years ago, Dawna Stone knew she was on to something.", "title": "St. Pete-based entrepreneur preaches what she practices in new diet book", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/st-pete-based-entrepreneur-preaches-what-she-practices-in-new-diet-book-20131012/", "image": {"width": 2551, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131012/ARTICLE/131019732/AR/0/AR-131019732.jpg", "height": 2586}, "updated_time": "2013-10-15T10:13:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Fifteen years ago, Dawna Stone knew she was on to something.", "title": "St. Pete-based entrepreneur preaches what she practices in new diet book", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131012/ARTICLE/131019732/AR/0/AR-131019732.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-12T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T10:13:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It wasn\u2019t until Stone sold the St. Petersburg-based Women\u2019s Running magazine in 2012 that she put her idea for a diet book back on the front burner.\nThe concept would make for a great diet book, she thought.\nYou don\u2019t have to exercise to do this diet, but exercise is a huge part of your own long-term ability to stay at a healthy weight.\n\u201cI know that even if I just tell people to eat healthy, I\u2019m going to get criticism.\nTo me, I know the book is healthy, the program is healthy."}
