As snowboarder Vic Wild stood atop the medal podium in Sochi this week, his home country's national anthem playing in honor of his gold medal in the parallel giant slalom event, the sound of locals singing along to the Russian tune was so overwhelmingly loud that it leaked into NBC's telecast. But the gold medalist from White Salmon, Wash., wasn't part of the pop-up chorus. He wasn't even mouthing the words.

That puts Wild, the born-and-bred American who is riding for Russia, in the minority of gold medalists during these Games: 59.3% of them sang along with their countries' national anthems in Sochi, according to a Commissariat of Calculation survey of medal ceremonies that included 81 gold medalists across individual and team sports. Men and women embraced their glorified karaoke stints at equal rates, which marks a change of tune from 2012, when a Journal audit found 51.4% of men and 35.1% of women were singers at the London Games.

Wild wasn't the only Russian who stood stoically during his ceremony. But another Olympian representing the host country under similar circumstances took a different approach. Victor An, the short-track speed skater who used to compete for South Korea but won gold for Russia during these Games, belted out his new country's national anthem as if he were auditioning for "American Idol."

Our study found Olympians were likelier to sing than cry while celebrating. In the Commissariat's calculations, only 17% of Olympians shed tears on the medal stand, not a far cry from the 15.5% of Olympians who bawled in London. Of that small group, 65% pulled off the Olympian task of crying while singing.
