Even if in doubt, report all changes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Toronto Sun", "description": "Motor vehicle insurance is compulsory in Ontario.", "title": "Case of vanishing insurance", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2014/06/21/case-of-vanishing-insurance?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Case of vanishing insurance", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297343204615_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464200895716", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "Motor vehicle insurance is compulsory in Ontario.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb80e\"", "article_summary": "So, Alof had insurance as of the date of the accident, but his insurance company retroactively withdrew the insurance after the accident, leaving Alof in a precarious position.\nThat\u2019s precisely what the other driver\u2019s insurance company argued in a court motion to dismiss Alof\u2019s lawsuit.\nWhat doesn\u2019t make sense occurs when an insurance company tries to use the law to retroactively void an insurance policy, to take away an injured driver\u2019s right to sue.\nHe had a discussion with his insurance company after moving to Ontario, advising it he didn\u2019t know if the move was going to be permanent.\nIt\u2019s important that any potential changes in risk be reported to your insurance company."}
