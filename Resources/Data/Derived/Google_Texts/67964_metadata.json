Then he boarded a plane for Colorado with some of his siblings and their families.\n\n\u201cWe were up there for about three days, trying to get some answers, and some closure and peace about things, because a lot of us had not talked to Dad for several months and were unaware of his status,\u201d said the Rev. Michael Davis, who lives in Midlothian, Texas.\n\nDavis, 54, had become homeless, camping along the creek until he found a place to stay. He had arrived in Colorado about six years earlier, hoping to land a job in computer technology, but he struggled with the emotional pain of divorce and the death of one of his five children.\n\nThe family arrived in Colorado with little more than hope.\n\n\u201cWe had nothing to go on, just a key to a little storage unit,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt was a total step of faith.\u201d\n\nBefore checking into their hotel, they stopped at the homeless camp near the creek where his body was found Sept. 12, 2013.\n\n\u201cWithin a few minutes we found two people who knew my dad,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThey posted this on Facebook, and more friends of their father commented. \u201cThe next morning we were at Dad\u2019s campsite and met all his friends,\u201d Davis said.\n\nSlowly, they pieced together information on his last day alive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been at three different Bible studies, including a morning devotional at a coffee shop and going to a pizza shop to meet with the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt was great to learn my dad was very at peace with God.\u201d\n\nThey also retrieved their father\u2019s belongings from the storage locker: his Bible, some photographs, some Christian worship CDs and a little radio.\n\n\u201cI could tell that even though he was struggling and homeless, he was a happy man who loved the Lord and loved to help people,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMy dad was a happy guy who made the best out of whatever situation he found himself in.\u201d\n\nDanny Davis\u2019 mother, Edith, likes to focus on her son\u2019s creative abilities, like how he built a sun room for her house and built the first personal computer she ever owned. She also relies on faith.\n\n\u201cWhen you know the Lord, you mourn, but you\u2019re not without hope,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to see your child again. But that doesn\u2019t stop the big ol\u2019 hole in your heart.\u201d\n\nColleen O\u2019Connor: 303-954-1083, coconnor@denverpost.com or twitter.com/coconnordp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Struggling and homeless, Texas man who died in Colorado floods embraced faith", "title": "Struggling and homeless, Texas man who died in Colorado floods embraced faith", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/08/struggling-and-homeless-texas-man-who-died-in-colorado-floods-embraced-faith/", "image": {"width": 523, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140908__20140909_A8_DANNYDAVISp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140908__20140909_A8_DANNYDAVISp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-08T21:48:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:32:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWithin a few minutes we found two people who knew my dad,\u201d Davis said.\n\u201cWe had nothing to go on, just a key to a little storage unit,\u201d Davis said.\nSoon after flood officials discovered the body of Danny Mike Davis near Fountain Creek in Colorado Springs, his son presided over the funeral in their home state of Texas.\nDavis, 54, had become homeless, camping along the creek until he found a place to stay.\n\u201cHe\u2019d been at three different Bible studies, including a morning devotional at a coffee shop and going to a pizza shop to meet with the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs,\u201d Davis said."}
