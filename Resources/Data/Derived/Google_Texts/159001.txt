A lot can happen over the course of two decades: new jobs, new family members, new presidents, new trends and trendsetters, new understandings of the world in which we live.

And there is perhaps no field for which this is truer than health, where new findings are constantly emerging. Some of these findings have led to life-improving drugs, like Viagra and Truvada, while others led to truly remarkable medical breakthroughs, like face transplants and personalized medicine. Twenty years also provides ample time for new ideas and trends to emerge, such as CrossFit, organic eating, and health as entertainment.

In honor of Yahooâ€™s 20th birthday, we compiled a list of what we think are the biggest moments in health over the last 20 years. Take a look at our round-up, and be sure to include your own picks in the comments.
