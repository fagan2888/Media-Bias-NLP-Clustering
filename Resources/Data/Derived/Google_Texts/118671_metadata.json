(Photo: AP)\n\nIowa farmers and our nation\u2019s economic productivity rely on access to essential natural resources like crude oil. For everything from filling the tank of a tractor to America\u2019 strategic interests abroad, safe access to oil is essential to our state\u2019s and country\u2019s continued economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline would help transport crude oil from the Bakken region of North Dakota through Iowa as well as other upper Midwest states. It would be safer and more efficient than using rail cars, which are being used today to carry the load.\n\nOpponents to the project forget Iowa is still an agricultural state, and we rely on petroleum and diesel to run our businesses.\n\nBut the recent oil boom in North Dakota also has placed our farmers at a disadvantage. Too many rail cars are allocated for oil transport, leaving farmers high and dry with shipments sitting in elevators and rail yards. The cars we rely on to transport grain are being taken up by Bakken oil.\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline would allow for farmers to transport commodities with less expense by opening up more rail cars. The pipeline, as proposed, will alleviate four to seven unit trains per day, helping ease railcar transportation shortages for agriculture and other products, especially in the upper Midwest. And this is no small challenge to address; in 2014 alone, Midwest farmers lost $570 million in shipments, according to a American Farm Bureau Federation study.\n\nI strongly believe this pipeline is in the country\u2019s best interest as a whole.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1SLFPnt", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Safe access to oil is essential to our state\u2019s and country\u2019s continued economic growth", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Safe access to oil is essential to our state\u2019s and country\u2019s continued economic growth", "title": "Dakota Access Pipeline is in our best interests", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/08/05/pipeline-benefits-everyone-carter/31145079/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Safe access to oil is essential to our state\u2019s and country\u2019s continued economic growth", "title": "Dakota Access Pipeline is in our best interests", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e972509815038099be0de9d968053e0017d60c8/c=116-0-417-401/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46d729d8f3d768b717d4a020d4552b4eef49b4a8/c=66-0-467-401/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d8d36144bd2e13bc60f90ebcfb1ac87a90627f9/c=0-0-534-400/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f880bad1e08da3dac20a53ff02ab53c3f837f2d0/c=0-50-534-350&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-04T23:14:11.027000-05:00", "shorthed": "Dakota Access Pipeline is in our best interests", "articleid": 31145079, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eec6fd4cafba6c9b20fad3b0475b2dc4dc63a0e1/c=0-50-534-350/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70f689c316271227bf89628d0e373ea257e6d4c8/c=154-0-380-401/local/-/media/2015/08/04/DesMoines/B9318339569Z.1_20150804225605_000_GEGB6BNHB.2-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "author": "Chad Carter, Des Moines", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Dakota Access Pipeline is in our best interests"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3750\"", "article_summary": "The Dakota Access Pipeline would help transport crude oil from the Bakken region of North Dakota through Iowa as well as other upper Midwest states.\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline would allow for farmers to transport commodities with less expense by opening up more rail cars.\nIt would be safer and more efficient than using rail cars, which are being used today to carry the load.\nToo many rail cars are allocated for oil transport, leaving farmers high and dry with shipments sitting in elevators and rail yards.\n(Photo: AP)Iowa farmers and our nation\u2019s economic productivity rely on access to essential natural resources like crude oil."}
