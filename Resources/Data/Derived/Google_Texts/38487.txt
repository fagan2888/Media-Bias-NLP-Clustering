Well-known Kansas City burger joint Westport Flea Market has gotten some positive publicity for its “1985” deal in celebration of the Royals’ ALCS playoffs success (because they’re selling burgers at 1985 prices, which is enough to get local news stations excited), but the restaurant is making headlines across the wild world of the Internet for another, related reason of late.

Westport’s owner, Jeff Zwillenberg, recently welcomed KCTV reporter Courtenay DeHoff to his kitchen to try one of the storied burgers, and promptly allowed the exchange to get saucy. Offering DeHoff a burger, Zwillenberg told her “I would love to see my meat in your mouth.” With the camera rolling.

Seemingly not one to be stopped in her tracks by an off-color, on-air sexual remark, DeHoff went with it. “It’s not the first time I’ve heard that,” she responded, taking a bite of the burger.

Watch the exchange below:
