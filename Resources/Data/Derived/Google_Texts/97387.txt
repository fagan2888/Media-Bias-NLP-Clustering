Spruce up your poodle. Make the cat look perfect. Santa's waiting.

Family members with two legs or four can meet Santa during the annual Pet Photos with Santa at Mayfair mall in Wauwatosa.

Bring your dog or cat to Center Court from 6 to 9 p.m. every Monday now through Dec. 16 for a photo with Santa Claus. The visit is free. Photo packages start at $22.99.
