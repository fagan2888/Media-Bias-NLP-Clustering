I tend to find their fans easier to like than those of Alabama and LSU. Maybe it\u2019s just because we don\u2019t play each other every year and haven\u2019t been able to really fertilize an unhealthy hatred. I am aware that a certain contingent of their fan base considers the state of Mississippi and Ole Miss to be inferior underlings in the SEC food chain, but then again, I\u2019m pretty sure every SEC school has the same view of us.\n\nAt any rate, I really enjoyed Dan Patrick\u2019s interview with Tennessee native Bo Wallace, who grew up as a Tennessee Volunteers fan before becoming a Rebel. Bo was affable and diplomatic, other than standing by his disdain for Mississippi State.\n\nI\u2019m just glad Dan Patrick didn\u2019t ask Bo about his conspicuous camel toe, which can be seen clearly in this video at about the 0:25 mark. And the waist on those jeans is higher than Woody Harrelson in a treehouse.\n\nI find it hard to summon any significant hate for Tennessee. Perhaps that\u2019s because the first thing I think of is Charlie Daniels and his Volunteer Jam concerts. Maybe it\u2019s because when I see Charlie sit in with the Marshall Tucker Band, they seem to be rolling as hard as the Rebs, 24 hours at a time.\n\nAnd Tennessee is the state that gave us the overflowing cup of goodness that was Memphis wrestling. Then again, Tennessee did take the life out of Hank Jr. Deduction of points.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of the UT fan strategically releasing a photo this week allegedly depicting Robert Nkemdiche taking a bong hit earlier this year. Oh, my. Did the Vols learn nothing from the \u201cArchie Who?\u201d backfire? I don\u2019t know whether Big Bob took a hit or not, but I know he\u2019ll be delivering some hits on Saturday. I suppose we have no choice at this point but to destroy Big Orange. The only thing getting smoked on Saturday will be whoever has a \u201cT\u201d on his helmet and a ball in his hands. And the Vols will only dream of hitting a bowl at the end of the season. I see Big Bob morphing into Jefferson from Ridgemont High. They might as well have destroyed his Camaro.\n\nWait, Spicoli\u2026bong\u2026pissed off star player? X Files material. Maybe there\u2019s much more at play here than we even know.\n\nWhich reminds me of something completely unrelated: The so-called \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act is getting after me without Vaseline on my insurance premiums, reminding me of a profound revelation Jeff Spicoli once uttered, paraphrasing another famous Jefferson: \u201cHey! We left this England place \u2019cause it was bogus. So, if we don\u2019t get some cool rules ourselves, pronto, we\u2019ll just be bogus, too.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tad Wilkes, tad.wilkes@hottytoddy.com\n\nTad Wilkes is a journalist, lawyer, and songwriter known as Moon Pie Curtis living in Oxford.
