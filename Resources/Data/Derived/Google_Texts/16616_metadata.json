The problem is that this sentiment ignores the ways that race continues to affect Americans today. A new report from Demos and Brandeis University, \u201cThe Racial Wealth Gap: Why Policy Matters,\u201d makes this point strongly. The report shows that focusing on education alone will do little to reduce racial wealth gaps for households at the median, and that the Supreme Court, through upcoming decisions, could soon make the wealth gap explode.\n\nWealth is the whole of an individual\u2019s accumulated assets, not the amount of money they make each year. As such, in his recent book, \u201cThe Son Also Rises,\u201d Gregory Clark finds that the residual benefits of wealth remain for 10 to 15 generations. To understand why that matters, consider the fact that Loretta Lynch, Obama\u2019s recent nomination for U.S. attorney general, is the great-great-granddaughter of a slave who escaped to freedom. (That\u2019s four generations). Consider also that most people on Social Security today went to segregated schools. (That\u2019s two generations.) If Clark is correct in his thesis, then the impacts of wealth built on the foundations of American slavery and segregation will continue to affect Lynch\u2019s great-great-great grandchildren.\n\nIt is therefore unsurprising that addressing just one aspect of this disparity cannot solve racial wealth gaps. Demos/Brandeis find that equalizing graduation rates would reduce the wealth gap between blacks and whites by 1 percent, and between Latinos and whites by 3 percent at the median. Equalizing the distribution of income would only reduce the wealth gap by 11 percent for blacks and 9 percent for Latinos. Part of the durability of wealth gaps is the disproportionate benefits that whites still enjoy: They face less job market discrimination and are more likely to reap a big inheritance, for example. This means that the returns to education and income are generally higher for whites. But even after controlling for these returns, income and education can\u2019t explain the entire wealth gap.\n\nBecause America\u2019s primary vehicle for wealth accumulation is our homes, much of the explanation of the racial wealth gap lies in unequal homeownership rates. According to the Brandeis/Demos analysis, equalizing homeownership would reduce the racial wealth gap by 31 percent for blacks and 28 percent for Latinos. This effect is muted because centuries of discrimination\u2014including racial exclusion from neighborhoods where home values appreciate, redlining, and discriminatory lending practices\u2014mean that people of color are segregated into relatively poor neighborhoods. Indeed, in 1969, civil rights activist John Lewis bought a three-bedroom house for $35,000 in Venetian Hills, Atlanta. He and his wife were the first black family in the middle-class neighborhood. In his book, \u201cWalking with the Wind,\u201d he notes that, \u201cwithin two years\u2026 the white owners began moving out.\u201d Had the value of his house simply kept up with inflation, it would be worth $222,881 today. But Zillow shows that three-bedroom houses in Venetian Hills, Atlanta, are currently selling for around $65,000 to $100,000.\n\nSystematic disinvestment in communities of color means that even when blacks and Latinos own their homes, they are worth far less than white homes. In addition, blacks and Latinos are targets of shady lending. They are more likely to be offered a subprime loan even if they are qualified to receive a better rate. In the wake of the financial crisis, big banks like Blackstone scooped up foreclosed homes and are now offering them to people of color to rent, further pulling wealth out of these communities to benefit rich whites.\n\nThe financial crisis had a disparate impact on people of color. A Center for Responsible Lending report examined the loans originated during the subprime boom (2005 to 2008), and found that blacks and Latinos were almost twice as likely to have foreclosed during the crisis. The New York Times reported that Wells Fargo \u201csaw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation\u2019s home-owning mania.\u201d They discovered that loan officers \u201cpushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages\u201d and \u201cstated in an affidavit\u2026 that employees had referred to blacks as \u2018mud people\u2019 and to subprime lending as \u2018ghetto loans.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yet again, conservatives on the Supreme Court are poised to do significant damage to minority communities", "title": "How the Supreme Court is about to explode America\u2019s racial wealth gap", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Yet again, conservatives on the Supreme Court are poised to do significant damage to minority communities", "title": "How the Supreme Court is about to explode America\u2019s racial wealth gap", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/how_the_supreme_court_is_about_to_explode_americas_racial_wealth_gap/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/scalia_roberts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yet again, conservatives on the Supreme Court are poised to do significant damage to minority communities", "title": "How the Supreme Court is about to explode America\u2019s racial wealth gap", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/scalia_roberts.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee and Catherine Ruetschlin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Income inequality, Race, racial discrimination, Racism, SCOTUS, The Supreme Court, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3a5\"", "article_summary": "Because America\u2019s primary vehicle for wealth accumulation is our homes, much of the explanation of the racial wealth gap lies in unequal homeownership rates.\nThe report shows that focusing on education alone will do little to reduce racial wealth gaps for households at the median, and that the Supreme Court, through upcoming decisions, could soon make the wealth gap explode.\nA new report from Demos and Brandeis University, \u201cThe Racial Wealth Gap: Why Policy Matters,\u201d makes this point strongly.\nIt is therefore unsurprising that addressing just one aspect of this disparity cannot solve racial wealth gaps.\nAccording to the Brandeis/Demos analysis, equalizing homeownership would reduce the racial wealth gap by 31 percent for blacks and 28 percent for Latinos."}
