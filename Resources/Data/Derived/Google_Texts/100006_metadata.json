U.S. President Barack Obama and his HealthCare.gov website face another critical test starting this week, as Americans who have been unable to enroll in health coverage under Obamacare rush to a site that continues to face challenges. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH) - RTX161D1\n\n4062769\n\nThe man formerly known as \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Wanted Hacker\u201d told Congress that the HealthCare.gov Obamacare enrollment website clearly \u201cdid not consider security as a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a hacker\u2019s wet dream to break into healthcare.gov,\u201d said Kevin Mitnick, once the world\u2019s most wanted cybercriminal and now a top cyber security consultant, in written testimony before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\n\u201cAfter reading the documents provided by David Kennedy that detailed numerous security vulnerabilities associated with the healthcare.gov web site, it\u2019s clear that the management team did not consider security as a priority,\u201d Mitnick wrote.\n\n\u201cHealthcare.gov retrieves information from numerous third-party databases belonging to the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and other State agencies. It would be a hacker\u2019s wet dream to break into healthcare.gov and potentially gain access to the information stored in these databases. A breach may result in massive identity theft never seen before \u2014 these databases house information on every U.S. citizen!\u201d Mitnick wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful the team that built the healthcare.gov site implemented minimal, if any, security best practices to mitigate the significant risk of a system compromise or access to consumer proprietary information,\u201d Mitnick wrote.\n\nMitnick, the founder and CEO of Mitnick Security Consulting, was a fugitive of the law before his 1995 arrest and subsequent conversion to cyber defender. He is now a security consultant for Fortune 500 companies and does work for government agencies.\n\nThe White House has opposed a House bill to require the administration to provide Congress with weekly reports on Obamacare website functionality problems and other Obamacare issues. As The Daily Caller reported this week, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has failed to provide a plan to guard against website security breaches and Obamacare-related fraud, according to Republican Rep. Diane Black.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "'It's shameful'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The man formerly known as \"The World's Most Wanted Hacker\" told Congress that the HealthCare.gov Obamacare enrollment website clearly \"did not consider security as a priority.\"    \"It would be a hacke", "title": "\u2018A hacker\u2019s wet dream:\u2019 \u2018World\u2019s most wanted hacker\u2019 SLAMS Obamacare website security", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/17/a-hackers-wet-dream-worlds-most-wanted-hacker-slams-obamacare-website-security/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sebeliushall.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It's shameful'", "title": "\u2018A hacker\u2019s wet dream:\u2019 \u2018World\u2019s most wanted hacker\u2019 SLAMS Obamacare website security Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/17/a-hackers-wet-dream-worlds-most-wanted-hacker-slams-obamacare-website-security/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sebeliushall.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-17 12:13:16", "sailthru.title": "'A hacker's wet dream:' 'World's most wanted hacker' SLAMS Obamacare website security", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The man formerly known as \"The World's Most Wanted Hacker\" told Congress that the HealthCare.gov Obamacare enrollment website clearly \"did not consider security as a priority.\"    \"It would be a hacke", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sebeliushall.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00c3\"", "article_summary": "Mitnick, the founder and CEO of Mitnick Security Consulting, was a fugitive of the law before his 1995 arrest and subsequent conversion to cyber defender.\nA breach may result in massive identity theft never seen before \u2014 these databases house information on every U.S. citizen!\u201d Mitnick wrote.\nThe White House has opposed a House bill to require the administration to provide Congress with weekly reports on Obamacare website functionality problems and other Obamacare issues.\n\u201cHealthcare.gov retrieves information from numerous third-party databases belonging to the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and other State agencies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful the team that built the healthcare.gov site implemented minimal, if any, security best practices to mitigate the significant risk of a system compromise or access to consumer proprietary information,\u201d Mitnick wrote."}
