But as details of the plan come more into focus, alarms are being raised that the Islamic republic is playing a high-stakes game of \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 that is allowing it to advance its nuclear program.\n\nWhile the White House initially did not recognize the Islamic republic has a right to enrich, Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman with the White House National Security Council, told the Washington Free Beacon that \u201cwe are prepared to negotiate a strictly limited enrichment program in the end state\u201d on December 3.\n\nMeehan went on to say that the Iranians have indicated for the first time that they are prepared to accept \u201crigorous monitoring and limits on level, scope, capacity and stockpiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny such program,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be subject to strict and verifiable curbs on its capacity and stockpiles of enriched uranium for a significant number of years and tied to practical energy needs that will remain minimal for years to come.\u201d\n\nOn December 4, 2013, the Jerusalem Post reported Israel\u2019s opposition to any permanent enrichment capacity. Even at low levels, Israeli officials argue, the infrastructure required for such enrichment leaves Iran perilously close to the ability to manufacture a nuclear weapon.\n\nThis past September, the Russians handed over operational control of the Russian-made Bushehr nuclear power plant to Iran, and are still trying to close a deal to build more nuclear power plants in Iran. IRINN-TV quoted Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on December 11, 2013 as saying the two countries are close to an agreement on building additional nuclear plants.\n\nFollowing Turkey\u2019s announcement in early January that it had struck a deal with Japan to build nuclear facilities in its country, Iran said it too wanted Japan to help build nuclear plants. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he believes Iran and Japan can work together to build facilities that generate electricity.\n\n\u201cJapan obtains the most advanced technologies in nuclear energy and exports them abroad,\u201d Araqchi said. \u201cThere are good prospects for Iran and Japan to cooperate in the construction of the nuclear power plants.\u201d\n\nAdding further tension to this diplomatic game of Deal or No Deal, Zarif said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was wrong when he bragged the agreement would result in Iran trashing some of its enrichment uranium stockpiles.\n\n\u201cWe did not agree to dismantle anything.\u201d Zarif told CNN, adding that his country was allowed to continue enriching up to 5-percent and the deal was \u201creversible.\u201d\n\nSecretary Kerry also claimed that Iran agreed to \u201cdismantle some infrastructure that makes higher-level uranium enrichment possible.\u201d However, on Wednesday Iranian FM Zarif accused the Obama White House of misrepresenting the deal relating to Iran\u2019s controversial nuclear program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As details of President Obama's agreement with Iran over its nuclear program come more into focus, alarms are being raised that the Islamic republic is playing", "og": {"site_name": "The Right Perspective", "description": "As details of President Obama's agreement with Iran over its nuclear program come more into focus, alarms are being raised that the Islamic republic is playing a high-stakes game of 'Deal or No Deal' which allows it to advance its nuclear program.", "title": "Iran's Nuclear 'Deal or No Deal'", "url": "http://www.therightperspective.org/2014/01/25/irans-nuclear-deal-or-no-deal/", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.therightperspective.org", "description": "As details of President Obama's agreement with Iran over its nuclear program come more into focus, alarms are being raised that the Islamic republic is playing a high-stakes game of 'Deal or No Deal' which allows it to advance its nuclear program.", "title": "Iran's Nuclear 'Deal or No Deal'", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "site": "@http://www.twitter.com/newsguy2005", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-TRP_Logo_512x512-270x270.jpg", "keywords": "iran,nuclear,nuclear enrichment,john kerry,bernadette meehan,israel,bushehr,russia,turkey,japan,mohammad javad zarif,abbas araqchi,middle east,the new cold war", "article": {"tag": "the new cold war", "published_time": "2014-01-25T15:26:02Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T15:26:02Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe174c\"", "article_summary": "Following Turkey\u2019s announcement in early January that it had struck a deal with Japan to build nuclear facilities in its country, Iran said it too wanted Japan to help build nuclear plants.\nLate in the evening of November 23, 2013, President Obama\u2019s legacy moment was announced: a tentative deal with Iran resolving its nuclear enrichment issue.\nBut as details of the plan come more into focus, alarms are being raised that the Islamic republic is playing a high-stakes game of \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 that is allowing it to advance its nuclear program.\nThis past September, the Russians handed over operational control of the Russian-made Bushehr nuclear power plant to Iran, and are still trying to close a deal to build more nuclear power plants in Iran.\nIRINN-TV quoted Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on December 11, 2013 as saying the two countries are close to an agreement on building additional nuclear plants."}
