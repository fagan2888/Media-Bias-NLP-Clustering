MILWAUKEE (AP) -- President Barack Obama visits Milwaukee this week to celebrate the city's sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act.

Milwaukee won a competition among 20 cities to increase the number of enrollees under the latest health insurance marketplace open enrollment period.

Obama is scheduled to travel to Milwaukee on Thursday and speak at the United Community Center.

The White House announced in February that Milwaukee won the "Healthy Communities Challenge." About 38,000 people in the Milwaukee area newly selected a plan through the health insurance marketplace during the latest open enrollment period. Altogether, about 89,000 people in the Milwaukee area selected a 2016 marketplace plan.

MILWAUKEE, Wis. -- President Obama will visit Milwaukee on March 3 to highlight health insurance enrollment success. This comes after the city won the “White House Healthy Communities Challenge.”

“I am thrilled to be welcoming President Obama to Milwaukee next week to celebrate our success in the Healthy Communities Challenge. In November, when I received a call from the White House challenging Milwaukee to increase the number of new enrollees into the Health Insurance Marketplace, I accepted without hesitation with the knowledge that our coalition of health partners was already at work,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.

On February 12, the city officials, along with healthcare advocates heard the announcement from the White House over the phone.

“I am proud of the collaborative effort that took place to increase the number of local residents enrolled in health insurance, and I look forward to showcasing the hard work of the more than 100 partners in the Milwaukee Enrollment Network during this visit,” Barrett said.
