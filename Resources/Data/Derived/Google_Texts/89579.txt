The rope used to hang ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is up for auction and could sell for as much as $7 million.

Ex-Prime Minister Mowaffak Al-Rubaie has put the rope up for sale more than eight years after the execution in 2006, The New York Post reported Friday.

An unidentified senior Iraqi political official told the Middle East news site Al-Araby al-Jadeed that several individuals from Israel, Iran and Kuwait have made offers on the rope.

Mr. Al-Rubaie told the Independent in 2013 that his men brought him back a piece of the rope “after they cut Saddam down.”

The Iraqi government has not commented but local law requires that if the item is sold, the money from the sale must go to the state’s treasury, the Post reported.
