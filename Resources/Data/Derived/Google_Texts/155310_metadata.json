Hangovers get worse, lasting several days, and a night out consuming hamburgers, cheese fries, and beer makes us feel way, way worse than it used to when we were sprightly young 20-year-olds. This also means that, as we age, we might also witness our waistlines getting bigger.\n\nThe strange thing is that as people get older, they tend to eat much healthier than they did as college students (the time when cramming down chocolate bars, fluffer nutters, and pizza during study sessions was likely a weekly ordeal). Older people are more likely to turn to responsible food choices like salads and lean meats. But if our diets improve as we get older, then why do we still get fat as we age?\n\nAccording to a new study, it\u2019s because physical activity has a greater impact on our weight and health than diet does as we grow older. The study examined 4,999 American adults between the ages of 20 and 70 by using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and recorded information about people\u2019s weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and diet.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the very important impact of physical activity on weight status in U.S. adults, and in particular it points to the critical role of the age-related decline in physical activity on the increasing rates of overweight and obesity that we see with aging,\u201d said Russell Pate, lead author of the study, according to the Huffington Post. \u201cOur findings indicate that increasing fatness with age in U.S. adults cannot be explained by changes in the quality of the diet they consume.\u201d\n\nPeople who rely only on diet to lose weight end up either gaining the weight back shortly after, or struggle to lose weight because they\u2019re not feeding themselves the proper nutrients. Exercise, on the other hand, helps you keep the weight off longer and will jumpstart your metabolism. Learn more about the diet-versus-exercise debate here.\n\nIndeed, the study is important because obesity continues to be a huge problem in this nation, affecting nearly one-third of the American population, and the importance of exercise can\u2019t be stressed enough. Two-thirds of the American population, meanwhile, is either obese or overweight.\n\n\u201cAmericans should meet the federal physical activity guideline: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week,\u201d Tate states. \u201cIf most American adults met that guideline, rates of overweight and obesity would be substantially lower than they are today.\u201d\n\nSo, ordering a salad at your favorite diner instead of your regular cheeseburger may be a good start, but it\u2019s certainly not the whole deal. You\u2019re going to have to get moving if you want to stay fit and healthy as you get older.\n\nSource: Pate R, Taverno Ross S, Liese A, Dowda M.
