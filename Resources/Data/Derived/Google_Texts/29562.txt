If you’re on the job hunt, chances are you’ll have to pee in a cup at some point — if you haven’t already. More and more companies are subjecting their employees to drug screenings, dismissing candidates who test positive. However, failing a drug test when you’re not a drug user, may be attributed to over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and foods that may trigger a false positive result.

Urine tests, one of the most common drug screening methods, analyzes urine samples for the presence of certain illegal drugs and prescription medications, including alcohol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, marijuana, cocaine, PCP, and opioids (narcotics).

There are plenty of legal foods and medications, from bagels to cough suppressants, which contain minuscule traces of these drugs.
