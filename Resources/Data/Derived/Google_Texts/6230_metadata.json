Stanford Cancer Center South Bay has espoused this ethos in every aspect of its development, including having patients conduct interviews for hiring.\n\nAs Katie Abbott, the senior program manager for business operations, puts it: \u201cBeing in healthcare as a clinician or an administrator doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re saved from being a patient. But we still become blind a bit and miss things\u2014it really takes those eyes of other folks to help us design better.\u201d\n\nThe center, which opened in June, employs patients and family members from Stanford\u2019s Palo Alto center, as well as a local community cancer practice, on its 20-person Patient and Family Advisory Council in this process. The center was adamant about having 100% of staff interviewed by a patient, a family member, and someone from the non-hiring leadership team. Over the course of six months, the committee hired 250 people for the center and used this process on each one (except doctors)\u2014from nurses to the cafe staff. The hiring managers used direct quotes from candidates\u2019 interviews to assist in their decision.\n\nAbbott said patients ask completely different questions of prospective staff and have provided crucial perspective for the center to carry out its mission to be patient-centric. The Affordable Care Act has changed financial models in healthcare, making patients the direct consumer. And to cater to this market, more facilities in the US are being designed to focus on patient experience and quality of care.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t necessarily measure\u201d the effect the patients\u2019 involvement has had, Abbott said. \u201cBut when you walk in the building, it just feels different.\u201d\n\nI talked to Abbott at the Health Experience Refactored Conference in Boston about this approach. Here\u2019s how patients and family became an integral part of the interview process, one that\u2019s still in place, as explained by Abbott. (The following is edited for length and clarity.)\n\nThey made the process nimble. \u201cIn the beginning, [the hospital staff] was really reluctant to participate. They thought this was going to be an additional step that would slow down the hiring process and we might be losing our best candidates. So we set up a framework so that wouldn\u2019t happen. We made ourselves very available so if somebody said, \u2018I need this interview to be done this afternoon,\u2019 we were able to be nimble enough to do that.'\u201d\n\nThey provided adequate training. \u201cWe did train our patients and families first so they went through an interview bootcamp with HR. They learned what to ask, what not to ask. You can ask about experience; no, you cannot ask if somebody is pregnant right now. That also helped the patients and families feel more comfortable. Some of them were executives themselves and had done interviews before. Most of them who participated had never done an interview in the past. Part of it was getting them comfortable and confident and up to speed. The other piece was being able to use a few of the quick wins [in using this process] and first interviews as a platform to show just how beneficial their perspective was.\u201d\n\nPatients and family members became the deciding factor. \u201cIn the beginning, managers sent us their top candidates and it was very clear they\u2019d made the decisions of who they wanted to hire. We would send them the feedback: 90% of the time, patients and families were so enthusiastic about having these folks join the team. But for that other 10%, if the interview didn\u2019t go as well or there were just quotes that these candidates had said that didn\u2019t quite feel patient- and family-centered, we would send that feedback to the hiring managers. They would say \u2018Oh my gosh, I knew this person technically was great, they could do the job and even from a human-centered standpoint, I thought they were great, but there was something that I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on.\u2019 Oftentimes the feedback we would capture was solidifying what their gut already had told them. They were a great candidate, but something just wasn\u2019t quite a great fit. As we moved on, we found that people were actually sending us their top two or three candidates and they would say, \u2018They\u2019re all great, I need the Patient and Family Advisory Council to pick.'\u201d\n\nThey learned from the questions their patients asked. \u201cOne of my favorites, and this was an interesting one for folks to answer, was \u2018What\u2019s one thing about the culture where you work now that you\u2019d like to bring to the new cancer center and what\u2019s one thing that you\u2019d like to leave behind?\u2019 It made candidates a little uneasy, but it gave them permission to talk about the things they were proud of and they hoped to bring to the new site, and things that were big opportunities for us to problem-solve together. That was one of my favorite questions that our volunteers asked, and now I ask in almost all of my interviews as well.\u201d\n\nIf candidates weren\u2019t comfortable being interviewed by patients, they probably weren\u2019t a great fit. \u201cSome of them even said things like, \u2018I don\u2019t really like being around patients.\u2019 They may have been a lab tech in the back, but to me, every vial of blood, every specimen that comes through is a patient. That candidate may have never admitted that to the hiring manager. When they were able to say that in front of the patients and us [staff, it was clear that] this wasn\u2019t a great fit for this person either. They need to be excited about the culture that we\u2019re trying to build in order for them to be excited about their role as well.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this post stated that doctors were interviewed by the patient and family advisory council members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes it's the patient, not the doctor or hospital administrator, who knows best.
