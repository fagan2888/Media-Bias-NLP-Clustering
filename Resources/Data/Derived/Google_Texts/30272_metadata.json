Latex-clad 20-year-old pop stars do not \u201cencourage a teenage culture\u201d in which boys can sexually assault unconscious girls with impunity. And convicted rapists who escape punishment and violate the terms of their rehabilitation programs \u2014 only to be faced with a mere 30 days in prison as a result \u2014 have not received a sentence \u201cappropriate given the nature of the case.\u201d\n\nAnd yet this is, verbatim, how we\u2019re talking about rape in 2013. A little more than a year out from the \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comment that killed Todd Akin\u2019s political career, it\u2019s become clear that, far from being a ridiculous outlier, Akin\u2019s view of sexual violence is basically how too many people with high profiles choose to talk about rape: quick to blame survivors, even quicker to excuse perpetrators.\n\nIt is so easy to be better. Writing about sexual assault with accuracy, empathy and common sense is really about taking the time and forethought just to be a good person.\n\nHere are five ways to start.\n\nBeing sexually assaulted is a tragedy. Going to prison for sexually assaulting someone is not.\n\nEmpathy is a good thing. Even empathy for people who commit terrible crimes can be a good thing. But being sexually assaulted and being held accountable for sexually assaulting someone are not the same things. The former is awful, the latter is the opposite of awful.\n\nThough he has since walked back his statements, Judge G. Todd Baugh initially agreed wholeheartedly with Stacey Dean Rambold\u2019s defense attorney when he argued that Rambold \u2014 a 49-year-old teacher who repeatedly raped his 14-year-old student \u2014 should not serve the recommended 15 years behind bars because he had \u201csuffered enough\u201d during his trial. Rambold, his attorney argued, was branded with the \u201cscarlet letter of the Internet,\u201d lost his job, his home and his family after the assault. Rambold\u2019s victim, on the other hand, was repeatedly raped by an adult who was legally responsible for her care; she would go on to commit suicide before the trial against Rambold concluded. She was only 16 years old.\n\nTo suggest Rambold\u2019s experience of being found guilty of a crime is on par with the experience of being a victim of that crime is not only offensive \u2014 it\u2019s delusional.\n\nThen, of course, there was CNN\u2019s notorious commentary on the \u201cpromising futures\u201d of Trent Mays and Ma\u2019lik Richmond, the two high school football players found guilty of raping an unconscious teenage girl and, in Mays\u2019 case, circulating the photos of the assault online. After delivering news of the guilty verdict to Candy Crowley, general correspondent Poppy Harlow lamented:\n\nIncredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart \u2026 when that sentence came down, [Richmond] collapsed in the arms of his attorney \u2026 He said to him, \u201cMy life is over. No one is going to want me now.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t a tragedy when people who commit crimes face consequences. It\u2019s actually called justice when that happens.\n\nFemale sexuality does not invite rape, ever (ever, ever, ever, ever, ever).\n\nOn Tuesday, the Washington Post ran a piece by Richard Cohen suggesting that Miley Cyrus might be somehow responsible for the crimes committed in Steubenville. And while it\u2019s tempting to dismiss Cohen as an out-of-touch man with a horrible track record of saying deeply misogynistic and racist things on the Internet (all of which is also true), he\u2019s not the only one blaming female raunch culture for sexual violence.\n\nIn a story for USA Today, Joanne Bamberger took a similar position on Cyrus, this time blaming her, bizarrely, for gross failures of accountability from the criminal justice system. While Cohen believes Cyrus is guilty of \u201cdebasing\u201d women and girls and effectively inviting teenagers to sexually assault other teenagers, Bamberger cites the pop star\u2019s onstage writhing and grinding as the reason that judges like Baugh think girls like Rambold\u2019s victim are \u201cas much in control of the situation\u201d as their assailants:\n\nEven though [Cyrus] is 20, many of us still see her as the tween/teen star of Disney\u2019s \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d and maintain a mental image of her as that more wholesome child, even as she struts on stage today, inviting sexual attention. Shows like \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d reinforce the idea that girls are sexually mature before they graduate from high school. The music industry inundates us with salacious female images, like the Britney Spears/Madonna French-kissing episode ten years ago on same MTV award show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rules for accurate rape commentary are a lot like the rules of not being a horrible person.
