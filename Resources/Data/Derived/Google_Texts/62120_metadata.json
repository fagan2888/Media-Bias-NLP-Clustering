I'm right here. I got you.\"\n\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, is never one to shy away from daredevil feats, and took to the skies when wildfires were raging through the Ryazan region of Russia in August 2010.\n\nMr Putin took the co-pilots seat, and personally aimed the water-laden plane at the fire - driving the flames back before more damage could be done.\n\nPrince Harry\n\nPerhaps the ultimate knight in shining armour, Prince Harry made women all over the world swoon when he came to the rescue of a member of his opposing team during a polo game.\n\nIn 2012 the Prince was competing in Brazil when a collision between players led to businessman Bash Kazi being knocked unconscious.\n\nHarry rushed to his aid and performed first aid - putting him in the recovery position and doing what he could to ensure Mr Bash could breathe. Mr Bash said after the event that the Prince was \u201ca fabulous person\u201d and \u201csuch a gentleman\u201d.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California is used to playing the role of an action hero. But in 2004 Mr Schwarzenegger put his skills to the test when, on a family holiday in Maui, he spotted a man struggling to swim and to breathe in the water.\n\nThe 56-year-old swam out to him, only to discover the man had cramps all over his body and was unable to swim to shore. Mr Schwarzenegger helped the man to cling on to his boogie board and then swam the man back to shore, where he stayed with him to ensure he was not in danger.\n\nEd Milliband\n\nAdmitting that he is rarely cast as a muscled \u2018superhero\u2019 type, Ed Miliband \u201cmysteriously appeared out of nowhere, a bit like an action hero\u201d to help cyclist Ella Philips after she fell off her bike in London.\n\nMiss Phillips said she will \u201cdefinitely be voting for him now\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02709/barack_faint_2709602k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;Barack_Obama", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/barackobama", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "World leaders who have come to the rescue", "section-id": 4411, "GSAGenre": "barackobama", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-barackobama", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/barackobama", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 10396205, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "As Barack Obama catches a woman who faints during her speech, here is a look \n  at world leaders, royals and politicians who have come to the rescue", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-22", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-barack_obama", "last-modified": "2013-10-22", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 385, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Georgina Strapp", "tag": "Barack Obama", "subsection": "Barack Obama", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 3, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10396205, "tmgads.articleid": 10396205, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"World leaders who have come to the rescue \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10396205/World-leaders-who-have-come-to-the-rescue.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02709/barack_faint_2709602k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10396205\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-22T11:03:12Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Georgina Strapp\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Barack Obama\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "As Barack Obama catches a woman who faints during her speech, here is a look   at world leaders, royals and politicians who have come to the rescue", "title": "World leaders who have come to the rescue", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10396205/World-leaders-who-have-come-to-the-rescue.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02709/barack_faint_2709602k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "barackobama", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.barackobama", "DCSext.author": "Georgina Strapp", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-22 12:03"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce73e\"", "article_summary": "Mr Putin took the co-pilots seat, and personally aimed the water-laden plane at the fire - driving the flames back before more damage could be done.\nHarry rushed to his aid and performed first aid - putting him in the recovery position and doing what he could to ensure Mr Bash could breathe.\nMr Bash said after the event that the Prince was \u201ca fabulous person\u201d and \u201csuch a gentleman\u201d.\nPrince HarryPerhaps the ultimate knight in shining armour, Prince Harry made women all over the world swoon when he came to the rescue of a member of his opposing team during a polo game.\nPresident Barack Obama caught a pregnant woman as she fainted during his speech on the troubled Obamacare website on Monday."}
