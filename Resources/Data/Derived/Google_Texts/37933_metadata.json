Scott Walker (R), fresh off his six-point victory in this year\u2019s re-election campaign, appeared on msnbc the other day and offered a curious defense of his decision to reject Medicaid expansion.\n\nTara Culp-Ressler had a good report on the interview.\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Friday, Walker was asked whether his position stemmed from an \u201cideological criticism,\u201d and if he believes the handful of Republican governors implementing this provision of the health law are not \u201cgenuine conservatives.\u201d The governor didn\u2019t explicitly answer that question, pointing out that every state has different needs. But he did offer a broader criticism of the public health program. \u201cBeyond that, I just ask the basic question: Why is more people on Medicaid a good thing?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather find a way, particularly for able-bodied adults without children, I\u2019d like to find a way to get them into the workforce. I think ideologically, that\u2019s a better approach, not just as a conservative, but as an American. Have more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201d\n\nI can appreciate why governors like Walker find themselves in a tough position on this. On the one hand, Medicaid expansion is a no-brainer, which helps low-income families access medical care, improves state finances, and bolsters public hospitals. It\u2019s exactly why so many GOP governors, even in red states, have embraced the policy.\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans hold President Obama in contempt, and they\u2019re supposed to reject every aspect of \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nBut even under these circumstances, Walker\u2019s argument is just ridiculous.\n\nLet\u2019s unwrap it:\n\n\u201cWhy is more people on Medicaid a good thing?\u201d Well, because these are struggling families who can\u2019t otherwise afford basic medical care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to find a way to get them into the workforce.\u201d That sounds nice, but many of these Americans are already in the workforce, but they still don\u2019t make enough money. The fact that the governor doesn\u2019t understand this basic detail is somewhat alarming. What\u2019s more, in Wisconsin, Walker\u2019s efforts to \u201cfind a way\u201d to create jobs has failed miserably \u2013 the governor promised to create 250,000 jobs in his first term, but ended up creating less than half that total.\n\n\u201cHave more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201d Again, it\u2019s a lovely sentiment, but Walker is effectively arguing that low-income families shouldn\u2019t have access to medical care because it\u2019s inconsistent with his governing philosophy.\n\nObviously, far-right Republicans have a fairly rigid ideology, but the question here is one of pragmatism. There are real-world people struggling in Wisconsin right now. They want health care coverage, but can\u2019t have it because Scott Walker has a vision of \u201cthe American dream,\u201d and Medicaid isn\u2019t part of that vision.\n\nThe governor\u2019s message to them is \u2026 what, exactly? \u201cSorry you can\u2019t have access to basic care, but at least you\u2019re not dependent on the government\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.
