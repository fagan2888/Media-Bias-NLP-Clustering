The manager later escaped while Lepere remained in the building until police stormed in.\n\nAs the standoff with the Kouachi brothers unfolded, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, stormed a kosher grocery store on the eastern edge of Paris, killing four and taking 15 hostages, who were later released.\n\nFrom inside the printing business, Lepere sent officers \"tactical elements such as his location inside the premises,\" Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said, according to Sky News. Lepere could hear the brothers talking, which gave him more information to send to police outside, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported.\n\nLepere also sent a text message to his father saying, \"I am hidden on the first floor. I think they have killed everyone. Tell the police to intervene,\" Daily Mail reports.\n\nIt is unclear where Lepere hid. Sky News reports he crouched \"under a sink in the canteen\" of the building. Daily Mail reports he was \"hidden in a cardboard box just yards away\" from the brothers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal did not name Lepere but reported that the printing house's business manager and another man were trapped inside with the Kouachi brothers. Around 2:30 p.m., the manager escaped and ran to police but the other man remained stuck inside for almost three hours communicating with authorities, the paper said.\n\nJust before 5 p.m. Friday, security forces launched a major assault on the printing plant with explosions and gunshots ringing out. Police killed the Kouachi brothers in the exchange and rescued their hostage.\n\nPolice eventually got to Lepere using an armored car and took him to police headquarters, where he was quickly reunited with his family, Sky News reports.\n\nLepere's father said the family was \"doing fine\" and thanked the police and the \"people who helped,\" Sky News reports.\n\nPolice also stormed the Paris kosher grocery in another eruption of gunshots and explosions rescuing 15 hostages and killing Coulibaly.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1BMOqvi", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A terrified man hiding and texting French police from inside the printing business besieged by the Charlie Hebdo attackers gave authorities critical updates during Friday's dramatic standoff.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "A terrified man hiding and texting French police from inside the printing business besieged by the Charlie Hebdo attackers gave authorities critical updates during Friday's dramatic standoff.", "title": "Man hid from 'Hebdo' gunmen, texted police", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/10/lilian-lepere-hid-from-hebdo-gunmen-and-texted-police/21553843/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A terrified man hiding and texting French police from inside the printing business besieged by the Charlie Hebdo attackers gave authorities critical updates during Friday's dramatic standoff.", "title": "Man hid from 'Hebdo' gunmen, texted police", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e4f75ed9d503f17f692bb6a160877653ebccdd2/c=173-0-3437-3264&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Daily Mail", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/Daily Mail", "title": "Man hid from 'Hebdo' gunmen, texted police", "author": "Yamiche Alcindor", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/world", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b6ccca71ce3ec57e0432efba997beefa35659ba8/c=682-0-3130-3264/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d591badae3637c044d187dd4507f0142fa3adfb/c=173-0-3437-3264/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a0f7be1b2d48d1a1e36854848e250b680c1a0298/c=0-0-4341-3264/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51890149ded1012bbf42401af7c66c8ed86e5b04/c=0-488-4890-3251&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-10T14:19:04.733000-05:00", "shorthed": "Man hid from 'Hebdo' gunmen, texted police", "articleid": 21553843, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc5be4a81bfea0875a89389cf6b0220b9a418f26/c=0-488-4890-3251/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d4bba3fb6b3f49025b5145693fde65c1e586519/c=1106-0-2934-3264/local/-/media/2015/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635564938081836501-AP-France-Newspaper-Attack.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ea6\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Michel Spingler, AP)A terrified man hiding and texting French police from inside the printing business besieged by the Charlie Hebdo attackers gave authorities critical updates during Friday's dramatic standoff.\nPolice killed the Kouachi brothers in the exchange and rescued their hostage.\nThe Wall Street Journal did not name Lepere but reported that the printing house's business manager and another man were trapped inside with the Kouachi brothers.\nFrom inside the printing business, Lepere sent officers \"tactical elements such as his location inside the premises,\" Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said, according to Sky News.\nPolice also stormed the Paris kosher grocery in another eruption of gunshots and explosions rescuing 15 hostages and killing Coulibaly."}
