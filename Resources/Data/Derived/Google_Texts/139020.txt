A Florida watchdog group says keeping some older inmates behind bars may be costing the state a bundle and is doing little for public safety.

Florida is housing just under 6,000 inmates over the age of 60 and releasing some of them is just one idea to cut prison costs. Morgan McCord of Florida Taxwatch said, "When we implement some sort of elderly parole option, it's allowing some of these non-violent offenders to really get out of a prison system that is not providing a positive return on investment for our communities."

Taxpayers spend an average of $17,000 a year to keep someone in prison and the elderly can cost two or three times as much.

State lawmakers have limited what latitude judges have through sentencing guidelines. Now Taxwatch says there needs to be an alternative.

Florida Taxwatch research director Rober Weissert said, "We're talking about a revenue, a cost estimating tool. Something that would provide not only what the cost of incarnation would be, but the cost of alternatives are."

Taking 10 percent of the inmates out of prison and putting ankle bracelets on them would save $120,000,000 a year. "That's a $120,000,000 a year that can be reinvested in our communities, to be given to education, student performance," said Weissert.

Florida spends $280,000,000 on prison health care alone. The entire system costs two billion dollars a year to run.

About 102,000 inmates reside in Florida prisons. Health care costs are expected to go from $280,000,000 this year to $369,000,000 next year.
