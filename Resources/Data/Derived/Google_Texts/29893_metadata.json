Mark Pocan (D-WI) seems to have found Speaker Boehner\u2019s hubris hard to swallow today.\n\nOn the heels of Boehner\u2019s announcement that the Republican Party will be doing what it always does when a Democrat is in office \u2014 sue and try to impeach (after obstruction and ginning up scandals) \u2014 Pocan laughed in Boehner\u2019s face with a statement denouncing the Speaker for his historically lazy House that tried to shut the government down just last year.\n\n\u201cWith Speaker Boehner and the Tea Party at the helm, this Congress has failed to act on vital legislation to help improve the lives of Americans. The same Speaker who allowed the government to shut down last October, now intends to sue the President of the United States for acting while Congress has not, instead voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act 54 times and turning the tragedy in Benghazi into a manufactured scandal.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the least productive Congress in modern history \u2013 the so-called \u2018Do-nothing Congress\u2019 of 1948 \u2013 passed 350 bills in their first year; this Congress passed fewer than 100 bills in its first year. It is ironic the Speaker would sue the President for doing his job while the House of Representatives fails to do its job.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Boehner is allowing the Tea Party tail to wag the dog. It is clear he has chosen to be the Speaker for the extreme right-wing of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, this Republican controlled House of Representatives has no intention of actually governing and will continue to block any effort by President Obama at the expense of our constituents.\u201d\n\nIn July of 2013, I reported on the Double-Down-Do-Nothings for PoliticusUSA, \u201cYou might have thought the 112th Congress\u2019 historic low of 23 legislative items passed at this same last year was the epic fail, but you\u2019ll have to revise that. This 113th Congress has only passed 15 legislative items at the 6 month mark.\u201d None of the 15 legislative items were of any significance, either.\u201d\n\nMore about the Do-Nothings:\n\nThe 112th Congress made history as the most unproductive session since the 1940s (records only go back to 1947) for passing only 220 laws. For perspective, President Harry Truman labeled his Congress the \u201cDo-Nothing Congress\u201d for passing just 906 laws. I know math isn\u2019t exactly the forte of Republicans, but 15 versus half of 906 is pretty basic.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not both parties:\n\nBefore Republicans took over the House, we had the same level of movement in Congress as prior to Obama taking office. \u201cIn 2011, Congress passed just 90 bills into law. The only other year in which Congress failed to pass at least 125 laws was 1995,\u201d USA Today explained. That was another Democratic President, Bill Clinton, with a Republican Congress. \u201cWhen Democrats controlled both chambers during the 111th Congress, 258 laws were enacted in 2010 and 125 in 2009, including President Obama\u2019s health care law.\u201d\n\nOn January first, House Republican leadership unveiled the new House work calendar revealing that the House would only be in session for 97 days prior to Election Day and 112 days through the end of the year. That\u2019s a Do-Noting-Double-Down.\n\nAs Jason Easley pointed out earlier today, this lawsuit is all about impeachment proceedings against President Obama. Speaker Boehner denies this, but this is how the Clinton impeachment started. Boehner claims he\u2019s doing this to keep Obama from destroying the integrity of the office, but that claim is laughable given how Republicans rolled out the red carpet for Bush\u2019s gross expansion of executive branch power. It\u2019s okay when other presidents do it, but it\u2019s not okay when Obama does it.\n\nImage Credit: Alex Wong/Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat Mark Pocan denounced Speaker Boehner for his historically lazy House that tried to shut the government down just last year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Democrat Mark Pocan denounced Speaker Boehner for his historically lazy House that tried to shut the government down just last year.", "title": "Democrat Laughs in Do-Nothing John Boehner's Face For Suing Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/06/25/democrat-laughs-do-nothing-john-boehners-face-suing-obama-legislating.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-25-at-5.11.13-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-25T18:54:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Mark Pocan,John Boehner,lawsuit,President Obama,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-06-25T18:05:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T18:54:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7b7\"", "article_summary": "As Jason Easley pointed out earlier today, this lawsuit is all about impeachment proceedings against President Obama.\n\u201cIn fact, the least productive Congress in modern history \u2013 the so-called \u2018Do-nothing Congress\u2019 of 1948 \u2013 passed 350 bills in their first year; this Congress passed fewer than 100 bills in its first year.\nIt is clear he has chosen to be the Speaker for the extreme right-wing of the Republican Party.\nSpeaker Boehner denies this, but this is how the Clinton impeachment started.\n\u201cIn 2011, Congress passed just 90 bills into law."}
