His back hurts from an injury sustained in a fall from a bulldozer at work years ago. He has two rotator cuff tears that trouble his shoulder and gets cortisone injections in his knees to keep pain at bay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s mornings, days I can\u2019t hardly get up,\u201d he said, easing into a chair in his living room. But say the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d and Dixon bristles \u2014 even though he\u2019s covered by it.\n\nIt\u2019s a feeling he and other Kentucky voters will take to the ballot box in four weeks, when views about the Affordable Care Act help shape the tight Senate race between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is a lightning rod in Kentucky, even though the state had one of the most successful rollouts in the nation. Kentucky is the only Southern state to have both set up its own exchange and expand Medicaid. Nearly a year later, more than half a million residents have gotten coverage \u2014 making Kentucky a state with one of the largest drops in the number of uninsured, second only to Arkansas.\n\nLike so many others in eastern Kentucky\u2019s mining industry, Dixon lost his job in 2012. A combination of declining production, competition from cheaper coal fields and natural gas, and environmental regulation have slashed local jobs.\n\nWhen he was working, he earned a comfortable $90,000 to $97,000 a year.\n\n\u201cKind of ashamed to say it, but now I\u2019m on $300 a month food stamps,\u201d he said.\n\nLosing work meant losing health coverage. He and his 19-year-old son were uninsured for a year. Dixon\u2019s younger son was in high school, so he received state coverage, but the single father worried about not having a safety net for his older son and himself.\n\nThen the Affordable Care Act started, and Kentucky set up its own insurance exchange, called Kynect. Dixon signed up and qualified for a Medicaid plan. Once he was insured, he said, the first thing he did was get his back checked out.\n\nBut when asked if he supports \u201cObamacare,\u201d Dixon lets out a long sigh and fidgets in his chair. \u201cI don't know how to answer that,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things are left unsaid.\u201d\n\nAn NBC/Marist poll conducted in May found 57 percent of Kentuckians surveyed said they disliked \u201cObamacare.\u201d But when asked about Kynect, only 22 percent disapproved.\n\nAnd yet they\u2019re basically the same thing.\n\n\u201c\u2018Obamacare\u201d has been demonized by its opponents,\u201d said Al Cross, a journalism professor at the University of Kentucky. \u201cAnd it\u2019s easy to demonize because the first three syllables of the word are a word that most Kentuckians don't like.\u201d\n\nA September CNN/ORC poll shows 65 percent of registered Kentucky voters disapprove of President Barack Obama.\n\nDr. Sharon Colton works in Evarts, Kentucky, at the Clover Fork Clinic, which treats about 70 patients a day. She said many of her patients don\u2019t realize that Kynect is \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think some of them are just happy to have insurance, and however they got it, you know they\u2019re happy about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don't look at the politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do recall at least one patient who said, \u2018Well I don't want it, even if it is free,\u2019\u201d she added, \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t like President Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Affordable Care Act shapes tight Senate race, though both McConnell and Grimes skirt the issue", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/10/8/5-days-in-kentuckyobamacaresenaterace.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/10/8/5-days-in-kentuckyobamacaresenaterace/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.5days-kentucky-obamacare.1412805138580.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Affordable Care Act shapes tight Senate race, though both McConnell and Grimes skirt the issue", "title": "5 days in Kentucky: Insurance enrollment up; just don\u2019t say \u2018Obamacare\u2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/10/8/5-days-in-kentuckyobamacaresenaterace/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.5days-kentucky-obamacare.1412805138580.jpg", "description": "Affordable Care Act shapes tight Senate race, though both McConnell and Grimes skirt the issue", "card": "summary", "title": "5 days in Kentucky: Insurance enrollment up; just don\u2019t say \u2018Obamacare\u2019"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Kentucky, Election 2014, Obamacare, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But say the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d and Dixon bristles \u2014 even though he\u2019s covered by it.\nBut when asked if he supports \u201cObamacare,\u201d Dixon lets out a long sigh and fidgets in his chair.\nThen the Affordable Care Act started, and Kentucky set up its own insurance exchange, called Kynect.\n\u201c\u2018Obamacare\u201d has been demonized by its opponents,\u201d said Al Cross, a journalism professor at the University of Kentucky.\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is a lightning rod in Kentucky, even though the state had one of the most successful rollouts in the nation."}
