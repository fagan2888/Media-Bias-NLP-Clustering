Ted Cruz, R-Texas, generated a lot of social media about his stance on \"net neutrality,\" faster than the Road Runner. His YouTube video, \u201cThe negative consequences of net neutrality explained in 2 minutes,\u201d offered a well-produced, but somewhat simplistic, response to Democratic Minnesota Sen. Al Franken\u2019s turgid attack on Cruz\u2019s knowledge of the issue.\n\nCruz argues that the Communications Act of 1934, the interpretation of which is at the heart of this debate, was meant to regulate landline phones not smartphones or broadband. The senator makes some good points, although his smartphone metaphor doesn\u2019t apply; the cellphone industry would be exempt from a public utility approach.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Republicans]\n\nCruz\u2019s video targets the public, but it really doesn\u2019t matter what they think. This is an \"inside-the-Beltway\" conversation over which industry shapes the future of the Internet. Consumers have been excluded from the conversation. No one has yet to explain to them succinctly how the status quo or net neutrality (the assumption that all types of data on the Internet are treated equally by Internet service providers) will affect their wallets. Yes \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of talk about innovation and a free and open Internet, but it\u2019s mostly ambiguous rhetoric. Whatever opinion John Q. Public has about net neutrality, it\u2019s probably the one his political party told him to take, not one arrived at through informed thought.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made lots of noise when he recently made his big statement about net neutrality. Whatever he said doesn\u2019t matter either. Not because there isn\u2019t some substance to his argument, too, but because he surreptitiously gave himself an out from the start. He said that the decision is ultimately the Federal Communications Commission's alone, which isn\u2019t true. He could put this issue to bed now by issuing an executive order. He is the chief executive. Presidents use executive orders, which are a component of their statutory and constitutional powers, to tell federal agencies how they want laws interpreted. He\u2019s done this in the past, not only with his Affordable Care Act mandates, which where much bigger political footballs than this one, but also in presidential executive order 13616, in which he ordered the FCC to speed up expanding broadband to underserved communities.\n\n[READ: The Future of the Internet Is at Stake]\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is tasked with hammering out a deal, but, according to an Appinions study many of the most influential people and companies in the conversation are the opponents of net neutrality.
