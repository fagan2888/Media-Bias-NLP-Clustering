While \u201cThe Theory of Everything Star\u201d Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor over Michael Keaton, it hardly came as a major upset, having been widely deemed a two-man race that could go either way. \u201cBoyhood,\u201d meanwhile, came home with nothing except Patricia Arquette\u2019s Best Supporting Actress win. Neither Linklater nor I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had won the Oscar before, although I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had four nominations under his belt (Linklater has one, for Best Adapted Screenplay for \u201cBefore Sunset.\u201d)\n\nWhile \u201cBoyhood\u201d shot out of the gate early, \u201cBirdman\u201d had been picking up steam lately, taking home the top prize at the Producers Guild, Directors Guild, SAG Awards and Spirit Awards (although \u201cBoyhood\u201d triumphed at the BAFTAs). Yet despite the close race, some critics were remarkably prescient about \u201cBirdman\u201d\u2018s sweep. As Grantland\u2019s Mark Harris wrote, a \u201cBirdman\u201d victory would be much in line with the Academy\u2019s preferences as of late, pointing out that it would be the third time in four years \u201cthat people who make movies have given top honors to a movie about people who make movies\u201d (along with \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cArgo\u201d). Taking up Harris\u2019 point, Salon critic Andrew O\u2019Hehir observed that the Academy tends to reward films that hold a mirror up to the grand struggles of the film industry, saying that \u201cself-regarding movies about the greatness and craziness and triumph and tragedy of those who make movies have become the new Oscar norm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Richard Linklater\u2019s 12-year coming-of-age epic went home mostly empty-handed VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBirdman\u201d trumps \u201cBoyhood\u201d at the Oscars", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Richard Linklater\u2019s 12-year coming-of-age epic went home mostly empty-handed VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBirdman\u201d trumps \u201cBoyhood\u201d at the Oscars", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/23/birdman_trumps_boyhood_at_the_oscars/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/AP773214545037-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Richard Linklater\u2019s 12-year coming-of-age epic went home mostly empty-handed VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBirdman\u201d trumps \u201cBoyhood\u201d at the Oscars", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/AP773214545037-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birdman, Boyhood, Hollywood, Movies, oscars 2015, The Academy Awards, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9d2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Birdman, Boyhood, Hollywood, Movies, oscars 2015, The Academy Awards, Video, Entertainment NewsThe big narrative going into tonight\u2019s ceremony was \u201cBoyhood\u201d vs. \u201cBirdman.\u201d And now the Academy has spoken, with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s sly dark comedy about the world of showbiz taking home Best Picture over Linklater\u2019s 12-year coming-of-age epic.\nWhile \u201cThe Theory of Everything Star\u201d Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor over Michael Keaton, it hardly came as a major upset, having been widely deemed a two-man race that could go either way.\n\u201cBoyhood,\u201d meanwhile, came home with nothing except Patricia Arquette\u2019s Best Supporting Actress win.\nIn addition to winning best picture, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu also won for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, two categories many critics had gone into the ceremony saying were too close to call.\n\u201cBirdman\u201d cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki \u2014 who also won for last year\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d \u2014 took home the prize for Best Cinematography (no surprise, considering the film was shot in a masterful single take)."}
