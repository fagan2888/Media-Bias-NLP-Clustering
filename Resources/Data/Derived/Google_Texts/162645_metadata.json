And now, vulnerable Democrats like Rep. Joe Garcia (D-Fla.) who once supported the Affordable Care Act have figured out just how to run on Obamacare \u2014 by placing the blame for the healthcare law\u2019s failure on the White House.\n\nGarcia, who was elected to represent Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional district in 2012, was an ardent supporter of the president\u2019s healthcare law and touted the \u201cmany benefits to this legislation\u201d while campaigning. And while Democrats seeking reelection in the 2014 midterms have begun distancing themselves from Obamacare in the midst of its disastrous implementation, the House Majority PAC \u2014 a political action committee supported by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 released an ad supporting Garcia\u2019s attempts to fix the law, while passing the buck for its failures on to the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cJoe Garcia is working to fix Obamacare. He voted to let you keep your existing health plan and took the White House to task for the disastrous healthcare website,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says, taking a shot at the president\u2019s \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d lie.\n\nThe ad continues, referencing Garcia\u2019s votes to \u201chold insurance companies accountable\u201d in covering patients with pre-existing conditions \u2014 a measure already ensured by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough the Florida Democrat wasn\u2019t in office when Obamacare was passed in 2010, he praised the law for including provisions that \u201cprohibit lifetime limits on care,\u201d Garcia\u2019s campaign website states, and criticized Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) for refusing federal funds to implement the law and failing to expand Medicaid.\n\nAs the midterms elections grow closer, Pelosi\u2019s House Majority PAC has made a point to assert the Obamacare train wreck is not a result of House Democrats\u2019 actions, but rather the Obama administration\u2019s. The organization released an ad last month on behalf of Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) criticizing the federal healthcare exchange\u2019s \u201cstunning ineptitude\u201dand highlighted her attempts to fix the broken law.\n\nWhile Republicans have seized to opportunity to highlight Obamacare\u2019s failures thus far, it looks like the White House is going to have to play defense against Democrats, too.\n\nWatch Garcia\u2019s ad below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Democrats facing tough reelections have taken to distancing themselves from President Barack Obama, opting to pass on the campaigner-in-chief's help on the campaign trail.
