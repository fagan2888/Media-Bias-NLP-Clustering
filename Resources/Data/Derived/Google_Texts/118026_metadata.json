Nine hours of bonding with three movers. Two days of unpacking and furniture arranging (uhh, before you put that down, could we try the armoire upstairs?). Ten broken fingernails, two Band-Aids, 12 Advil and one ice pack.\n\nAnd I\u2019m in my new home.\n\nNot only that, the new place \u2014 another home I\u2019ve staged to sell \u2014 was show-ready 48 hours after the movers drove off. It\u2019s detailed down to the vegetable bin. I have the circles under my eyes to prove it.\n\nIf I\u2019ve done my job right, the buyers will never suspect the sweat and swearing that took place offstage. To them, the place will look as if it fell into place as effortlessly as snow on a winter\u2019s evening.\n\nExcept it didn\u2019t.\n\nLike every home, this one had its decorating challenges. The 100-year-old Southern-plantation-style house came partly furnished.\n\nCertain rooms, I was instructed, were to stay furnished as they were. Others I was to decorate with my stuff. Thus, my skills were tested as I tried to make two styles, as different as New York and southern France, blend.\n\nThe home came with midcentury-modern pieces, sleek black and clean-lined, and accents of deep chocolate brown and aqua.\n\nMy d\u00e9cor leans Old-World European, and mixes warm wood tones with golds, burgundies and peacock blue.\n\nI like both looks and color palettes a lot. I just wasn\u2019t sure how well I would like them together. How would my brown dining table\u2019s curved, carved legs appear alongside black, straight-lined pieces?\n\nI was about to find out.\n\nI knew I was in treacherous waters. Many designers have told me that the hardest design style to pull off is not contemporary, traditional, ethnic or rustic. It\u2019s eclectic.\n\n\u201cWhy is this so hard?\u201d I asked Chicago designer Bill Godley, who\u2019s been pulling together sophisticated eclectic looks for decades.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s easy to make an eclectic interior look like a mishmash,\u201d said Godley. \u201cBut it\u2019s also my favorite style, because you can create a look that no one else can imitate.\u201d\n\nGetting my space to work took more trial and error than usual, but when a combination worked, it made each of the pieces involved look more interesting.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

Key in every interior, getting scale and proportion right is especially important in eclectic rooms. Scale matters both in how the pieces relate to the room and to one another.\n\n2. Play up contrasts. It\u2019s better to be really different in feel, time period or style than just a little off. For instance, under a slick, black-framed contemporary mirror, I put a distressed, white wood table with curved legs. Godley agreed it was a good move. \u201cClean lines in contemporary pieces mix very well with more ornate pieces.\u201d He gave the example of a cabinet he got in Thailand. It\u2019s heavily carved, embedded with shiny stones. He also has a mirror in a similar style. \u201cI would never, never put that mirror with that chest,\u201d he said. Instead, he pairs the chest with a contemporary Venetian mirror.\n\n3. Blend pieces throughout the house. Mix it up in every room. \u201cOtherwise, you look like a furniture store \u2014 and that\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Godley.\n\n4. Balance the mix. You can have three pieces of Chinese furniture, three modern and three Italian provincial, as long as the mix is balanced. \u201cYou have to really feel the overall ambience, and be sure the mix is evenly distributed,\u201d Godley said. In other words, don\u2019t cluster pieces from each style in their own area. Pile the Chinese brocade pillows on the black, boxy sofa next to the Italian end tables.\n\n5. Find the common thread. This is often color, which can be a great equalizer. The existing d\u00e9cor I moved into had a lot of aqua tones; much of my furniture has greenish-blue tones, too. I played up those shades with art and accessories to help unify the space.\n\n6. Pull back. Though it\u2019s always important to have well-edited accessories, it\u2019s even more important in an eclectic interior to have fewer pieces that make a big statement, that emphasize lines and that don\u2019t just fill spaces. Mix looks in accessories, too. Put modern beside rustic.\n\n7. Build bridges. Leather works in almost any interior and is a great transition fabric, said Godley. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with putting leather on a period piece once covered in velvet to create contrast within the piece itself.\u201d Pillows can also work as glue in a room. \u201cI\u2019ve done rooms where pillows are the main item that pulls the space together,\u201d he said.\n\n8. Break out. \u201cYou see these cookie-cutter rooms all over suburban America, where those doing the interiors would never deviate from one style, because it\u2019s so much easier,\u201d said Godley. \u201cI know that sounds harsh, but it\u2019s just so boring.\u201d At least no one can say I\u2019m boring.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Home design: 8 ways to make eclectic style look deliberate", "title": "Home design: 8 ways to make eclectic style look deliberate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/home-design-8-ways-to-make-eclectic-style-look-deliberate/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_C3_FE14AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_C3_FE14AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T04:15:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:02:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ff0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause it\u2019s easy to make an eclectic interior look like a mishmash,\u201d said Godley.\n\u201cClean lines in contemporary pieces mix very well with more ornate pieces.\u201d He gave the example of a cabinet he got in Thailand.\nTo them, the place will look as if it fell into place as effortlessly as snow on a winter\u2019s evening.\nKey in every interior, getting scale and proportion right is especially important in eclectic rooms.\n8 ways to make it workThough tricky to pull off, eclectic interiors work with these guidelines, says Chicago designer Bill Godley."}
