A new PAC formed in March is raising money to \u201celect men and women with integrity to elected office in the state of Idaho,\u201d of which Otter apparently isn\u2019t one.\n\nIn an open letter published on its Facebook page, the Integrity in Government PAC echoes Beck\u2019s accusation that Otter has strayed from his earlier conservative commitments, claiming the governor \u201cis not the man [they] once supported,\u201d and he \u201cno longer supports conservative principles.\u201d\n\nRecently, the Idaho Statesman provided a brief history of the PAC\u2019s formation:\n\nLee Ann Callear, the PAC\u2019s chair, is an Idaho Republican Party executive committee member and Region 2 chairwoman. She formed the PAC with three other central Idaho residents and Doyle Beck of Idaho Falls, who is the Bonneville County Republican Party chairman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d said Callear, of Ahsahka. \u201cI\u2019m trying to expose some of the things that I think are corrupt in Idaho government, just like Butch Otter saying that our economy is in such good shape, and I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nSince it formed in March, the PAC had raised just under $20,000, mostly from out-of-state individuals and couples, but also including $2,000 from the Idaho County Republican Central Committee and $1,700 from the Clearwater County Republican Central Committee.\n\nThen, in the past week, the Integrity in Government PAC suddenly raised $107,000 in nine big donations, six of those from residents of the Idaho Falls area, including two-time GOP congressional candidate and longtime John Birch Society organizer Chick Heileson, and the other three from Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people,\u201d Callear said. \u201cThey want to send it to someone who\u2019s honest, and I do have that reputation.\u201d She added that she hopes to \u201ccounter some of the big money that is coming from the lobbyists.\u201d\n\nThe PAC\u2019s letter outlines 12 \u201cserious allegations\u201d against Otter and provides short summaries of the governor\u2019s blameworthy actions. Although many of the charges pertain to matters particular to Idaho, there are three of them that merit mention here as they touch and concern the Constitution and the underlying principle of federalism.\n\n\u201cFederal Dependency Grows Under Otter, Rejects State Sovereignty\u201d is the second of Integrity in Government\u2019s list of Otter\u2019s sins against the Republican Party and is the first of the three we will report.\n\nAccording to information provided by the group, during the Butch Otter administration, Idaho \u201cis more dependent on the federal government than ever before.\u201d Citing figures published by the Idaho Freedom Foundation, the PAC claims, \u201cSince 2003, the state\u2019s reliance on the federal government has grown 82 percent, and the state now uses federal money to sustain more than 440 government programs.\u201d\n\nOtter, the group, insists, has promised to address the imbalance, but has done nothing to fulfill those promises.\n\nThe Integrity in Government PAC makes a very timely and damning allegation, especially given the recent events in neighboring Nevada and the federal government\u2019s effort to seize control of lands located within that state. The PAC\u2019s letter reads:\n\nOtter also appears quite comfortable with the federal government\u2019s control over state land. Other states, including Utah, have specifically called for states to assert their control over the land inside their borders. Idaho Republicans have passed a resolution in support of states controlling their own land. Otter even attended a meeting of the state Republican Central Committee, asking state GOP officials to support state control of public lands. Otter is an outlier. He said such an idea is a bad one, and instead and wants to work out a deal where Idaho gets to be property managers for the federal government. In other words, we\u2019d get to do the federal government\u2019s bidding for land that remains locked up and underutilized.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see how such serious accusations, if proven true, could cause trouble for Otter in this era of federal overreach and attempts at ownership over millions of acres of Western land.\n\nThe next violation of the Republican Party\u2019s trust as asserted by Integrity in Government PAC is: \u201cOtter Opposes the Free Market, Supports Corporate Welfare.\u201d Specifically, the organization reports: \"In 2014, his administration brought another bill to give a tax break ... to businesses that hire 20 new employees in rural areas or 50 new employees in urban areas. His crony friends in the Department of Commerce will get to decide whether businesses are deserving or not of the tax break.\"\n\nAnd, it gets worse: \"In 2014, Otter signed into law a bill that gives a rebate to Big Hollywood for bringing a production here. That means liberals like Bill Mahr [sic], Michael Moore and Chris Matthews can get some of your money if they decide to do work in Idaho!\"\n\nThe last of the \u201cbetrayals\u201d committed by Governor Otter, as chronicled by the PAC, is perhaps the most serious: \u201cOtter Supports Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRelating a story that has unfortunately been told in several states, Integrity in Government PAC reports that despite having originally supported a bill nullifying the \u201coptional\u201d provisions of ObamaCare within the Gem State (HB 298), when the legislature sent the measure to his desk for signing, Otter vetoed it!\n\nThere was, however, the PAC claims, more to the deception than just a broken promise and a veto. \"While Otter was talking up nullification in his State of the State, his budget for that same year called for the Department of Insurance to collect $2.5 million from the federal government to start putting the insurance exchange in place.\"\n\nAlthough Otter struggled to get his planned ObamaCare exchange approved by members of his own party, he reportedly worked with Democrats to push the proposal through the legislature. This perfidy made Idaho \u201cthe only Republican-controlled state to implement an Obamacare insurance exchange.\"\n\nAfter making these condemning allegations of self-dealing and unalloyed betrayal of his party and his principles, Integrity in Government PAC insists that the letter containing those charges was \u201cdifficult to write\u201d as Butch Otter was \u201ca friend of [theirs] for many years.\u201d\n\nThe point is, the PAC explains, not what Otter was, but what he is. \u201cThe governor that we have today is not the same man who stood up against Big Government, who stood up against the Federal government. We\u2019re not sure when the change occurred, or why it occurred or when. It does not matter. But it is up to us to recognize that something has happened, and it affects our vote.\u201d\n\nOtter\u2019s 40 years in elective office is long enough, the group adds, and calls on Idahoans to \u201cconsider fresh, Republican conservative leadership.\u201d\n\nJudging from the substantial quotes published on the PAC\u2019s Facebook page, it appears they believe State Senator Russ Fulcher represents the GOP\u2019s hope for a governor who will remain true to conservative principles.\n\nAs of press time, with 871 of 942 precincts reporting, Governor Otter leads Fulcher by a margin of nearly nine percentage points. The Idaho Statesman has called the race for Otter, quoting a political science professor who said, \u201cThe Idaho GOP establishment seems to be the big winner.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper reports that other key GOP incumbents retained their seats, with Idaho\u2019s Republicans apparently \u201csatisfied with the status quo.\n\nJoe A.
