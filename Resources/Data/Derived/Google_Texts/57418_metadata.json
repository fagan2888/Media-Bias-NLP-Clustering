Her disappearance set off a massive search on the part of the community and her parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer. The Spierers have repeatedly asked her friends to step forward with any information they have about her disappearance, and went so far as to file a civil lawsuit in hopes the court would compel them to talk.\n\nIn October 2014, Judge Tanya Walton Pratt decided to toss out the lawsuit naming defendants Corey Rossman and Jason Rosenbaum. The Spierers claimed the men were negligent and failed in their \u201cduty of care\u201d to their daughter, knowing she was intoxicated while continuing to provide her with alcohol and failing to make sure she returned home safely. The federal appeals court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision to throw out the lawsuit in a decision handed down Friday.\n\n\u201cWe have found no decisions under Indiana law where persons were held liable for the actions of their social peers, absent additional factors not present here,\u201d the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in its decision.\n\n\u201cBecause he was with Lauren the majority of the evening and bought drinks for her, Rossman was nearest to assuming a duty to care for her,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cBut he also appears to have been intoxicated\u2014so much so that it is questionable whether he could effectively take care of himself, still less another person.\u201d\n\nCharlene Spierer provided a statement to CBS4 about the decision.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the decision but not deterred. We continue our search for answers and justice for Lauren,\u201d Spierer wrote.\n\nRead the ruling here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(Aug. 14, 2015) \u2013 A federal appeals court upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the parents of missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer against the men she was last seen with on the night she disappeared.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "description": "(Aug. 14, 2015) \u2013 A federal appeals court upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the parents of missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer against the men she was last\u2026", "title": "Appeals court affirms decision to toss out lawsuit filed by parents of missing IU student Lauren Spierer", "url": "http://cbs4indy.com/2015/08/14/appeals-court-affirms-decision-to-toss-out-lawsuit-filed-by-parents-of-missing-iu-student-lauren-spierer/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/lauren-spierer-1.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/lauren-spierer-1.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@cbs4indy", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs4indy"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get your Indianpolis news, weather, sports, contests, broadcast schedule, community events, and station profile from Indy's CBS affiliate CBS4Indy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "fb": {"pages": 315510655359}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://cbs4indy.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7952da63e73906af73d23febaa4f6da0?s=16", "application-name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy", "published_time": "2015-08-14T18:32:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T19:26:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "97DFOe8LA-RusExwUtjGnPNTbFPxcebeoCtXwJNFDNg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce059\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Appeals court affirms decision to toss out lawsuit filed by parents of missing IU student Lauren Spierer(Aug. 14, 2015) \u2013 A federal appeals court upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the parents of missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer against the men she was last seen with on the night she disappeared.\nThe federal appeals court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision to throw out the lawsuit in a decision handed down Friday.\nWe continue our search for answers and justice for Lauren,\u201d Spierer wrote.\nHer disappearance set off a massive search on the part of the community and her parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer.\nIn October 2014, Judge Tanya Walton Pratt decided to toss out the lawsuit naming defendants Corey Rossman and Jason Rosenbaum."}
