Follow him on Twitter: @CarlosLozadaWP.\n\nThe Stranger Barack Obama in the White House By Chuck Todd Little, Brown & Co. 518 pp. $29.\n\nChuck Todd is not just invariably described as a political junkie \u2014 he is invariably described as being invariably described as a political junkie. When NBC News announced that Todd would take over the moderator\u2019s chair on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d profiles gushed about his love for political minutiae. This is the guy, after all, who as host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d reported on the White House soup of the day . Every day.\n\nBut now Todd has written a thick book devoted to understanding the man in the Oval Office, or as Todd explains, \u201cwho Barack Obama is and who he isn\u2019t, what he strives to be and what he actually is.\u201d Finally, a chance for the smart chronicler of in-the-moment politics to think big and reveal what the presidency that he has covered from the beginning really means.\n\n\"The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House\" by Chuck Todd (Little, Brown/Little, Brown)\n\nExcept it\u2019s a chance he passes up. \u201cThe Stranger\u201d is not an evolution of the Chuck Todd brand but a celebration of it. Todd has written a daily rundown of the Obama presidency, with every moment, critical or trivial, assessed by its political weight. That approach works for a morning cable-news show, but stretched over 500 pages, its limits become clear. This book, though critical of the president, reveals less about Obama than about what the world looks like through the eyes of a writer for whom politics is not just everything, it is the only thing.\n\nAs for the title conceit: Todd perceives Obama as a stranger to Washington, analytical more than ideological; a successful politician who is almost arrogant in his disdain for the personal demands of retail politics; a nuance guy in an all-or-nothing town. The result of this mismatch is that Obama, who seemed to promise an era of post-partisanship, has presided over \u201ca nadir of partisan relations.\u201d\n\nThat is a reasonable view; it\u2019s just not a particularly novel one. It\u2019s been the rap on Obama for a while. And in \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d that argument feels grafted onto the opening and closing chapters, a dutiful analysis bookending Todd\u2019s blow-by-blow of the Obama years.\n\nEach chapter coincides roughly with a crisis Obama has faced, starting with the Great Recession. Todd dwells on the internal disputes between the White House\u2019s econ geeks and its political advisers, and on the legislative strategizing to get the stimulus bill passed. He loves to tell us what was in people\u2019s minds during meetings: \u201cThis is going to be politically tough,\u201d senior political adviser David Axelrod thinks in a key early discussion of the stimulus package, while White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ponders \u201chow the response to the economic crisis could be used for maximum political gain.\u201d Todd appears most interested in the \u201coptics\u201d of the stimulus and why Obama failed to gain more than token GOP support for it. \u201cHe had signed a stimulus bill that would give Republicans every excuse they needed to accuse him of exploding the deficit,\u201d Todd writes. \u201cFar from drawing up a truly bipartisan bill, Obama would claim the veneer of bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nTodd boils down the administration\u2019s debate over troop levels in Afghanistan \u2014 another early decision for the president \u2014 to bureaucratic sniping between the Pentagon and the White House and whether \u201cthe generals were trying to roll the civilians.\u201d Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Vice President Biden disagreed on \u201calmost everything,\u201d explains Todd, but he suggests that Biden\u2019s opposition to troop increases may have been less out of conviction and more of a good cop/bad cop ploy to expand Obama\u2019s options. And remember Obama\u2019s 2002 speech calling the impending Iraq invasion a \u201cdumb\u201d war? Turns out that was not a principled stand but a \u201cpolitical bet\u201d he made, Todd explains, one that \u201cturned out to be correct\u201d when Obama ran for president.\n\nThe 2010 BP oil spill gets similarly narrow treatment. \u201cNo crisis inspired more fear in the White House than the oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d Todd writes. Yet, after devoting a couple of paragraphs to the disaster response \u2014 briefings, conference calls and \u201cthe impressive feat\u201d of plugging the leak \u2014 Todd reverts to the politics of the spill, including the internal debate over whether Obama should show anger and how his Oval Office speech couldn\u2019t compete with the video of oil still gushing. And, of course, there were the electoral implications: \u201cThe oil spill took the president off the fundraising circuit,\u201d Todd frets, and the Democratic Party was \u201cknocked off message at one of the most critical periods of the 2010 campaign.\u201d\n\nEven the killing of Osama bin Laden becomes less about its impact on the war on terrorism and more about the disagreements within the administration over how much credit to take and information to share with the public. \u201cThe race to disclose details reflected the mind-set of the White House at that period,\u201d Todd says, \u201cwhen Obama\u2019s approval ratings were middling at best and his prospects for re-election looked shaky.\u201d\n\nSometimes Todd\u2019s blinders help. A chapter evocatively titled \u201cThey Were First-Graders\u201d does more than lament the brutality of Newtown; it deconstructs the politics of gun control and emphasizes how the NRA\u2019s real power resides not in its sway over the far right but in its pull with pro-gun Democrats. And Todd\u2019s recap of the HealthCare.gov debacle shows how the multiplicity of managers involved in the project didn\u2019t absolve Obama from failing to assign one person sole responsibility for making the site work.\n\nBut more often than not, the political focus is jarring. In a chapter called \u201cIf He Had a Son,\u201d referring to Obama\u2019s emotional remarks about Trayvon Martin, Todd examines Obama\u2019s role in America\u2019s race debates. But after recounting the 2009 \u201cBeer Summit\u201d and the president\u2019s reactions to Martin\u2019s killing and the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Todd inexplicably devotes the bulk of the chapter to Obama\u2019s running squabbles with congressional Republicans. Todd briefly notes that \u201cthe Trayvon experience was a turning point for Obama,\u201d and that his initiative to help vulnerable young black men, called My Brother\u2019s Keeper, will be a big part of his post-presidential years. But surely there is more to explore on the subject of Obama, race and the presidency?\n\nTodd\u2019s attempts to peer deep inside Obama as an individual don\u2019t take us far. \u201cAs is the case for many Americans, the president\u2019s unusual upbringing shaped him to be the person he is today,\u201d is not an encouraging start. Todd makes much of the fact that Obama\u2019s mother was an anthropologist, which somehow transmitted to her only son \u201cinstinctive observational skills that allowed him to read and understand folks better than most politicians.\u201d At the same time, being biracial \u201cinfused in him the temperament and patience that have marked his presidency both positively and negatively.\u201d As a politician, Obama is described as \u201cpassive and arrogant,\u201d and at times he is \u201call telescope and zero microscope.\u201d\n\nThe author\u2019s focus on personality strays, inevitably, into the grievances among high-level staffers and party players. For readers keeping score at home: Anita Dunn and Robert Gibbs didn\u2019t have \u201ca lot of love lost,\u201d Joe Biden didn\u2019t get along with David Plouffe, Gibbs clashed with Valerie Jarrett, Bill Clinton could barely bring himself to look at David Axelrod (though they reconciled later), and Rahm Emanuel was at odds with Gibbs. (Seriously, did anyone like Gibbs?) There is bickering over job titles, too, because \u201ctitles always matter with Beltway types,\u201d Todd explains. It\u2019s true: The book cover features the words \u201cModerator of Meet the Press and former NBC News Chief White House Correspondent\u201d under Todd\u2019s name.\n\nAs befitting a political junkie chronicle, the book is generous with political cliches. Throughout \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d field days are had, rocky shoals are navigated, skies pose limits, writing appears on walls, fuel is added to fires, dies are cast, and collective sighs of relief are breathed. And there are sentences like this one: \u201cEarly on, there were signs the Republicans wouldn\u2019t follow the presidential Pied Piper to postpartisanship.\u201d\n\nSo, if not post-partisanship, what does Todd see as the legacy of a man who wants to be known as much more than America\u2019s first black president? On matters such as Middle East stability or the long-term impact of Obamacare, Todd offers a lot of time-will-tells and history-will-decides. The one thing he is certain of, however, is Obama\u2019s impact on the practice of politics. This president has transformed \u201cthe way campaigns are run and elections are won,\u201d Todd writes, both in the technology deployed and dollars spent. Obama also leaves behind a more ideologically unified Democratic Party and an \u201cunassailable\u201d Democratic coalition, based on minority voters and newly empowered interest groups. Even though that coalition looks slightly more assailable after Tuesday\u2019s midterms, Todd makes clear that for the president and his entourage, \u201cthe Obama brand and the Democratic Party brand were distinct, and . . . one was paramount over the other.\u201d\n\nTodd is most insightful in such moments, when politics is truly the only relevant subject. His retelling of the 2012 campaign spans everything from the Romney camp\u2019s flawed strategy for television ad buys to Obama\u2019s lethargic preparation for the first debate. He also unspools the confrontational, co-dependent relationship between Obama and the Clintons (frankly, I would read a book just about that). And Todd even plays media critic, pinning the early \u201cfawning coverage\u201d of Obama on baby boomer editors excited at the prospect of a black president, as well as noting that Fox News and his own MSNBC are both \u201cpartisan cable networks that catered to specific ideologies.\u201d I wonder what his colleagues will think of that one.\n\nDuring Todd\u2019s farewell segment on \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d in August, he made a passionate defense of political obsessiveness. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a political junkie, I don\u2019t run away from that,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cBut my love for politics is because I love our democracy. To some who have mistaken my love for politics as simply loving a game . . . they don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s the most important game our country is involved with, every day.\u201d\n\nThat may be. But \u201cThe Stranger\u201d doesn\u2019t prove his case. It\u2019s all microscope and zero telescope.\n\ncarlos.lozada@washpost.com\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFive myths about Barack Obama\n\nIf this article offends you, I\u2019m sorry\n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste at Yale\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "chuck todd book, obama meet the press, chuck todd meet the press, the daily rundown, obama syria, obamacare, obama bin laden, bin laden raid, obama stimulus bill, chuck todd the stranger, the stranger book chuck todd, chuck todd obama book, chuck todd new book, books about obama", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s new book examines the politics behind the Obama White House\u2019s every move.", "title": "Chuck Todd\u2019s daily rundown of the Obama presidency", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chuck-todds-daily-rundown-of-the-obama-presidency/2014/11/06/b5667b36-637a-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/11/03/National-Politics/Images/chucktoddipadbackground.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CarlosLozadaWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chuck-todds-daily-rundown-of-the-obama-presidency/2014/11/06/b5667b36-637a-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "chuck todd book, obama meet the press, chuck todd meet the press, the daily rundown, obama syria, obamacare, obama bin laden, bin laden raid, obama stimulus bill, chuck todd the stranger, the stranger book chuck todd, chuck todd obama book, chuck todd new book, books about obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b5667b36-637a-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s new book examines the politics behind the Obama White House\u2019s every move."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe235c\"", "article_summary": "This is the guy, after all, who as host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d reported on the White House soup of the day .\n\"The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House\" by Chuck Todd (Little, Brown/Little, Brown)Except it\u2019s a chance he passes up.\nTodd has written a daily rundown of the Obama presidency, with every moment, critical or trivial, assessed by its political weight.\nThe Stranger Barack Obama in the White House By Chuck Todd Little, Brown & Co. 518 pp.\nDuring Todd\u2019s farewell segment on \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d in August, he made a passionate defense of political obsessiveness."}
