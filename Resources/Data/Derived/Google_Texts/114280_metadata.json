He has worn the uniform of nine other teams and had two stops each with the Rockies, Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nWright was back in Coors Field this past weekend as a member of the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen, where he has proved to be an effective setup man (3-2, 3.24 ERA in 41 \u2154 innings).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little older and a little wiser,\u201d Wright said when asked about first joining the big leagues with the Rockies. \u201cI wish I knew then what I know now.\u201d\n\nWhen Wright came to the big leagues, Coors Field had opened the year before, and Todd Helton made his debut in the majors a year later. The Rockies\u2019 scouting department, directed by Pat Daugherty, selected Wright in the first round of the 1993 draft. The 6-foot-6 right-hander climbed through the farm system, arriving at age 21.\n\nDid the needs of an expansion team cause him to be rushed to the big leagues?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI had pitched pretty well in Double-A (New Haven) and in Colorado Springs. I was ready. The same thing would have happened if I had been with any other team.\u201d\n\nHe tuned up with a 5-1 record and 0.81 ERA in seven starts at New Haven and a 4-2 mark and 2.72 ERA in nine starts in Triple-A.\n\nWright made 91 starts in his first stint with the Rockies before being traded to Milwaukee after the 1999 season. The Rockies brought him back in 2004-05, and he made 41 more starts. At one point in Rockies history, Wright ranked second only to Pedro Astacio in starts and innings pitched. Wright still holds the franchise record for career pickoffs with 33.\n\nBut overall, Wright is less than pleased with his Rockies career. He was 30-52 overall, and no team he played on with the Rockies won more than 83 games.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have done better,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is where it all started. This is where I learned to pitch. The first time I was here is kind of a blur. I was so young. It\u2019s a tough place to pitch, and it will turn you from a boy to a man really quick. You learn quickly that major-league hitters are a lot bigger and stronger. But I don\u2019t make excuses for my time here. There have been pitchers here who were paid a lot more than I was paid, and they didn\u2019t do any better.\u201d\n\nWright still looks at Colorado as his major-league home.\n\n\u201cI love pitching here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite ballpark. The fans are great. Although it has all changed, I still know who plays on their team and I pull for them. It\u2019s my baseball home.\u201d\n\nWright\u2019s career changed in 2008 when the Texas Rangers converted him into a relief pitcher. He had been struggling as a starter. He has since thrived as a reliever, with several of the best ERAs of his career, including a career-best 3.09 in 2013.\n\nHow much longer will Wright pitch?\n\n\u201cAs long as I have a uniform and my wife lets me,\u201d he said.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss\n\nWright bio\n\nBorn: Dec. 24, 1974, in Oklahoma City\n\nHigh school: Westmore in Moore, Okla.\n\nCollege: None\n\nFamily: Wife Marnie, daughter Presley, sons Jett and Cash\n\nHobbies: Family duty in offseason\n\nLooking ahead: Staying in uniform\n\nResidence: Dallas", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fb9\"", "article_summary": "There are more than just the 19 years of his major-league career that verify pitcher Jamey Wright\u2019s legacy.\nBut overall, Wright is less than pleased with his Rockies career.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little older and a little wiser,\u201d Wright said when asked about first joining the big leagues with the Rockies.\nWright made 91 starts in his first stint with the Rockies before being traded to Milwaukee after the 1999 season.\nAt one point in Rockies history, Wright ranked second only to Pedro Astacio in starts and innings pitched."}
