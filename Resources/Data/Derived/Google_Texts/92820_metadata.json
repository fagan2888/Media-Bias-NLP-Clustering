The two agencies have related mandates: the FDA approves drugs and devices that have proven to be \u201csafe and effective,\u201d while CMS authorizes coverage on products that are \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d\n\nProduct sponsors, particularly those of medical devices, have been frustrated by the delays that result because each agency has a different set of required evidentiary standards. The brief focuses on two initiatives\u2014parallel review and coverage with evidence development (CED)\u2014which have the potential to address this bottleneck.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Background?\n\nThe brief details the two review processes. The FDA conducts its review among the narrow population of clinical trial participants. CMS, however, wants a product to benefit the more diverse and varied universe of Medicare patients. The brief explains how the CED initiative, which first began in 1995, can bridge this gap by providing temporary reimbursement for beneficiaries enrolled in clinical studies. Parallel review, launched in 2011 as a pilot program, seeks to shorten the review timeline through increased communication among sponsors, the FDA, and CMS. Devices must meet certain eligibility criteria, outlined in the brief.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Debate?\n\nFor both programs, CMS resources hold the key to fuller implementation. The Coverage and Analysis Group within CMS, which oversees both programs, has lost about half its staffing since 2007, leading to a reduction in the overall number of national coverage determinations. The brief explains why the two programs have so far failed to reach their potential. For example, some manufacturers remain reluctant to focus their data collection on Medicare\u2019s requirements, while others call for reforms to the program\u2019s eligibility standards.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe future of both parallel review and CED is uncertain, but, as the brief points out, CMS and the FDA may extend a modified version of parallel review. Current and future budget cuts at CMS and related agencies, and the current political environment, make their future continuation highly questionable, as the brief further explains.\n\nAbout Health Policy Briefs\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics.
