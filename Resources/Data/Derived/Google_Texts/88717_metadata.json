Her mother, Yande Schwarzbock, said the girl's insurer, Neighborhood Health Plan established new rules this year that meant Emmarose lost access to the hospital.\n\nCrystal Rivera\u2019s son has the kind of health issues that would make any mother anxious: food allergies, asthma attacks, a skin condition. But 5-year-old Dacuarie Dillard was in good hands, seeing specialists at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, where he and Rivera had grown comfortable with his care.\n\nThings changed Jan. 1, when the family\u2019s health insurer, Neighborhood Health Plan, began a new contract with Children\u2019s that makes it more complicated for Dacuarie and thousands of poor children like him to see doctors at one of Massachusetts\u2019 most prestigious hospitals, even as it becomes increasingly popular with wealthier patients from around the country and the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new policy, one of many moves by insurers to control costs by restricting choice, applies toNeighborhood members on Medicaid, the government program for low-income individuals and families, known here as MassHealth, with tens of thousands of children possibly affected.\n\nFamilies like Rivera\u2019s \u2014 those with primary care doctors outside the Children\u2019s physician network \u2014 will have to give up their specialists at the hospital or find a new MassHealth plan.\n\nEither step brings with it stress for families already coping with caring for sick children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for people that are considered poor or underprivileged to have to go through these things,\u201d said Rivera, 27, who works full time and cares for her two children in Brighton. \u201cEveryone deserves equal care.\u201d\n\nRivera is taking her son to Boston Medical Center while she decides whether to switch to another plan that will allow Dacuarie to see specialists at Children\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeighborhood Health Plan, a division of the giant Partners HealthCare, is the biggest of six Medicaid managed-care plans, which are paid by the state to coordinate services for families on MassHealth.\n\nNeighborhood officials say they made the change because they can\u2019t afford the steep rates at Children\u2019s Hospital, which is one of the highest-priced Massachusetts health care providers. The contract maintains service for roughly 22,000 other MassHealth members who, unlike Dacuarie Dillard, already see primary care physicians within the Children\u2019s Hospital network. Neighborhood has about 300,000 Medicaid members, including about 120,000 children.\n\nAs the state and insurers seek to control health care costs, restricting choice for consumers has become an increasingly common strategy, not just for those with government-funded coverage, but also for residents with private or employer-paid plans.\n\nIn some cases, that may mean not being able to see certain doctors. In others it could mean selected tests, drugs, and hospitals are off-limits.\n\n\u201cMassHealth expects its [managed care plans] to build cost-effective and adequate network relationships that ensure access to care for members and make sense financially,\u201d said Michelle Hillman, a spokeswoman for MassHealth.\n\nState officials also noted there is \u201csignificant price variation\u201d among high-quality providers, making it possible to get equally good care at lower rates.\n\nNeighborhood isn\u2019t the only insurer to limit access to Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nIn 2014, Boston Medical Center\u2019s HealthNet Plan, which also manages care for families on Medicaid, cut ties with Children\u2019s and Baystate Health of Springfield, citing high costs. It lost 50,000 members after the changes.\n\nTufts Health Plan requires prior authorization before its Medicaid members get inpatient treatment at any hospital, including Children\u2019s.\n\nThe state\u2019s other three Medicaid managed-care plans do not include Children\u2019s in their networks.\n\nEarlier this year, the national health insurer Aetna Inc. nearly ended its contract with Children\u2019s because of a dispute about payment rates, but they ultimately came to an agreement.\n\nUnder new rules at Neighborhood, most MassHealth members need prior approval from the insurer before they can access Children\u2019s Hospital or its doctors. Such authorizations are rare.\n\nNeighborhood\u2019s members can get pediatric care at several other hospitals, including Tufts Medical Center, Boston Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital. (Like Neighborhood, Mass. General is owned by Partners HealthCare).\n\nDoug Thompson, Neighborhood\u2019s chief financial officer, said the insurer sought to keep some access to Children\u2019s Hospital. To drop the hospital from Neighborhood\u2019s network entirely, he said, would have caused \u201cmassive disruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with Children\u2019s is part of a larger effort to manage our Medicaid business effectively,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe worked hard to find a way to make sure that patients still had access to consistent high-quality care, but in a financial framework consistent with what MassHealth pays.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital executives said they provide significant level of care to children on Medicaid, and that they lose more than $100 million a year treating them, because reimbursements don\u2019t meet all of their costs. Medicaid patients account for about one-third of Children\u2019s revenue.\n\n\u201cWe think of ourselves as the safety net provider for kids locally,\u201d said Josh Greenberg, vice president of government relations at Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cWe are not pleased about the problems that the kids who want to come here may be having to get Neighborhood Health Plan to authorize their care. It\u2019s a very difficult situation to be in.\u201d\n\nPrimary care physicians who treat children on Medicaid say the hospital and insurer should have found a way to maintain access for all members.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital, for many circumstances, has the best people in the country, some of the best people in the world, and now we\u2019re saying if you\u2019re poor you can\u2019t go there,\u201d said Dr. Robyn Riseberg, a pediatrician at the South End Community Health Center, which serves many low-income families. \u201cI feel it really is a war on poor children.\u201d\n\nFor Riseberg and other doctors, the new policy also means they must be more selective about referrals, taking insurance rules into account, instead of thinking only about what is best for their patients.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in the 12 years that I\u2019ve been here that insurance has so directly limited my access to deciding which specialist is best for a particular need of my patient,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Zaref, a pediatrician at Southboro Medical Group in Framingham.\n\nMeanwhile, families continue to face disruptions.\n\nYande Schwarzbock\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Emmarose Logatti, has been seeing specialists at Children\u2019s Hospital for most of her life to treat the effects of a stroke she suffered before she was born.\n\nWhen Schwarzbock learned that Neighborhood Health Plan was going to limit access to Children\u2019s, she quickly dropped the managed-care plan and switched to another Medicaid program that offers more choice.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to go to another hospital, because these doctors already know her. I couldn\u2019t afford to wait,\u201d said Schwarzbock, 37, who lives in the South End.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere else. I want to go to Children\u2019s.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3133382318", "eomportal-id": 395131, "description": "Crystal Rivera\u2019s son has the kind of health issues that would make any mother anxious: food allergies, asthma attacks, a skin condition.
