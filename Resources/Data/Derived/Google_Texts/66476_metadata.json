House Republicans are currently suing President Obama over perceived executive overreach in his implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJonathan Bernstein argues that the GOP is now a \u201cpost-policy\u201d party, favoring ideological purity over policy innovation.\n\nThe GOP has a serious shot at retaking the Senate this year.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that Mississippi\u2019s sole remaining abortion clinic must be allowed to remain open, lest its abortion burden be placed on other states.\n\nThe Mississippi law is part of a larger push on the pro-life right to restrict abortions through health and insurance regulations such as Virginia\u2019s abortion clinic construction standards.\n\nSince Texas\u2019 law restricting abortions under certain circumstances went into effect last year, abortions have dropped 13 percent statewide.\n\nMost Americans believe that abortion should be legal during the first trimester.\n\nSome one-party controlled states such as Kansas have attempted \u201creal-live experiments\u201d in conservative governing through massive tax breaks and spending cuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJamelle chatters about A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller Jr.\n\nAnnie chatters about the effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on Russia\u2019s status as a high-income economy.\n\nDavid chatters about the death of the Enola Gay navigator, Theodore \u201cDutch\u201d Van Kirk.\n\nTopic ideas for next week?
