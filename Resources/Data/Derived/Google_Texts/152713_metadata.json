But most worrying for the Kremlin is that the weakness cannot just be blamed on external factors but stems from domestic shortcomings.\n\nThe Russian economy faces a daunting list of troubles \u2013- a declining population, the re-emergence of the United States as a rival energy superpower due to shale gas, and the government's colossal spending on defence that stretches the budget.\n\nThese factors are compounded by Russia's failure to stimulate private enterprise, reform the judicial system, improve labour productivity and turn the Russian economy into more than a lumbering energy producer.\n\nRussia's weakness this year alone can be linked to this failure, which has damaged the investment climate, economists say.\n\nThe revisions by the economy ministry were the \u201cclearest signal yet that Moscow believes that economic weakness over the past year has been structural rather than cyclical in nature,\u201d said Neil Shearing, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"Without a major shift in policy we suspect that Russia will go from being one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies to one of its biggest underperformers.\"\n\nThe forecasts by his own ministry made Putin\u2019s aim of Russia becoming one of the world\u2019s top five economies by 2020 look almost laughable and also undermined its credibility as a member of the BRICS groups of supposedly fast-growing emerging markets.\n\nAn October survey of 21 top economists by Russia\u2019s Higher School of Economics (HSE) showed not only a low consensus forecast of 1.6-percent growth this year, but also growth expectations of three percent or less for every year up to 2022.\n\n\u201cThree percent growth, which would have seen unjustifiably low until recently now seems almost unreachable,\u201d said Sergei Smirnov, deputy director of the HSE\u2019s Development Institute.\n\nHe said that forecasts of \"a decade of lean years\" would mean growth of 29 percent in the decade from 2013-2022, making a mockery of the government\u2019s ambition to double GDP in 10 years.\n\nRussia's central bank, which has long kept a hawkish eye on inflation, on Friday warned about Russia's growth prospects after keeping key interest rates unchanged at 5.5 percent.\n\n\"Due to weak investment activity and the slow recovery of external demand, the Central Bank expects low Russian economic growth rates to remain in the medium-term perspective,\" it said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned Russia in October that unless more was done to address reform, growth in the medium term would be no more than 3.5 percent due to Russia\u2019s weak investment climate.\n\nBut it said that Russia could achieve medium-term growth of 5.0 percent with reform. \u201cUnder a reform scenario, Russia\u2019s medium-term growth could rise considerably,\u201d it said.\n\nPutin built his popularity on giving many Russians a new prosperity after the torrid 1990s. According to the IMF, this meant that since 2000 Russia has increased its per capita income from 33 to 51 percent of the OECD average.\n\nBut Russia was helped in the period up to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis by two one-off factors \u2013- unusually high oil prices and the using up of the spare capacity created by the dismantling of the inefficient Soviet economy.\n\nBut this capacity has now been used up, with no slack.\n\nThe IMF forecasts growth of just 1.5 percent in 2013 with a pick-up to three percent in 2014. Troublingly for the Kremlin, the IMF says the economy is working at close to full capacity with inflation and employment high.\n\n\"The activation of spare capacity and rising oil prices that drove a decade of average annual growth in excess of five percent are not replicable,\" the IMF said in a report.\n\nWith Putin set to stay in the Kremlin until at least 2018 \u2013- and maybe even 2024 if he seeks another mandate \u2013- the Russian authorities will want to ensure a maximum of economic stability to prevent handing a new cause to the still-nascent protest movement.\n\nRead the original article on Agence France Presse.
