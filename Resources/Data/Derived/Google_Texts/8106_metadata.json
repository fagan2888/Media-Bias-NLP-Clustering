Reaching, or even approaching, the gap affects access to medication and influences whether those medications are taken as prescribed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume that the existence of Part D means that people aren\u2019t having a difficult time affording their meds,\u201d says Louanne Bakk, an assistant professor in the University at Buffalo School of Social Work. \u201cThere are certain groups that continue struggling with prescription drug costs regardless of this federal benefit being in place.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has looked at the gap across the general population, but a new study by Bakk published online in the journal Social Work in Public Health is the first to examine how race and gender relate to the coverage gap.\n\nThe results have important implications for social workers who need to be mindful of the cost difficulties the gap creates and the potential resources that exist to get people through that period, according to Bakk.\n\nUnder the 2010 standard benefit, the period referenced in the study, beneficiaries went into the coverage gap when their prescription drug spending reached $2,830. At this point, they pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until their additional prescription drug spending brought their total to $4,550. While the Affordable Care Act decreases the amount beneficiaries are responsible for when reaching the coverage gap, costs associated with this benefit threshold can still be problematic.\n\nBut reaching what\u2019s known as the catastrophic limit \u2013 or, a point where out-of-pocket costs decrease significantly \u2013 rarely happens. People in the coverage gap often can\u2019t afford the full cost of their medications and stop taking them. As a result, their spending never reaches the amount required to receive the catastrophic coverage benefit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known that people in poor health or those with low incomes are more likely to stop taking their medication when they go into the gap, but as we look at this demographically, although there wasn\u2019t a significant difference between males and females, we did find that older blacks are having a much harder time affording their meds than whites, and this difference is largely driven by the coverage gap.\u201d\n\nAvailable assistance meantime isn\u2019t always easy to find. The Low Income Subsidy Program, for instance, is available through Medicare and was signed into the law at the same time Medicare Part D was enacted, but only about 50 percent of those who qualify are using this assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly a lack of awareness,\u201d she says.\n\nMedicare Part D is complicated, with more than 50 different enrollment options and benefits that can change annually. Yet only 10 percent of beneficiaries are in the most cost-effective plan based on their medication needs.\n\n\u201cPeople need help because of this complexity and social workers can have a direct role in providing this help,\u201d says Bakk. \u201cPeople who struggle can be linked to the resources they need and connected to the best plan based on their needs, making changes if necessary during the annual enrollment period in October and November.\u201d\n\nThose who stop taking their meds because of costs associated with the coverage gap put their health at risk and increase the likely need for medical care, says Bakk.\n\nSkipping meds or not taking them properly creates the possibility of further health care issues including a greater likelihood of an emergency room visit and an increased possibility of hospitalization.\n\n\u201cPeople need to have access to the drugs that have been prescribed to them by their physician,\u201d she says. \u201cProperly taking medications can prevent more costly health conditions.\u201d\n\nBakk says that as policy discussions continue there is a critical need to recognize that some individuals are continuing to have difficulties. For those struggling with prescription drug costs, resources such as the Low Income Subsidy and Elder Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program are available.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.buffalo.edu/content/shared/university/news/news-center-releases/2015/08/013/jcr:content/par/image.img.512.auto.jpg/1439402597937.jpg", "description": "BUFFALO, N.Y. &ndash; Medicare Part D provides help to\nbeneficiaries struggling with the cost of prescriptions drugs, but\nthe plan&rsquo;s coverage gap hits some populations harder than\nothers, particularly African-Americans age 65 and older.
