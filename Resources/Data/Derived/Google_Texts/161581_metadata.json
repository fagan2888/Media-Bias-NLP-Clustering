Given the ETF\u2019s and sector\u2019s recent and long-standing strength, now is a good time to evaluate XLV from a technical perspective.\n\n\u201cXLV has done really well the past few years, as its outpaced the S&P 500 by a large margin. The only Sector (lower left corner) that is ahead of Health Care over the past five years is consumer discretionary,\u201d notes Chris Kimble of Kimble Charting Solutions. \u201cThe strong rally in XLV has taken it up to the top of its rising channel and a Fibonacci Extension level based upon the 2007 highs and the 2009 lows.\u201d\n\nAgainst the backdrop of health care sector strength, investors have not been shy about putting money to work in the sector. XLV pulled in $843 million in new assets for the week ending Aug. 8, reports Joseph Ciolli for Bloomberg. Among sector ETFs, only XLE has pulled in more new assets than XLV this year. [Investors Heart Health Care ETFs]\n\nThat says investors have not been turned off by volatility in biotech stocks and intense criticism of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nXLV devotes 20.2% of its weight to biotech stocks. The ETF also features a combined 31.3% allocation to health services providers and equipment makers, groups that have directly benefited from Obamacare. [Obamacare a Boon for This ETF]\n\nWith all the enthusiasm investors have displayed for health care stocks and ETFs, enthusiasm that has generally been rewarded, XLV\u2019s chart still shows the fund is at or nearing a critical technical juncture and its near-term action could be telling.\n\n\u201cAt this time the trend in health care is up, as its above support and long-term moving averages. Humbly I believe it often pays to keep a close eye on leadership. What XLV does with this pattern could be important to the broad market,\u201d said Kimble.\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR\n\nChart Courtesy: Kimble Charting Solutions", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "sector etfs,etf inflows,health care etfs,technical analysis,feature stories,featured,lead,trend following,xlv", "google-site-verification": "Q-wAoS5rW2yMYxQN_OT0klqLjkfU6a6rxznKurdUlsY", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.etftrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/favicon-1.png"}, "article_summary": "Health Care Select Sector SPDRChart Courtesy: Kimble Charting Solutions\n\u201cAt this time the trend in health care is up, as its above support and long-term moving averages.\nThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLV), the largest health care exchange traded fund by assets enters Thursday with a year-to-date gain of almost 10.9%, meaning the ETF has surpassed the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLE) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLU) for top honors among the nine sector SPDR ETFs this year.\n[Investors Heart Health Care ETFs]That says investors have not been turned off by volatility in biotech stocks and intense criticism of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe only Sector (lower left corner) that is ahead of Health Care over the past five years is consumer discretionary,\u201d notes Chris Kimble of Kimble Charting Solutions."}
