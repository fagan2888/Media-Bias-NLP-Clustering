Depending on whom you ask, spring break trips to perennial hot spots in Mexico, Florida and Puerto Rico are becoming a thing of the past.

Some leisure companies have taken the idea of a cruise and added everything party-hungry college students dream about. One of these, Inception at Sea, is a cruise organized by Whet Travel and Student City. The outfit is staging a four-day cruise to Norwegian Cruise Line's private island Great Stirrup Cay.

The cruise departs from Miami on Friday, and includes a full menu of on-board accommodations like food, unlimited beverages and access to all events on board and on land.

Given booming interest, Rafi Leibo, director of sales and marketing at Whet Travel, told CNBC it didn't take long for the idea of this event to become reality.

"Cruising in general gives anyone the opportunity to travel in style, while not having to worry or stress about pretty much anything," he said. Inception also includes performances from popular groups from the worlds of hip-hop and electronic dance music.

"When you combine the convenience and intimacy of cruising with the energy of 2,000 spring breakers from colleges around the country, and mix in some of the biggest talent in [music] it's just a winning formula," Leibo said.
