PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Eleven mothers have filed complaints with the Rhode Island attorney general’s office alleging extensive delays by a company that makes jewelry from breast milk.

Some mothers have been waiting nearly two years for the products by Westerly-based jeweler MommyMilk Creations.

Owner Allicia Mogavero says the process of turning the milk into jewelry is time consuming and customers are made aware of the potential long delays.

WPRO-AM reports (http://bit.ly/1CSx8jN ) the company’s invoices and website don’t indicate waits could approach two years.

The owner says she has fallen behind on orders and customers eventually will get what they paid for.

State Attorney General Peter Kilmartin says his office received one formal complaint about MommyMilk last year and it was closed once the complainant received the item.
