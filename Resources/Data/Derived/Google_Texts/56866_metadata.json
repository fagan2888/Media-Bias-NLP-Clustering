They acknowledge that Obamacare has not collapsed and is probably not going to collapse, as some conservatives warned. They even acknowledge that the law has some positive effects. The problem, they say, is that these benefits don\u2019t outweigh the costs.\n\nPeter Suderman of Reason is one of those writers. His new article references the now-familiar signs of success, like the 7.3 million paid enrollment in the new marketplaces that the Administration announced a few weeks ago. But the statistics are a bit misleading, he says. That enrollment figure was for the middle of August, before a few hundred thousand people lost coverage because they could not verify residency status. Premiums in the new marketplaces will, on the whole, rise at low rates next year. But that\u2019s because insurers are jostling for position and underbidding each other; many people will find that premiums for the plans they currently have are rising next year. Meanwhile, there are cost overruns for building the system and new reports of security problems. A large portion of the people getting health insurance are getting it through Medicaid, which means many of them have difficulty finding doctors who will see them.\n\nSome of these claims rely on dubious evidence or could use more context. It\u2019s true, for example, that Medicaid beneficiaries frequently struggle to find physicians. It\u2019s also true that people on Medicaid are much better off than if they had no insurance at all. Studies have shown that Medicaid beneficiaries end up more financially secure and probably healthier as well, although there's a lot of debate about the latter point. That's a big reason why people who actually have Medicaid like it.\n\nStill, many of the flaws and complications that Suderman chronicles are very real and need to be accounted for. Take the issue of premiums in the marketplaces and what's happening with them. Even though premiums overall are rising slowly and even declining in a few places, prices for some individual plans are going to rise substantially. That\u2019s the nature of a competitive marketplace\u2014an idea that came from conservatives\u2014and, as noted in this space previously, not all consumers may realize that right away. That's a real problem that needs attention from officials.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "There are real flaws and they aren't the whole story", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "An expert tells you what they critics get wrong.", "title": "Obamacare Has Problems\u2014and It Is Working", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0c72e3f2c22287cc06759b4a5bae9de120d49ba7.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119724/obamacare-working-real-problems-progress-uninsured-costs", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0c72e3f2c22287cc06759b4a5bae9de120d49ba7.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Obamacare Has Problems\u2014and It Is Working", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An expert tells you what they critics get wrong."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/0c72e3f2c22287cc06759b4a5bae9de120d49ba7.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The 5 Key Questions About Obamacare, Answered\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119724/obamacare-working-real-problems-progress-uninsured-costs\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-08T12:11:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119724,\"author\":\"Jonathan Cohn\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"QED\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"insurance\",\"premiums\",\"uninsured\",\"enrollment\",\"Peter Suderman\",\"train wreck\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-10-08"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf76\"", "article_summary": "Still, many of the flaws and complications that Suderman chronicles are very real and need to be accounted for.\nThey acknowledge that Obamacare has not collapsed and is probably not going to collapse, as some conservatives warned.\nThat's a real problem that needs attention from officials.\nIt\u2019s also true that people on Medicaid are much better off than if they had no insurance at all.\nEven though premiums overall are rising slowly and even declining in a few places, prices for some individual plans are going to rise substantially."}
