Included in this progress is significant headway on the agreement\u2019s quality metrics and a savings to Medicare of $116 million thus far. And while there have certainly been challenges in making such a historic change, the progress is undeniable.\n\nThere are valuable lessons to be harvested from the early stages of Maryland\u2019s demonstration that inform this purpose and can assist the individual efforts of health care organizations as they embark on similar paths.\n\nHistory\n\nMaryland has had a hospital rate regulation system in effect for nearly 40 years, created by a 1977 federal-state compact that required Medicare and Medicaid to pay hospitals the same rates, set by a state commission, as other payers. While this agreement was more expensive for CMS, the system provided tangible benefits in exchange for that investment:\n\nThe state\u2019s hospital costs dropped from 23.6 percent above the national average to less than the national average\n\nCost-shifting is extremely limited\n\nThere is no need for public hospitals\n\nMaryland\u2019s hospitals retain their reputation for clinical excellence\n\nBut this agreement with CMS needed to be modernized because the original version only measured inpatient expenses. As the nation\u2019s hospitals began to shift treatment toward less costly outpatient services, Maryland\u2019s hospitals continued to be measured solely on pricier inpatient costs when compared to national spending trends \u2014 not a reasonable comparison in today\u2019s health care marketplace. The details of the revamped agreement took nearly two years to negotiate and its effectiveness is being monitored continuously by CMS and state regulators.\n\nNow, under the auspices of this new contract, Maryland is, as former CMS Principal Deputy Administrator Jonathan Blum said when discussing the agreement nearly 18 months ago, \u201ctest[ing] the boundaries of what it means to lower total cost of care and boost total quality of care.\u201d\n\nProgress To Date\n\nCMS, in its push to spur innovation in line with the goals of the Triple Aim, laid out highly aggressive requirements for Maryland\u2019s hospitals to meet over the agreement\u2019s initial five years. These metrics were designed to guarantee CMS concrete returns on its annual investment in Maryland. The requirements are:\n\nLimit all-payer hospital per capita spending in Maryland to annual growth of 3.58 percent\n\nReduce total Medicare hospital spending in Maryland by $330 million over five years\n\nLimit growth in total Medicare spending per beneficiary in Maryland to no more than national growth\n\nReduce the readmissions rate in Maryland to the national average within five years\n\nReduce infections and other hospital-acquired conditions by 30 percent within five years\n\nBased on data available to hospitals, the following chart demonstrates where we stand on those goals as of the end of the first year of this new demonstration:\n\nFor four of the five metrics, hospitals are exceeding the target (as an example, prior to the waiver\u2019s passage, hospital revenue growth averaged more than 6 percent; in the first year, it was a scant 1.47 percent). On readmissions, while the rate of reduction is short of the goal, hospitals are reducing readmissions and reducing readmissions faster than the rest of the nation. Overall, the new model is proving successful at bending the cost and quality curves.\n\nSo, how was so much progress made in such a short period of time? The answer is complex, but at its heart is the upending of a traditional fee-for-service model in favor of fixed global budgets, where annual hospital revenue is capped. This has proven to be a powerful incentive for hospitals to reduce costs through reducing unnecessary utilization and improving quality.\n\nWhile the agreement with state regulators called for 80 percent of all hospital revenue to be linked to some type of population-based reimbursement system by year five, hospitals signed agreements with state regulators placing 95 percent under global budgets within the first six months. This \u201call-in\u201d attitude illustrates the determination of hospitals to get on board with changes that are helping us get patients the right care, at the right time, in the right setting.\n\nThe results? Inpatient admissions and inpatient use rates fell more than 4 percent; potentially avoidable utilization fell even further, more than 6 percent. This has translated into $116 million in savings to Medicare in the first year of the demonstration alone.\n\nThese results are highly encouraging and demonstrate that the historic trajectories in health care spending and quality can be bent toward new, preferable destinations. Still, the challenge for Maryland\u2019s hospitals remains to show, conclusively, that these early returns can be sustained over time.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nDramatic changes have occurred in just 18 months, as hospitals have refashioned their staff, their staff\u2019s responsibilities and, in some cases, their physical space, to meet the demands of a new era and new incentives. Valuable lessons can be distilled from their efforts.\n\nIt\u2019s Hard Work\n\nThis is hard work, from both a policy and clinical standpoint. Transforming from a traditional fee-for-service model has taken dozens of meetings of state-level work groups to create and refine policies that reflect the agreement\u2019s goals. More importantly, Maryland\u2019s hospitals have completely changed their business model and the way in which care is delivered. Individual hospitals have been feverishly investing in new care coordination partnerships, population health initiatives, and staff development to drive patients to the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting. This is difficult, long-term transformation.\n\nIt\u2019s Counterintuitive\n\nFor health care leaders accustomed to the fee-for-service world, it\u2019s challenging to step outside that box. Hospitals will be paid the same revenue no matter how many people they treat? Reducing volume is actually beneficial? It\u2019s a hospital\u2019s job to make sure patients\u2019 needs are met after they leave? In Maryland, the answers are yes, yes, and yes. Culture change on an institutional level is much different than policy change at a state level, and the ease of trickle-down implementation for each organization shows wide variation.\n\nThe Pace Is Intense\n\nBecause so much change has occurred in such a short time, it\u2019s difficult to digest and analyze the individual steps to determine which have been most effective. That means there\u2019s a lot of experimentation, without definitive correlations between individual initiatives and improved outcomes. That\u2019s OK \u2014 the analysis is coming, but for now, patients and payers are seeing the positive effects of the new model. Patients are receiving more thorough after-care and improved inpatient and outpatient care, payers are saving money, and communities are healthier.\n\nInvestment Is Needed Now To Be Successful Later\n\nPrior to the shift to fixed annual budgets, when Maryland\u2019s hospitals operated under traditional fee-for-service models, annual revenue increases were determined largely based on utilization growth and inflation. Now, the system must account for myriad other factors, including the inherent and substantial risk in caring for an unknown number of patients with unpredictable care needs within a fixed global budget. Insurance organizations refer to these unknown, but expected, costs as \u201cactuarial risk.\u201d Because hospitals are now fully accountable for managing this risk under a global budget, resources must be available to mitigate the long-term risk.\n\nThe Tricky Part Is Yet To Come\n\nWhile hospitals have made significant progress on these metrics, hospitals are only one piece of the overall health care landscape. Other providers\u2014doctors, post-acute care facilities, and others\u2014still operate under a strict fee-for-service model. To truly transform health care, it will take cooperation and buy-in from the entire continuum. This will include physician gainsharing and other initiatives that bring providers in line with the goals of the CMS agreement.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nThree big additions are needed to make the model successful under the five-year demonstration agreement.\n\nThe first is an internal cost reduction program through which a portion of the savings that hospitals realize under global budgets will be redirected to doctors, to financially incentivize quality improvement and care redesign. Creating alignment with physicians will be key to future success.\n\nThe second is a statewide data infrastructure to assist all hospitals with care coordination, a central component of population health management. Some funding for this initiative is being allocated, but it will take months, if not years, for a fully functional and effective system to be operational.\n\nThe third is a plan for when the fee-for-service and global budget models are reconciled. As it stands, Maryland\u2019s model is a hybrid. While total annual revenue is capped, the mechanism to obtain that revenue is still through fee-for-service billing. As population health programs become more widespread, inpatient volume is projected to both decrease and become more acute. This will lead to higher per-patient costs (even though total revenue is held in check). In their place, Maryland\u2019s hospitals are striving for models of care based on the total cost of caring for patients and communities \u2014 value-based care. That\u2019s where the nation is going, and Maryland\u2019s experiment is at the forefront.\n\nFor now, however, the early results are encouraging. And the new health care environment being created in Maryland\u2014one never tested on such a large scale and under such scrutiny\u2014is the right thing to do for the patients and communities that hospitals have the privilege to serve.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/11/12/marylands-progress-on-the-path-to-the-triple-aim/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_Makary.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Maryland\u2019s Progress On The Path To The Triple Aim"}, "description": "Maryland\u2019s Progress On The Path To The Triple Aim | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Still, the challenge for Maryland\u2019s hospitals remains to show, conclusively, that these early returns can be sustained over time.\nThis will lead to higher per-patient costs (even though total revenue is held in check).\nIt\u2019s CounterintuitiveFor health care leaders accustomed to the fee-for-service world, it\u2019s challenging to step outside that box.\nMore importantly, Maryland\u2019s hospitals have completely changed their business model and the way in which care is delivered.\nAs it stands, Maryland\u2019s model is a hybrid."}
