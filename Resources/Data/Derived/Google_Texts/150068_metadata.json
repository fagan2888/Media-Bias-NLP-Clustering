Ted Cruz a political liability to some fellow Republicans.\n\nThey blasted GOP Senate candidates in 11 states Tuesday, attempting to tie them to Cruz and his aggressive stances on Obamacare, budget talks and the debt limit. Cruz has made clear that he will attempt to use the Oct. 17 deadline on the debt limit as leverage against the health care law.\n\n\u201cRefusing to abandon the Ted Cruz strategy during the debt limit debate is an entirely new level of bad judgment and recklessness from Bill Cassidy and he should be ashamed of himself,\u201d said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, referring to a GOP nominee in Louisiana. \u201cRepublican Senate hopefuls like Bill Cassidy should immediately abandon Ted Cruz\u2019s dangerous strategy and not allow radical Republicans to renege on the obligations of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe committee is issuing similar missives against candidates in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and West Virginia.\n\nFollow Todd J.
