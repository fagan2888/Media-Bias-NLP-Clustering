He consistently dodged questions about any connection to the corruption even as former underlings pleaded guilty or were convicted.\n\nDuring his four-hour interview with a federal prosecutor, Baca portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who knew nothing about attempts to keep the informant away from FBI agents. He also denied knowing that deputies had interrupted and ended a jailhouse interview between FBI agents and the informant, or knowing that deputies went to the lead FBI agent's house and threatened to arrest her.\n\nOn Wednesday, he plead guilty to lying to federal authorities.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Baca ordered that the informant be isolated and instructed deputies to approach the FBI agent and \"do everything but put handcuffs on her.\"\n\nCourt papers show a lieutenant working in the jails had apologized to Baca for allowing the FBI agents to speak with the informant.\n\nIn the interview, Baca said a threat by one of the deputies to arrest the FBI agent was inappropriate and an \"impulsive reaction.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the deputy actually intend to arrest her, or was bluffing, Baca replied: \"I don't believe anyone should lie under any circumstances.\"\n\nHe faces up to six months behind bars when he is sentenced on May 16.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recordings reveal the lies former LA sheriff told prosecutor - AP News: LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Former Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca .05/27/2016 3:40:44AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Former Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca told three lies to federal", "title": "AP News - Recordings reveal the lies former LA sheriff told prosecutor", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/13/recordings-reveal-the-lies-former-la-sheriff-told-prosecutor-n2119286", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\44\\7b754109-d031-4020-a1dd-1cdcbcbd7edf.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Former Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca told three lies to federal", "title": "AP News - Recordings reveal the lies former LA sheriff told prosecutor", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/13/recordings-reveal-the-lies-former-la-sheriff-told-prosecutor-n2119286", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/44/7b754109-d031-4020-a1dd-1cdcbcbd7edf.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Recordings reveal the lies former LA sheriff told prosecutor, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Former Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca told three lies to federal authorities who were investigating corruption at the jails he ran, according to a newspaper report.\nIn the interview, Baca said a threat by one of the deputies to arrest the FBI agent was inappropriate and an \"impulsive reaction.\"\nCourt papers show a lieutenant working in the jails had apologized to Baca for allowing the FBI agents to speak with the informant.\nDuring his four-hour interview with a federal prosecutor, Baca portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who knew nothing about attempts to keep the informant away from FBI agents.\nHe also denied knowing that deputies had interrupted and ended a jailhouse interview between FBI agents and the informant, or knowing that deputies went to the lead FBI agent's house and threatened to arrest her."}
