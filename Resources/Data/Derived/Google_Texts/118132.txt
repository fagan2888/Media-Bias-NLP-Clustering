Stokes County will have to pay $232,560 more for employee health insurance next year, a 15 percent increase over this year’s insurance costs.

County Clerk Darleen Bullins said that the rate was the best the county would be able to get, due partially to high claims this year but also to increasing costs as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

“We started out at 26 percent increase and were able to negotiate it down to 15 percent,” she said. “It has been increasing ever since we came out of the pool. The Affordable Care Act made a big difference this time as well.”

Stokes County Board of Commissioners Chair Leon Inman said the increase equated to almost a one cent property tax increase.

“It is not getting any easier,” he said. “I know Darleen has spent numerous hours on this and what you see before you is the absolute best deal out there.”

Under the proposed rates county employees will not see any changes in benefits and dental and life insurance rates will not increase.

Commissioners unanimously agreed to accept the proposed rates.
