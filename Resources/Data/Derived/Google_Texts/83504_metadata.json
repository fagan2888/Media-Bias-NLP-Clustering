She huddled with her assistant coaches while scribbling up plays that she would show her team during timeouts. She paced the sidelines at times, maybe burning off a bit of nervous energy.\n\nIn other words, she coached.\n\nAnd while it might have seemed normal, it was different.\n\nHammon made another piece of history Saturday, becoming the first woman to lead a team in an NBA summer league game. Hammon and the San Antonio Spurs lost 78-73 to the New York Knicks in the Las Vegas league debut for both squads.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning all sorts of kinds of things, not just about Xs and Os but how to handle a team, how to speak to guys,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just a flower that\u2019s getting great roots \u2014 but far from blooming.\u201d\n\nOther women have coached in summer league \u2014 Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman was invited by Sacramento\u2019s George Karl to be on the Kings\u2019 staff this summer and Lindsey Harding, a former No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft, is a guest on Toronto\u2019s staff in Las Vegas \u2014 but no female had been actually in charge of a roster.\n\nThat is, until now.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a big deal because it\u2019s coaches coaching. She\u2019s been given an opportunity to do what she\u2019s done her whole life,\u201d said Lieberman, who became the first woman to coach a men\u2019s pro team in the NBA Development League. \u201cThe thing that catches everybody\u2019s eye is that we\u2019re women coaching men. Eventually, it\u2019ll be normal. But certainly, Becky has opened up a tremendous door. She\u2019s the right person for the job.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t always go as Hammon would have wanted. But she showed plenty of coaching savvy.\n\nShe subbed out all five of her starters after 4 minutes, with the Spurs already down 13-2 \u2014 and she was fairly animated on the sideline while explaining how she wanted certain situations handled at that point. San Antonio got up by nine in the fourth, but the Knicks answered with a 16-0 run capped by a wild jumper from rookie Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nHammon wasn\u2019t fazed. She had two timeouts in the bank and used one with about 25 seconds left with her team down by three \u2014 then used the other with 16 seconds remaining when the first play she had drawn up for that situation fell apart. Hammon briskly moved to half-court, got a ref\u2019s attention and called her final timeout.\n\nIt almost worked out. Jarrell Eddie got an open 3-point try from the right corner, but it rimmed out.\n\n\u201cI drew up a play. I didn\u2019t draw it clear enough,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cAnd I called a timeout. Let\u2019s get it right. We got a good look \u2026 so I\u2019m learning. Do I want to absolutely go down to the wire every game? No, because it\u2019s \u2026 stressful.\u201d\n\nHammon is going into her second year as an assistant for the Spurs. The former WNBA star spent 16 seasons playing for New York and San Antonio, so it seemed fitting that her summer-coaching debut was against the Knicks.\n\nShe was clearly enjoying the moment pregame. Down on the far end from the Spurs bench, Lieberman blew her kisses and bowed, which earned her a smile and wave back from Hammon. She waved at a couple other well-wishers as well, chatting with members of the Spurs staff.\n\nOther than the black warmup pants (all the other Spurs coaches and staff were in in shorts), the hoop earrings and the ponytail, Hammon was just like everyone else. And that\u2019s exactly the way she wanted it.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s always about bigger picture,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that when your wife or your daughter goes for a job interview she gets the same opportunity that a guy gets. That\u2019s the bigger picture. That\u2019s the bigger goal. Whether it\u2019s basketball or the Army or CEOs or in operating rooms, we want women there.\u201d\n\nLieberman is close friends with Hammon, and they\u2019ve talked plenty about being women who are making it in a world where men fill most of the coaching chairs.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re women,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to do this thing and make it normal. To all these other people, they haven\u2019t seen that before. It\u2019s our job. It\u2019s like President Obama. He knew he was black before he got the job. It was his job to make it normal. It\u2019s our job to make it normal.\u201d\n\nIt got a little more normal on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Becky Hammon makes summer league coaching debut for Spurs", "title": "Becky Hammon makes summer league coaching debut for Spurs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/11/becky-hammon-makes-summer-league-coaching-debut-for-spurs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_044827_becky-hammon.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150711_044827_becky-hammon.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-11T16:46:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:24:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe thing that catches everybody\u2019s eye is that we\u2019re women coaching men.\nHammon and the San Antonio Spurs lost 78-73 to the New York Knicks in the Las Vegas league debut for both squads.\nHammon made another piece of history Saturday, becoming the first woman to lead a team in an NBA summer league game.\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re women,\u201d Lieberman said.\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Every few minutes, Becky Hammon would check some notes and then stuff the list back into her hip pocket."}
