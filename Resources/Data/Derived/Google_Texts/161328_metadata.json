Gary Herbert released the details of an alternative plan for expanding eligibility for Medicaid in Utah.\n\nThe federal government said it will pay most of the cost if states allow more people to be eligible for the program.\n\nGov. Herbert said he would prefer to use the federal funds to help more than 100,000 low-income Utahns with private healthcare programs.\n\n#HealthyUtah helps individuals who earn less than $12,000/yr. single moms, low inc. adults. 2/3 are employed \u2014 Gary R. Herbert (@GovHerbert) December 4, 2014\n\nNow Gov. Herbert needs the Utah legislature to approve the plan.\n\nThe governor said his Healthy Utah plan is better for Utah for four reasons.\n\nHe said it respects the tax payer, supports private markets, promotes individual responsibility and connects underemployed with individual job assistance and it maximizes state flexibility.\n\nRespect the taxpayer - brings $409 million in ACA taxes that Utahns have already paid back into our state economy #healthyutah \u2014 Gary R. Herbert (@GovHerbert) December 4, 2014\n\nSupport private markets - uses $ that would go into Medicaid to instead help low-income Utahns purchase insurance from private Utah vendors \u2014 Gary R.
