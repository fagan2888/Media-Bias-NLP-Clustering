My company donated 50 live flowering plants to the cause as I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to be in a nursing home with no visitors on Mother\u2019s Day!\n\nAlliance on Aging provides a wonderful service to our local seniors and the smiles generated by the delivery of flowers are priceless!\n\n\u2014 Brandon Wiggins, Carmel Valley\n\nRocket Farms donates orchids for \u2018Mama\u2019\n\nI, too, was thrilled to read the front-page story in last Sunday\u2019s Herald about the delivery of plants to women in care facilities throughout Monterey County on Mother\u2019s Day. My own mother was a recipient of an orchid as part of the \u201cI Remember Mama\u201d event coordinated by the Alliance on Aging.\n\nHowever, I must speak up to help clarify a major misperception in a letter to the editor in which Rocket Farms is chastised for charging $35 for each plant. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a member of the board of directors for Alliance on Aging, I can tell you firsthand the overwhelming success of this event was largely due to the fact that once again Rocket Farms graciously donated all the orchids delivered on Mother\u2019s Day by a corps of wonderful volunteers.\n\n\u201cI Remember Mama\u201d supports the Alliance\u2019s Ombudsman program providing advocacy for seniors in local care facilities. Donors pay $35 to sponsor delivery of a plant either anonymously or to a designated recipient. Kudos to Rocket Farms for their tremendous generosity in helping to provide much needed services to the senior population in our community.\n\n\u2014 Robert Hedberg, Carmel\n\nVolunteers step up in delivering flowers\n\nI want to commend the Monterey Herald for the excellent article about local volunteers delivering beautiful orchids that brought smiles to over 1,200 senior women for our \u201cI Remember Mama\u201d event on Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nDespite being their busiest time of the year, Rocket Farms has, for the past five years, graciously donated the orchids (free of charge to the Alliance on Aging) to enable our volunteers to deliver them to 76 nursing homes and senior assisted living facilities in the county.\n\nFor the past 21 years, hundreds of volunteers from local churches, schools, colleges, fire departments and other groups took time to visit these women to ensure that they are not forgotten on that special day.\n\n\u2014 Teresa Sullivan, executive director, Alliance on Aging\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents inspire others to embrace history\n\nCongratulations to Los Arboles Middle School students Tara Smith, Gabriella Flanders and Gabriella Gallo-Rodriguez for their victory at the California State History Day finals in Sacramento. Their win represents a commitment on the parts of both teacher and learners to learn history by going into depth through project-based learning.\n\nOther finalists represented International School of Monterey, All Saints Day School, Seaside Middle School, York and Stevenson Lower School.\n\nI hope other Monterey Peninsula elementary, middle and high schools will be inspired to participate in Monterey County History Day in 2016, which has been produced by the Lyceum of Monterey County, in conjunction with the Monterey County Office of Education, for the last 25 years.\n\n\u2014 Tom Nelson, executive director, Lyceum of Monterey County.\n\nSecret \u2018Obamatrade\u2019 deal destroys American jobs\n\nWell, hell just froze over! As a hard-core conservative Republican, I publicly state that I completely agree with Elizabeth Warren and the \u201cliberal left\u201d Democrats in blocking Obama\u2019s secret \u201cObamatrade\u201d Pacific trade deal.\n\nWarren says, \u201cLet America see the agreement\u201d before a fast-track vote, and she is dead right. After boasting of his \u201ctransparency,\u201d no president has ever concealed as many treaties and done as much to hide his vindictive strikes against his political enemies as Obama. His slimy financial favors for contributors, like the corrupt Clinton Foundation dealings, is easy to find and Warren and the Democrats correctly say this China trade deal harms the U.S.\n\nObama\u2019s hidden agenda here can\u2019t stand the light of day and my fellow Republicans are flat wrong to help Obama and Clinton hide it. Let\u2019s not allow another secret deal like Obamacare, which is now bankrupting those states like California and Hawaii and Oregon. The \u201cObamatrade\u201d deal destroys American jobs to favor China.\n\n\u2014 Frank Louis Blair Koucky III, Carmel Valley", "article_metadata": {"description": "Delivery of flowers to seniors is pricelessWith regards to Dorothy Smith\u2019s letter to the editor (May 13), surely she must realize that besides supporting the Alliance on Aging (a very worthwhile organization!), there are", "title": "Letters: Delivery of flowers to seniors is priceless", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150516/NEWS/150519808", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150516/NEWS/150519808/AR/0/AR-150519808.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1129px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Letters: Delivery of flowers to seniors is priceless"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Delivery of flowers to seniors is pricelessWith regards to Dorothy Smith\u2019s letter to the editor (May 13), surely she must realize that besides supporting the Alliance on Aging (a very worthwhile organization!), there are", "title": "Letters: Delivery of flowers to seniors is priceless", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150516/NEWS/150519808", "image": {"src": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150516/NEWS/150519808/AR/0/AR-150519808.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "letters, Letters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "letters, Letters"}, "article_summary": "Alliance on Aging provides a wonderful service to our local seniors and the smiles generated by the delivery of flowers are priceless!\n), there are other costs associated with the wonderful delivery of orchids and flowers to the dear women in convalescent facilities.\nOther finalists represented International School of Monterey, All Saints Day School, Seaside Middle School, York and Stevenson Lower School.\nKudos to Rocket Farms for their tremendous generosity in helping to provide much needed services to the senior population in our community.\nDelivery of flowers to seniors is pricelessWith regards to Dorothy Smith\u2019s letter to the editor (May 13), surely she must realize that besides supporting the Alliance on Aging (a very worthwhile organization!"}
