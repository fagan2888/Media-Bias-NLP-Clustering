That case, filed by the state, the town and a local community association, goes before a federal judge in Boston on Aug. 12.\n\n\u201cThe tribe unilaterally chose to begin construction of a casino a month before the summary judgment argument,\u201d the town says in its filing.\n\nThe tribe dismissed the legal maneuver as a \u201cminor distraction\u201d and questioned its merits.\n\n\u201cThe town has yet to allege any type of public safety or building safety issue; the tribe is making its improvements to the gaming facility in compliance with applicable building codes, which will be properly inspected and certified to be code-compliant before the facility is ever open to the public,\u201d it said.\n\nThe filing comes as tensions between the tribe and the town have grown in recent weeks.\n\nThe town issued a cease and desist order on July 6 after Tobias Vanderhoop, chairman of the federally recognized tribe, said in a court deposition that the tribe would begin converting a partially finished, 6,500-square-foot community center into a gambling facility offering bingo-style electronic games.\n\nVanderhoop said the work would start July 6 and the tribe would not seek town permits or allow town inspections of the project since the building is located on tribal land. The tribe, which hopes to have the casino open by the fall, has also since told the town it won\u2019t honor the cease and desist order.\n\nThe tribe, meanwhile, will hold a special vote Aug. 16 on the casino plan after opponents gathered enough signatures for a petition, Vanderhoop confirmed. The casino proposal narrowly survived a similar vote last February.\n\nFormer tribal chairwoman Beverly Wright, who helped coordinate the petition, said: \u201cThis is our homeland. We do not want a casino near where our tribal children live. I\u2019m all for gambling. But not on the island. It does not make sense here. We don\u2019t have the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOther tribe members say they\u2019re considering staging sit-ins to block further construction activity in the meantime. Tribe members who live on the island are mostly opposed to the casino while tribe members who live off the island and constitute the tribe\u2019s majority support the plan.\n\n\u201cDecisions are being made by people who don\u2019t even live here,\u201d says Jason Widdiss, a tribe member who lives on the island.\n\nThe tribe maintains it has the right under federal law to open on its lands a gambling facility that could offer high-stakes, bingo-style electronic games but not casino table games or other types of electronic gambling machines like slot machines.\n\nThe state and the town argue a 1983 agreement between the tribe and the state that resulted in the tribe\u2019s roughly 400 acres of land on Martha\u2019s Vineyard explicitly bars the tribe from entering the gambling business. The tribe says the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which was passed a few years after the land deal, supersedes any state or local laws.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A casino fight is brewing on bucolic Martha's Vineyard.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A casino fight is brewing on bucolic Martha\u2019s Vineyard.", "title": "Town moves to block construction of Martha\u2019s Vineyard casino", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/14/town-moves-to-block-construction-of-marthas-vineya/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/AP262962986395.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/AP262962986395.jpg", "description": "A casino fight is brewing on bucolic Martha's Vineyard.", "card": "summary", "title": "Town moves to block construction of Martha\u2019s Vineyard casino"}, "Author": "PHILIP MARCELO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Hospitality Recreation, Tobias Vanderhoop"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe tribe unilaterally chose to begin construction of a casino a month before the summary judgment argument,\u201d the town says in its filing.\nThe tribe, which hopes to have the casino open by the fall, has also since told the town it won\u2019t honor the cease and desist order.\nThat case, filed by the state, the town and a local community association, goes before a federal judge in Boston on Aug. 12.\nThe town argues the tribe should wait until a judge decides on a lawsuit challenging the tribe\u2019s plans.\nWe don\u2019t have the infrastructure.\u201dOther tribe members say they\u2019re considering staging sit-ins to block further construction activity in the meantime."}
