DoorDash briefly stopped taking In-N-Out orders this spring but resumed a few months later with a fake logo advertising In-N-Out on its website.\n\nStarted in 2013, DoorDash delivers food from different restaurants in more than 250 cities nationwide through its website and smartphone app. Its CEO and founder Tony Xu said it was founded on the premise that the majority of restaurants don\u2019t offer delivery.\n\nValued at $600 million, DoorDash charges customers a flat fee for delivery and typically negotiates a commission with restaurants for a portion of sales.\n\nDoorDash has partnered with Taco Bell, 7-Eleven, KFC and other national brands to deliver food to hungry customers seeking convenience. For restaurants, adding delivery can boost sales and open the door to new business.\n\nUnlike restaurants that follow strict food handling standards, on-demand startup delivery services like DoorDash are unregulated. But as more consumers demand any kind of food at any time, delivery services are expected to become even more popular.\n\nGet Free Updates!
