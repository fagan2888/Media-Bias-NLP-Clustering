But at this point, we\u2019re also able to measure the ACA\u2019s efficacy beyond just the anecdotes.\n\nThe New York Times reported on a substantial increase in the number of young women who\u2019ve been diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a mystery to explain the trend. Because \u201cObamacare\u201d covers young adults before their 26th birthday, the percentage of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds has plummeted.\n\nYou can probably guess what that means: more young women are able to see a doctor, more doctors are able to do cancer screenings, and more exams are detecting cancer at early stages. From the Times\u2019 report\n\nResearchers from the American Cancer Society wanted to examine whether the expansion of health insurance among young American women was leading to more early-stage diagnoses. Early diagnosis improves the prospects for survival because treatment is more effective and the chance of remission is higher. It also bolsters women\u2019s chances for preserving their fertility during treatment. And women with health insurance are far more likely to get a screening that can identify cancer early. Researchers used the National Cancer Data Base, a hospital-based registry of about 70 percent of all cancer cases in the United States. They compared diagnoses for women ages 21 to 25 who had cervical cancer with those for women ages 26 to 34, before and after the health law provision began in 2010.\n\nThe results painted a striking picture of increased e arly-stage diagnoses among the younger group, with no meaningful change in the older group.\n\nOne of the researchers, Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, said the effect of the Affordable Care Act is hard to miss, leading to results he described as \u201cvery remarkable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For the ACA's proponents, there's new evidence that the health care reform law is literally a life-saver.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-plays-remarkable-role-cancer-detection", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "For the ACA's proponents, there's new evidence that the health care reform law is literally a life-saver.", "title": "ACA plays 'remarkable' role in cancer detection", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-plays-remarkable-role-cancer-detection", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/462802374.jpg?itok=46pRmd8O", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-plays-remarkable-role-cancer-detection", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/462802374.jpg?itok=tcIpoRYL", "height": 553}, "title": "ACA plays 'remarkable' role in cancer detection", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For the ACA's proponents, there's new evidence that the health care reform law is literally a life-saver."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-25T10:40:08-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "ACA plays 'remarkable' role in cancer detection", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "11/25/2015 10:40:08 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-plays-remarkable-role-cancer-detection"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "For the ACA's proponents, there's new evidence that the health care reform law is literally a life-saver.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d93\"", "article_summary": "And women with health insurance are far more likely to get a screening that can identify cancer early.\nYou can probably guess what that means: more young women are able to see a doctor, more doctors are able to do cancer screenings, and more exams are detecting cancer at early stages.\nResearchers used the National Cancer Data Base, a hospital-based registry of about 70 percent of all cancer cases in the United States.\nFrom the Times\u2019 reportResearchers from the American Cancer Society wanted to examine whether the expansion of health insurance among young American women was leading to more early-stage diagnoses.\nEarly diagnosis improves the prospects for survival because treatment is more effective and the chance of remission is higher."}
