These sorts of e-mails are standard little more than a year out from a general election, as we are now.\n\nBut Obama isn\u2019t going to be on any ballots anytime soon. So each dollar that flows into OFA\u2019s coffer is, presumably, a dollar not going to a candidate with battles yet to come. Why is there not more outcry against OFA from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), or congressional Democrats, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign? And why is OFA still pressing forward even as Obama\u2019s presidency is winding down?\n\nThe answer says something about how Obama intends to influence the party in years to come. At a time when a good deal of partisan action takes place outside of regular party organizations, OFA works to mobilize support for progressive priorities in the face of continuing intense opposition. Beyond current struggles, the challenge for Organizing for Action will be to move beyond loyalty to Obama himself and find ways to deepen his political and policy legacies after he leaves the White House\n\nObama\u2019s organization, 3.0\n\nOrganizing for Action is actually the third iteration of Obama\u2019s grass-roots movement. First came Obama for America, the president\u2019s vaunted information-age campaign organization. Next that was transformed into Organizing for America (OFA 2.0) which was inserted in the DNC, where it was tasked with several things: mobilizing support for Obama\u2019s signature program, the Affordable Care Act; supporting Democratic midterm campaigns; and keeping alive \u2014 even strengthening\u2014 Obama\u2019s grass-roots network and voter and contributor databases, to be ready for the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nSome opponents of the merger had hoped to keep the organization separate so that it could remain an independent power base for the president. In a nod toward their concerns, OFA enjoyed \u201cdepartmental\u201d status within the DNC, retained control of its own e-mail list, and was managed by Obama campaign staffers rather than DNC personnel.\n\nThis third incarnation, Organizing for Action (or OFA 3.0), is especially pathbreaking. Although candidate-centered campaign organizations became a principal feature of the modern executive with John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 run for the White House, Organizing for Action was spun off as a 501(c)(4) group, and dedicated to championing the \u201cagenda Americans voted for in 2012.\u201d\n\nOFA 2.0\u2019s activities \u2013 especially its efforts to mobilize support for \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 had gone beyond campaigning. But as former party chairman, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) told us, OFA was primarily envisaged as \u201cthe grassroots arm of the DNC,\u201d and it played an integral part in the national party\u2019s expanded field operations in the states. Consequently, OFA\u2019s objectives were closely tied to the 2010 midterms and, more emphatically, the president\u2019s reelection.\n\nIn contrast, OFA 3.0, formed when the president was no longer going to be a candidate, has been explicitly dedicated to policy advocacy and implementation. Over the course of Obama\u2019s second term, Organizing for Action has: played a critical part in enrolling the uninsured during the rollout of Obamacare; staged hundreds of rallies around the country in support of progressive causes; and continued to build and refine the gigantic e-mail lists and databases so essential to the president\u2019s two electoral victories.\n\nOFA\u2019s ability to mobilize Obama\u2019s supporters on behalf of policies has been one important reason that the president has been able to avoid lame duck status, and has instead continued to work on advancing substantive projects. OFA has helped to promote Obama\u2019s policies, such as immigration reform, LGBT rights, and climate change policy through administrative action.\n\nTaking up what the national parties can no longer do\n\nIf these tasks of mobilizing political support and advocating for policy sound like the DNC\u2019s job, that\u2019s because it is\u2026or used to be. As Daniel Galvin has shown, since the consolidation of the modern executive office, presidents, especially Republicans, have relied on their party\u2019s national committees to do much of the stage-setting needed to both win electoral battles and \u201cwin the peace\u201d between contests.\n\nBut in 2002, the emergence of national committees as national political machines was short-circuited.\n\nAlthough Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission is best remembered for striking down some campaign finance restrictions, perhaps as important are the portions of 2002\u2019s Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) that the Supreme Court let stand. While fundraising restrictions on Political Action Committees and other forms of \u201cindependent\u201d groups were eliminated, the BCRA\u2019s new regulations on contributions to party committees were upheld. The most significant remaining regulation was the so-called soft money ban, which proscribed the national party organizations from raising unregulated funds.\n\nWhat does that mean? Prior to the BCRA\u2019s passage, campaign finance law distinguished between money raised for the purposes of \u201celectioneering\u201d on behalf of candidates for office (what was then called \u201chard money\u201d) and dollars earmarked for all other purposes (referred to as \u201csoft money\u201d). Individual donors were \u2013as now \u2013 restricted in the amount of hard money they could donate, but there was no cap on soft money donations before 2002. Since then, however, no distinction has been enforced between hard money and soft; all donations to political parties have been subject to the same limits.\n\nThese esoteric but very significant changes in the campaign finance laws have had an important impact on the relative power of formal party organizations and \u201cindependent\u201d groups. Parties once exploited the soft money loophole, using the more permissively regulated dollars to run issue ads that stopped just short of bestowing explicit endorsements or calling out opposing politicians by name.\n\nMoreover, as Ray La Raja\u2019s research has shown, national committees also used soft money to engage in party-building activities that strengthened the chances of candidates up and down the ticket. These were vital services politicians had come to rely on.\n\nBut with their war chests limited to campaign activity, both the DNC and RNC now focus almost exclusively on strategic contributions to candidates locked in competitive elections.\n\nUsing \u201csoft money\u201d to advocate for policies and train organizers\n\nThat\u2019s where Organizing for Action comes in. Unlike parties, in the post-Citizen\u2019s United era, 501(c)(4) groups like OFA can accept unlimited contributions. And they can advocate for policies in ways unregulated by campaign finance laws. Although such groups must spend more than half of their funds toward \u201csocial welfare\u201d (read: not overtly political) purposes to be eligible for tax-exempt status, enforcing this provision is daunting.\n\nJust as parties once exploited the soft money loophole, 501(c)(4) groups like OFA can now take advantage of ambiguity over exactly what counts as a campaign-related expenditure.\n\nIn addition to advocating on issues and policies, OFA has taken on some of the campaign-related roles traditionally played by national party committees. In addition to maintaining and updating the databases and other digital assets that have been so critical to Obama\u2019s campaign and policy successes, OFA has held numerous \u201ccommunity organizer workshops\u201d and an annual Spring Fellows Program. Through these efforts, OFA mints new community organizers and trains a workforce for Democratic candidates and other progressive nonprofits.\n\nOrganizing for Action trained more than 10,000 organizers during its first two years, many of whom worked on the 2014 midterm elections and have joined 2016 presidential campaigns. These campaign and advocacy laboratories suggest how OFA \u2013 a pioneering presidential organization \u2013 might endure beyond 2016, seeking, as a recent organization e-mail trumpeted, to secure the \u201cfuture of the Progressive movement.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why there\u2019s so little concern that OFA\u2019s fundraising might suck the oxygen out of 2016 Democratic campaigns: It is, instead, preparing to support those campaigns. Obama\u2019s grass-roots organization has only raised a bit over $5 million during the first two quarters of 2015. Instead of drawing from big donors and releasing TV ads, OFA invests in on-the-ground volunteers, more so than any previous presidential organization and almost all 501(c)(4) groups.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s family\u201d\n\nMost Democratic partisans understand that \u201cObama\u2019s family,\u201d as staff and volunteers refer to themselves, is not trying to siphon money from their campaigns, displace the party, or simply bolster Obama\u2019s agenda. Rather, its messaging and grass-roots mobilization is taking up what the more constrained national party committees once did, and in doing so, might be providing a valuable service to all Democrats.\n\nIndeed, former President Obama may well keep OFA intact after he leaves office. With its state of the art digital platform, 30 million e-mail addresses, 3 million donors and 2 million active participants, OFA 4.0 could continue to be a useful ally to progressive politicians and causes. In a fractious political environment where loose coalitions of interest groups, think tanks, PACs, and wealthy mega-donors have filled the vacuum left by atrophying national parties, the broadly focused OFA could perhaps provide some much-needed coordination and direction just as party bosses once did.\n\nIf this is OFA\u2019s future, President Obama, with the help of his \u201cfamily,\u201d could remain a central player in American politics for years to come. This prospect will undoubtedly send Republicans into fits. The prospect of this president with his loyal following, charisma, and rhetorical flourish, staying on stage after his curtain call likely does not thrill Hillary Clinton either.\n\nSidney M.
