It stars Eliza Coupe as Nina Whitley.\n\nNext week is the season finale of \"Benched,\" with a full hour of two back-to-back episodes. Someone in the office is on the short list for Public Defender of the Year, and hint \u2014 it's not Boring Larry or Sheryl.\n\nIn \"Campaign Contributions,\" Nina will insist on helping after it's discovered that Phil is up for the award. Also, Trent will let his 10-year-old \"little brother\" accompany him to court for a week.\n\nThe finale is titled \"Brief Encounters\" and will feature Nina apparently \"reuniting\" with Trent, and she will face a difficult choice regarding the situation. Also, Phil will examine his own relationships.\n\nWill Nina and Phil's examinations and tough decisions have to do with them both ignoring the obvious attraction they have for each other, which was brought to light in the previous episode?\n\nLast week, a double date didn't go as planned, and Nina and Phil's dates ended up together by the end of the night. This left Nina and Phil in an awkward situation, and although it wasn't spelled out, we could tell they'd come to the realization that they liked each other. Of course, both were too afraid to act on those feelings. Will it happen next week?\n\nThere's still no word yet on whether the show has been renewed for a second season or not. On Twitter, when someone asked show creator Michaela Watkins what the status was, she replied that there's still no word on a renewal.:\n\n\u201c@bigman7000: @michaelaWat season finale next week of my fav show #benched nooooooo.
