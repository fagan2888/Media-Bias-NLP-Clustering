Mike Huckabee (R) sparked considerable controversy when he suggested that offering insurance coverage for birth control is rooted in the assumption that women need the government to help them control their sex drives. Huckabee is hardly the first lawmaker to make an illogical comment about reproductive health that seems to belie the way that women\u2019s reproductive systems actually work. Gaffes of this nature have become a serious problem for the GOP party, particularly as it attempts to attract more female voters.\n\nRepublicans have held some training sessions to help teach lawmakers how to better talk to women, but the issue may have deeper roots than a lack of PR savvy. Some lawmakers simply need to go back to health class. Here are five important lessons about reproductive health that GOP politicians should commit to memory:\n\n1. Birth control pills aren\u2019t directly correlated to how much sex a woman is having.\n\nRepublican lawmakers often refer to birth control as if it has a direct relationship with sex \u2014 as in, the women who have sex more frequently need to take pills more frequently, and the woman who aren\u2019t having a lot of sex don\u2019t need to worry as much about paying for birth control. Rush Limbaugh is a big proponent of this assumption about reproductive health. \u201cShe\u2019s having so much sex, she can\u2019t afford her birth control,\u201d the conservative radio host said in reference to Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law student who was maligned for testifying in favor of Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage.\n\nIn fact, women who rely on oral contraceptives need to take a pill once every day, regardless of the frequency of their sexual activity. There\u2019s no extra charge for the women who have more sex \u2014 they\u2019re just, quite literally, getting more bang for their buck.\n\nThe type of pill that Limbaugh is referencing could eventually become a reality, however. Researchers may be getting closer to developing an oral contraceptive that women could take before each instance of sexual intercourse. The medically accurate term is \u201cpericoital birth control,\u201d although Cosmopolitan favors \u201cedible condoms.\u201d Ironically, this method would actually make the most sense for the women who are having sex fairly infrequently.\n\n2. Over half of the women who use birth control need it for medical reasons.\n\nRepublicans typically make comments about birth control coverage solely in the context of the government paying for women\u2019s sex lives. Obviously, many sexually active women are using the pill to prevent pregnancy. But there are also several unrelated medical reasons that a woman may need oral contraceptives. Sandra Fluke is another good example to illustrate this. Her testimony in favor of birth control wasn\u2019t about how much sex she was having; it was actually about a lesbian friend who uses the pill to treat ovarian cysts.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, 58 percent of women on the pill are using it at least partly for medical reasons. Some of those women are also using the pill for pregnancy prevention, but about 1.5 million American women need birth control solely for medical reasons.\n\nThe reasons for needing the pill can range from regulating painful menstrual cycles, to preventing cramps, to controlling acne, to treating endometriosis.\n\n3. There\u2019s a difference between preventing fertilization (ie, contraception) and ending a pregnancy (ie, abortion).\n\nParticularly in the context of the controversy over Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision, conservatives frequently conflate birth control with abortion. Dozens of legal challenges against the health reform law are based on the scientifically inaccurate claim that Plan B, or the \u201cmorning after pill,\u201d is a type of abortion-inducing drug. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s actually going on inside a woman\u2019s body.\n\nObviously, birth control is a preventative health service because it doesn\u2019t end an existing pregnancy. Contraceptive methods prevent sperm from coming into contact with, and ultimately fertilizing, a woman\u2019s egg. Oral birth control pills accomplish this by using hormones to manipulate two biological functions in the female reproductive system. The pill prevents ovulation, the process by which an egg leaves the ovaries, and thickens cervical mucus, which helps slow sperm and block them from meeting an egg. It\u2019s important to remember that ovulation is a process that can take up to 48 hours, and sperm can live in the female body for several days \u2014 so fertilization doesn\u2019t happen immediately after sexual intercourse. That\u2019s why it\u2019s possible to prevent pregnancy even after sex has occurred, using emergency contraception.\n\nThe so-called \u201cmorning after pill\u201d functions in the same way that the birth control pill does, by attempting to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus. There is no scientific evidence that Plan B disrupts what\u2019s called \u201cimplantation,\u201d when a fertilized egg implants in the uterine lining \u2014 a disruption that many conservatives would consider to be abortion. The abortion pill, on the other hand, does destroy an implanted embryo. That\u2019s the difference.\n\n4. The biology of pregnancy is the same for both consensual and nonconsensual sex.\n\nFormer Missouri Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s (R) infamous comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d sparked a larger conversation about sexual assault, pregnancy, and abortion access. Of course, Akin\u2019s assertion that women who are raped don\u2019t often become pregnant is scientifically incorrect. The female body is not able to distinguish between sperm that results from consensual sexual intercourse and sperm that results from a sexual assault. The national rape-related pregnancy rate is about five percent, and an estimated 32,000 women become pregnant from rape every year.\n\nAnd more broadly, it\u2019s perhaps important for lawmakers to understand that there are some realities about pregnancy and abortion that hold true no matter what type of sexual experience was involved. Some women who become pregnant from rape want to carry the pregnancy to term, just like some women who conceive from consensual sex. But other women who conceive as a result of sexual assault can\u2019t imagine continuing that pregnancy \u2014 because of the emotional implications of the paternity, because of their individual financial situation, because they are already parenting, because it\u2019s dangerous for their body to attempt to support a fetus, or because they simply don\u2019t want to be pregnant. These are the same circumstances facing the women who end other types of unintended pregnancies.\n\nUltimately, ranking women\u2019s experiences against each other to decide who \u201cdeserves\u201d abortion access \u2014 as if women who have not been raped don\u2019t have a good enough reason to need reproductive health care \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a very effective policy.\n\n5. Talking about sex doesn\u2019t encourage people to have more sex.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many of the lawmakers who make inaccurate statements about sexual and reproductive health are the same ones who consistently oppose efforts to implement comprehensive sex ed. Indeed, the GOP\u2019s official party platform continues to enshrine abstinence-only education as the best approach for America\u2019s youth.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that conservatives oppose comprehensive sex ed is because they believe it\u2019s inappropriate to expose kids to explicit content about human sexuality. If health classes give teenagers step-by-step instructions for becoming sexually active, that will just end up encouraging them to have more sex, right?\n\nWrong. There\u2019s actually a large body of research that proves teaching kids about sex actually encourages them to delay the first instance of sexual activity. According to one review of comprehensive sex ed programs conducted by a researcher from National Campaign to End Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, these type of programs result in teens delaying sex, having sex less frequently and with fewer partners, and using contraception more consistently. The ongoing resistance to Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage often seems to be rooted in the same discomfort with giving young women the resources they need to be sexually healthy. But there\u2019s no evidence that state-backed efforts to improve reproductive health result in a rash of sexual promiscuity.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "When it comes to reproductive health, the GOP needs to go back to school.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "When it comes to reproductive health, the GOP needs to go back to school.", "title": "Five Important Sex Ed Lessons For Republican Lawmakers", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/24/3200131/sex-education-lessons-republicans/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_18382684.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When it comes to reproductive health, the GOP needs to go back to school.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_18382684-321x214.jpg", "title": "Five Important Sex Ed Lessons For Republican Lawmakers", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_18382684.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_18382684.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T09:10:41+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Particularly in the context of the controversy over Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision, conservatives frequently conflate birth control with abortion.\nHealth Five Important Sex Ed Lessons For Republican Lawmakers CREDIT: ShutterstockThis week, Former Arkansas Gov.\nHere are five important lessons about reproductive health that GOP politicians should commit to memory:1.\nThe so-called \u201cmorning after pill\u201d functions in the same way that the birth control pill does, by attempting to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus.\nRepublicans typically make comments about birth control coverage solely in the context of the government paying for women\u2019s sex lives."}
