Floyd Norris, Zachary Karabell, and Dean Baker have noted how often the CBO gets it wrong, and how it influences policy in damaging ways. I wrote last March in Harper\u2019s Magazine that there should be a shadow CBO to correct and decipher CBO pronouncements.\n\nJared counters that CBO economists are simply following \u201dstate of the art\u201d economics most of the time. What state of the art? Hasn\u2019t confidence in \u201ceconomic science\u201d been sorely tested by the 2008 crash? It should have been tested long before that tragic event. In 2003, Robert Lucas said that we had solved the problems of depression. In 2005, Milton Friedman said that he wondered why so many people were worried about the economy because to him it appeared so stable\u2014this at the height of the subprime mortgage boom. In 2008, Olivier Blanchard said macro was in good shape.\n\nJared notes that the CBO assumes public spending will crowd out private spending as an example of how it follows textbook economics. That\u2019s right, it does, and often entirely incorrectly. Textbook economics is getting a grilling by many macroeconomists these days.\n\nThe point is that the CBO\u2019s mission is all wrong. Jared kind of acknowledges this; he adds in parentheses they should give ranges, not single-point forecasts. But that is not a parenthetical point. It is the heart of the matter.\n\nCBO economists can\u2019t make single-point projections with any confidence, so why do they? These forecasts are often terribly misleading. The recent minimum wage report, as I noted on Next New Deal, is a perfect example. Everyone took the CBO\u2019s midpoint number as an actual projection. Why? Because the CBO said it was in just those words. That is its mandate. In addition, the CBO\u2019s \u201cnon-partisan\u201d label is taken to mean \u201cobjective,\u201d and to non-practitioners, its projections simply reflect some hard, politically unbiased analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Its recent minimum wage report is terribly misleading.
