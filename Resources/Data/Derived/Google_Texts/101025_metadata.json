It\u2019s the worst rate in Florida.\n\nClarissa Carroll lives in Cross City, capital of Dixie County. She\u2019s pregnant with her fourth baby, due in March.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have private insurance, so she drives 35 minutes to neighboring Levy County to see her doctor at a federally funded non-profit clinic in Chiefland. State data show that four out of five women in Dixie leave the county for care.\n\nCarroll's baby is fine now, but initially she went to the clinic every week because the staff couldn\u2019t hear a heartbeat. She says spending that much on gas destroyed her family budget. Her boyfriend is a firefighter in the neighboring county.\n\n\u201cWe try to save as much money for gas as possible,\" Carroll said. \u201cHe can stay at the fire department for free at night, and then I\u2019m just having to worry about gas to get my oldest to school if she doesn\u2019t get the bus on time and prenatal care.\"\n\nHealth News Florida is highlighting details of its Pregnant and Poor investigation all week. See the series here.\n\nBarbara Locke, who runs the health department for Dixie, Gilchrist and Levy counties, said she hears that a lot: women missing doctors' appointments to save gas.\n\n\u201cThey would literally have to decide, 'Am I going to use gas to go my appointment today, or am I going to use gas to go to work?\u201d Locke said.\n\n\u201cOr 'Am I going to use that money to put food on the table tonight?'\u201d added Julie Moderie, director of Healthy Start of North Central Florida.\n\nLocke said she\u2019s worried that too many women will forgo visits to the doctor during the important first trimester.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re going to see some real impacts related to the fact that many health departments have gotten out of prenatal care,\u201d she said.\n\nLocke said the health departments had to drop prenatal care when the state Medicaid program decided to move nearly all Medicaid patients into private HMOs and other managed-care networks. The state stopped covering the costs for health departments, she said, cutting the payment from $130 to $40.\n\nSome federally funded non-profit clinics picked up the slack, but they are few and far between. Not every county has one.\n\nUnder the new statewide Medicaid managed care program, private plans that contract with the state are supposed to provide members access to a doctor and transportation. It is unclear how well that is working.\n\nEven women who have employer-sponsored insurance find themselves putting in the miles to see a doctor. One is 20-year-old Audra Rutherford of the tiny Lafayette County town of Mayo, midway between Gainesville and Tallahassee.\n\nSeven months pregnant, she gets insurance through the family business, Bass Assassin. It makes plastic fishing lures, some with colorful names.\n\n\u201cSo we have drunk monkey, electric chicken, chicken on a chain, slammin\u2019 chicken, electric buzzard, Texas roach, we got all kind of crazy names,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cBut the thing about it is the name sells.\u201d\n\nShe drives an hour and a half to see her obstetrician in Gainesville. It\u2019s a big downside to small-town life in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region.\n\n\u201cI actually know a couple who had to stop on the side of the road while trying to get to Gainesville when they were in labor because it was too far, and that baby was coming,\u201d Rutherford said.\n\nAnd so the couple delivered on the side of the road.\n\n\u201cA lot of men joke, 'Oh, ain\u2019t no worse than delivering a calf.'\" Rutherford disagrees. \"It\u2019s like no, completely different, completely different.\u201d\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
