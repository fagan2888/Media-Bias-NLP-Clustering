Americans could expect when signing up for Obamacare, Becerra says. | Rod Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO Becerra: ACA message hard to grasp

Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) argued Wednesday that Obamacare supporters have struggled to win public opinion because people weren’t able to see their insurance options until October.

“The insurance companies, right after we passed the bill in 2010, couldn’t tell Americans what they would charge. We didn’t know how many states would participate with their own exchanges or how many would default,” he said during a POLITICO Health Care Breakfast Briefing. “There was no way to tell Americans to expect what they would sign up for.”

Becerra also argued that spending on efforts to market the law to new customers has been far smaller in scale than what a comparable private sector effort would be.

“We don’t spend money to market a lot of what we do because it’s taxpayers’ money,” he said.

Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) rejected that argument and said the marketing efforts by Obamacare proponents have simply been ineffective. She referenced one of the most circulated — and derided — ad images.

“I saw Pajama Boy, you all did. I don’t think they’ve done a very good job,” she said.

Stephen Parente, a University of Minnesota expert on health finance, argued that the Democratic message was a harder sell in part because the law was built on Republican principles, like relying on private sector coverage and the individual mandate.

“That doesn’t sell very well as health care for all,” he said.
