The hospital, owned by Clark County, had two rounds of layoffs affecting 390 positions and announced it would close four clinics.\n\nAmid the crisis, the hospital appointed a new CEO, Lawrence Barnard, and a new governing board. Their job is to turn around the troubled hospital and make it self-supporting without a Clark County subsidy.\n\nIt\u2019s a big challenge and one that public hospitals across America have been tackling for years.\n\nFinances\n\nNew Leadership: Lawrence Barnard He was named UMC\u2019s interim CEO in January after Brian Brannman left for an executive position at Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican. Barnard was given the full-time job in February. A West Point graduate, Barnard peppers his speeches with military anecdotes. He also has an MBA from the University of Southern California. Prior to joining UMC in 2012, he worked as an administrator at Summerlin and Valley hospitals. At 35, he is the youngest CEO at UMC in at least 15 years.\n\nUMC\u2019s biggest problem is its defining feature. It\u2019s the safety net for Las Vegas\u2019 poor and uninsured. That means the hospital provides medical care for which it is paid just pennies on the dollar, or not paid at all. The hospital wrote off 16 percent of its gross charges as charity care in 2013, twice the average of other Las Vegas hospitals.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also has led to painful side effects. Thousands of patients who received medical care through Clark County Social Services moved into Medicaid. And Medicaid reimburses the hospital at a rate 30 percent lower than social services. The shift cost the hospital about $15 million in lower reimbursement payments.\n\nAnother challenge is the hospital\u2019s contracts with insurance companies, which often don\u2019t pay enough for procedures for the hospital to turn a profit.\n\nTo help cover the hospital\u2019s losses, Clark County provides tens of millions of dollars in annual subsidies, including $70 million this year. Commissioners have told hospital executives that number will be cut to $40 million next year, prompting the layoffs.\n\nPrescription: The hospital always will have uninsured patients, but it can do more to bring in better-paying patients to even out the mix, Barnard said. That partly means improving relationships with local doctors who choose which hospitals their patients go to for surgeries.\n\nBarnard also is working to renegotiate the hospital\u2019s contracts with insurers to be more favorable to UMC and improve its core operations, including bill collections and average patient stays.\n\nPoliticians are looking at creating a special property tax to support UMC. Tax increases are a tough political sell, but the issue could come up at the Legislature next year.\n\nReputation\n\nIf you\u2019re shot, stabbed or in a bad car crash, you\u2019ll be glad UMC\u2019s trauma center exists. It\u2019s the only top-flight trauma center in the valley. It\u2019s where Sen. Harry Reid went after a car accident in 2012 and it\u2019s where the president\u2019s medical team sets up when he\u2019s in town.\n\nBut too many people avoid UMC for less serious medical care because they consider it a place only for the poor and uninsured, Barnard said.\n\nPrescription: Fixing UMC\u2019s reputation starts with consistent care, Barnard said. Patients who have a good experience at UMC are more likely to come back and more likely to recommend the hospital to friends.\n\nThe hospital also would benefit from borrowing UNLV\u2019s branding if the university launches a medical school.\n\nLeadership\n\nThe Clark County Commission has the final say on UMC\u2019s budget. But few politicians have been willing to invest the enormous amount of time required to figure out long-term fixes.\n\nPrescription: Commissioners fought bitterly over whether to shift UMC oversight to an independent board. They eventually approved the board, which took office in January. It includes industry professionals in medicine, finance, law and labor. The idea is this board will have more time than commissioners to become specialists in hospital operations.\n\nThe group has been working on a hospital master plan but has no deadline to finish.\n\nCapital improvements\n\nUMC needs about $14 million a year to replace aging equipment and keep up its buildings. But over the past two years, it has received less than half that from Clark County. That means the hospital doesn\u2019t always have the equipment doctors want, and equipment is being used beyond its recommended life span.\n\nPrescription: To find money for equipment, UMC first must reverse its operating losses. That would allow the hospital to shift Clark County\u2019s subsidy from operations to equipment.\n\nThe hospital also could launch fundraising campaigns for specific divisions, such as the children\u2019s hospital.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nPublic hospitals often use charitable contributions as a key revenue source. But UMC hasn\u2019t had much success in this area.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s charitable foundation has had financial troubles of its own and didn\u2019t file tax returns for three straight years, leading to the loss of its nonprofit status. It gave UMC $235,000 in 2009 and no money in 2008, according to its two most recent tax returns.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s poor reputation remains a major challenge to fundraising. People are less willing to donate if they aren\u2019t sure their money will be spent well.\n\nPrescription: UMC needs donors for equipment and building improvements, not just to keep the lights on. That means launching targeted campaigns for specific divisions.\n\nIn Atlanta, the public health system became a nonprofit and launched a new fundraising campaign. Since 2009, the Atlanta system has raised more than $100 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Finding a prescription to make the public hospital financially viable has vexed executives and politicians for more than  a decade, and over the past year, UMC\u2019s problems have grown even more acute.
