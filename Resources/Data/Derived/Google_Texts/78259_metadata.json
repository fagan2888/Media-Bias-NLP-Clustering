I\u2019ll show you that in a second.\u201d\n\nHealth reform: The Affordable Care Act \u201creally kicks in in \u201816. Obama\u2019s gonna be out playing golf. He might even be on one of my courses. I would invite him. \u2026 I have the best courses in the world.\u201d\n\nBorder security: \u201cI would build a Great Wall. And nobody builds walls better than me. \u2026 And I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively.\u201d\n\nTerrorism: \u201cIslamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast. They\u2019ve become rich. I\u2019m in competition with them.\u201d\n\nChina: \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid. I like China. I just sold an apartment for $15 million.\u201d\n\nMexico: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. \u2026 They\u2019re sending people who have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems [to] us. \u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs; they\u2019re bringing crime; they\u2019re rapists; and some, I assume are good people.\u201d\n\nShulman didn\u2019t even bother to respond to Trump\u2019s remarks. For, as Napoleon reputedly said, \u201cNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ann Coulter, with whom I used to appear on air when we were regulars on MSNBC, tweeted out Thursday that \u201cTrump is surging in the polls for saying what other GOPs too stupid to say.\u201d\n\nWell, The Donald has indeed vaulted into second place behind Jeb Bush among Republican presidential contenders in the latest CNN/ORC poll. But it has little to do what he is saying, and much to do with his celebrity.\n\nIndeed, if the soi-disant conservative Republican Caitlin Jenner announced that she was joining the crowded GOP field, she, too, would probably enjoy an initial surge in the polls.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the GOP\u2019s electable presidential candidates need not worry about Trump\u2019s poll numbers. They should.\n\nBut not because he has remotest chance of capturing the party\u2019s nomination (U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes rates him a 33-1 shot). But because his poll numbers just might remain high enough for him to be included in GOP primary debates.\n\nThat would be a nuisance the party\u2019s serious candidates don\u2019t need. Because they almost certainly would spend much of primary season undoing the damage to the Republican brand that The Donald almost certainly would do.\n\nAlready Republicans have had to distance themselves from Trump\u2019s rant about Mexican immigrants \u2013 which was, at best, xenophobic, and, worst, racist. And we can expect more of the same from the plutocrat who would be president when campaign season begins in earnest.\n\nRunning for president is serious business. Donald Trump threatens to turn it into a farce. As Napoleon also said: \u201cThere is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: The plutocrat who would be president | trump, donald, gop, president, presidential, best, republican, party, bringing, need", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JOSEPH PERKINS", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "\u201cShort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d That\u2019s how the late, great Spy magazine hilariously described Donald Trump, the megalomaniacal billionaire who has a seeming obsessive-compulsive need to stick his name on everything he owns.", "title": "The plutocrat who would be president", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/trump-669895-donald-gop.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nqvpoi-b88451221z.120150702141234000gkkam50r.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nqvpoi-b88451221z.120150702141234000gkkam50r.10.jpg"}, "description": "\u201cShort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d That\u2019s how the late, great Spy magazine hilariously described Donald Trump, the megalomaniacal billionaire who has a seeming obsessive-compulsive need to stick his na", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The plutocrat who would be president"}, "content_author": "JOSEPH PERKINS", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nqvpoi-b88451221z.120150702141234000gkkam50r.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "trump, donald, gop, president, presidential, best, republican, party, bringing, need", "publication_date": "2015-07-02", "access-type": "free", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "The plutocrat who would be president"}, "article_summary": "And we can expect more of the same from the plutocrat who would be president when campaign season begins in earnest.\nThe economy: \u201cI\u2019ll be the best jobs president God ever created.\u201dCampaign finance: \u201cI\u2019m really rich.\nThe Donald \u2013 as first wife Ivana nicknamed him \u2013 announced a fortnight ago his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\nDonald Trump threatens to turn it into a farce.\nI\u2019m in competition with them.\u201dChina: \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid."}
