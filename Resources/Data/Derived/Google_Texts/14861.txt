Allowing cheaper health plans designed to cover just half of medical costs to be sold on the exchanges would result in 350,000 additional individuals enrolling in coverage in the next decade, according to an analysis (PDF) by Avalere Health.Because of associated lower premiums for such plans, the federal government would spend $5.8 billion less on subsidies by 2024. But it would also take in $5.5 billion less in fines from individuals and companies that failed to meet the mandates of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . The net impact would be a $300 million reduction in the deficit over the course of a decade.
