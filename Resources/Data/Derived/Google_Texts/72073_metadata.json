Utah Republican Mike Lee, a leader in the conservative movement, isn\u2019t sold on the so-called budget reconciliation procedure to gut the law. Rand Paul says he\u2019s for repeal but is hedging on exactly how to do it.\n\nMitch McConnell, who may enjoy a 54 vote Senate Republican majority by January, won\u2019t commit to using the simple majority vote to kill Obamacare. And none of the Republican 2016 presidential candidates are pushing hard for the more radical Senate procedures to repeal the health care law.\n\nInterviews with a wide range of key figures in the Senate and within the conservative movement show that while the party may be united rhetorically on repealing Obamacare, Republicans are surprisingly squishy on exactly how to do it.\n\nThe most popular response is to say, \u201cyes, I\u2019m for repeal,\u201d but without saying how. Paul spokesman Brian Darling says the Kentucky senator \u201cis committed one hundred percent to a full repeal,\u201d but added that \u201cusing regular order or reconciliation or both is an inside the beltway fight.\u201d And Steve Daines, the newly elected senator from Montana, said through a spokesman only that he \u201csupports fully repealing Obamacare\u201d and \u201cwill closely examine how to most effectively achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even address the moderates like Maine Republican Susan Collins, or politically vulnerable blue state Republicans who are up for re-election in 2016. Collins just got re-elected, and now her spokesman, Kevin Kelley, says Collins \u201cdoesn\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible to outright repeal the entire law\u201d and that Congress should spend its time just trying to fix its worst flaws.\n\nThe only sure thing for Republicans at this point is that there will be a vote on a standalone repeal bill, probably early in the year. And even though virtually all Republicans will vote for it, the bill will fall short of a filibuster-proof 60 in the Senate.\n\nThe real question is what happens after that. If the Republicans decide to declare all-out war, as Cruz wants, they could set up a simple majority vote on repeal under the budget reconciliation rules. The upside of this move is that it would get to Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 and he would veto it, which is exactly what many conservative activists want. The downside, however, is significant: Such a move would quickly dominate the Senate, divide Republicans and become a PR disaster.\n\nThe other option is just to focus on the most unpopular pieces of the law, like knocking out the individual mandate, the medical device tax, the definition of full-time work as 30-hours a week, and possibly a \u201crisk corridors\u201d provision that gives extra payments to health insurers that attract too many sick patients.\n\nThat\u2019s the approach McConnell and other Senate GOP leaders have talked about the most, and Republican aides say that strategy would have the advantage of attracting Democratic votes.\n\nBut Cruz is the most vocal member of a small group that believes any serious repeal attempt must use every possible legislative tool to put a bill on Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 not just the 60-vote strategy that they know will fail. Cruz, the architect of last year\u2019s government shutdown over Obamacare, told Fox News on election night that \u201cI think we should start by using [budget] reconciliation to pass complete and total repeal.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio, another potential 2016 presidential candidate, is one of the few leaving the door open to the budget reconciliation approach. He told a Denver talk show host last month that \u201cI think we need to do it any way we can to get it done.\u201d\n\nHeritage Action\u2019s Dan Holler said the use of reconciliation \u201csignals a seriousness\u201d that the GOP would wipe the law off the books if they win the White House in 2016. At least one of the new GOP senators, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, is on board with that plan, at least in a rhetorical way. Rob Skjonsberg, who managed his campaign and is now the director of his transition team, says Rounds wants to \u201crepeal and replace as much of Obamacare as possible through the budget process.\u201d\n\nBut the skeptics seem to outnumber the Cruz camp at this point. Lee, a tea party favorite, wants to have \u201cas many bites at the apple as possible,\u201d according to an aide \u2014 but he also wants more information on how much of the health care law the Senate could actually repeal through budget rules. The process can only be used for legislation that has some impact on spending and revenues \u2014 which includes most of the biggest pieces of Obamacare, like the individual mandate and subsidies for health insurance, but not all of it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His fellow conservatives aren\u2019t all jumping on board with the repeal movement.", "title": "Ted Cruz out on a limb on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/ted-cruz-obamacare-repeal-112791.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/11/141111_ted_cruz_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "politics,ted cruz,obamacare,Health Care,congress,barack obama,affordable care act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His fellow conservatives aren\u2019t all jumping on board with the repeal movement.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1f6\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz is still ready to use any means necessary to repeal Obamacare.\nStory Continued BelowWhile Cruz wants to use a draconian budget measure to repeal Obamacare with just 51 votes in the Senate, he looks to be increasingly out on a limb.\nMitch McConnell, who may enjoy a 54 vote Senate Republican majority by January, won\u2019t commit to using the simple majority vote to kill Obamacare.\nIf the Republicans decide to declare all-out war, as Cruz wants, they could set up a simple majority vote on repeal under the budget reconciliation rules.\nBut even his fellow conservatives aren\u2019t all jumping on board \u2013 a sign that the Republican repeal or bust movement is struggling while Obamacare continues to enroll millions of people with health insurance."}
