Because the funds are not subject to annual appropriations, they will continue to be available to states that need to pay employees and contractors and buy equipment and supplies.\n\nWhat is even less clear is the ability of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to operate a federal data \"hub\" that underpins both the state-run exchanges and the 34 state exchanges that fall under the purview of the administration.\n\nThe possibility of a federal government shutdown became more likely late last week, when congressional Republicans voted to fund the government but not the implementation of Obama's healthcare law.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate is unlikely to go along. If the two chambers cannot agree on a spending bill by Sept. 30, it will trigger a government shutdown the next day.\n\nPrevious shutdowns, as well as a memo issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week, shed some light on how another one would affect the rollout of the ACA.\n\nOMB told federal agencies that they could continue to run \"entitlement programs, such as social security benefits, for which an indefinite appropriation provides the funding.\"\n\nDuring the longest government shutdown, from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan.6, 1996, similar procedure allowed almost all employees of the Social Security Administration to continue working (and get paid), because Social Security \"is a permanent program\" that does not require annual appropriations from Congress to operate, said Van de Water.\n\nThe benefits established under the healthcare reform law, including federal subsidies to help people pay insurance premiums, \"are also entitlements provided in permanent law,\" he said. \"Under the OMB memo it seems highly likely that CMS would conclude that the people necessary to carry out the ACA could continue to work.\"\n\nFederal employees working on Obamacare could therefore keep reporting to their desks even if they are not deemed \"essential.\" OMB defines essential employees as those \"providing for the national security,\" which means the military continues to operate during a government shutdown, or \"the safety of life and property,\" which means people such as meat inspectors, FBI agents and federal prison guards remain on the job.\n\nCMS referred questions about who would work and what ACA-related functions would be affected by a shutdown to OMB. In a statement, OMB spokesman Steven Posner said \"agencies are still in the process of reviewing relevant legal requirements and updating their plans. Determinations about specific programs are being actively reviewed as agencies undertake this process.\"\n\nKEEPING THE HUB OPEN\n\nAnother key question concerns how a shutdown would affect Obamacare's core information technology (IT) component, called the federal data services hub.\n\nThe hub funnels personal information, such as income, from databases at the Internal Revenue Service, other federal agencies and private data companies back to the state exchanges, indicating whether someone is eligible for federal subsidies to purchase health insurance.\n\n\"I have not been provided any information from CMS on whether the hub would operate\" in the event of a government shutdown, said Rocky King, executive director of Cover Oregon, that state's Obamacare marketplace.\n\nThat will depend on how CMS interprets OMB's directive in two areas: contractors and information technology.\n\nContractors led by CGI Group Inc and Quality Software Services Inc have built and will operate much of the information technology (IT) underpinning the exchanges. Even if the data hub is allowed to operate during a government shutdown, \"it needs continuous maintenance,\" said Michael Marchand, spokesman for Washington Health Plan Finder, that state's ACA marketplace.\n\nOMB says that a contractor \"may continue to proceed with its work\" during a shutdown if the agency it's working for \"already obligated funds representing the entire price under a contract\" before the shutdown.\n\n\"This seems to say that if there is an issued contract, the contractors can keep working,\" said Van de Water.\n\nCMS declined to say whether the IT contracts for Obamacare meet that criterion.\n\nIT operations are allowed to continue only under limited circumstances, according to the OMB memo. One circumstance is if \"their continuation is necessarily implied from a congressional authorization or appropriation of other continued functions.\"\n\nStates running their own Obamacare exchanges are also uncertain about whether their own employees will get paid in the event of a shutdown, and whether they will have access to the federal grants that support their operations. The ambiguity stems from the fact that the grants, totaling tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, did not come in the form of a lump payment deposited in a state's bank account.\n\n\"These are draw-down grants so the money is not in our bank,\" said Oregon's King, referring to a system in which the federal government deposits funds in accounts that states draw from as expenses are incurred. \"No information has been shared with me that we would be prevented from continuing that draw-down, but I just don't know.\"\n\nKevin Counihan, chief of Connecticut's Access Health CT exchange, said he should have enough money to operate for about four months in the event of a shutdown. Should the federal data hub not be operational, the state could still accept applications, he said. Officials in Colorado also said their exchange would function, but the state would have to make adjustments if the shutdown was prolonged.\n\nFederal payments to subsidize insurance for eligible buyers - those with incomes less than four times the federal poverty level, or $62,040 for a couple - would not be in jeopardy because they are due just before coverage begins, not when someone enrolls. Anyone buying health insurance by Dec. 15, 2013, is covered as of Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Sharon Begley and Lewis Krauskopf                 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. State officials behind  the launch of President Barac...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-22 15:09:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "By Sharon Begley and Lewis Krauskopf                 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. State officials behind  the launch of President Barac...", "title": "Officials: Obamacare Exchanges Could Weather Gov't Shutdown", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/21/obamacare-government-shutdown_n_3968520.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366397/images/o-OBAMACARE-GOVERNMENT-SHUTDOWN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366397/images/o-OBAMACARE-GOVERNMENT-SHUTDOWN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Officials: Obamacare Exchanges Could Weather Gov't Shutdown", "description": "By Sharon Begley and Lewis Krauskopf                 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. State officials behind  the launch of President Barac...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-21 15:09:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3968520", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,health care exchanges,obamacare,obamacare government shutdown,Government Shutdown,reuters,Affordable Care Act,medicare,medicaid,health care,obamacare exchanges", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "video,health care exchanges,obamacare,obamacare government shutdown,Government Shutdown,reuters,Affordable Care Act,medicare,medicaid,health care,obamacare exchanges", "published_time": "2013-09-21 15:09:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-11-21 05:12:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6e4\"", "article_summary": "Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care.\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody.\nWhat do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get?\nWhen the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands.\nCMS referred questions about who would work and what ACA-related functions would be affected by a shutdown to OMB."}
