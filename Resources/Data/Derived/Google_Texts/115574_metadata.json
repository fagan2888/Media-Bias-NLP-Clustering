Last season, he connected on 25-of-26 field goal attempts, including six from beyond 50 yards.\n\nFrom Madden Ratings Czar Donny Moore:\n\nIt was a banner year for Prater, as he kicked the longest field goal in NFL history by booting a 64-yarder against the Titans. That\u2019s worthy of a 99 KPW (kicking power) rating.\n\nChicago\u2019s Robbie Gould and Baltimore\u2019s Justin Tucker are next among kickers, each receiving a rating of 93.\n\nMiami Dolphins\u2019 Brandon Fields (96) is the top-ranked punter in the game, followed by San Francisco\u2019s Andy Lee (95).\n\nPrater is the fourth Broncos player to be ranked in the top five in their respective positions (EA released its list of kickers and punters together \u2014 Britton Colquitt may very well be in the top five among punters). Peyton Manning is the top overall quarterback, Von Miller is the top outside linebacker and T.J. Ward is the No. 3 strong safety.\n\nMadden NFL 15 will be released Aug. 26 for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver Broncos,EA Sports,Madden,madden nfl,Madden NFL 15,Matt Prater", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Game On", "description": "Booting the longest field goal in NFL history has netted Denver Broncos' Matt Prater the top rating among kickers in Madden NFL 15, Electronic Arts announced Saturday.", "title": "Matt Prater, Broncos kicker, ranked top kicker in Madden NFL 15", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/2014/08/04/matt-prater-broncos-kicker-ranked-top-kicker-madden-nfl-15/9478/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/files/2014/08/madden-ratings-matt-prater.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Booting the longest field goal in NFL history has netted Denver Broncos' Matt Prater the top rating among kickers in Madden NFL 15, Electronic Arts announced Saturday.", "title": "Matt Prater, Broncos kicker, ranked top kicker in Madden NFL 15", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/2014/08/04/matt-prater-broncos-kicker-ranked-top-kicker-madden-nfl-15/9478/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/videogames/files/2014/08/madden-ratings-matt-prater.jpg", "creator": "@JoeNguyen", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Booting the longest field goal in NFL history has netted Denver Broncos' Matt Prater the top rating among kickers in Madden NFL 15."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc823\"", "article_summary": "Booting the longest field goal in NFL history has help netted Denver Broncos\u2019 Matt Prater the top rating among kickers in Madden NFL 15, Electronic Arts announced Saturday.\nMadden NFL 15 will be released Aug. 26 for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.\nLast season, he connected on 25-of-26 field goal attempts, including six from beyond 50 yards.\nFrom Madden Ratings Czar Donny Moore:It was a banner year for Prater, as he kicked the longest field goal in NFL history by booting a 64-yarder against the Titans.\nThe 29-year-old Prater received a 95 overall rating in the game."}
