That is not the language they use, of course, but the intent is clear: to discredit her with progressives and liberals alike.\n\nIn 2015 it became apparent that Republicans were pursuing just this strategy, as left wing environmental hero Bill MicKibben dutifully retweeted Republican propaganda aimed at Clinton.\n\nThe actual culprit is a group called America Rising, which aims its posts on social media not at conservatives but at liberals, as The New York Times pointed out last spring, \u201cdesigned to be spotted, and shared, by liberals.\u201d\n\nBecause all Democrats know that friends of Wall Street are Republicans. Right? So Republicans are quick to point out to Democratic voters that Hillary Clinton has close ties to Wall Street. Except if true this ought to make her a great choice for Republicans.\n\nThey are not alone. The Times pointed also to American Crossroads, run by none other than Karl Rove, who, if prone to the errors of Republican math, seems to understand liberal math quite well.\n\nKen Goldstein of the University of San Francisco says, \u201cPolitics is usually basic math, and this is a little bit of calculus, thinking a couple steps ahead.\u201d\n\nInsidious might be another term for it. Republican attacks on Clinton are far less likely to be successful than attacks from the left, and the advent of Bernie Sanders\u2019 population has already highlighted Clinton\u2019s vulnerability among the more progressive, young white male demographic.\n\nNeedless to say, Republicans have no limited their attacks to Clinton from one direction only. During the debates, they accused her of being a socialist, and Fox Nation implied the same in January \u2013 which is impossible if she is what they are telling liberals and progressives on social media \u2013 if what Bill McKibben is retweeting \u2013 is true.\n\nThis only goes to prove that Republicans will do and say anything they can to put roadblocks in Clinton\u2019s way. The smart play for the Clinton camp is to refuse to let Republicans have it both ways.\n\nIn February, Eric Bolling said on Fox News that Clinton is \u201can undeclared socialist as opposed to the unabashed socialist, Sanders.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have grown used to controlling the political discourse in this country, thanks to Fox News and a right-leaning mainstream media. Their attacks on Clinton, Sanders, and Trump, have been all over the place, a catch-as-catch-can collection of insults.\n\nWhat Republicans have perhaps not thought through is that this tactic can rebound on them. If she is, as Bolling says, a socialist, Republican opposition makes sense. But if Hillary is such a Republican, why should Republican voters hesitate to vote for her?\n\nAfter all, from the sounds of it, if you want a reasonable \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate to put against Trump, why not Clinton, who is far more qualified than either Rubio or Cruz? She may lack the religious bona fides, but those voters have already mostly gone to Trump\u2019s camp.\n\nThe facts are really irrelevant here. Perception is. And it is perception that Republicans are pushing on liberal social media while pushing another, diametrically opposed perception, on the mainstream media.\n\nSome Democrats might say, \u201cSo what? It\u2019s true.\u201d But which is true? Are you going to let Republicans have it both ways? Shouldn\u2019t you insist they decide which facts are actual facts?\n\nEven Bernie Sanders has said Hillary \u201csounds like a Republican\u201d when it comes to healthcare reform, but take into consideration that Republicans accuse Obama of being a socialist or communist over the president\u2019s signature healthcare reform that unofficially bears his name.\n\nNow what?\n\nTo add to the confusion, Obamacare is essentially a Republican idea \u2013 as Obama himself has pointed out \u2013 but one Republicans have disavowed. So is Obamacare no longer to be spoken of as Republican? If support of Obamacare makes you a Republican, is Obama a Republican?\n\nClinton has described herself as a moderate. Obama is so moderate that some analysts have described him as more of an old school Republican than a Democrat, while today\u2019s Republicans assail him as a socialist or communist. Whatever he is, however he is to be described, Clinton sounds a lot like him.\n\nThe Times cites Colin Reed, America Rising\u2019s executive director, who says, \u201cThe idea is to make her life difficult in the primary and challenge her from the left.\u201d And here is the give-away:\n\n\u201c[S]o if we have opportunities \u2013 creative ways, especially online \u2013 to push her from the left, we\u2019ll do it just to show those folks who she needs to turn out that she\u2019s not in line with them.\u201d\n\nExcept that what you\u2019re telling America publicly, through Fox News and the mainstream media, is that she\u2019s a socialist \u2013 and is in line with them.\n\nFor example, compare those words with what Jeff Bechdel, spokesperson for the conservative America Rising PAC said in a statement as recently as January:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is obvious Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t want to get into the differences between a Democrat and a socialist, and the reason is simple: there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nThis is a statement clearly aimed at Republican voters: Hillary is a socialist. Yet to Democrats they are saying Hillary is a Republican.\n\nRepublicans want it both ways, to claim Clinton is one thing to Democrats and another to Republicans, but if she is the socialist they decry, she certainly is not the Republican they claim.\n\nIt is up to Democrats, so far less prone to tests of ideological purity, to make Republicans choose their argument, to expose their duplicity to their own voters. It is up to Democrats, when Republicans try their math on left-leaning voters, to ensure that at least one of their arguments rebounds on them.\n\nSo they talk out of both sides of their mouth. The question is, which is it, Republicans? Is Hillary Clinton a socialist, or is she a Republican?\n\nThis is a question Democrats must answer. It is bad enough Republicans get away with defining their reality; they cannot be allowed to define ours as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America Rising is telling Democrats that Clinton is \"not in  line with them\" yet on Fox News, America Rising says Clinton is a socialist", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "America Rising is telling Democrats that Clinton is \"not in  line with them\" yet on Fox News, America Rising says Clinton is a socialist", "title": "Republican Hypocrites Can't Decide Whether Hillary Clinton is a Socialist", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/03/06/fox-news-repugs-clinton-socialist-social-media.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-ad-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-06T11:18:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2016-03-06T07:58:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-06T11:18:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe60df\"", "article_summary": "Is Hillary Clinton a socialist, or is she a Republican?\nBut if Hillary is such a Republican, why should Republican voters hesitate to vote for her?\nSo Republicans are quick to point out to Democratic voters that Hillary Clinton has close ties to Wall Street.\nRepublicans are eager to portray Hillary Clinton to Democratic voters as a Republican.\nIf she is, as Bolling says, a socialist, Republican opposition makes sense."}
