What could have been \u2013 and might yet still be \u2013 a valuable opportunity to discuss and begin to address a very real issue has been commandeered by those who would frame the conversation as one in which protesters are accused of trying to limit the free speech of their peers. These first amendment enthusiasts are either unaware or unconcerned with the persistent racial inequality that prevents students of color from even accessing this right in the first place. And yet, critics would rather focus on an imagined denial of rights to the dominant group, instead of the legitimate and persistent denial of rights to the oppressed.\n\nPaul Krugman at The New York Times points out in Health Reform Lives! that there would eventually be negatives with Obamacare but that we should be reasonable about them:\n\nWithout question, the run of unexpectedly good news for Obamacare has come to an end, as all such runs must. And look, we\u2019re talking about a brand-new system in which everyone is still learning how to function. There were bound to be some bobbles along the way. But are we looking at the beginnings of a death spiral? Some people are indeed saying that, but as far as I can tell, they\u2019re all people who have been predicting disaster every step of the way, and will still be predicting imminent collapse a decade from now. The reality is that Obamacare is an imperfect system, but it\u2019s workable \u2014 and it\u2019s working.\n\nE.J. Dionne is a cheery, hopeful sort most of the time and he sets out some optimism in his latest column at The Washington Post\u2014America\u2019s leaders are hurting the nation\u2019s image. He only saves his audience from a major round of ROTFL with a big caveat:\n\nThe often chaotic budget and debt-ceiling battles between the president and congressional Republicans (along with a great deal of demagoguery on immigration, race and Islam) have inspired little confidence among either friends or foes that we can manage even our own affairs. The coming mid-December deadline for reaching a budget agreement should thus be seen as more than just another inning in a long fiscal game. Congress has an opportunity to show that it takes all this world leadership talk seriously. It needs to demonstrate that even though the voters have given the presidency to one party and control of Congress to the other, we are still capable of being at least a functional democracy. At the great risk of overestimating our politicians, there is a good chance that they might pass the test. Merely writing such a sentence produces instant shivers of doubt, but this time, political calculation may be on the side of good government.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s editorial board is rarely known itself for smart politics, so it is a tad ironic that it titles its stance on the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination: Hillary Clinton smartly distances herself from Obama when it comes to dealing with ISIS/Daesh. It will also be most interesting to see how avid supporters of both President Obama who have chastised other Democrats for \u201crunning away from Obama\u201d will deal with Clinton\u2019s take in the matter:\n\nWhat is a bit more surprising, perhaps, or at least counterintuitive, is that the likely 2016 Democratic presidential nominee has put distance between herself and Mr. Obama. Not only is Hillary Clinton a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s party, but she is also his former secretary of state, closely linked to his foreign policy record. Yet in a speech Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations, Ms. Clinton described the Islamic State as \u201cdemonstrating new . . . reach and capabilities,\u201d and the appropriate U.S. policy goal as \u201cnot to deter or contain\u201d the group but to \u201cdefeat and destroy\u201d it. The contrast between Ms. Clinton\u2019s remarks and Mr. Obama\u2019s more limited objectives and more upbeat progress report was implicit but clear. And it was appropriate. Ms. Clinton has a strong claim to express her differences with Mr. Obama, since it\u2019s well-known that she argued them privately during her time in the administration, especially about how to handle Syria.\n\nMany activists may skeptically view Suzy Khimm\u2019s take at The New Republic in The Left's Green Lantern Problem. But she\u2019s right that there hasn\u2019t been anywhere nearly enough focus by the left on down-ballot contests, which is a focus that those of us who have launched Crowdsourcing the 50-State Strategy. That project is not simply a move to elect more congressional progressives and state legislators but also to reinforce crucial movement work around issues of inequality, police violence and climate change. Khimm writes:\n\nElecting a new Democrat to the White House in 2017 won\u2019t likely mean big policy changes, but rather holding the line against Republican attacks and pushing far more incremental reforms through execution action. That is essential, of course, and the threat of unified Republican governance is reason enough for progressives to invest deeply in electing a Democrat to the White House. But the only way to achieve anything approximating the kind of change that the rising left wants to see\u2014or Hillary, for that matter\u2014is by wresting back control of Congress and the states. To believe otherwise essentially relies on the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency. This, as political scientist Brendan Nyhan defined it to Vox, is the idea \u201cthat the president can achieve any political or policy objective if only he tries hard enough or uses the right tactics.\u201d The real road to progressive victory doesn\u2019t run through the White House in 2016, but the states in 2020. Those races will decide who controls the next round of redistricting\u2014and whether Republicans can largely lock down majorities in state capitals and Washington for another decade, as they did after their sweeping wins in 2010. \u201cIn Congress, the Tea Party lunatics have taken over the asylum,\u201d says Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party. \u201cIt\u2019s state legislatures where progressives need to win back power.\u201d\n\nJohn Nichols at The Nation gives some much needed historical pushback to the the pathetic and opportunistic xenophobes in Muslims Have Been Living in America Since Before the Revolutionary War:\n\n\ufeff As a young journalist, I wrote a good deal about the rural Muslim and Jewish farm communities of the Midwest. I met the children and grandchildren of those Muslim farmers from the Dakotas, and from eastern Iowa, where the Mother Mosque of America was constructed in 1934 in Cedar Rapids. As a reporter for the Toledo Blade, I came to know Yehia \u201cJohn\u201d Shousher and other Muslims who built a pioneering mosque in the city\u2019s \u201cLittle Syria\u201d neighborhood more than six decades ago. Later, they constructed one of the great mosques in North America, the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, at which people from dozens of countries proudly celebrate their community\u2019s \u201cequal and vibrant representation of women and the democratic and constitutional processes that the Center diligently follows.\u201d It is because I have spent so much time in these mosques, because I have for so long known them as part of the fabric of the communities where I have lived, of the regions I love, of an American experiment I have treasured, that I was shaken by Donald Trump\u2019s crude claim that \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely no choice\u201d but to monitor mosques, to consider closing some of them, to begin tracking Muslims using \u201csurveillance, including a watch list.\u201d\n\nSasha Abramsky at The Nation writes The GOP Stampede Toward Fascism After the Paris Attacks:\n\n\ufeffThere is an odor of early fascism, or rather of the hysteria that precedes the march away from democracy, to much of this Trumpian rhetoric. An odor of the street fight. An odor of the iron fist. It is an acrid smell, a mid-century aroma tinted with totalitarianism and historical ignorance. No society can protect its open, pluralistic politics by thoughtlessly clamping down on civil liberties. No country can seriously sustain its claim to being a beacon for human liberty if its most demagogic forces are unleashed against vulnerable, hungry, scared, and desperate refugees. In my mind\u2019s eye, I see the young child drowned in the Mediterranean, the photographs of whom, just a few weeks back, captured the world\u2019s attention and, quite rightly, tugged at our collective heartstrings. I see the families who get off airplanes after odysseys of thousands of miles, pick up their worldly belongings\u2014usually just two or three suitcases\u2014and, with the help of organizations such as the International Rescue Committee, are given a chance to start lives anew, welcomed into communities around the country. I see all of our better instincts at work in helping these men, women, and children start afresh. And now, competing with these images, I see something uglier being unleashed. I see powerful figures such as Trump beating up on helpless refugee children. I see a stampede on the right to exploit a catastrophe, to exploit the war crimes of madmen, for partisan political gain.\n\nJohn Kiriakou writes at Other Words How the Government Made Me a Dissident:\n\nI sometimes say the government turned me into a dissident \u2014 after I spent 14 years at the CIA and two more at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I only say it half-jokingly. While I\u2019m proud of winning this year\u2019s PEN Center\u2019s First Amendment award, I never intended to make a career out of being at odds with the government. Sometimes, though \u2014 like when I spent two years in prison for blowing the whistle on the CIA\u2019s torture program \u2014 it\u2019s felt like the government\u2019s gone out of its way to be at odds with me. And it\u2019s clear that our government demonizes people who disagree with the official line. Things got bad for anyone who disagrees with the official line right after 9/11.\n\nTheo Anderson at In These Times writes What Is Actually Radical About Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic Socialism Isn\u2019t the Socialism:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Gayatri Devi at The Guardian\u00a0notes that creationism from the mouths of right-wing politicians is not about belief in divine origian, but rather something more worldly:\u00a0Creationism isn't just an ideolo", "title": "Abbreviated pundit roundup: Muslims have been Americans since U.S. began; the 'Green Lantern' snare", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/23/1453307/-Abbreviated-pundit-roundup-Muslims-have-been-Americans-since-U-S-began-the-Green-Lantern-snare", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/180227/story_image/muslim-girl-with-us-flag.jpg?1448253617", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Gayatri Devi at The Guardian\u00a0notes that creationism from the mouths of right-wing politicians is not about belief in divine origian, but rather something more worldly:\u00a0Creationism isn't just an ide...", "creator": "@Meteor_Blades", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/180227/story_image/muslim-girl-with-us-flag.jpg?1448253617"}, "title": "Abbreviated pundit roundup: Muslims have been Americans since U.S. began; the 'Green Lantern' snare", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "Many activists may skeptically view Suzy Khimm\u2019s take at The New Republic in The Left's Green Lantern Problem.\nMs. Clinton has a strong claim to express her differences with Mr. Obama, since it\u2019s well-known that she argued them privately during her time in the administration, especially about how to handle Syria.\nTo believe otherwise essentially relies on the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency.\nTheo Anderson at In These Times writes What Is Actually Radical About Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic Socialism Isn\u2019t the Socialism:\nAt the great risk of overestimating our politicians, there is a good chance that they might pass the test."}
