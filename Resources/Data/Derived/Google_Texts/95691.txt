Having been a single-payer advocate for over 20 years and a critic of the Affordable Care Act, I am now ready to embrace Amendment 69. The ACA has benefited many people, but it certainly is not universal health care, and without a public option it has been called by Wendell Potter "The Health Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement ACT." But it has provided some individuals life-saving benefits. We all must realize that politics is the art of the possible.

Amendment 69 is a constitutional amendment to create a Colorado state publicly funded universal health-care system. It is not a single-payer system technically, but is a significant improvement over the ACA! It has many important reasons to be supported:

• Reduces the uninsured rate to essentially zero (universal coverage).

• Eliminates almost all underinsured.

• Eliminates deductibles and large out-of-pocket expenses.

• Allows patients full choice of primary care providers.

• Comprehensive benefits, including all necessary health care services.

• Is economical, transparent, and accountable.

• It is truly affordable and doesn't impose penalties.

As a former member of the board of directors for HCAC and having worked with Dr. Irene Aguilar and other key people involved with ColoradoCare, I know it is a huge improvement over ACA and a major step in the right direction. Its success does rest on two critical conditions: Their ability to obtain federal waivers under ACA section 1332 and overcoming opposition from powerful insurance, pharmaceutical and elected state representatives.

I am not sure the political climate is right, but I am encouraged by the recent state wide school board election results. Just maybe the public is ready to take control of their future and finally say no to powerful special interests.
