Mark Mutter. Sept. 10 was the deadline for filling an election vacancy.\n\nA four-year mayor's term and three, four-year at-large terms on the Township Council will be up for grabs on Nov. 3. Price, Rodrick and fellow Democrat Michael Bateman, 65, are joined on the Democrats' ticket by mayoral candidate Susan Pontoriero.\n\nThe Democrats are running against Republican Mayor Thomas F. Kelaher and Council members Maurice B. Hill Jr., Brian Kubiel and George E. Wittmann Jr. Kelaher, 83, a former Ocean County Prosecutor, will be seeking his third term as mayor.\n\nDemocrats staged a successful write-in campaign to get their candidates on the ballot this year after no one from their party filed to compete against the GOP incumbents in time for April's filing deadline.\n\nToms River -- like most of Ocean County, has long been a Republican stronghold. Paul Brush, a Democrat, chose not to seek re-election as mayor in 2007. He was the last Democrat to hold office here, and when he ran for office in the contentious 2003 election, he won as an Independent. Toms River's seven-member council consists of three, at-large council seats and four ward council seats.\n\nJean Mikle: (732) 643-4050, jmikle@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
