The deadline to obtain health insurance is March 31.\n\nHanlon said no one should try to apply for health insurance March 30 expecting to be covered by March 31.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t process that quickly, so Valentine\u2019s Day is a good deadline to keep in mind as it takes about six weeks to get health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nThe book goes through the history of the ACA beginning in 2010, and explains the Marketplace, Federal Mandate and Premium Tax Credit using several examples.\n\n\u201cI tried to make it easy to read with big print and short chapters,\u201d Hanlon said.\n\nThe book also has a section of credible sources where readers can access more information including links to the websites of various government and private organizations related to the ACA including the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHanlon said if someone wanted to be up to date on the ACA, she\u2019d recommend regularly visiting the Kaiser Family Foundation website because it is a nonprofit, nonpartisan private operating foundation.\n\nA glossary of health insurance related terms is featured in the back of the book.\n\nCall or visit the Hanlon & Associates CPA office to purchase a copy, or visit conwaycpa.com to order a copy online. Links to subscribe to newsletters and email lists can also be found on the site.\n\nThe books sell for a retail price of $20, but Hanlon & Associates CPA is offering the book to the public for $15. A coupon for $20 off any tax service at Hanlon & Associates CPA comes with the purchase of the book.\n\n\u201cGoing it alone or with TurboTax may not be the best solution anymore,\u201d Hanlon said.\n\n(Staff writer Michelle Corbet can be reached by email at michelle.corbet@thecabin.net or by phone at 505-1215.
