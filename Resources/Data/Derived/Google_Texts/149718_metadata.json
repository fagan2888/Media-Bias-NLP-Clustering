Thad Cochran with President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on health care, immigration and the federal debt:\n\nIt claims Cochran \u201cvoted with Harry Reid to make amnesty for illegal immigrants possible\u201d in 2006. But Cochran voted that year against the comprehensive immigration bill, and he voted against similar bills in 1986, twice in 2007 and again last year.\n\nIt suggests Cochran is paying lip service in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, because he \u201caccept[ed] a special exemption for himself and his staff.\u201d Cochran voted against Obamacare, and he and his staff are on the Washington, D.C., health insurance exchange created by the law.\n\nThe ad says his votes for the debt ceiling cost Americans $58,000 per person. Cochran voted to increase the debt ceiling by a total of $11.1 trillion over 33 years, but that comes to $34,895 per person \u2013 not $58,000.\n\nCochran, who has served in the Senate since 1978, faces a challenge from the right from Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator, in the June 3 Republican primary. The Washington Post wrote that after a string of recent election defeats, \u201cthe tea party\u2019s last best hope to oust a lawmaker is in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nTea Party Patriots Citizens Fund has begun airing its 30-second TV spot called \u201cWhat Happened to Thad Cochran?\u201d statewide on broadcast and cable TV, and plans to run a 60-second radio version as well.\n\nVotes for Amnesty?\n\nAccording to the narrator in the Tea Party Patriots ad, Cochran \u201ceven voted with Harry Reid to make amnesty for illegal immigrants possible.\u201d\n\nCochran voted against 2013\u2019s Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which passed the Senate but has been blocked by the House.\n\nSo on what does the ad base its claim? A spokesman for Tea Party Patriots pointed us to two votes in 2006. The first was on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 offered by Republican Sen. David Vitter to strip out what he called \u201camnesty provisions in this bill.\u201d Sen. John McCain pushed back, saying \u201cit is not amnesty\u201d under the dictionary definition of the word, and unlike in 1986, the bill included strict measures toward \u201cearned citizenship.\u201d (We agree the term \u201camnesty\u201d was not strictly accurate.) Vitter\u2019s amendment failed 33-66, and Cochran was among the 24 Republicans who voted against it. (And Senate Majority Leader Reid voted against it as well.)\n\nTea Party Patriots also pointed to Cochran\u2019s vote a week later on cloture, a procedural vote bringing debate on the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 to a close and allowing it to come to a full vote. Cochran was among 31 Republicans who supported the vote, which passed 73-35. (Reid also voted for it.)\n\nWe reached out to Cochran\u2019s campaign for an explanation of those votes and did not hear back. But the important thing to note is that Cochran ultimately voted against the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. In fact, Cochran has consistently voted against comprehensive immigration bills that include a path to citizenship for those people currently living in the U.S. illegally. That includes votes in 1986, 2006, two in 2007, and finally last year\u2019s Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\n\nIn other words, it is simply inaccurate to claim that Cochran has voted to \u201cmake amnesty for illegal immigrants possible.\u201d\n\nCochran Does More Than Say He\u2019s Against Obamacare\n\nThe narrator in the Tea Party Patriots ad also calls into question Cochran\u2019s bona fides in opposing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHe says he opposes Obamacare, but he accepts a special exemption for himself and his staff,\u201d the narrator states.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that Cochran does more than \u201csay\u201d he opposes the Affordable Care Act. He voted against it.\n\nCochran also voted in March 2013 for an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz \u201cto establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide for the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and to encourage patient-centered reform.\u201d It failed 45-54.\n\nAnd in February 2011, Cochran voted for an amendment from Sen. Mitch McConnell to a transportation bill that sought \u201cto repeal the job-killing health care law and health care-related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.\u201d It failed 47-51.\n\nCochran also has voted in favor of defunding the ACA, such as his vote on March 13, 2013, in favor of an amendment offered by Cruz \u201cto prohibit the use of funds to carry out the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d It failed 45-52.\n\nCochran was also a co-sponsor of the self-explanatory ObamaCare Repeal Act, which was introduced in January 2013.\n\nWe could go on, but you get the idea. Cochran has done more than \u201csay\u201d he\u2019s against the Affordable Care Act. He voted against it, and has voted to repeal and defund it.\n\nAs for the claim that Cochran \u201caccept[ed] a special exemption [from the ACA] for himself and his staff,\u201d we\u2019ve dispelled that canard on numerous occasions. Cochran and his staff went into the D.C. exchange created by the Affordable Care Act. The federal government continues to pick up 72 percent of federal employees\u2019 premiums on average \u2014 just as it did before the ACA. But that\u2019s not a \u201cspecial exemption.\u201d Most large employers pay a portion of health care costs.\n\nRaised Debt $58,000 Per Person?\n\nThe ad also exaggerates the impact of Cochran\u2019s votes on the debt ceiling. It says he has voted to increase the federal debt 24 times. \u201cThat\u2019s $58,000 per person,\u201d the narrator says against the backdrop of a family of four. That overstates the actual per capita amount by about 40 percent.\n\nThere are currently 318 million people in the U.S., so 318 million times $58,000 would equal a total debt of about $18.4 trillion. But that\u2019s too high. The total federal debt, which includes money that the government owes to itself, is $17.5 trillion, and the debt held by the public is $12.5 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury website.\n\nHow much did Cochran vote to increase the debt? The ad says he voted 24 times, and the tea party group provided us with a list of the 24 votes, from 1981 to 2013. But that list mistakenly claims Cochran voted to increase the debt limit by $32 billion on Aug. 15, 1986, when in fact Cochran was among 29 members who were absent that day and did not vote. The debt-ceiling bill barely passed 36-35.\n\nThat would mean Cochran voted 23 times to raise the debt ceiling at a total cost of $11.1 trillion. That comes to $34,895 per person.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba01\"", "article_summary": "But that\u2019s not a \u201cspecial exemption.\u201d Most large employers pay a portion of health care costs.\nThat would mean Cochran voted 23 times to raise the debt ceiling at a total cost of $11.1 trillion.\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that Cochran does more than \u201csay\u201d he opposes the Affordable Care Act.\nCochran and his staff went into the D.C. exchange created by the Affordable Care Act.\nCochran has done more than \u201csay\u201d he\u2019s against the Affordable Care Act."}
