Today it\u2019s 50 percent.\n\nThere are 90,000 commercial risk patients and the system purchased a Medicaid health plan from Amerigroup of 60,000 members.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build critical mass with covered lives and build a shared savings construct,\u201d Stauder said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a market with many commercial payers. We needed to broaden market share.\u201d\n\nThe goal by 2020 is to have a million covered lives.\n\nAetna provides health plan administration; claims and customer service; analytics; technology and care management programs.\n\nInova provides a nationally recognized healthcare system, and more member management at the primary care level of chronic conditions and lower unit costs.\n\nInnovation Health began in September 2013 and has grown to 180,000 members.\n\nThe health system\u2019s narrow network is supplemented by the national Aetna network, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about empowering the physician providers,\u201d Stauder said, emphasizing the need to get their cooperation.\n\nCare coordinators steer members towards appropriate programs and there are alerts given if any members are in network hospitals, he said.\n\nFor post-acute care, there are transitional programs; post-discharge community placement; and medical home for 30 days for high risk for readmission patients. The system is currently building out an advanced illness model to include home-based physician visits and EPIC community based visits.\n\nAnalytics and IT tools include using, a fully integrated EMR through EPIC, a MyChart portable EMR patient engagement driver, telemedicine; analytics for risk stratification and predictive data analytics for clinical quality.\n\nThe Aetna platform also interfaces with Epic.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse\n\nThis story is part of our ongoing coverage of the HIMSS16 conference.
