Joe Heck, R-Nev., is anti-woman.\n\nErin Bilbray, a Democratic candidate running against Heck in Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, recently alleged in an email that Heck is \u201cno advocate for women\u2019s equality, choice, or health.\u201d\n\nCharacterizing Heck\u2019s record as \u201cvery anti-choice, very anti-woman\u201d during an interview with the Sun, she offered as evidence several votes Heck has taken during his three years in Congress and while he was serving in the state Senate.\n\nShe concluded her email pitch with a question: \u201cWill you please help me beat Rep. Heck and protect women's rights by contributing $5 right now?\u201d\n\nBilbray, who announced her candidacy this summer, consults for Emerge Nevada, a nonprofit group she founded that helps women get elected to political office. She said she planned to make women\u2019s issues a \u201chuge\u201d part of her campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, staffers with Heck\u2019s re-election campaign who read Bilbray\u2019s email got a sense of deja vu. They\u2019d seen some of these claims before from Democratic candidate John Oceguera, who failed to defeat Heck during last year\u2019s election, and from Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., who failed to unseat Heck in 2010 before winning election last year in Nevada\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\n\u201cThey were fact-checked,\u201d said Mark Ciavola, Heck\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThey were debunked.\u201d\n\nWhat are the claims, and how truthful are they?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Erin Bilbray, a Democratic candidate running against Rep.
