Victoria Steele (D) revealed during emotional testimony Wednesday that she was molested by a male relative when she was a young girl. Steele, who was speaking against a bill that would make it harder for women to elect abortion coverage in plans bought through the Affordable Care Act, hadn't planned to talk about her past abuse, she explained later. But when committee chair Kelly Townsend asked her whether she felt abortion was a medical service, she felt compelled to share her experience.\n\n\"When I was a child, I was molested for years by one particular person,\" Steele testified. \"This is health care. Having the ability to get an abortion. This is health care. And that's why I see this as necessary.\"\n\nSteele said she later found out there were multiple victims, one of whom told her their molester had told her he would \"stick a pencil up there and take care of it\" if she ever ended up pregnant.\n\nAfter Steele's testimony, a state House committee approved the bill by a 5-3 party-line vote. The bill now faces a vote before the full House.\n\nIn an editorial for Cosmopolitan published on Friday, Steele said she expected the bill to survive further debate, but explained why she thinks it's dangerous for women's rights:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "\"We should not have to bare that part of our lives in such a public way to be able to access legal medical care.\"", "title": "This Arizona lawmaker bravely revealed her sexual assault to fight a restrictive abortion bill", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/03/arizona-lawmaker-abortion-molested", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/abortion_1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"creator": "eenayo", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/03/arizona-lawmaker-abortion-molested", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/abortion_1.png", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/abortion_1.png"}, "title": "This Arizona lawmaker bravely revealed her sexual assault to fight a restrictive abortion bill", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Reproductive+Rights,Sex+and+Gender", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Arizona state Rep.
