But it\u2019s also \u201cthe most modest growth in the past four years.\u201d\n\nThrough three quarters, traffic was up 1 percent at quick-service restaurants and 6 percent at fast casuals, according to NPD Group, a research and consulting firm.\n\nThe 2 percent payroll tax hike hit consumer spending early. \u201cWhen that went up at the beginning of the year, we saw restaurant traffic slow down, and [operators] had to go back to discounting,\u201d says Bonnie Riggs, restaurant industry analyst at NPD.\n\nIn addition, the 16-day government shutdown in October represented a $24 billion hit to the economy and \u201ctook a toll on consumer confidence,\u201d Riehle says.\n\nThe economy has been the No. 1 issue in recent years among operators polled by the NRA in its annual Industry Forecast, and it affected much of the industry in 2013. Here, we take a look at the top nine stories from the year and what they suggest for the future of quick service.\n\nValue menus get a makeover\n\nThis year may go down in the annals of history as the year single-price value menus bit the dust. For a range of reasons, from rising costs to changing consumer tastes, the nearly quarter-century-old concept of value menus\u2014a series of items all priced around $1\u2014is giving way to multi-level pricing and a wider variety of food.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that stratification was going to happen,\u201d says Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president of foodservice strategies at WD Partners, a Dublin, Ohio\u2013based design and consulting company. \u201cIt was like trying to keep gasoline at $1.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive to seven years from now, there will be no dollar menu. It will just be the value menu.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s, which introduced the single-price value menu in 1989, launched its Right Size, Right Price menu systemwide in January with items from 99 cents to $1.99.\n\n\u201cWe looked at six items priced at 99 cents, because that is still a critical price point, and others under $2, because that is still a good value,\u201d says spokesman Denny Lynch.\n\nIn the fall, McDonald\u2019s Dollar Menu transformed into the Dollar Menu & More, merging the brand\u2019s $1 items with others up to $2 and the 20-piece nuggets for $5. Some other restaurant companies also began offering multi-priced value menus.\n\n\u201cThis is an evolutionary process,\u201d Lombardi says. \u201cFive to seven years from now, there will be no dollar menu. It will just be the value menu.\u201d\n\nBrands turn to the IPO\n\nAfter two years without a limited-service restaurant company launching an initial public offering, two brands made the plunge in 2013.\n\nFast-casual mainstay Noodles & Co., based in Broomfield, Colorado, raised $96.4 million with its initial public offering (IPO) in early July, while Chicago-based sandwich-maker Potbelly brought in $108 million with its October IPO.\n\nNoodles sold 5.37 million shares at $18 each, and started trading at nearly twice that price. The Potbelly IPO was for 7.5 million shares at $14 apiece, well above the original price range of $9\u2013$11, and shares opened trading at $28.66.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of growth names in the consumer cyclical stocks,\u201d says R.J. Hottovy, a restaurant industry analyst with investment firm Morningstar. \u201cAs a result, the market is willing to overpay for concepts that are viable and have growth potential.\u201d\n\nA few other companies are reportedly looking at going public, including Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc. and Focus Brands Inc., parent of Cinnabon and Moe\u2019s Southwest Grill.\n\nStarbucks continues its evolution\n\nStarbucks wasted little time this year integrating acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012. In short order, the company expanded the availability of Evolution Fresh juices, introduced La Boulange artisan baked goods, and opened its first two Teavana Fine Teas + Tea Bar locations.\n\n\u201cWhatever we bring into the store, we want it to be enhancing to the customer experience and complementary to our leadership position in coffee,\u201d chief executive Howard Schultz told investors in the fall.\n\nEvolution Fresh also launched standalone Evolution Fresh stores and opened a new factory this year. Meanwhile, La Boulange products are now in more than half of Starbucks\u2019 7,000 U.S. company stores, and a La Boulange lunch concept is being tested.\n\n\u201cStarbucks has been pretty smart,\u201d says Melissa Abbott, senior director of culinary insights at The Hartman Group, a Bellevue, Washington\u2013based research and consulting firm. \u201cThey are capitalizing on categories customers want but may not easily have access to.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter pizza\u201d explodes\n\nFast-casual pizza is not new, but the number of upstart limited-service chains built around artisan, quickly baked pizza is soaring.\n\nSince brands like MOD Pizza, Your Pie, and Uncle Maddio\u2019s pioneered the space in the late 2000s, nearly a dozen fast-casual pizza efforts have popped up around the country, including Project Pie, Blaze Pizza, and The Pizza Studio. This year, the nation\u2019s fifth-largest pizza company, Sbarro, opened its own fast-casual pizza iteration, Pizza Cucinova, in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nMore brands are on the way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the same grand proliferation being set up that we saw with the better-burger concept,\u201d Lombardi says. \u201cThis is part of the customization consumers demand.\u201d\n\nSome efforts have big money behind them, including Los Angeles\u2013based PizzaRev, backed financially by Buffalo Wild Wings. Others feature experienced operators, such as Denver\u2019s Live Basil, created by Smashburger founders Tom Ryan and Rick Schaden.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Despite a year filled with turmoil in Washington, the limited-service restaurant industry showed moderate growth and promise in 2013, thanks in part to creative new ideas and products, plus another good gain from fast-casual units.
