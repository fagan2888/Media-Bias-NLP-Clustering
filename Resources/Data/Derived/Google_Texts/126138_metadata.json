Statistics show the percentage of employers with 5,000 or more employees that are self-insured has grown to 94 percent in 2015. Overall, 63 percent of employers are fully or partially self-insured, compared to 44 percent in 1999, the article says.\n\nTo keep up, traditional insurers are finding ways to access the self-insurance market. Insurance brokers have been a key cog in the wheel, connecting fully insurered carriers' administrative services only offerings to stop-loss insurance providers. The market for stop-loss has grown because of the Affordable Care Act's ban on annual or lifetime coverage limits, the article adds.\n\nExperts say greater plan choices drive employers toward self-funded plans. Mike Ferguson, president of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, tells Managed Care Magazine that instead of purchasing prepackaged plans, employers can modify a plan to fit the needs of their employees. An employer with a large percentage of older employees may want to focus on chronic pain benefits, whereas an employer with a younger workforce might adapt the plan to cover family planning.\n\nSelf-insured companies also have access to more claims data, Ferguson says, allowing companies to deploy analytics in an effort to cut unnecessary costs.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Managed Care Magazine article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMore companies choose to self-insure employees\n\n4 strategies to grow membership, boost revenue\n\nSelf-insurance popularity sends full-risk enrollment falling\n\nMore hospitals provide self-insurance plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "As more employers turn to self-funded health insurance plans for flexibility and cost control, health insurance companies are tweaking their business models to adjust,\u00a0according to\u00a0Managed Care Magazine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "As more employers turn to self-funded health insurance plans for flexibility and cost control, health insurance companies are tweaking their business models to adjust,\u00a0according to\u00a0Managed Care Magazine.", "title": "As self-insurance market grows, health insurers adapt", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/self-insurance-market-grows-health-insurers-adapt/2016-03-28", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "data analytics,employer health insurance,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Self-funded health plans,self-insured plans", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "As more employers turn to self-funded health insurance plans for flexibility and cost control, health insurance companies are tweaking their business models to adjust, according to Managed Care Magazine.\nInsurance brokers have been a key cog in the wheel, connecting fully insurered carriers' administrative services only offerings to stop-loss insurance providers.\nTo learn more:- read the Managed Care Magazine articleRelated Articles:More companies choose to self-insure employees4 strategies to grow membership, boost revenueSelf-insurance popularity sends full-risk enrollment fallingMore hospitals provide self-insurance plans\nTo keep up, traditional insurers are finding ways to access the self-insurance market.\nThe market for stop-loss has grown because of the Affordable Care Act's ban on annual or lifetime coverage limits, the article adds."}
