(via James Taranto)\n\nIn 2009, the Campaign for America's Future, a collection of influential lefties within the Democratic Party, ran a blog post that proposed to use the VA as a national health care model.\n\nCAF events had featured Obama, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. It was an influential organization pushing the party further to the left.\n\nThe post was by health care consultant Joe Paduda, who recently dismissed the people suffering under ObamaCare by writing, \"'When one person suffers it is a tragedy, when millions do, it is a statistic.' As abhorrent as quoting Josef Stalin might be, the monster was right.\"\n\nIf you want a window into the mindset that is responsible for the VA and ObamaCare, you could do worse than to contemplate the sort of person who thinks that way.\n\nArguing against the Medicare for Everyone proposal that's a popular lefty vehicle to single payer, Paduda wrote, \"Medicare is not controlling the primary driver of medical costs \u2013 utilization of services.\"\n\n\"Medicare\u2019s imaging expenses doubled between 2000 and 2007. Utilization of physician in-office services went up more than 10% in 2006.\"\n\nThe VA however is super at controlling utilization of services, aka getting patients the tests they need so they don't die.\n\n\"It\u2019s the Veteran\u2019s Administration, and rather than Medicare, i\u2019d base a national plan on a dramatic expansion of the VA,\" he said, claiming that while \"the number of veterans receiving treatment from the VA more than doubled, from 2.5 million to 5.3 million, but the agency needed 10,000 fewer employees to deliver that care \u2013 as a result the cost per patient stayed flat.\"\n\nMuch like a lot of VA patients. But as Stalin said, \"The idea of a concentration camp is excellent.\"\n\nMerrill Goozner criticized Paduda's proposal because few lefties were even willing to advocate for bringing the NHS's single payer death machine to America.\n\n\"What Paduda failed to note was that the VA also is a single-payer-type system that delivers health care directly, just like the British National Health Service... The problem with using the VA as a model for the public plan is that those who would accuse its proponents of advocating for \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d would be right. How many of those proponents would be willing to stand up and say at that point: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what we\u2019re for.\u201d\n\nGive it a little time.\n\nGraves will be dug, vets will be buried and a year from now another lefty with CAP or some other outlet will write an article about how great the VA is and another lefty will suggest that we will turn it into national health care machine.\n\nBecause that's what lefty does.\n\nAs Stalin said, \"Education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed.\"", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "\"I'd base a national plan on a dramatic expansion of the VA,\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "\"I'd base a national plan on a dramatic expansion of the VA,\"", "title": "Liberals Wanted to use the VA as a Model for National Health Care", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/226161/liberals-wanted-use-va-model-national-health-care-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:45:29-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/226161/liberals-wanted-use-va-model-national-health-care-daniel-greenfield", "description": "\"I'd base a national plan on a dramatic expansion of the VA,\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Liberals Wanted to use the VA as a Model for National Health Care"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-23T14:49:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:45:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\"What Paduda failed to note was that the VA also is a single-payer-type system that delivers health care directly, just like the British National Health Service...\n(via James Taranto)In 2009, the Campaign for America's Future, a collection of influential lefties within the Democratic Party, ran a blog post that proposed to use the VA as a national health care model.\nThe problem with using the VA as a model for the public plan is that those who would accuse its proponents of advocating for \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d would be right.\nThe post was by health care consultant Joe Paduda, who recently dismissed the people suffering under ObamaCare by writing, \"'When one person suffers it is a tragedy, when millions do, it is a statistic.'\nGraves will be dug, vets will be buried and a year from now another lefty with CAP or some other outlet will write an article about how great the VA is and another lefty will suggest that we will turn it into national health care machine."}
