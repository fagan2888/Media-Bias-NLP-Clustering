After years of resolutely ignoring workforce decline \u2013 claiming every downward tick in the nominal unemployment rate was pure, undiluted joyous news, even though most of those ticks occurred because hundreds of thousands of people were giving up and dropping out of the workforce entirely \u2013 liberals are falling all over themselves to bang out Tweets and blog posts explaining how it\u2019s a good thing that same nominal unemployment rate just ticked up.\n\nNearly 400K back into labor force moved UE up to 5.5%. That\u2019s GOOD NEWS not bad news. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \u2014 Ben White (@morningmoneyben) June 5, 2015\n\nThey pretended these people didn\u2019t exist when they left the workforce, but now they\u2019re rolling out the red carpet and welcoming them back. The departure didn\u2019t happen, but the return is cause for celebration. Hallelujah! Like the man who opens his refrigerator in a pitch-dark kitchen for a midnight snack, they have seen the light!\n\nActually, the return of these 400,000 people to the workforce is only the first half of potential good news. Now they have to find jobs. It\u2019s good that they\u2019re trying, but not enough of them have succeeded yet. We won\u2019t know the rest of the story for a few months, at which point the inevitable revisions to the April and May numbers will also be in. It was always amusing to watch the Obama Administration and its apologists respond to each new entry in a long string of dismaying reports by frantically stammering, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t read too much into any single month of data!\u201d but they were right \u2013 it\u2019s quarterly and yearly trends that matter.\n\nSpeaking of the big picture, job creation 2015 remains slightly worse than 2014, not better\u2026\n\nUS job growth has averaged 217,000 a month this year vs. 229,000 through the first five months of 2014 \u2014 James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis) June 5, 2015\n\n\u2026 and since a lot of the new jobs are temporary and part-time work, average earnings aren\u2019t improving much\u2026\n\nHourly earnings ticked up in May, but still hovering just above 2%/year. No clear upward trend. pic.twitter.com/9GmCRJclEf \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) June 5, 2015\n\n\u2026 and workforce participation is still hovering around three-decade lows. Another interesting point about wage growth: most of May\u2019s appears to have occurred among high-end supervisors and managers, the very same people liberals spend most of their time savaging for their \u201cincome inequality.\u201d It will be nice to have a few weeks where Democrats embrace income inequality like a long-lost child, because otherwise they\u2019d have to discuss the less appealing elements of the May unemployment report.\n\nMaybe this is the true beginning of the long-promised but never-delivered recovery \u2013 we can all unite in hoping so \u2013 but it\u2019s still weak and much too late. The lost Obama years are going to hurt us for a long time to come. We\u2019ve made far too many hard-to-reverse adjustments to a \u201cnew normal\u201d we never should have accepted.\n\nOne undiluted bit of good news is that last month\u2019s bitter winter has suddenly ended, as suddenly as a flash of lightning. All the bitching about how the unprecedented appearance of cold weather in the Northeast around the end of the year has abruptly fallen silent. Old Man Winter will return as soon as the next bad piece of economic news drops, of course, but at least he can relax on the beach for a while and enjoy his vacation without having a thousand quivering fingers pointed in his face.\n\nStronger-than-expected job growth and 280,000 new jobs is good. More of this in the coming months would be great. Of course, if we do get a quarter of sustained good employment news, the Federal Reserve will respond, which will feel bad in the short term, but be good in the long run \u2013 and it will be loads of fun to watch Obama supporters suddenly agree with critics of the monetary policies they\u2019ve been defending for years.\n\nMeanwhile, let those of us who noticed when the 400,000 returning exiles departed from the U.S. workforce wish them good luck in finding good jobs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "May Jobs Report: Liberals Suddenly Rediscover the 'Workforce' Concept", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "May Jobs Report: Liberals Suddenly Rediscover the 'Workforce' Concept", "title": "May Jobs Report: Liberals Suddenly Rediscover the 'Workforce' Concept - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ap_ap-photo378-e1433513432250.jpg", "height": 427}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/05/may-jobs-report-liberals-suddenly-rediscover-the-workforce-concept/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "May Jobs Report: Liberals Suddenly Rediscover the 'Workforce' Concept", "title": "May Jobs Report: Liberals Suddenly Rediscover the 'Workforce' Concept - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ap_ap-photo378-e1433513432250.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "economy, job creation, unemployment, wage growth, workforce,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "workforce", "published_time": "2015-06-05T07:11:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, let those of us who noticed when the 400,000 returning exiles departed from the U.S. workforce wish them good luck in finding good jobs.\nOne undiluted bit of good news is that last month\u2019s bitter winter has suddenly ended, as suddenly as a flash of lightning.\nActually, the return of these 400,000 people to the workforce is only the first half of potential good news.\nStronger-than-expected job growth and 280,000 new jobs is good.\nLike the man who opens his refrigerator in a pitch-dark kitchen for a midnight snack, they have seen the light!"}
