One year later, Manning helped the Colts demolish the Broncos 49-24 at the same stadium.\n\nThose are the only times the Broncos and Colts have met in the playoffs. Both times the Broncos played doormat to Manning\u2019s greatness.\n\nHe threw for 377 yards and five touchdowns in Round 1, then came back to punish the Broncos with 457 yards passing and four touchdowns in Round 2.\n\n\u201cI said coming in that this was the best offense I have ever played against,\u201d Broncos Pro Bowl safety John Lynch said after the Colts\u2019 49-24 victory. \u201cToday they confirmed that. They have a quarterback who puts them in the right situations. I\u2019ve never been in a game where so much of it felt like we were almost helpless.\u201d\n\nManning, now in his third season as Denver\u2019s star quarterback, faces his former team in an AFC divisional playoff game Sunday at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. He is 38 now and a different player, playing under a different system. His gun-slinging days have been tempered as the Broncos seek a balanced offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to find different ways to win football games and hopefully that prepares us well when you get into these playoff games and anything can go on,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent games take on different identities. You never know what it\u2019s going to be, but I think we\u2019ve proven we can win games differently and hopefully that serves us well potentially on Sunday.\u201d\n\nWhen he was with the Colts, Manning\u2019s passing attack was nearly unstoppable. The Denver defenses that lined up in those wild-card games a decade ago were no match for his accuracy.\n\nAfter the debacle in the 2003 playoff game against the Colts, Broncos coach Mike Shana- han acquired Lynch and star cornerback Champ Bailey. But Manning still found a way to exploit Denver\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nThe soft spot in Denver\u2019s secondary in the 2004 playoff game against the Colts was rookie cornerback Roc Alexander, Denver\u2019s nickel back. With Bailey playing man-to-man coverage on Marvin Harrison \u2014 the Colts\u2019 best wide receiver \u2014 Manning attacked Alexander, throwing early, often and effectively to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. Wayne caught 10 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Colts postseason record for yards receiving.\n\nWayne, now 36, could be playing his final game Sunday unless the Colts can find a way to pull the upset and advance.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos got blasted by Peyton Manning\u2019s Colts", "title": "Broncos got blasted by Peyton Manning\u2019s Colts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/broncos-got-blasted-by-peyton-mannings-colts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110__20150111_Z00_SP11FBNHISTORYp1.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110__20150111_Z00_SP11FBNHISTORYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T13:53:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:21:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf672\"", "article_summary": "In the wild-card round of the 2003 playoffs, Manning\u2019s Indianapolis Colts blasted the Broncos 41-10 at the RCA Dome.\nAfter the debacle in the 2003 playoff game against the Colts, Broncos coach Mike Shana- han acquired Lynch and star cornerback Champ Bailey.\n\u201cDifferent games take on different identities.\nThe soft spot in Denver\u2019s secondary in the 2004 playoff game against the Colts was rookie cornerback Roc Alexander, Denver\u2019s nickel back.\nOne year later, Manning helped the Colts demolish the Broncos 49-24 at the same stadium."}
