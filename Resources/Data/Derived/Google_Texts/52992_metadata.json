(Photo/courtesy of heclifebuilders.org)\n\nCan homelessness be abolished?\n\nThe question was the focus of government officials and organizational partners attending a roundtable discussion hosted by the USC School of Social Work.\n\nAssistant Professor Ben Henwood, a member of the school\u2019s Homelessness, Housing, and Social Environment research cluster, talked about the long-standing effort to finish a mission \u201cthat no one thought was a real possibility 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe hope is to take what we know about housing interventions and apply them to youth. Ben Henwood\n\nMuch of that effort can be attributed to Philip Mangano, who in 2009 left his position as head of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, a position he held under the second George W. Bush administration from 2002 to 2009.\n\nDuring his tenure with the federal government, Mangano advocated for ending chronic homelessness through housing and counseling rather than a symptomatic focus of temporary shelter and meal solutions.\n\n\u201cWe dare use the term \u2018abolish\u2019 when discussing homelessness because we have empirically seen those people \u2014 who we once thought could only be helped with soup or a blanket \u2014 recover, achieve stable housing and move forward in their lives,\u201d Mangano said. \u201cThey are no longer ricocheting among various expensive behavioral and mental health services.\n\n\u201cNow it not only makes sense morally and spiritually to reduce homelessness, but it also makes sense economically, which serves as a means to motivate political will,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat will combined with data and research allows us to begin to actually talk seriously about and see the ending of homelessness around the country.\u201d\n\nHenwood steps in\n\nAfter leaving his post, Mangano created the American Round Table to Abolish Homelessness, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization. Mangano, who held the first serious discussion on the topic in 2013 at Harvard University, wanted to bring the colloquy to the West Coast, which is where Henwood stepped in.\n\n\u201cThe meeting felt like a good match for our cluster,\u201d said Henwood, who used a $5,000 team-building grant from the Southern California Center for Translational Science Institute to support the two-day event.\n\nTopics touched on many issues related to current and future homeless populations, including the Affordable Care Act and how it relates to housing initiatives, such as Housing First, a program that provides housing as a first step to create a more stable environment for other long-term health needs, such as mental health and substance abuse counseling.\n\nFinancing was a big point of interest for the attendees, Henwood said.\n\nParticipants discussed newer strategies related to financing successful housing programs and how to acquire private money and investors to support them. They also looked at age trends in homelessness and what that means for future program needs and the advent of a new population of chronic homeless.\n\n\u201cA cohort of older adults, mostly baby boomers, made up the chronic homeless we saw in the \u201980s,\u201d Henwood said. \u201cThese people have only gotten older and will soon no longer be with us. However, now we\u2019ve identified that transitional-age youth are the likely new cohort of chronically homeless.\u201d\n\nDean Flynn discusses Grand Challenges\n\nHenwood suggested that lessons taken from the older cohort can be applied to prevent these transitional-age youth from becoming chronically homeless. The school\u2019s research cluster is currently investigating issues of aging in homelessness and the role housing plays to support this population.\n\n\u201cThe hope is to take what we know about housing interventions and apply them to youth,\u201d Henwood said. \u201cI think this point was a big eye-opener for some people.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest accomplishments at the colloquy was in response to a speech delivered by Marilyn L. Flynn, dean of the School of Social Work.\n\nFlynn discussed the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare\u2019s Grand Challenges for Social Work Initiative, a movement to set the future goals and trends in the field of social work and toward community engagement and support.\n\nMangano said the dean challenged participants to put the notion of housing in the frame of social work.\n\n\u201cWe were touched by her authenticity and promotion of giving housing needs a deeper contemplation within the whole realm of social work concerning curriculum and practice,\u201d Mangano said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important avenue for those of us interested in the issue.\u201d\n\nMore stories about: Faculty, Homelessness, Social Work", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://news.usc.edu/67298/helping-the-homeless-with-more-than-soup-or-a-blanket/", "image": {"width": 300, "secure_url": "https://news.usc.edu/files/2014/08/Homeless-teen-300x200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://news.usc.edu/files/2014/08/Homeless-teen-300x200.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "U.S. leaders examine the social, economic and political challenges facing policymakers.", "title": "Helping the homeless with more than soup or a blanket"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda98a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s an important avenue for those of us interested in the issue.\u201dMore stories about: Faculty, Homelessness, Social Work\nFlynn discussed the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare\u2019s Grand Challenges for Social Work Initiative, a movement to set the future goals and trends in the field of social work and toward community engagement and support.\nA conference held at USC touched on many issues related to current and future homeless populations.\nThe question was the focus of government officials and organizational partners attending a roundtable discussion hosted by the USC School of Social Work.\nMangano said the dean challenged participants to put the notion of housing in the frame of social work."}
