Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, who has publicly opposed loosening marijuana laws because of the effect it would have on children\u2019s health.\n\nA summary of the measure posted on the House Appropriations Committee website, though, suggests a more narrow focus, saying it prohibits funds from being used to \u201cimplement a referendum legalizing recreational marijuana use in the District.\u201d\n\nD.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has routinely spoken out against attempts by Congress to interfere in local laws, said before the budget bill was made public that she was dismayed by the idea that the District would be used as a bargaining chip in the larger appropriations package.\n\nSEE ALSO: D.C. marijuana legalization could put U.S. in violation of anti-drug treaties\n\n\u201cI would be at a loss to explain why Democrats would agree to block D.C. marijuana legalization on their watch,\u201d Ms. Norton said. \u201cRepublicans will control Congress in less than a month. I don\u2019t know why Democrats would give them a head start in interfering with the District\u2019s local laws.\u201d\n\nThe inclusion of the rider was a significant blow to D.C. officials, who approved decriminalization amid concerns that the city\u2019s marijuana laws were being inequitably enforced against black residents. The law put the city among 18 states that have decriminalized the drug, as federal officials in President Obama\u2019s Justice Department have largely stepped back and allowed states to decide the issue for themselves despite the fact that the drug remains illegal under federal law.\n\nMr. Obama has signaled his opposition to the amendment interfering with the city\u2019s marijuana laws, and he could veto the spending bill. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who opposes the rider, indicated it may likely be passed.\n\n\u201cIf they put it in there, it\u2019s going to be hard to take it out over here, but I oppose it,\u201d said Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat.\n\nThe rider came after more than 70 percent of voters opted for legalization last month at the ballot box and left D.C. leaders uncertain how to proceed.\n\nMayor-elect Muriel Bowser offered no clear explanation of how she would proceed when asked earlier in the day about the situation.\n\n\u201cI call on all members of Congress to respect the will of D.C. voters and reject any attempts to violate our right to self-governance,\u201d Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser Tuesday afternoon in a written response to questions on the issue. \u201cIn the meantime, the Council and I will move forward to implement the law in a thoughtful and responsible way.\u201d\n\nBudget negotiations had reportedly centered around blocking a plan under consideration by the D.C. Council to open legal pot shops in the nation\u2019s capital that would be regulated and taxed by the city.\n\nMs. Norton, the District\u2019s nonvoting congressional representative, said Tuesday afternoon that she had no confirmation of the language of the rider and that Democrats had assured her that negotiations were continuing on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are still fighting and talking to the relevant leaders to do all we can to protect D.C.\u2019s marijuana legalization law,\u201d Ms. Norton said. \u201cWe want them to leave what the voters have done alone.\u201d\n\nCongress has used budget riders as a tool to block legislation members considered controversial in the past. The District\u2019s medical marijuana program was blocked from taking effect for more than a decade through riders.\n\nMalik Burnett, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, said Congress\u2018 continuing interference in the District\u2019s local marijuana laws was \u201cvery problematic.\n\n\u201cAll this confusion speaks to the fact that the federal government shouldn\u2019t be interfering in the District of Columbia,\u201d he said.\n\nD.C. Council member David Grosso, at-large independent who introduced the measure to regulate marijuana, encouraged residents to contact ranking members of the appropriations committees to object to the riders.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening and frustrating to learn that once again the District of Columbia is being used as a political pawn by the Congress,\u201d Mr. Grosso said. \u201cTo undermine the vote of the people \u2014 taxpayers \u2014 does not foster or promote the \u2018limited government\u2019 stance House Republicans claim they stand for; it\u2019s uninformed paternalistic meddling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A voter approved ballot initiative legalizing marijuana in the District and a council-passed measure decriminalizing the drug fell victim to federal budget negotiators, who inserted an amendment into a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill that effectively restores criminal penalties for pot possession in the nation's capital.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr., Andrea Noble and Andrea Noble, Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A voter approved ballot initiative legalizing marijuana in the District and a council-passed measure decriminalizing the drug fell victim to federal budget negotiators, who inserted an amendment into a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill that effectively restores criminal penalties for pot possession in the nation\u2019s capital.", "title": "Congress axes D.C. marijuana legalization in spending plan", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/9/dc-marijuana-legalization-could-be-undercut-by-fed/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/norton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/norton.jpg", "title": "Congress axes D.C. marijuana legalization in spending plan", "description": "A voter approved ballot initiative legalizing marijuana in the District and a council-passed measure decriminalizing the drug fell victim to federal budget negotiators, who inserted an amendment into", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd119c\"", "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: D.C. marijuana legalization could put U.S. in violation of anti-drug treaties\u201cI would be at a loss to explain why Democrats would agree to block D.C. marijuana legalization on their watch,\u201d Ms. Norton said.\n\u201cWe are still fighting and talking to the relevant leaders to do all we can to protect D.C.\u2019s marijuana legalization law,\u201d Ms. Norton said.\nMr. Obama has signaled his opposition to the amendment interfering with the city\u2019s marijuana laws, and he could veto the spending bill.\nMalik Burnett, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, said Congress\u2018 continuing interference in the District\u2019s local marijuana laws was \u201cvery problematic.\nThe rider came after more than 70 percent of voters opted for legalization last month at the ballot box and left D.C. leaders uncertain how to proceed."}
