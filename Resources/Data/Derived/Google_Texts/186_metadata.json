Here is the reason, which may come on top of other reasons:\n\nAn Uber exec talked about hiring an investigative team to find dirt on journalists writing unflattering things about the company. Emil Michael, a senior VP, told BuzzFeed News that he might spend $1 million to dig deep into their \u201cpersonal lives\u201d and \u201cfamilies.\u201d\n\nSome Uber deleters said they feared leaving their personal information \u2014 credit cards, trips taken, etc. \u2014 with a company so casual about privacy. But many saw this as the final deal-killing blemish on a corporate image growing less attractive by the month.\n\nFull disclosure: I've sung love songs to Uber and its streamlined driving service. But yes, I'm irritated.\n\nMichael has distanced himself from the raw remarks, saying that they were attributed to him \u201cat a private dinner party.\u201d (He didn't deny making them.)\n\nBut the bigger problem for Uber is the perception that its boy wonders can mouth off outrageously without demotion or other consequence.\n\nUber founder Travis Kalanick recently told GQ magazine that the success of his company has made it much easier to score with women. He called the company Boob-er \u2014 perhaps not a firing offense but a profoundly shtoopid remark.\n\nSome tech fortunes rest on disrupting a traditional business. In Uber's case, it's the regulated taxi industry. So let's not be deceived. Under their owners' messy hair and T-shirts lies the capitalistic aggression of a J.P. Morgan.\n\nThe Republican Party recently praised Uber in a petition.\n\n\u201cTaxi unions and liberal government bureaucrats are\n\n. . . issuing strangling regulations and implementing unnecessary red tape\u201d to stifle Uber's entrepreneurial spirit, it said.\n\nWall Street has valued Uber at an optimistic $18 billion, but investors' sense of humor goes just so far. Bad-boy talk can hurt the bottom line. After all, other companies (Lyft, Sidecar) do what Uber does.\n\nThough unimaginably rich, Uber's top guys are not at all into sharing the wealth. Uber has bragged that its UberX drivers in New York rake in a median salary of about $90,000. But drivers told Business Insider that when expenses are subtracted, the pay is closer to the minimum wage. For UberX, the non-luxury option, drivers own their cars and must pay for gas, insurance and maintenance.\n\nUber cut its rates in New York City by 20 percent, which meant the drivers made 20 percent less money. At first, the company said that the discount was temporary and then, in September, announced it would continue indefinitely.\n\nBoosting demand for the service, Uber told the drivers, would result in more business and more money. In other words, they'd get back to making what they did before by working longer hours.\n\nThe California App-Based Drivers Association says it calculated that a five-minute 2-mile trip in Los Angeles results in a $4 fare \u2014 out of which the driver makes only $1.25. That's what\u2019s left after Uber takes out a $1 \u201csafe rides fee\u201d and its 25 percent of the remainder. From that, drivers must subtract their cost of running a vehicle, about 50 cents a mile.\n\nUber's Republican fan base may be pained by the company's recent declaration that it adores the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe democratization of those types of benefits (allows) people to have more flexible ways to make a living,\u201d Kalanick said. \u201cThey don't have to be working for the Man.\u201d Isn't he cool?\n\nLess worshipful coverage of the young tech stars has been most welcome. It's not good for the boys when hipsters still using their service coin the term \u201cUber shame.\u201d\n\nDisrupters, meet the deleters.\n\nfharrop@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "An Uber exec talked about hiring an investigative team to find dirt on journalists writing unflattering things about the company.
