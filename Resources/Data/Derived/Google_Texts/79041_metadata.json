I am a lover of humanity, not a hater. \u2026 I have been immoral, drunk, high. I ran with the wicked people for 28 years and I have run with the Jesus people since and the contrast is astounding.\"\n\nHe spoke to the group for about 45 minutes.\n\n\"I tell people, 'You are a sinner, we all are. Do you want to hear my story before I give you the bottom line on your story?'\" he preached, according to the Daily Mail. \"We murder each other and we steal from one another, sex and immorality goes ballistic. All the diseases that just so happen to follow sexual mischief.\"\n\nRELATED: Phil Robertson's Other Controversial Quotes From His GQ Interview\n\nRobertson admitted that he too has committed sexual sins and offered advice to the group at White's Ferry Road Church.\n\n\"So what is your safest course of action?\" he asked. \"If you're a man, find yourself a woman, marry them and keep your sex right there. \u2026 You can have fun, but one thing is for sure, as long as you are both healthy in the first place, you are not going to catch some debilitating illness. There is safety there.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Commonsense says we are not going to procreate the human race unless we have a man and a woman. From the beginning Jesus said, 'It is a man and a woman.' Adam was made and Eve was made for this reason.\"\n\nThe \"Duck Dynasty\" patriarch added that throughout the human race, \"the sins have always been the same.\"\n\n\"We get high, we get drunk, we get laid, we steal and kill,\" he said. \"I am just reading what was written over 2,000 years ago. Those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom. All I did was quote from the scriptures, but they just didn't know it. \u2026 The sins are the same, humans haven't changed.\"\n\nREAD: Should A&E Have Suspended 'Duck Dynasty's' Phil Robertson for Anti-Gay Comments\n\nHe said that giving the world bad news causes them to \"start kicking and screaming,\" referring to the backlash his comments have generated.\n\nFinally, he told the room that Jesus would take away all sins.\n\n\"If you're a homosexual, he'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference? If you break one sin, you may as well break them all,\" he said. \"Why don't we just love each other enough that we wouldn't want to do these things to each other?\"\n\nRobertson also shot down claims that he is some country bumpkin who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"We are a bunch of rednecks from Louisiana, but I am not uneducated,\" he said. \"I have a degree from Louisiana Tech.\"\n\nHe also said he's not surprised by all the negative media attention.\n\n\"Jesus Christ was the most perfect being to ever walk this planet and he was persecuted and nailed to the cross,\" he said, \"so please don't be surprised when we get a little static.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the show have not responded to ABC News' requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "'Duck Dynasty' Star: 'All I Did Was Quote From the Scriptures'", "description": "'Duck Dynasty' Star: 'All I Did Was Quote From the Scriptures'", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/phil-robertson-defends-anti-gay-comments-all-i-did-was-quote-from-the-scriptures/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "He added that Jesus can save homosexuals, adulterers and liars.", "title": "'Duck Dynasty' Star: 'All I Did Was Quote From the Scriptures'"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "entertainment news, celebrity news, celebrity gossip", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaffb\"", "article_summary": "Phil Robertson Defends Anti-Gay Comments: 'All I Did Was Quote From the Scriptures'Phil Robertson is standing by his controversial statements.\n(Photo Credit: A&E)READ: 'Duck Dynasty' Suspends Phil Robertson After Anti-Gay CommentsHe continued, \"I love all men and women.\nREAD: Should A&E Have Suspended 'Duck Dynasty's' Phil Robertson for Anti-Gay CommentsHe said that giving the world bad news causes them to \"start kicking and screaming,\" referring to the backlash his comments have generated.\nDuring the group's meeting, Robertson defended his comments, adding that they were quotes from the Bible.\nThe Daily Mail said it was granted access yesterday while Robertson, 67, spoke to a small Bible study group in West Monroe, La."}
