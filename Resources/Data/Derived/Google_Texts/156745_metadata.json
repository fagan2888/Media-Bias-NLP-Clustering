Despite his early morning remarks, however, he earned loud plaudits from the audience on several occasions. And while he touched on both domestic and foreign policy, he mostly discussed his dissatisfaction with the \u201cPC police\u201d and the current administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that the Left in particular loves to re-label and rename things,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, if you\u2019re pro-life, you\u2019re anti-woman. If you\u2019re pro-traditional family, then you\u2019re a homophobe\u2026if you\u2019re black, and you oppose a progressive agenda, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to stop sitting quietly by,\u201d he urged the audience.\n\nHe also expressed concern about the failure of Big Government, and its alarming growth and expansion since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cIn 1969, 1.4 percent of our population was on food stamps,\u201d he intoned. \u201cToday, more than 14 percent are on food stamps \u2013 a ten fold increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to change course,\u201d he said.\n\nNot surprisingly, he also discussed the importance of having compassion for the poor and less fortunate.\n\n\u201cWe are a very smart people and a very compassionate people, and we need to find out how [to] strengthen the framework of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is our responsibility to take care of the indigent; it is not the government\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\n\nMost memorably, he recalled a story that recently deeply affected him. When he was at the airport several months ago, a woman approached him expressing broad support for his ideas, but wondered why he didn\u2019t want \u201cpoor people to have health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been listening to the propaganda,\u201d he said in reply. The truth is, he told the audience, is that he wants everyone to have health care, but the best way to do that is to first repeal a broken and unworkable law.\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] is absolutely about redistribution and control,\u201d he emphasized.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016 preview..05/26/2016 18:47:49PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "2016 preview.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Ben Carson at CPAC: \"We Need to Stop Sitting Quietly By\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/02/26/ben-carson-kicks-of-cpac-n1962678", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/15/41707d59-c7a5-4801-942f-d8d7adc4e166.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "2016 preview.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Ben Carson at CPAC: \"We Need to Stop Sitting Quietly By\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/02/26/ben-carson-kicks-of-cpac-n1962678", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/15/41707d59-c7a5-4801-942f-d8d7adc4e166.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Ben Carson at CPAC: \"We Need to Stop Sitting Quietly By\", Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cToday, more than 14 percent are on food stamps \u2013 a ten fold increase.\u201d\u201cWe need to change course,\u201d he said.\nIf you\u2019re pro-traditional family, then you\u2019re a homophobe\u2026if you\u2019re black, and you oppose a progressive agenda, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\u201cWe have to stop sitting quietly by,\u201d he urged the audience.\nDr. Ben Carson, for his part, had the honor of delivering the first CPAC speech of 2015.\n\u201cIn 1969, 1.4 percent of our population was on food stamps,\u201d he intoned.\n\u201cFor instance, if you\u2019re pro-life, you\u2019re anti-woman."}
