Could you be attacking Obamacare instead? OK, you disagree with the tactics, but we\u2019re all against Obamacare. Could we just talk that for three weeks?\u201d\n\n\u201c[I] get very angry at people like John McCain for spending so much time on TV attacking Ted Cruz,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we conservatives should spend our time attacking \u2014 forget McCain, I\u2019m all for attacking him \u2014 but other Republicans, they come from different states. Any Republican is better than any Democrat.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Coulter said, it comes down to winning elections and that is area where the so-called consulting class has let the Republican Party down.\n\n\u201cThe important thing to concentrate on now is winning elections. If we had \u2014 what was one of the ones you mentioned, West Virginia \u2014 political consultants blew that one because they wanted to make money off the deep-pocketed candidate , a very wealthy John Raese, who has three homes. They didn\u2019t even believe he lived in West Virginia. But consultants don\u2019t care. Should we run someone who could win in West Virginia, twice \u2014 in two Senate elections? Or, should we just go to the deep-pocketed candidates so we can buy Jaguars?\u201d\n\nCoulter pointed to the void the failures of the consulting class has created, which has been filled by conservative commentators like herself and Hannity and that has not always led to a winning outcome.\n\n\u201cIt started occurring to me: It really all starts with the political consultants, because the way the world is supposed to work \u2014 people like you and me and Levin, the chattering class \u2014 we\u2019re supposed to be able to be purists,\u201d Coulter continued. \u201cWe\u2019re the idea people. We chitchat. We move the public dialogue. Our job isn\u2019t to get Republicans elected. Our job is to move public dialogue. The Republican National Committee, the Republican Governors Association and Senatorial Committee \u2014 their job is to get Republicans elected. It was only when they dropped the ball so that they could line their own pockets that we started getting involved in this and by the way, it\u2019s been largely catastrophic.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Conservative commentator says Republicans should have attacked Obamacare instead of Cruz", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservative commentator Ann Coulter believes that the tea party's admirable effort to defund Obamacare during the government shutdown was weakened by internecine bickering over political tactics.", "title": "Coulter laments GOP infighting during government shutdown [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/coulter-laments-gop-infighting-during-government-shutdown-video/", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Coulter1017-e1382063246245.jpg", "height": 550}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative commentator says Republicans should have attacked Obamacare instead of Cruz", "title": "Coulter laments GOP infighting during government shutdown [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/17/coulter-laments-gop-infighting-during-government-shutdown-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Coulter1017-e1382063246245.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-17 23:14:36", "sailthru.title": "Coulter laments GOP infighting during government shutdown [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "government shutdown", "sailthru.description": "Conservative commentator Ann Coulter believes that the tea party's admirable effort to defund Obamacare during the government shutdown was weakened by internecine bickering over political tactics.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Coulter1017-e1382063246245.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe96\"", "article_summary": "Should we run someone who could win in West Virginia, twice \u2014 in two Senate elections?\nCould you be attacking Obamacare instead?\n3917295Conservative commentator Ann Coulter believes that the tea party\u2019s admirable effort to defund Obamacare during the government shutdown was weakened by internecine bickering over political tactics.\nThey didn\u2019t even believe he lived in West Virginia.\nThe Republican National Committee, the Republican Governors Association and Senatorial Committee \u2014 their job is to get Republicans elected."}
