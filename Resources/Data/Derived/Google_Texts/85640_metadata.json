Humphrey Civil and Human Rights Award, for her exemplary record of legislative achievement supporting social and economic justice for all Americans.\n\nThroughout her nearly 30 years in Congress, Pelosi has been a fervent and tireless champion of legislation to further and protect the rights of people of color, the LGBT community, people with disabilities, and those at the margins of society.\n\nIn 2007, Pelosi made history when she became the first woman to serve as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Her fearless leadership was critical to the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the repeal of the discriminatory \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d military policy.\n\nPelosi continues to stand at the vanguard of social justice today. In the 114th Congress, Pelosi is an unwavering advocate for civil and human rights priorities, including raising the federal minimum wage, reforming our discriminatory justice system, and restoring the Voting Rights Act.\n\nVisit our Hubert H. Humphrey Civil and Human Rights Award Dinner page for information about tickets, sponsorship, and our other nominee, Bryan A. Stevenson.\n\nRelated Posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "On May 11, the civil and human rights community will honor U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi with its highest honor, the Hubert H.
