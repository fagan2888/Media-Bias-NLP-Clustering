Oregon State University’s 2005 baseball team -- that put the Beavers in the College World Series -- will be inducted into the university’s Athletics Hall of Fame. The university made the announcement on Tuesday.

Among that class is Yankees center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, Navajo/ Colorado River Indian tribes, who helped the team win 46 games (suffering only 12 losses) during his tenure, and set the stage for the Beaver’s 2006 and 2007 national titles.

“The 2005 club is very deserving of this honor,” Oregon State head coach Pat Casey said in a news release. “The team started a run of 10 years that have been the most successful in our history. Each and every member of that team should be proud of what they accomplished that season and what they mean to this program. I cherish that season and it is one of many highlights of my coaching career, and I will never forget the commitment they made to making it all possible.”

Ellsbury was one of three All-American selections on the team, along with pitchers Dallas Buck and Jonah Nickerson. Over the past 10 seasons, OSU has won 420 games while advancing to nine NCAA tournaments.

Last year, Ellsbury donated $1million to his alma mater to help expand the baseball team’s locker room facilities. At the time, he told OregonLive.com, "OSU Baseball has given me so much. I am thrilled I am able to help my alma mater carry on its proud tradition; and perhaps, this expansion will convince a few more Pacific Northwest recruits to wear OSU orange and black." OSU responded to that donation by making plans to name its locker room facilities after the former Beaver.

The team will be formally inducted with additional members of the 2015 Hall of Fame class during a football home game weekend in the fall.
