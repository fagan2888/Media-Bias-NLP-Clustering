Kayakers on the South Platte River Saturday afternoon unsuccessfully tried to save a drowning woman.

A woman and her husband were tubing on the river when the woman fell into the water, said Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy Chad Teller.

Kayakers who were downstream pulled the woman from the water and attempted to resuscitate her, Teller said. A deputy who lives nearby responded to the scene and tried to help, he said.

The woman’s name has not been released. The cause of her tubing accident remains under investigation, Teller said.

The woman and her husband were not wearing life jackets, he said.
