FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez sits in a Massachusetts courtroom, listening intently as prosecutors build a case that he killed another man.

Hernandez appears to pay close attention during the trial, where he stands accused of murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee’s sister.

Hernandez takes notes and watches the monitor as evidence against him is displayed.

He sometimes jokes or laughs with his family members or fiancee who sit in the front row to support him, though that row is often empty.

On days his family comes, Hernandez turns on the charm, beaming a dimpled smile.

Hernandez seems smaller now than he was when he was first arrested. He occasionally talks sports with court officers and one of his lawyers.
