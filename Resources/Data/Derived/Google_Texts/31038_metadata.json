Bush.\n\nIn a never-before-reported meeting in Bush\u2019s Dallas office, Cruz began to outline his 2012 campaign playbook for the former president, according to people familiar with the conversation. Cruz explained how he would consolidate conservatives yearning for a political outsider, how he would outflank the front-runner on the right, how he would proudly carry the mantle of the ascendant tea party to victory over entrenched elites.\n\nIt was impressive foreshadowing. But Bush cut Cruz off before he could finish.\n\n\u201cI guess you don\u2019t want my support,\u201d Bush interrupted. \u201cTed, what the hell do you think I am?\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn my conversations with Republican policy types and Senate aides about Cruz, this lack of regard for his colleagues, and for the niceties that have traditionally governed the upper chamber, was a common theme. As Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, told me last week, referring to the time Cruz called McConnell a liar on the Senate floor: \u201cYou just don\u2019t do that. Are we not still gentlemen, and respectful of each other?\u201d\n\nAnother criticism of Cruz is that his antics are disruptive and damaging to the Republican Party. The shutdown nearly led to a national default, terrifying the business community. It led to the lowest approval ratings for the GOP in decades. Even the Kochs came out against such tactics. Groups like the Chamber of Commerce generally support a conservative platform, but not at the price of government ceasing to function. \u201cIt\u2019s not what he\u2019s trying to accomplish or what he says he\u2019s trying to accomplish that bothers people,\u201d former McConnell chief of staff Josh Holmes told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s consistently sacrificed the mutual goals of many for his personal enhancement.\u201d\u2026\n\nBut a Republican policy expert close to a number of top GOP operatives and donors insisted it\u2019s not about Cruz\u2019s style or his positions. It\u2019s his disingenuousness\u2014and inability to produce results. \u201cHe knows his tactics are bound to fail, but pursues them to debase his Republican colleagues under false pretenses and endear himself to the base as the only authentic conservative,\u201d said the expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he runs an organization that does not endorse candidates. But the effort doesn\u2019t result in smaller government or the end of Obamacare\u2014all it achieves is drawing attention to Cruz. \u201cHe is incapable of delivering anything but theater,\u201d the expert added.\n\n***\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is many people around here think Cruz would be worse for our chances of keeping the majority,\u201d said a senior Republican senator, who requested anonymity to speak about Cruz frankly. \u201cHe\u2019s so polarizing, it could be a wipeout.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cTrump says things that drive you up the wall \u2014 he says he doesn\u2019t like guys who get captured and that he\u2019ll make Mexico pay for the wall \u2014 but he\u2019s not mean. Cruz is mean,\u201d said the senior Republican\u2026\n\nAnother GOP senator who requested anonymity said that while neither Cruz nor Trump would be ideal ticket toppers in states such as New Hampshire and Florida, it will be easier for vulnerable incumbents to distance themselves from Trump than from Cruz.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s not really seen as a Republican, while Cruz is much more identified with the party,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cTrump would be better heading the ticket than Cruz.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cThe Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee must build a winning coalition that extends beyond the Republican base,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cRunning a campaign and expanding the coalition is an exercise in addition, not subtraction.\u201d\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who has been chasing Mr. Trump in the polls in early primary states, is popular among religious conservatives and hard-right Republican voters. But Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual bloc, such that it is, pulls in registered Democrats and other nontraditional Republican primary voters. Indeed, some polling has shown overlap in views among those who favor Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is a rigid ideologue,\u201d said Mr. Dent, who is not supporting Trump and has yet to endorse anyone. \u201cDonald Trump is ideologically scattered and malleable. In my view, a more rigid ideology would have a much harder time assembling a winning general election coalition than the less doctrinaire candidate.\u201d\n\n***\n\nCampbell tells me that the Cruz campaign is overlooking another fundamental aspect of his work: The party itself needs to be united behind its nominee, and the open warfare that has broken out over the prospect of Cruz becoming the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer suggests that\u2019s unlikely to happen should he best his Republican rivals. \u201cA candidate who appeals only to the establishment or only to the true-blue conservative can\u2019t win\u201d the general election, Campbell says. \u201cYou need them both together. Even if you got every conservative out to vote, you still need moderate support as well. And the establishment can\u2019t hope to put together a winning ticket without conservative support.\u201d\u2026\n\nI ask Campbell if he thinks Cruz can muster the establishment support necessary to unify the party and pull off a general-election victory. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says, \u201cand he hasn\u2019t made much of an effort to do it. My dream ticket would be a Rubio-Kasich ticket.\u201d Rubio, Campbell argues, is the only candidate who has shown the ability to appeal to both ideological conservatives and establishment moderates\u2026\n\nLike Campbell, Sides offers a word of caution about deeply ideological candidates. \u201cThere is some research that shows that candidates who are strongly ideological do suffer a penalty at the ballot box,\u201d he says, pointing to the performance of Republican Barry Goldwater, who lost a landslide to Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Democrat George McGovern, who was clobbered by Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\n***\n\nThe think\u00ading goes as fol\u00adlows: If Cruz loses Iowa, he peters out in New Hamp\u00adshire and doesn\u2019t pose a risk of fin\u00adish\u00ading in a re\u00adspect\u00adable second place. That al\u00adlows the es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment win\u00adner out of the Gran\u00adite State to build mo\u00admentum as the anti-Trump al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive\u2026\n\nThese strategists are look\u00ading at Trump\u2019s in\u00adcreas\u00adingly bel\u00adli\u00adcose at\u00adtacks against Cruz with glee. In their view, only Trump can suc\u00adcess\u00adfully put a dent in Cruz\u2019s sky-high fa\u00advor\u00adab\u00adil\u00adity among Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, which is a pre\u00adcon\u00addi\u00adtion to block\u00ading him from the nom\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big prob\u00adlem with the the\u00adory be\u00ading em\u00adbraced by many party pooh-bahs. It risks hand\u00ading the elec\u00adtion to Trump on a sil\u00adver plat\u00adter\u2014help\u00ading knock out his strongest rival while watch\u00ading help\u00adlessly as more-mod\u00ader\u00adate al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adives blow each oth\u00ader up in the pro\u00adcess. The wish\u00adful think\u00ading be\u00adhind such a strategy is that Cruz is ut\u00adterly un\u00adelect\u00adable, while Trump is un\u00adpre\u00addict\u00adable enough to win a gen\u00ader\u00adal elec\u00adtion. In real\u00adity, Cruz looks like an elect\u00adable stand\u00adard-bear\u00ader, while Trump could blow the party to smithereens\u2026\n\nOne thing is clear: Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan lead\u00aders de\u00adtest Cruz so much that they\u2019re will\u00ading to run the risk an un\u00adelect\u00adable Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan will glide to the nom\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion. In\u00adstead of com\u00ading up with a con\u00adcer\u00adted strategy to deal with Trump from the be\u00adgin\u00adning, they\u2019re now play\u00ading with fire with some last-ditch im\u00adpro\u00advising\u2014the con\u00adsequences of which could burn the party down.\n\n***\n\nIt may be that members of the Republican establishment, in their trolling of Cruz, don\u2019t address Trump\u2019s own electability because they recognize it for what it is. \u201cOf course, this willingness to accommodate Mr. Trump is driven in part by the fact that few among the Republican professional class believe he would win a general election,\u201d the New York Times reported in a separate piece about the establishment\u2019s supposed d\u00e9tente with the mogul. \u201cIn their minds it would be better to effectively rent the party to Mr. Trump for four months this fall, through the general election, than risk turning it over to Mr. Cruz for at least four years, as either the president or the next-in-line leader for the 2020 nomination.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the tell. Are we really to think that the Republican Party establishment has already come to terms with losing this election? The purpose of the Republican Party establishment is not primarily ideological; it is to win elections for the Republican Party so that the Republican Party will have more ability to do the bidding of the interest groups that prop it up. If the establishment was already prepared to lose the election, they\u2019d be better off going with Cruz to at least scratch the conservative movement\u2019s itch for one of their own as the nominee in order to prove that this path won\u2019t actually work\u2026\n\nTheir first objective is to take out Cruz. That means stopping him in Iowa. If he loses Iowa, a narrative sets in about how he blew it, and he might then finish out of the top three in New Hampshire. From there, he would likely not be able to make the dominant sweep through the South over the next month that his delegate strategy requires. If we look at Cruz\u2019s Iowa trend line over the past week as he\u2019s been taking incoming fire from all sides, it seems that this part of the plan is working.\n\n***\n\n\u201cThis has been overblown because a small number of people who really don\u2019t like Cruz are happy to say he\u2019s worse than Trump,\u201d said Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist and former House GOP leadership spokesman. \u201cPeople have been personally burned by Cruz and really don\u2019t like him but if they give Trump long enough, he\u2019ll burn them too.\u201d\n\nA senior congressional Republican aide, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, agreed with Cooper. \u201cPeople hate Cruz because they\u2019ve had to deal with him. Haven\u2019t had that experience with Trump yet,\u201d the aide said, confessing that he\u2019d vote for Cruz if they were his only two choices.\n\nThere\u2019s no consensus within the party\u2019s establishment as to which of the two candidates represents the greater threat. According to numerous GOP strategists with establishment connections who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s upside is that he\u2019s a businessman who they believe may be more pragmatic than ideological when push comes to shove, while Cruz\u2019s upside is that he\u2019s a longtime devotee to conservative causes (unlike Trump, who has famously voiced liberal views in the past) and more predictable.\n\n***\n\nCruz is a true believer. Trump has no firm principles except making money, getting attention, and gaining power. But Cruz really does detest the federal government, and has spent much of his life embracing radical right economic and political views. When Cruz said \u201cwe are facing what I consider to be the epic battle of our generation,\u201d he wasn\u2019t referring to jihadist terrorism but to Obamacare\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s more disciplined and strategic. Trump is all over the place, often winging it, saying whatever pops into his mind. Cruz hews to a clear script and a carefully crafted strategy. He plays the long game (as he\u2019s shown in Iowa). Cruz\u2019s legal career entailed a sustained use of the courts to achieve conservative ends, and he plots his moves carefully\u2026\n\nCruz is a loner who\u2019s willing to destroy institutions. Trump has spent his career using the federal government and making friends with big shots. Not Cruz. Most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate detest him. And Cruz is eager to destroy: He has repeatedly crossed to the other side of the Capitol and led House Republicans toward fiscal cliffs. In the Fall of 2013, Cruz\u2019s strident opposition to Obamacare \u2013 including a 21-hour talking marathon \u2014 led in a significant way to the shutdown of the federal government.\n\n***\n\nThese arguments are so weak that they can be understood only as rationalizations for a passionate hatred of Cruz felt by Republicans whom he has challenged. I\u2019m a friend of Cruz, but you need not be one to see that anger is leading the officials to make a mistake \u2014 or, rather, three of them\u2026\n\n[I]t is not at all clear that Trump would make a stronger general-election candidate. Some Republicans say he has more potential than Cruz among white voters without college degrees. Maybe so. But Trump could also do worse among college-educated whites and among nonwhites. What little evidence we have suggests he would be a weaker candidate overall: He\u2019s doing a bit worse than Cruz in head-to-head polling matchups with Hillary Clinton, and much worse in polls that measure whether voters view the candidates favorably or unfavorably.\n\nSome Republicans believe a Trump loss would not hurt their congressional candidates as much as a Cruz loss, because voters will see Trump as his own man while viewing Cruz as a symbol of the party. Dream on. Any nominee will be the de facto leader of the party\u2026\n\n[I]t\u2019s likely that congressional Republicans would find it easier to work with Cruz than Trump in the White House. Cruz\u2019s Senate colleagues think he has been selfish rather than principled when he has picked fights with them. But his self-interest as president would point him toward passing conservative legislation \u2014 replacing Obamacare, for example, something that Cruz and congressional Republicans have said mostly the same things about for several years. Trump would be much less predictable.\n\n***\n\nWhy does the Establishment hate Cruz so much? He threatens their livelihood, unlike Trump, whose real estate and casino business has required friendly dealings with politicians of all stripes for half a century. Permit me an anecdote: a couple of years ago I attended the annual dinner of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs where I was then a Fellow, and had the honor to sit next to Allen West. Col. West had just lost his Congressional seat in Florida to a massive Democratic campaign to dislodge him. We were discussing supply-side economics. Sen. Lindsey Graham sauntered over and flashed a smile with more teeth than a Great White. West and I stood up. I told Sen. Graham, \u201cWe should make this man president.\u201d Graham showed even more teeth and declared, \u201cFirst, we\u2019re going to make him rich.\u201d\u2026\n\nCorporate America wanted nothing to do with Ronald Reagan in 1980. Not a single Fortune 500 CEO backed him\u2013all of them supported George H. W. Bush or John Connally in the primaries. When informed of this (Jude Wanniski, who was at the meeting, told me), Reagan said that he didn\u2019t need them\u2013he would be the candidate of the entrepreneur, the small businessman, the farmer, the workingman. Cruz wants to be Reagan redux. The Establishment remembers Reagan; in particular, it remembers that the corporate powers-that-be of 1980 were dwarfed by the entrepreneurial newcomers whom the Reagan reforms unleashed. It didn\u2019t like Reagan the first time, and the last thing it wants is a younger incarnation of him.\n\nWithout a return to entrepreneurship, America\u2019s economy will stagnate and America\u2019s middle class will continue to lose ground. Donald Trump represents the triumph of resentment over hope. I don\u2019t know what American voters will do. But I\u2019m frightened.\n\n***\n\n***\n\n***\n\n\u201cIf it come downs to Cruz and Trump, I\u2019m a big Trump supporter.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Establishments.", "title": "Quotes of the day", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/26/quotes-of-the-day-2310/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "establishment, GOP, Iowa, religion, republican, Ted Cruz, trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-27T03:41:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T23:32:54+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The purpose of the Republican Party establishment is not primarily ideological; it is to win elections for the Republican Party so that the Republican Party will have more ability to do the bidding of the interest groups that prop it up.\nIndeed, some polling has shown overlap in views among those who favor Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nAre we really to think that the Republican Party establishment has already come to terms with losing this election?\nAre we not still gentlemen, and respectful of each other?\u201dAnother criticism of Cruz is that his antics are disruptive and damaging to the Republican Party.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s not really seen as a Republican, while Cruz is much more identified with the party,\u201d the lawmaker said."}
