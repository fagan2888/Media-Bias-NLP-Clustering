Canfield was a breast cancer survivor, then 50 years old. She had beaten cancer once, but couldn\u2019t provide health care for herself because her health history made the costs of private insurance astronomically high.\n\n\u201cI was self-employed,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter breast cancer in 1995, my rates went up every year. It was just too expensive and I didn\u2019t make enough to afford it.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Canfield said she had increased her deductible to the highest possible level, but the premiums kept increasing. She said she paid about $6,075 in premiums alone in 2009. Her work running her own cleaning service couldn\u2019t cover the cost of more than $500 a month for insurance.\n\n\u201cI simply can no longer afford to pay for my health care costs!!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cThanks to this incredible premium increase demanded by my insurance company, January will be my last month of insurance.\u201d\n\nShe wrote that she was proud to be cancer free for 11 years, but said the insurance company still viewed her as a risk and had made it impossible for her to get care.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance industry has technically not denied me insurance directly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut indirectly they have by increasing my costs.\u201d\n\nSeveral months after dropping her insurance, Canfield was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of blood cancer.\n\nCanfield was lying in a hospital bed receiving treatment in 2010 when she got a call from the president about her letter.\n\nHis interest and response in Canfield\u2019s case brought media attention to her hospital door.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Medina Hospital was prepared for the amount of attention I received,\u201d she said.\n\nCanfield had become an example of what many health care analysts said they believed was wrong with the health care industry. Canfield was able to receive treatments for her cancer through a compassionate-use program sponsored by the federal government for her specific type of cancer.\n\n\u201cIn a way, I was lucky it was one of the few things that could be treated by compassionate care,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what if I wasn\u2019t?\n\n\u201cWhat about all the other sick people who need insurance?\u201d\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed Obama\u2019s conversations with Canfield, she became well known to journalists covering the health care debate. She also became the target of opponents of what eventually became the Affordable Care Act who argued the law was the wrong approach to solving the nation\u2019s health care problems.\n\n\u201cThere are people that thought I was making the whole thing up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey called me a liar.\u201d\n\nBut Canfield said she mostly remembers the letters of support she received.\n\nShe still keeps all the cards and letters she received in binders, dated by the year and month that they arrived.\n\n\u201cI kept everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI received volumes of letters and cards.\u201d\n\nNow at age 56, the two-time cancer survivor also has had the opportunity to witness the law she worked so hard for get challenged twice and be upheld twice as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2012 after the Supreme Court upheld the law for the first time, Obama mentioned Canfield\u2019s struggle in a speech he delivered as his official response to the ruling. Most recently, the court issued a ruling in June upholding another challenge to the law by a vote of 6-3.\n\nCanfield said she wasn\u2019t ever really worried the law would be overturned by the high court.\n\n\u201cI just never really worried about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew they would do the right thing.\u201d\n\nCanfield said she never intended to become one of the human faces of the Obama campaign for health reform, but she\u2019s not afraid to share her story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many people come up to me and say their son or daughter now has health care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nA few years back after she was mentioned in Obama\u2019s 2012 speech, a United Kingdom journalist asked Canfield if she felt used by the White House for political gain.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t feel used, I feel privileged,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nHer letter to Obama hangs in the Oval Office in a frame, and she\u2019s met the president in person on more than one occasion. One month ago, shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent ruling, Canfield was invited aboard Air Force One, where she traveled with the president to a speaking engagement in Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\u201cWe had lunch on the plane. It was just a sandwich, but it was a really good sandwich,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got a tour of the entire plane, and got to see the conference room area.\u201d\n\nAfter getting off the plane in Nashville, Obama gave a speech about health care reform and said he \u201cfelt good\u201d about the direction health care reforms were he headed. He mentioned Canfield\u2019s fight against cancer and her fight for reform during his remarks.\n\n\u201cHe called me a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe said Obama always makes her feel welcome when they visit. She said she believes he wanted to see health care reform become a law with the goal of keeping people like her from slipping through the coverage system and facing insurmountable costs.\n\n\u201cI think he does care about what happens to people like me,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth care is important for everyone. You like to think you won\u2019t ever need it, but you just never know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "More than five years ago, a Medina Township woman sent a letter to newly elected President Barack Obama that begged him to reform the nation\u2019s health care system.
