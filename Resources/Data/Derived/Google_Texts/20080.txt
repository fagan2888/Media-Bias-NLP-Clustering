DENVER (AP) - A bill intended to expand women's access to no-cost birth control options under the Affordable Care Act has failed in a state Senate committee.



The bill would have provided Colorado women access to a full range of contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration without having to make copays.



The GOP-led Senate State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee rejected the bill on Monday.



It had passed the Democrat-led House.



Republicans have opposed paying for contraceptive coverage.



Democratic House sponsors Susan Lontine of Denver and Daneya Esgar of Pueblo said a lack of clarity at the federal level about birth control coverage had created inconsistent options for individual women.
