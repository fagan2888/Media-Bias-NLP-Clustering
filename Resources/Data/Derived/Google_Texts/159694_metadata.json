Which is the same reaction you get if you say \"President Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nHere's a roundup from other TV funnymen:\n\nDavid Letterman\n\nTed Cruz could be president of the United States. And if you thought the Secret Service was drinking before . . .\n\nTed Cruz was born in Canada, his father fled to the United States from Cuba, and yet Ted Cruz is against immigration. Isn't that odd?\n\nLittle-known facts about Ted Cruz (from Top 10 list): Ted is short for Tedium. . . . He was never elected to Congress, he just started showing up. . . . He's already planning a failed 2020 presidential bid.\u201d\n\nBill Maher\n\nTed Cruz is half-Canadian and half-Cuban -- the wit of Justin Bieber combined with the people skills of Scarface.\n\nThere were some people heckling Ted Cruz, and he accused them of being paid political operatives helping President Obama.
