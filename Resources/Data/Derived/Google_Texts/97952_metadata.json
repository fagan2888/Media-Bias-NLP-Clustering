The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is holding a meeting at its headquarters in Baltimore March 31 to discuss changes that would start in 2018.\n\nSmall plans, fast-growing issuers, new market entrants and nonprofit CO-OPs created with government funding under the ACA were hard hit in 2014 by big payments they were forced to make under the risk adjustment program, and some of them have asked for payment caps or exemptions for at least the first few years of the program . Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which generally have benefited from the program, argue that it is necessary to make sure insurers have an incentive to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n`Key Themes' for 2014\n\nUnder the risk adjustment program, funds are transferred from plans with healthier and lower-cost enrollees to plans with less healthy and high-cost enrollees. All individual and small group plans that took effect after the ACA was enacted in 2010, called nongrandfathered plans, must participate in the program, including those sold outside of the ACA marketplaces.\n\nOf the 468 issuers in the eligible individual market in 2014, 200 issuers, 43 percent, owed charges, while 268 issuers, 57 percent, received payments, the March 24 discussion paper said. It identified three \u201ckey themes\u201d for 2014:\n\nIssuers with low paid claims per enrollee had low risk scores, meaning they were more likely to be liable for payments, while those with high paid claims tended to have high risk scores.\n\nAn issuer's size didn't determine if they received a risk adjustment payment or charge. However, risk adjustment transfer as a share of issuer premiums varied much less for larger issuers than for smaller ones.\n\nIssuers with greater than average proportions of enrollees in gold and platinum plans\u2014which cover the most medical costs\u2014were more likely to receive payments and issuers with higher proportions of members in bronze plans that cover the least medical costs were more likely to owe charges.\n\nCMS's Investigation\n\nThe discussion paper said the CMS is \u201cinvestigating whether the risk adjustment methodology appropriately addresses plan differences.\u201d The transfer equation doesn't address network differences, plan efficiency or effective care coordination or disease management, it said.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring a number of ways of addressing such plan differences in our methodology,\u201d including by modifying the risk adjustment equation using a plan\u2019s own premium, the dscussion paper said. That appeared to be a reference to the proposal made by some of the CO-OPs and other plans to cap risk adjustment payments based on a share of their premiums, at least in the initial years of the program. But the CMS said there could be \u201cunintended incentives to raise or lower premiums in order to take advantage of this effect.\u201d\n\nThe discussion paper said that \u201cin general, the HHS risk adjustment methodology is working as intended,\u201d supporting market stability by pooling risk and transferring funds from low-risk plans to high-risk plans.\n\nAvalere Report\n\nAlso on March 24 health-care consulting firm Avalere released a report suggesting changes to the risk adjustment program.\n\nACA individual marketplace enrollees are older, lower-income and have higher health needs than people in the large group employer market, on which the risk adjustment model was based, Avalere found. Further, 30 percent of ACA marketplace enrollees were enrolled for less than a year and their costs are 18 percent higher than full-year enrollees, Avalere said.\n\nWhile the CMS uses 127 health conditions to predict the risk of enrollees, only about 19 percent of individuals in the market ended up having one of those conditions, and the risk adjustment program may not be compensating plans for the actual risk of individuals enrolled, Avalere said. The exchange population is different from the Medicare model on which the CMS is basing its risk adjustment model, Tom Kornfield, vice president of Avalere, told Bloomberg BNA March 24.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken some good steps with the prescription drug information they\u2019re talking about including,\u201d Kornfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s a positive sign.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sara Hansard in Washington at shansard@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/changes-weighed-aca-n57982069036/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Possible changes to the Affordable Care Act's program for protecting insurers that cover sicker populations were laid out March 24 in a discussion\u00a0paper\u00a0issued by the HHS.", "title": "Changes Weighed for ACA Program Covering Sicker Patients"}, "csrf-token": "5J7LWg4cEYKP_ASj09AKbFbJltLCgdkOx_Ndg4bw6E_D5fLxOPZqQSBuIYj9NG17y1t0Eun6Jp8d-zT7bwC1Tt0JZZOXDmn80djyLKs9M0s1:pzT8i5awwlwPcXIe625tSGUG1oUPqOEmpG9jqOtMxT6OOGR2c03fsAA82jTrWpj-xQysq1gLnktaRbbwTJSuFJuN52qIwP1CLYK7tZnXwR41", "description": "Possible changes to the Affordable Care Act's program for protecting insurers that cover sicker populations were laid out March 24 in a discussion\u00a0paper\u00a0issued by the HHS", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Avalere ReportAlso on March 24 health-care consulting firm Avalere released a report suggesting changes to the risk adjustment program.\nFurther, 30 percent of ACA marketplace enrollees were enrolled for less than a year and their costs are 18 percent higher than full-year enrollees, Avalere said.\n`Key Themes' for 2014Under the risk adjustment program, funds are transferred from plans with healthier and lower-cost enrollees to plans with less healthy and high-cost enrollees.\nHowever, risk adjustment transfer as a share of issuer premiums varied much less for larger issuers than for smaller ones.\nAn issuer's size didn't determine if they received a risk adjustment payment or charge."}
