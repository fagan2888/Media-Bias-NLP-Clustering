What is unfolding in front of us is nothing short of spectacular. The problems with healthcare.gov are slowly being resolved which is helping more and more people sign up for affordable healthcare, many for the first time in their life. The law provides so much more than that, including standards for even the lowest level plans, protections for young adults 26 and younger, and the elimination of pre-existing plans. Of course, you will not hear the success stories on the news, because those stories are not nearly as sexy as the \u201cObama Lied\u201d slogan they are so fond of.\n\nThe biggest downside of the ACA is the reliance on the private insurance industry. It does not have to be this way, however. There is yet another provision in the Affordable Care Act that can open the door for states to institute their own single-payer healthcare system. Other states have a public option, especially for those below a certain income level, but no state had instituted a true single-payer system. All of this has changed thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVermont\u2014Home of Ben and Jerry\u2019s, Maple Syrup, Bernie Sanders and the first state to pass marriage equality. Now, Vermont will be known for something that will impact every resident in the state.\n\nThe ACA provided states with federal funds to institute a Medicaid expansion. The states chose to expand the program also were able to set up their own state exchanges, which were relatively free from the problems the federal site had. Vermont decided to take it a step further by setting up their very own single payer system.\n\nThe slogan of the program: Everybody in, nobody out.\n\nThe program will be fully operational by 2017, and will be funded through Medicare, Medicaid, federal money for the ACA given to Vermont, and a slight increase in taxes. In exchange, there will be no more premiums, deductibles, copay\u2019s, hospital bills or anything else aimed at making insurance companies a profit. Further, all hospitals and healthcare providers will now be nonprofit.\n\nThis system will provide an instant boost the state economy. On the one side, you have workers that no longer have to worry about paying medical costs or a monthly premium and are able to use that money for other things. On the other side, you have the burden of paying insurance taken off of the employers side, who will be able to use the saved money to provide a better wage and/or reinvest in their company through updated infrastructure and added jobs. It is a win-win solution.\n\nTo make sure that it is done right the first time, Vermont brought in a specialist who knows a thing or two about setting up a single-payer system.\n\nDr. William Hsaio, the Harvard health care economist who helped craft health systems in seven countries, was Vermont\u2019s adviser. He estimates that Vermont will save 25 percent per capita over the current system in administrative costs and other savings.\n\n\n\nMany like to say that the United States has the best healthcare system in the world. The problem is we don\u2019t. Not even close. In fact, the only way you can get the best healthcare in the world, is if you are willing and able to pay for it. The United States can and must do better for its people.\n\nCosts have to be held down \u2014 there is no reason why the U.S. has to pay twice the amount per capita as the next most costly system in the world (Norway\u2019s), and still not cover millions of its citizens. A Harvard Medical School study states that 45,000 Americans die each year from treatable diseases because they cannot afford to get treatment.\n\n\n\n45,000 Americans die every single year because they cannot afford treatment, are you ready for that? That is 15 times the amount of people that died during the September 11, 2001, attacks, or perhaps for you Righty\u2019s out there you would rather see it put this way, 11,250 times the amount of people that died in the Benghazi attack. That equals 5 Americans that die every hour, of every day, of every year because of a preventable illness that was not taken care of due to lack of access and means.\n\nEven once the Affordable Care Act wrinkles are ironed out, which they will be, and every America is covered, which will happen, that will not change the fact that all of this is being driven by a for-profit system by companies that only care about their bottom line. Despite rules in the ACA which prevent insurance companies from absolutely gouging their customers, insurance companies are not exactly know for their ethical behavior.\n\nA single-payer system would all but eliminate anybody dying unnecessarily due to lack of access to healthcare. Our Declaration of Independence states, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d How can somebody have life and happiness, without their health? Despite the glaring hypocrisy of rich, white males who owned slaves stating all men are created equal, we have come a long way from 1776. Yet when it comes to the very basic need, we are left to the whim of a business. Single-payer is inevitable, and the ACA is a giant step in that direction. We need must hold our officials to a higher standard which will get us there faster. 40,000 people a year is absolutely unacceptable. Vermont saw the writings on the wall. Will the rest of us?\n\nVideo\n\nBernie Sanders on MSNBC discussing his state\u2019s new single-payer system.\n\nSee more at Occupy Democrats on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Truthout sparks action by revealing systemic injustice and providing a platform for transformative ideas through investigative reporting and analysis.", "title": "Vermont Approves Single-Payer Health Care: &quot;Everybody In, Nobody Out&quot;", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Single-payer is inevitable, and the ACA is a giant step in that direction.", "title": "Vermont Approves Single-Payer Health Care: ''Everybody In, Nobody Out''", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/20495-vermont-approves-single-payer-health-care-everybody-in-nobody-out", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2013_12/2013_1207-6.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2013_12/2013_1207-6.jpg", "title": "Vermont Approves Single-Payer Health Care: &quot;Everybody In, Nobody Out&quot;", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@truthout"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "britney", "keywords": "Truthout, truth-out, truth out, independent news, nonprofit news, ad free news, progressive news, investigative reporting, critical analysis, BuzzFlash, headlines, commentary, fracking, Guantanamo, mass incarceration, prisons, new economy, police militarization, climate change", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08e0\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Ted Swedenburg / Flickr)The Affordable Care Act continues to plow ahead, despite Republican attempts to fight it at every turn.\nThere is yet another provision in the Affordable Care Act that can open the door for states to institute their own single-payer healthcare system.\nAll of this has changed thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\nOther states have a public option, especially for those below a certain income level, but no state had instituted a true single-payer system.\nVideoBernie Sanders on MSNBC discussing his state\u2019s new single-payer system."}
