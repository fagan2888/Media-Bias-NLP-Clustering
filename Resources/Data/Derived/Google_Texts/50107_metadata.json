At President Barack Obama\u2019s urging, Joey fired the cannon inside the East Room of the White House. Joey also gave the president a card that read, \u201cDon\u2019t be bored, make something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Avila said of the first lady\u2019s invitation to attend the speech. \u201cBut I know this is not about me. It\u2019s about the movement. It\u2019s just getting stronger and bigger.\u201d\n\nCristian Avila: Avila, a 23-year-old undocumented immigrant, fasted for 22 days to underscore the \u201cmoral urgency\u201d for Congress to pass immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants.

The Obamas, Vice President Joe Biden and other dignitaries visited during the fast.\n\nOther Arizonans at the State of the Union\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com Tue Jan 28, 2014 11:44 PM\n\nCory Remsburg, a decorated Army Ranger from Gilbert, has made a habit out of meeting President Barack Obama.\n\nThe first time, Remsburg was a paratrooper doing a ceremonial jump.\n\nThe second time, he was in a hospital with a massive head wound.\n\nThe third time, he was in a wheelchair, but stood to salute his commander in chief.\n\nThe fourth time came Tuesday after Obama delivered the State of the Union address at which Remsburg was seated as an honored guest in the audience.\n\nRemsburg, 30, who was wounded by an explosive device in Afghanistan, and his father, Craig, were among 24 guests invited to sit in the Capitol gallery with first lady Michelle Obama. President Obama introduced and praised Remsburg and all those who serve in uniform at the end of his speech.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty awesome event,\u201d the father said. \u201cHe (Cory) was humbled by the recognition, and he thanked the White House and Congress for letting him represent the wounded warriors.\u201d\n\nCraig Remsburg said the invitation came last week. His son has spent the past three years in hospitals and rehabilitation centers learning to walk and talk again. The father hopes that story will remind the country that soldiers are still being killed and wounded.\n\n\u201cIf he sends that message by his presence alone, then he\u2019s done something,\u201d the elder Remsburg said by phone from Washington on Tuesday. \u201cThat was his take on it: If I can help others know that people are hurt and are continually going to get hurt in war, then I\u2019ve done my job.\u201d\n\nSgt. 1st Class Cory Remsburg, the recipient of the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, still has four to six hours of speech and physical therapy every day, his father said. He is blind in one eye and has a titanium plate in his skull.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Remsburgs met with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to discuss Cory\u2019s recovery.\n\nCory\u2019s meeting with Obama capped a remarkable string of face-to-face encounters between one soldier and one president.\n\n2 chance encounters\n\nCory Remsburg signed up for the Army on his 18th birthday. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who served in the military for 25 years. Remsburg was training to be a Ranger on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2003, he began a string of months-long deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBetween two deployments came a trip to France in June 2009. Remsburg was among Army Rangers who re-enacted the 65th anniversary of the D-Day paratrooper jump into Normandy during World War II. There, he met the visiting President Obama.\n\nWeeks later, Remsburg was sent to Afghanistan again. It was his 10th deployment.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2009, Remsburg and his unit were preparing to clear a landing zone for helicopters. One soldier stepped on an improvised explosive device. The blast from the 500-pound bomb killed the soldier and critically wounded others, including Remsburg.\n\nRemsburg was 5 feet from the blast. He suffered massive head trauma. He spent months in a coma. When he awakened, doctors moved him to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., to rebuild his skull.\n\nRemsburg was still at Bethesda in April 2010 when Obama came to visit wounded vets.\n\nDuring the tour, the president stepped into a room and saw a picture of himself on the wall. The photo showed the president meeting a soldier in France less than a year earlier. That soldier was Remsburg, now in the bed in front of him.\n\n\u201cAnd there at Bethesda, we were meeting again,\u201d Obama said during a speech to the Disabled Veterans of America Conference in 2010. \u201cAnd Cory still couldn\u2019t speak. But he looked me in the eye. He lifted his arm, and he shook my hand firmly. And when I asked how he was feeling, he held up his hand, pulled his fingers together and gave a thumbs up.\u201d\n\nLeading the way\n\nRemsburg spent the next three years in and out of hospitals and clinics. Last April, he was released to his family\u2019s home in Gilbert.\n\nThat August, Obama was scheduled to visit Desert Vista High School for a speech on the housing market and the economy. White House staff arranged a private meeting between Remsburg and Obama in a classroom at the school, the third meeting between the two.\n\nObama did not mention Remsburg during his speech that afternoon in Ahwatukee Foothills. But he did update the Disabled Veterans conference a few days later.\n\nIn that speech, Obama said he saw Remsburg alert in a wheelchair, far from the soldier who had been in a hospital bed barely able to move.\n\n\u201cAnd then, he wanted to show me something,\u201d Obama said in the speech. \u201cAnd he leaned out of his chair. And he reached out and grabbed his walker. And with the help of his parents, he pulled himself forward and he stood up.\n\n\u201cAnd he looked at me, and he gave me a sharp salute.\u201d Remsburg also recited his unit\u2019s slogan: \u201cRangers lead the way.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama quoted something else Remsburg told him: \u201cMy recovery has not been easy. Nothing in life that\u2019s worth anything is easy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Parker Leavitt and Richard Ruelas", "description": "Wounded Gilbert soldier, a guest at speech, meets Obama a 4th time,Cory Remsburg, a decorated Army Ranger from Gilbert, has made a habit out of meeting President Barack Obama.", "pubdate": "Tue Jan 28, 2014 11:44 PM", "creditline": "The Republic  |  azcentral.com", "headline": "Wounded Gilbert soldier, a guest at speech, meets Obama a 4th time", "section": "News", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2ugn", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Wounded Gilbert soldier, a guest at speech, meets Obama a 4th time"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Wounded Gilbert soldier, a guest at speech, meets Obama a 4th time, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "Cory Remsburg, a decorated Army Ranger from Gilbert, has made a habit out of meeting President Barack Obama.", "title": "Wounded Gilbert soldier, a guest at speech, meets Obama a 4th time", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20140128wounded-gilbert-soldier-guest-speech-meets-obama-th-time.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd347b\"", "article_summary": "President Obama introduced and praised Remsburg and all those who serve in uniform at the end of his speech.\nIn that speech, Obama said he saw Remsburg alert in a wheelchair, far from the soldier who had been in a hospital bed barely able to move.\nThe photo showed the president meeting a soldier in France less than a year earlier.\nThere, he met the visiting President Obama.\nWhite House staff arranged a private meeting between Remsburg and Obama in a classroom at the school, the third meeting between the two."}
