However, some degree of satisfaction was reported with respect to claims handling, policy issuance turnaround time and regulatory premium tax compliance.\n\n\u2022 Fronting costs remained unchanged over the prior year for 60% of survey respondents, while 30% reported increases of up to 15% and 10% reported decreases of up to 15%.\n\n\u2022 Fifty-nine percent of survey respondents reported that their captives purchase reinsurance, and 42% reported purchasing this coverage from a company other than an affiliate or their fronting insurer. A variety of Bermuda-market reinsurers were the predominant choice for 85.6% of captive reinsurance purchasers, followed by Lloyd's of London, cited by 52.7% of survey participants.\n\n\u2022 Approximately half of respondents reported no change in the cost of reinsurance from the prior year, while 26% reported increases, most of up to 15%, but some reported price increases exceeding 25%. However, 21% of survey respondents said their reinsurance premiums decreased, with cuts hovering below 5%.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u2022 More than one-quarter of survey respondents reported they marketed some portion of their captive program this year. The chief reasons cited for doing so were pricing increases, cited by 25%, and service issues, also cited by 25%, while 17.5% reported doing so routinely as part of good captive governance. Other reasons reported for shopping some portion of captive programs were: collateral issues, cited by 12.5% of survey respondents; claims oversight issues, cited by 7.5%; withdrawal of insurer, 5.0%; claims oversight issues, 2.5%; insurer change in leadership, 2.5%; and other, 2.5%.\n\nThe survey was conducted between Dec. 10, 2013, and Feb. 7, 2014, and included responses from 133 captive owners, 59.4% of which owned single-parent captives, 17.3% segregated cell captives, 15.0% risk retention groups, 6.8% association captives and 1.5% agency captives.\n\nCICA members can receive the full compiled results on the members-only section here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The use of captives to insure stop-loss coverage for self-funded health benefits was the largest area of employee benefits interest among the participants in the \u201c14th annual Captive Insurance Market Study\u201d conducted by the Captive Insurance CompaniesWhile only ...", "title": "Interest in using captives to insure medical stop-loss coverage growing - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140311/NEWS06/140319952", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20140311/NEWS06/140319952/AR/0/employee-benefits.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The use of captives to insure stop-loss coverage for self-funded health benefits was the largest area of employee benefits interest among the participants in the \u201c14th annual Captive Insurance Market Study\u201d conducted by the Captive Insurance CompaniesWhile only ...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Interest in using captives to insure medical stop-loss coverage growing - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "%%BREAK%%\u2022 More than one-quarter of survey respondents reported they marketed some portion of their captive program this year.\nAmong the other lines of employee benefits coverage respondents reported currently funding in their captives were: disability, funded by 5.3%; life, also by 5.3%; and accident and health, by 4.5%.\nHowever, 21% of survey respondents said their reinsurance premiums decreased, with cuts hovering below 5%.\n\u2022 Fifty-nine percent of survey respondents reported that their captives purchase reinsurance, and 42% reported purchasing this coverage from a company other than an affiliate or their fronting insurer.\n\u2022 Two insurers \u2014 Schaumburg, Ill.-based Zurich North America and Cincinnati-based Great American Insurance Co. \u2014 were identified as the only two insurers that could meet both property/casualty and employee benefits fronting needs."}
