Nothing attempted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, remotely compares in imperial hubris.\n\nMr. Bush gained explicit congressional consent for his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In contrast, the Obama administration has not even published a legal opinion attempting to justify the president\u2019s assertion of unilateral war-making authority. This is because no serious opinion can be written. ...\n\nMr. Obama may rightly be frustrated by gridlock in Washington, but his assault on the rule of law is a devastating setback for our constitutional order. His refusal even to ask the Justice Department to provide a formal legal pretext for the war on ISIS is astonishing.\n\nSince ISIS poses a new problem for the president, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires him to seek a new mandate from Congress. The resolution, enacted over President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s veto at the end of the Vietnam War, requires the president to obtain congressional assent within 60 days of commencing \u201chostilities\u201d; if he fails, he must withdraw American forces within 30 days.\n\nThe administration gave Congress the requisite notice on Aug. 8 that it had begun bombing ISIS, and so the time for obtaining approval runs out on Oct. 7. But Mr. Obama and his lawyers haven\u2019t even mentioned the War Powers Resolution in announcing the new offensive against ISIS \u2014 there is no indication that he intends to comply with this deadline...\n\nHe is acting on the proposition that the president, in his capacity as commander in chief, has unilateral authority to declare war.\n\nIn taking this step, Mr. Obama is not only betraying the electoral majorities who twice voted him into office on his promise to end Bush-era abuses of executive authority. He is also betraying the Constitution he swore to uphold.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In his terrific no-holds-barred op-ed, \"Obama's Betrayal of the Constitution,\" in today's New York Times, Yale University law professor Bruce Ackerman", "title": "Obama's War on ISIS Betrays the Constitution, Asserts New York Times Op-Ed", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/12/obamas-war-on-isis-betrays-the-constitut", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14105487695611.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14105487695611.jpg", "description": "In his terrific no-holds-barred op-ed, \"Obama's\nBetrayal of the Constitution,\" in today's New York\nTimes, Yale University law professor Bruce Ackerman argues\nthat the president is vastly exceeding his constitutional authority\nto wage war.&nbsp;\nFrom the op-ed:\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019s \ndeclaration of war agai", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama's War on ISIS Betrays the Constitution, Asserts <em>New York Times</em> Op-Ed"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Congress", "published_time": "2014-09-12T19:41:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce86c\"", "article_summary": "In his terrific no-holds-barred op-ed, \"Obama's Betrayal of the Constitution,\" in today's New York Times, Yale University law professor Bruce Ackerman argues that the president is vastly exceeding his constitutional authority to wage war.\nHe is acting on the proposition that the president, in his capacity as commander in chief, has unilateral authority to declare war.\nHis refusal even to ask the Justice Department to provide a formal legal pretext for the war on ISIS is astonishing.\nSince ISIS poses a new problem for the president, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires him to seek a new mandate from Congress.\n...Mr. Obama may rightly be frustrated by gridlock in Washington, but his assault on the rule of law is a devastating setback for our constitutional order."}
