Ware, 33, has missed three games this season, including the past two after aggravating the injury against Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s close. He\u2019s making some progress,\u201d Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Thursday morning. \u201cLike I said yesterday, he still has some steps to go.\u201d\n\nOutside linebackers Shaquil Barrett, Shane Ray and Lerentee McCray again will pick up the bulk of Ware\u2019s snaps.\n\nWare wasn\u2019t the only key starter out of practice Thursday morning. Left guard Evan Mathis (ankle) sat out for the second consecutive day.\n\nKubiak said Mathis\u2019 ankle was \u201creally sore\u201d and he also had a ways to go before being ready to play Sunday. Rookie guard Max Garcia likely would start at left guard if Mathis is unable to play.\n\nThe Broncos did get some positive news from the wideout position Thursday as Emmanuel Sanders practiced for the second day in a row.\n\nSanders missed the Broncos\u2019 17-15 win at Chicago because of a left high ankle sprain, but he ran well both days in practice this week.\n\nQuarterback Peyton Manning (foot) was the only other player not at practice Thursday. He will be out for at least the next two weeks.\n\nKubiak said safety T.J. Ward was the Broncos\u2019 defensive player of the week Sunday against Chicago. He praised Ward\u2019s composure after some tough penalties and non-penalties as well as his play in the run game and in coverage.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 DeMarcus Ware expected to be out Sunday against New England", "title": "Broncos\u2019 DeMarcus Ware expected to be out Sunday against New England", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/broncos-demarcus-ware-expected-to-be-out-sunday-against-new-england/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__DeMarcus-Warep1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__DeMarcus-Warep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T10:48:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:11:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rookie guard Max Garcia likely would start at left guard if Mathis is unable to play.\nKubiak said Mathis\u2019 ankle was \u201creally sore\u201d and he also had a ways to go before being ready to play Sunday.\nLeft guard Evan Mathis (ankle) sat out for the second consecutive day.\nDeMarcus Ware has been in the league long enough to know when he\u2019s not quite ready to play.\nWare, 33, has missed three games this season, including the past two after aggravating the injury against Indianapolis."}
