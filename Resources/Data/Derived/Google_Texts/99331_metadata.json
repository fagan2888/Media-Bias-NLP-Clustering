Blue Cross customers have been notified that the HCA-owned hospitals could be removed from their in-network plans by the end of the month if the two don\u2019t come to an agreement.

BCBSTX embraced the federal marketplaces like no other insurer, and suffered correlating losses. Last year, its parent company, Chicago\u2019s Health Care Services Corporation, paid $1.22 for every $1 it brought in. Since 2014, its plans in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Illinois, and Montana have lost more than $2 billion in that sphere, about $720 million of which is attributable to just Texas.\n\nHCA, meanwhile, brought in a record $4 billion. Locally, it\u2019s made headlines for the purchase of the upscale acute care hospital formerly known as Forest Park Medical Center at Frisco, which has been rebranded as Medical City Frisco and is operating under Medical Center of Plano\u2019s license.\n\nHCA sent the below statement on the matter:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "The Hospital Corporation of America and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state\u2019s largest insurer, have reached an impasse on contract negotiations that could result in the Tennessee chain\u2019s 40 Texas hospitals being removed from the insurer\u2019s in-network plans.
