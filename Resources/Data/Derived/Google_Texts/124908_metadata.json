Police also seized 12 vehicles and cash, and froze assets worth millions of dollars.\n\nIt is understood that people regularly drove overnight to raid reefs near Port Fairy, and returned to Melbourne in the mornings. The abalone was reportedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven of those arrested appeared at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday.\n\nPhuc Nguyen, Thanh Hai Nguyen, Thi Hung Van, Ca Nguyen, Ne Huynh, Han Dang and Van Nguyen were charged with trafficking commercial quantities of abalone, and selling and receiving abalone, rock lobster and other molluscs without authorisation. They were also charged with dealing with the seafood as proceeds of crime and agreeing with others to commit indictable offences.\n\nAll except Thi Hung Van were also charged with conspiring to traffick a commercial quantity of abalone, and taking seafood for sale without authorisation.\n\nMagistrate Kay Robertson extended their bail until their next court appearance on March 3 on the same conditions.\n\nThey were all ordered not to associate with the other accused, except for those whose partners are also accused. They were not to possess any abalone or fishing equipment or engage in fishing activities. They were also ordered to surrender their passports and to stay away from any marine environment.\n\nThe other seven people arrested over the alleged syndicate are expected to appear in court on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "Members of an alleged seafood trafficking syndicate have been charged with illegally taking and selling commercial quantities of abalone.", "title": "'Syndicate' members charged with trafficking abalone, rock lobster", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/syndicate-members-charged-with-trafficking-abalone-rock-lobster-20141020-118oce.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/z/v/l/k/l/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.118oce.png/1446014555851.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theage", "image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/z/v/l/k/l/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.118oce.png/1446014555851.jpg"}, "description": "Members of an alleged seafood trafficking syndicate have been charged with illegally taking and selling commercial quantities of abalone.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Syndicate' members charged with trafficking abalone, rock lobster"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Members of an alleged seafood trafficking syndicate have been charged with illegally taking and selling commercial quantities of abalone."}, "article_summary": "Members of an alleged seafood trafficking syndicate have been charged with illegally taking and selling commercial quantities of abalone.\nPhuc Nguyen, Thanh Hai Nguyen, Thi Hung Van, Ca Nguyen, Ne Huynh, Han Dang and Van Nguyen were charged with trafficking commercial quantities of abalone, and selling and receiving abalone, rock lobster and other molluscs without authorisation.\nAll except Thi Hung Van were also charged with conspiring to traffick a commercial quantity of abalone, and taking seafood for sale without authorisation.\nThey were also charged with dealing with the seafood as proceeds of crime and agreeing with others to commit indictable offences.\nThe other seven people arrested over the alleged syndicate are expected to appear in court on Tuesday."}
