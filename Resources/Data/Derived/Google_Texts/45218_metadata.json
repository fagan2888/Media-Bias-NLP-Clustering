But these organizations, ensconced in Northern Virginia office parks and elsewhere, aren\u2019t worried about the establishment\u2019s ire. In fact, they welcome it. Business has boomed since the push to defund Obamacare caught on. Conservative activists are lighting up social media, donations are pouring in, and e-mail lists are growing.\n\nThere you have it. Gridlock is good for business. Nuff said.\n\nIt's all pretty remarkable, isn't it? Our government is deadlocked because Republicans control one half of one branch of the government. The tea party faction controls that half because it can prevent John Boehner from being re-elected Speaker if he crosses them. So we've somehow maneuvered ourselves into a place where 40 or 50 fanatic representatives can bring the entire government of the most powerful nation on Earth to a screeching halt. And somehow this seems....kind of normal. It hardly even raises an eyebrow anymore.\n\nJust thought I'd mention that.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Assuming, of course, that your business involves fundraising from crotchety tea party members.", "title": "Gridlock might destroy the US economy, but it's still good for business", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/gridlock-economy-tea-party", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Gridlock might destroy the US economy, but it's still good for business", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/gridlock-economy-tea-party", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce78\"", "article_summary": "Gridlock is good for business.\nBut these organizations, ensconced in Northern Virginia office parks and elsewhere, aren\u2019t worried about the establishment\u2019s ire.\nBusiness has boomed since the push to defund Obamacare caught on.\nThe tea party faction controls that half because it can prevent John Boehner from being re-elected Speaker if he crosses them.\nConservative activists are lighting up social media, donations are pouring in, and e-mail lists are growing."}
