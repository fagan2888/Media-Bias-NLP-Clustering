Holder Jr. announced his resignation, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez randomly encountered three reporters sharing the cheap seats one section to the left.\n\nThey asked the obvious question: Could Perez \u2013 a Snyder native and former assistant attorney general for civil rights \u2013 be nominated to be the next attorney general?\n\nPerez held his lips tight and shook his head from left to right, as if to say no.\n\nBut a week later, more and more people in the nation\u2019s capital are pondering the same question and answering it: Maybe.\n\nSources in the Obama administration and Congress identify Perez, along with Solicitor General Donald B. Verilli Jr. and former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, as the leading candidates to succeed Holder, who plans to end a stormy six-year tenure as soon as the Senate confirms his successor.\n\nWashington sources said Perez has great strengths \u2013 most notably a close relationship with President Obama and a depth of experience \u2013 along with some weaknesses largely tied to the highly partisan nature of modern Washington.\n\nRepublicans privately say the nomination of Perez, a progressive hero, would likely prompt a confirmation battle in the Senate.\n\nPerez, a graduate of Canisius High School, Brown University and Harvard Law School, isn\u2019t saying very much about the possibility that he soon might be named the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow the word on the street,\u201d Perez said last week in an interview with the Huffington Post. \u201cI don\u2019t think about hypotheticals \u2026 I love my job and I love the work I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nOne of Perez\u2019s brothers, Dr. Jose G. Perez-Brache, took the matter one step further, though.\n\n\u201cHe likes his position as secretary of labor,\u201d said Perez-Brache, an internist at Kenmore Mercy Hospital. \u201cBut if the president asked him to be attorney general, he probably would not be able to say no.\u201d\n\nThat fact stems, in part, from the strong relationship Perez has built with the president in his 14 months as labor secretary.\n\nPOLITICO, a Washington website that tracks such things, noted late last month that Perez has `traveled more with the president in the past year than any other Cabinet secretary.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because the president\u2019s domestic agenda includes a heavy focus on raising the minimum wage and improving job training, which are, of course, Department of Labor issues.\n\nBut the closeness that has developed as of late between the president and Perez goes far beyond their joint appearances.\n\n\u201cA couple of times when we were out in San Francisco visiting our other brother, all of a sudden Tom\u2019s phone rang,\u201d Perez-Brache said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the president calling to say: \u2018Tom, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 The president\u2019s always calling him.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Perez\u2019s admirers argue that he possesses a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for an attorney general. He served as a federal prosecutor early in his career during the Reagan administration, and prosecuted domestic terrorism cases. And he later developed dual focuses on economic justice and civil rights, serving as Maryland\u2019s secretary of labor and then assistant attorney general for civil rights in the first Obama administration.\n\n\u201cHe has law enforcement, national security and management experience plus vision, which is more than anyone can ask for in a leader,\u201d said Robert Raben, a longtime friend of Perez\u2019s who managed the Senate confirmation process after he was chosen to be labor secretary.\n\nPerez\u2019s aggressive record in pursuing civil rights cases made that confirmation process an arduous one. The Senate approved his nomination in a 54-46 party-line vote, but not before Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: \u201cBased on the evidence, Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue. He\u2019s a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has not commented on the possibility of Perez being nominated for attorney general, but the top GOP senator seems primed to fight any nominee who is closely identified with Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cI will be scrutinizing the president\u2019s replacement nominee to ensure the Justice Department finally returns to prioritizing law enforcement over partisan concerns,\u201d McConnell said after Holder announced his resignation.\n\nThere are signs, though, that Perez isn\u2019t quite the liberal absolutist that McConnell and other Republicans portrayed him to be a year ago. He has worked with Sen. Dean A. Heller, R-Nev., on extending long-term unemployment benefits, and won public praise from none other than Michael S. Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cTom is a guy who gets stuff done,\u201d said Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor who\u2019s known Perez for years through his political work in the state.\n\nSteele said that while he disagreed with Perez on policy issues, Perez was always able to work with Republicans in Maryland. That\u2019s one reason why Steele supported Perez\u2019s nomination for labor secretary and would also back his nomination for attorney general.\n\nWhile Capitol Hill Republicans may be girding for a fight, Steele said Perez\u2019s confirmation might not be as difficult as it may at first seem.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already been confirmed by the Senate twice,\u201d Steele said. \u201cA lot of that drama has already played itself out.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Republicans would respond just as negatively to the nomination of either of the others on the shortlist for attorney general.\n\nVerilli, after all, defended the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which Republicans generally detest \u2013 before the Supreme Court as solicitor general. And Ruemmler, having served as Obama\u2019s White House counsel, might be seen as too close to the president.\n\nIt is also unclear exactly when Obama will nominate someone to succeed Holder, but the conventional wisdom in Washington is that he will do so shortly after the November elections so that the Senate with a Democratic majority can confirm his choice during the lame-duck session. He may well want to do that because most close observers think Republicans will take control of the Senate in the November elections, making the confirmation of any Obama appointee next year much more difficult.\n\nThe calendar could also weigh in against Perez, Senate sources said. After all, if Obama were to try to nominate Perez, the president could find himself facing two confirmation battles \u2013 one for attorney general, one for a new labor secretary \u2013 at a time when the lame-duck Congress will have only a few weeks to finish its work.\n\nRegardless of whether he is nominated for attorney general, Perez, who will turn 53 on Tuesday, has no shortage of political options. A dynamic public speaker who frequently cites his family\u2019s Dominican background and his Buffalo roots, he could, for instance, someday make a good candidate for a U.S. Senate seat from Maryland, his brother said.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t given me any leads,\u201d Perez-Brache said, \u201cbut this is not the end of Tom Perez.\u201d\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Heading back to his cheap seat on the third deck of Nationals Park on the day that Attorney General Eric H.
