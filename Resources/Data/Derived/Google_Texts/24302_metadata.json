That\u2019s always been an overstatement, even before the online insurance marketplaces\u2019 glitch-filled launch.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think the goal has always been to drive as many people as possible online, but who knows?\u201d said Shelby Gonzales, a senior health policy analyst for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cPeople have always been doing paper applications for a long time, so it\u2019s hard to know.\u201d\n\nThe whole appeal of shopping for coverage online is that a person ideally could do everything in one sitting: determine eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP or premium tax credits, and then sift through health plans, compare and choose. Another major benefit is that the online system should instantly flag application errors that would take longer to catch on paper.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obamacare online: File not found)\n\nTricia Brooks, a senior fellow at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said the application for exchange coverage is already more complicated than Medicaid and CHIP for two major reasons: Subsidy eligibility is checked against tax filings and whether a potential enrollee already has affordable coverage through work.\n\n\u201cI just hope that we have extremely few paper applications coming through,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t an effective way to do this. They certainly are going to be more administratively cumbersome because someone is going to have to sit down and input this data.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has been prepared for a crush of paper. Over the summer, it awarded a $1.2 billion contract to Serco, which says it expects to process 6.2 million paper applications in the health law\u2019s first open enrollment period running through the end of March.\n\nAs the exchange websites have been plagued with long wait times, temporary shutdowns and error messages since opening Oct. 1, some early shoppers have recently decided to ditch the Web in favor of paper applications.\n\n( POLITICO's Obamacare guide)\n\n\u201cWe see some navigators that have pushed the paper applications,\u201d said Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, referring to in-person assistance funded by the law to educate consumers about their coverage options. Those navigators, she said, can still help people compare health plans \u2014 something that consumers locked out of HealthCare.gov this week haven\u2019t been able to do.\n\n\u201cNavigators have access through [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and] the ability to really compare those plans, walk someone through the process, for them to be able to get the information,\u201d Filipic said on a Thursday call with reporters.\n\nConsumers have other options. The feds and each state-run exchange have opened call centers, agents and brokers have been certified to sell exchange plans, and thousands of stores \u2014 like major retail pharmacy and tax preparation firms \u2014 are offering on-site help.\n\nKevin Counihan, CEO of Connecticut\u2019s exchange, has made it a mission to abolish paper applications \u2014 as much as possible, anyway. The Connecticut exchange, known as Access Health CT, doesn\u2019t offer a fax number and is urging stakeholders to just say no to paper.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\n\u201cWe are actively discouraging paper to the point where we\u2019re going to run it as part of our advertising campaign,\u201d Counihan said in a recent interview. \u201cPaper, to us, is not the optimal customer experience. It\u2019s clunky, and it\u2019s subject to error.\u201d While Connecticut\u2019s exchange early on faced glitches and delays similar to other states, it was open for business and enrolling customers on the first day.\n\nVermont\u2019s Health Reform Director Robin Lunge said the state\u2019s exchange expects \u201ca mix\u201d of paper and online enrollment \u2014 and it brought on temporary staff in anticipation of incoming paper applications. Lunge said she understands Connecticut\u2019s anti-paper sentiment.\n\n\u201cThat makes good sense because paper applications are a lot harder to process,\u201d she said.\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Amid the online glitches, some are seeking coverage the old-fashioned way.", "title": "Obamacare applicants turn to paper", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/obamacare-glitches-give-paper-applications-new-life-97901.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/06/131006_aca_obamacare_form_reu_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1595),Affordable Care Act (463),Obamacare (604)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Amid the online glitches, some are seeking coverage the old-fashioned way.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd986f\"", "article_summary": "| REUTERS Obamacare applicants turn to paperObamacare is supposed to be a 21st-century shopping experience, but the health law can\u2019t escape living in an older paper world.\n\u201cThat makes good sense because paper applications are a lot harder to process,\u201d she said.\nSome early shoppers have decided to ditch the Web in favor of paper applications.\n\u201cI just hope that we have extremely few paper applications coming through,\u201d Brooks said.\nKevin Counihan, CEO of Connecticut\u2019s exchange, has made it a mission to abolish paper applications \u2014 as much as possible, anyway."}
