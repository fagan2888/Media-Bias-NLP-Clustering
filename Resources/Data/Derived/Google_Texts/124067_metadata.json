As the shutdown of the federal government last week illustrates, that debate is far from settled.\n\nBut to chief executive Frank Williams and Evolent\u2019s other co-founders, it was clear then that the way hospitals deliver and get paid for care was changing, regardless of the political wrangling.\n\n\u201cEven if you did not have the Affordable Care Act, if you think about the overall financial pressure that\u2019s created by the immense cost increases we\u2019ve had on the health care side, I think you have employers or people who pay for health care saying, \u2018We need more value for our dollar,\u2019\u201d Williams said.\n\nThat\u2019s the primary premise of the software Evolent sells to major health systems. It pulls the organization\u2019s financial and medical information into one platform, allowing them to more easily track a patient\u2019s care from the emergency room to follow-up appointments to the bill.\n\nIn just two years, the company has grown to 350 employees at its headquarters and San Francisco satellite office. The firm announced last week it added $100 million in venture capital to its reserves, building on the $24.5 million it had already collected from investors.\n\nThe company spun out from the Advisory Board, a consultancy for hospitals. The Advisory Board as well as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of the inspirations for its software, are among its chief financial backers.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed this is really going to require dedicated investment,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to have unique talent and scale, so we decided it would need to be done as a separate organization from the Advisory Board.\u201d\n\nEvolent counts health systems in 15 markets across the United States as clients. In the Baltimore-Washington region, MedStar Health has used the firm\u2019s technology to build its Medicare Advantage Plan in the District, as well as its own health plan for the system\u2019s 36,000 associates and dependents.\n\n\u201cMedStar has significantly increased our investment in information technology software programs over the last three to five years to support our care management approaches, including state of the art electronic health records across our organization, both inside our hospitals and across our physician practices,\u201d Ken Samet, MedStar Health\u2019s president and chief executive, said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cI believe all health care organizations have a responsibility to be part of the solution for how care will be provided to our communities in the future,\u201d Samet said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The firm\u2019s software aims to help major health systems reduce expenses while improve care", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/stevenoverly", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The firm\u2019s software aims to help major health systems reduce expenses while improve care", "title": "Arlington-based Evolent adds $100M in venture capital as it looks to revolutionize health care industry", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/arlington-based-evolent-adds-100m-in-venture-capital-as-it-looks-to-revolutionize-health-care-industry/2013/10/04/0a0504ee-2c5b-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/04/CapitalBusiness/Images/100626_WP_%20Evolent1121372298467.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@stevenoverly"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/arlington-based-evolent-adds-100m-in-venture-capital-as-it-looks-to-revolutionize-health-care-industry/2013/10/04/0a0504ee-2c5b-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews, evolent health, frank williams, medstar health, ken samet, health care, health care reform, affordable care act, health care technology, health care costs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/stevenoverly"}, "eomportal-uuid": "0a0504ee-2c5b-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, evolent health, frank williams, medstar health, ken samet, health care, health care reform, affordable care act, health care technology, health care costs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29fc\"", "article_summary": "Arlington-based Evolent Health got off the ground more than two years ago as the battle over health care reform raged on Capitol Hill and beyond.\n\u201cI believe all health care organizations have a responsibility to be part of the solution for how care will be provided to our communities in the future,\u201d Samet said.\nThat\u2019s the primary premise of the software Evolent sells to major health systems.\nThe Advisory Board as well as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of the inspirations for its software, are among its chief financial backers.\nAs the shutdown of the federal government last week illustrates, that debate is far from settled."}
