Photo: Ty Wright /New York Times Guess which presidential candidate is most fiscally conservative 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nSuppose you\u2019re a hard-core fiscal conservative. You don\u2019t give a hoot about social issues, and you don\u2019t follow any of this nonsense about identity politics or insiders and outsiders. All you care about is getting the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order.\n\nAre you sitting down? Because the candidate you should vote for might surprise you.\n\nAccording to a new report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the most fiscally conservative presidential contender left standing is ... Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeriously.\n\nYou\u2019re probably used to thinking of Clinton as just another spendthrift liberal, oblivious to fiscal restraint. And it is true that she wants to expand the footprint of the federal government. By a lot.\n\nConsider her New College Compact, which would substantially reduce higher-ed costs for new students and lower debt for past ones. She also plans to expand the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHer proposed expansions and investments in clean energy, early-childhood education, family leave, veterans services and infrastructure look costly, too.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton also proposes a lot of tax changes and other policies that would raise revenue or save money.\n\nThese include imposing a surtax on personal income over $5 million; raising rates on medium-term capital gains; limiting the value of tax breaks; changing the immigration system; taxing carried interest as ordinary income; raising the estate tax rate; imposing a risk fee on large financial institutions; and some as-yet-unspecified changes to the corporate tax code.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line for the nation\u2019s bottom line: Clinton\u2019s spending increases and other proposals have a total price tag of about $1.8 trillion over the next decade. But her offsets, mostly from tax hikes, would save an estimated $1.9 trillion over that same period (or closer to $1.6 trillion if you don\u2019t count those business tax proposals).\n\nThe net fiscal impact of her plans, then, is close to zero.\n\nTo be clear, she\u2019s not likely to reduce the federal debt. That presumably would be a more attractive outcome for the strictest of fiscal conservatives \u2014 including the number-crunchers at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who based their estimates partly on analyses from the Congressional Budget Office, Tax Policy Center and other outside groups.\n\n\u201cWhile Secretary Clinton would not worsen the fiscal situation, she also unfortunately does not offer concrete proposals for improving it,\u201d laments the report. \u201cWith debt at post-war record-high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply remaining on our current course is not enough.\u201d\n\nStill, contrast Clinton\u2019s plan with those offered by, oh, the other remaining presidential candidates, who would blow multitrillion-dollar holes in the budget.\n\nBernie Sanders proposes to expand the reach of the government far more than Clinton, and he promises to offset his increases with commensurate tax hikes.\n\nMany of the underlying assumptions his campaign used to get these numbers to add up, however, are way too optimistic.\n\nAn earlier Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimated that the budget shortfall from Sanders\u2019 proposals would add $2 trillion to $14.8 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade.\n\nOn the Republican side \u2014 the party allegedly devoted to fiscal responsibility \u2014 things look just as bad. The remaining GOP candidate, Donald Trump, offers massive, across-the-board tax cuts that he doesn\u2019t even attempt to pay for.\n\nTrump would cut tax revenue dramatically, while simultaneously raising spending on programs such as veterans health care. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ballparks the total cost of Trump\u2019s proposals at $11.7 trillion to $15.1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nFor the record, the various proposals touted by Texas\u2019 junior Sen. Ted Cruz before he suspended his presidential campaign Tuesday night \u2014 which included tax cuts, a repeal of Obamacare and a bigger military \u2014 would have added between $2.7 trillion and $21.3 trillion to the federal debt.\n\nMaybe when (if) voters start to notice the fiscal differences, Clinton will finally receive the praise she\u2019s been due, from arithmetic fans and fiscal conservatives alike.\n\ncrampell@washpost.com", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Are you sitting down?
