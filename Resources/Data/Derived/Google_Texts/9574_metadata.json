That means almost all major meetings taking place in Colorado for the next few years were planned well before Amendment 64 was approved by Colorado voters in November 2012.\n\nVisit Denver, the city\u2019s convention and visitors bureau, logged 429,210 convention delegates through the end of December, compared with 385,292 in 2013. Bookings for 2015 and 2016 are on pace to continue the same trend, bureau spokesman Rich Grant said.\n\nFor future bookings, fallout from legal marijuana has been a complete non-factor, Visit Denver CEO Richard Scharf said.\n\n\u201cPeople are more inclined to joke about it anymore than to express any concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty immaterial from either a positive or negative standpoint.\u201d\n\nScharf said officials of Visit Denver, the city government and organizations such as the Downtown Denver Partnership have worked hard to educate visitors and convention delegates on the terms of Colorado\u2019s cannabis laws, including where it can and cannot be consumed.\n\nRuff of RIMS said the shock value and comedic aspects have dissipated.\n\nThe group\u2019s convention delegates \u201care all college-educated people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lived in dorms once.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Meeting planners not afraid of legal Colo. weed; good panel fodder", "title": "Meeting planners not afraid of legal Colo. weed; good panel fodder", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/19/meeting-planners-not-afraid-of-legal-colo-weed-good-panel-fodder/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141223__ZCC18CONVENTIONcoverp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141223__ZCC18CONVENTIONcoverp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-19T19:57:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:16:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Business, Marijuana Year In Pot"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb328\"", "article_summary": "For future bookings, fallout from legal marijuana has been a complete non-factor, Visit Denver CEO Richard Scharf said.\nVisit Denver, the city\u2019s convention and visitors bureau, logged 429,210 convention delegates through the end of December, compared with 385,292 in 2013.\nThe group\u2019s convention delegates \u201care all college-educated people,\u201d he said.\nSome conventions have used Colorado\u2019s cannabis laws to incorporate working panels on the ways legal pot can affect their business sectors.\nDelegates to national conventions in Colorado are well aware of legal retail marijuana, and not just because they might have slipped in a visit to a dispensary."}
