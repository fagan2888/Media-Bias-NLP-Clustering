Diana Dooley of the California Health and Human Services Agency delivered the lunch keynote address on April 6 at the 2016 Northern California State of Reform Health Policy conference. In her remarks, she evaluated how well California has implemented the Affordable Care Act during her five-year term. She also shared her vision for moving towards a completely integrated delivery system and how the state will get there.\n\nWith more than 1 million Californians enrolled through the state exchange and over 4 million enrolled through Medicaid expansion, HHS has a heavy lift ahead. Dooley suggested that changes to delivery must come to meet this volume.\n\n\u201cThe very expansion of coverage has created the framework for a lot of the other changes, which is a fundamental change not only in the way that we deliver health care but in the way we think about health,\u201d said Sec. Dooley.\n\nStill, she candidly admits that implementing system-level changes to health care has not been easy.\n\n\u201cWe are five years in, in my term, and I still feel like I\u2019m running as fast as I can to keep the train on the tracks,\u201d she said.\n\nDooley reflected on the old way of handling program and policy within the agency, which included the creation of \u201cone off\u201d programs as necessary for public health issues like HIV treatment and maternal health.\n\n\u201cBecause [the system] didn\u2019t have a concept of universal coverage, we\u2019ve developed one-off programs for the last 50 years,\u201d said Sec. Dooley. \u201cBut if we could rationalize the system with the notion that everyone is going to get coverage and coverage is going to be comprehensive based on the Essential Health Benefits, and these benefits are going to be designed in such a way that everyone can compare apples to apples\u2014as we\u2019ve tried to do on Covered California\u2014then we can really get to a system of portability and people could move across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nThe audience received a window into Dooley\u2019s thinking for the future of HHS and programs in California.\n\n\u201cThe horizon that I see across the windshield of this vehicle is Medi-Cal and Covered Cal and employer-sponsored insurance. We would have plans that are working in all of those sectors,\u201d said Dooley. \u201cHistorically we created special plans that would only serve the Medi-Cal population because there was a sense that commercial plans wouldn\u2019t touch Medicaid. We grew up with Medi-Cal plans. Now we have Medi-Cal plans that are offering products on Covered California. I think there is a future where plans that traditionally offered services to Medicaid populations may offer services to employers where they can buy LA Care for example and get their services through the LA County Health systems.\u201d\n\nView Sec.
