Guests were invited to sit in a \u201cNative American Night\u201d section of the stadium for the game. Bighorse said that he and Negrette confronted the fan respectfully but things escalated once security guards intervened. He recounted the events on his blog, which you can read here.\n\nBighorse said that they were initially hauled away by security, but that San Francisco police officers handcuffed Negrette and began to forcefully escort her out of the ballpark. That\u2019s when Bighorse started to record what was happening on his cellphone. The police then handcuffed and detained him.\n\nICTMN obtained Bighorse's video:\n\nVideo of Native American Heritage Night\n\n\u201cWe were then ambushed by several police officers, who prevented us from returning to our seats,\u201d Bighorse wrote on his blog. \u201cThey claimed that we were trespassing and that we had to leave. I asked for what cause, and they claimed it was because of \u2018unruly behavior.\u2019\u201d Bighorse also said he was \u201cviolently patted down.\u201d\n\nICTMN contacted the Giants\u2019 communication office, but our call was not immediately returned.\n\nRELATED: EONM Calls on Governor Fallin to \u2018Recognize the Racism in Oklahoma\u2019\n\nRELATED: Snyder Wins: How 'CancelColbert' Drowned Out the Native Voice\n\nEradicating Offensive Native Mascotry (EONM), a group of Native American parents and allies that have actively protested against the Cleveland Indians's Chief Wahoo and the Washington \"Redskins\" mascots issued a statement:\n\n\"We are surprised that Native American people would be treated this way on \u2018Native American Heritage Night\u2019, while trying to confront the very pervasive problem of cultural misappropriation by non-Natives. While we can appreciate that the team held an event to bring Native American peoples and culture to the forefront, and that crowd control is protocol, there is a grave deficit of knowledge about Native cultures and people that became painfully evident at the game. Two Native American attendees were physically harmed during this unnecessary and preventable incident. It is our feeling that Native Americans should be able to not only attend sporting events free of harmful cultural misappropriation, but also be able to speak out about the desecration of Native cultures, people, and items. We feel that Mr. Bighorse and Ms. Negrette, were punished for trying to educate about the harms of Native Mascotry. They should not have been asked to leave the game, detained, and forcefully handcuffed by non-discerning security and police that did not care to know nor ask for the full story.\"\n\nNegrette said she was also surprised that people could be disrespectful, especially during Native American Heritage night.\n\n\u201cAs a Native person, I could not break my morals and hand some fake plastic headdress back to some drunk white guy,\u201d Negrette told ICTMN. \u201cI just couldn't do it. Crazyhorse would have rolled over in his grave if I did. That was another level of belittlement. And the police ripped it out of my hands and gave it back to them anyway.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Native American Heritage night sponsored by the San Francisco Giants turned ugly last night following an altercation involving a man wearing a war bonnet.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/26/scuffle-over-native-warbonnet-leads-unreasonable-detainment-giants-game-155479", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/giants_fan_war_bonnet_blurred_-_a_giants_fan_wearing_the_warbonnet_on_native_american_night.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Scuffle Over Native Warbonnet Leads to Unreasonable Detainment at Giants Game"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/26/scuffle-over-native-warbonnet-leads-unreasonable-detainment-giants-game-155479", "dc": {"title": "Scuffle Over Native Warbonnet Leads to Unreasonable Detainment at Giants Game"}, "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-26T09:50-04:00", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Scuffle Over Native Warbonnet Leads to Unreasonable Detainment at Giants Game"}, "article_summary": "Guests were invited to sit in a \u201cNative American Night\u201d section of the stadium for the game.\nA Native American Heritage night sponsored by the San Francisco Giants turned ugly last night following an altercation involving a man wearing a war bonnet.\nNegrette said she was also surprised that people could be disrespectful, especially during Native American Heritage night.\nTwo Native American attendees were physically harmed during this unnecessary and preventable incident.\nICTMN obtained Bighorse's video:Video of Native American Heritage Night\u201cWe were then ambushed by several police officers, who prevented us from returning to our seats,\u201d Bighorse wrote on his blog."}
