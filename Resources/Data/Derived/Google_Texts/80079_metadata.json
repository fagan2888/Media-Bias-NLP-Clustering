Sign up for a $72 two-month trial subscription today .\n\nCareFirst, Inc. is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit over the data breach it disclosed in May (The AIS Report 6/15, p. 11), with one current member and one former member leading the charge in the complaint filed Aug. 6 with the U.S. District Court of Maryland. While the Maryland-based Blues plan operator maintains that no Social Security numbers were compromised, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers contends identities already have been stolen as a result of the cyberattack, and another industry observer says the number of medical identity theft cases he has seen in the past six months alone is \u201cnuts.\u201d\n\nNamed plaintiffs Pamela Chambliss and Scott Adamson charged the insurer with negligence, breach of implied contract and unjust enrichment, alleging CareFirst failed to maintain proper security practices after discovering weaknesses in its IT posture shortly before the breach occurred. William Federman, an attorney at Oklahoma City-based firm Federman & Sherwood and one lawyer representing the plaintiffs, says the legal team has been in contact with several dozen people who have experienced fallout from the breach that affected 1.1 million CareFirst members, and that they have evidence that shows the data have been used inappropriately.\n\nBreaches Put Health Data at Risk\n\nA CareFirst spokesperson declined to comment on the case, but according to the complaint, the insurer became aware of its shortcomings after its vendor, FireEye, Inc. subsidiary Mandiant Security Consulting, discovered an attempted data breach in June 2014.\n\nFederman says he expects CareFirst to file a motion to dismiss sometime in September, but is confident that the strength of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence will kill that request. While Blues plans nationwide in July began offering credit monitoring services to all current members following breaches at Anthem, Inc., Premera Blue Cross and CareFirst, Federman says that doesn\u2019t protect misuse of member health information and that the quality of the credit monitoring isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only as good as the service they\u2019re using,\u201d he says, citing the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s July actions against identity theft protection service Lifelock, Inc. for misleading customers about the extent of its identity theft capabilities. \u201cA lot of these services are just inundated. They\u2019re hiring left and right, and whenever you\u2019re hiring massive new employees, you have problems in training.\u201d\n\nMedical Identity Protection Is New Frontier\n\nThe CareFirst complaint specifically mentions the possibility of medical identity theft, or the misuse of protected health information to submit fraudulent health insurance claims. According to the Ponemon Institute\u2019s Fifth Annual Study on Medical Identity Theft, released in February, medical identity theft increased 21% in 2014 compared with 2013. Victims each ponied up an average of $13,500 over an average of 200 hours to resolve the problem, although only 10% said they had reached a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nRick Kam, president and cofounder of IDExperts, which offers MIDAS, the Medical Identity Alert System, says the number of medical identity theft cases he has seen in the past six months has skyrocketed, citing the Blues breaches along with recent exposures at UCLA Health System and the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n\u201cIf you think about those particular incidents, all of them included health insurance information or some form of sensitive health information,\u201d Kam tells The AIS Report. \u201cSo not only through MIDAS, but more specifically through the services we provide to our breach clients, we\u2019ve seen a huge spike in medical identity theft, financial identity theft and tax return identity fraud just in the last six months. It\u2019s just off the charts. It\u2019s just nuts.\u201d\n\nMIDAS is an app that alerts customers when a medical claim is filed under their or a dependent\u2019s name, and blocks the claim from being paid until the customer approves it. The software has to be set up with both the customer\u2019s doctors and insurance company.\n\nIDExperts launched MIDAS just last November, but Kam began working on the idea five years ago when he and the IDExperts team first noticed medical identity theft becoming a problem. After searching in vain for a product that would protect against fraudulent medical claims, they decided to build it themselves. MIDAS clients are mostly insurance companies, including Portland, Ore.-based Moda Health, the CEO of which was a victim of medical identity theft himself. Moda offered the pilot installation of MIDAS to its 170,000 insurance exchange customers for free last year, and Kam says Moda intends to roll out the service to its remaining 500,000 clients this year. The average cost of the service runs less than $1 on average per customer per month.\n\nMany cases of medical identity theft don\u2019t come from data breaches, but rather are perpetrated by the person\u2019s friend or family member. Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director at the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance \u2014 of which CareFirst is a founding member \u2014 says providers are better equipped to halt identity theft than insurers, because they can employ techniques including fingerprint scans and photo verification to ensure a person\u2019s identity immediately upon arrival.\n\nInsurance companies also are under pressure to pay claims quickly, which prevents their special investigations units from vetting each incoming bill. Additionally, insurers have to comply with the medical loss ratio (MLR) provision of the Affordable Care Act, which somewhat limits their ability to invest in new technology.\n\n\u201cFraud reduction activities are in the restricted buckets,\u201d Patterson says, referring to expenses such as administrative, marketing and salaries that are allowed only a 20% allocation of insurers\u2019 premium revenues. An insurance exec might say, \u201c\u2018Oh, there\u2019s this cool software\u2019 \u2014 they can buy and deploy that, but any money a health plan company spends to do those new technologies, that\u2019s going to count against them in MLR.\u201d\n\nSeveral states are beginning discussions to tighten data breach laws to ensure more protection against medical identity theft, Patterson says. But any laws should take into account the organization\u2019s size and capability, according to Linn Freedman, attorney and chair of data privacy and security at the law firm Robinson + Cole.\n\n\u201cHIPAA has always been a regulation that takes into consideration the size and complexity of the organization,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cEncryption at rest is definitely best practice, so entities with a lot of high-risk data may want to consider encryption, whereas a solo practitioner doctor shouldn\u2019t necessarily be required to encrypt his data at rest.\u201d\n\nConsumers should check their Explanations of Benefits forms (EOBs) as soon as they come in, Patterson says, and can also obtain an annual statement of disclosure to see where their information has been sent over the past year. If customers notice a mistake, they can fill out a form from the Federal Trade Commission and file a report with the police to help recover any illegitimate costs.\n\nBut this information isn\u2019t typically made available to consumers when insurers publish their notifications; insurers instead focus on credit protection services. Patterson says that\u2019s partly because the health care industry is less accustomed to handling data breaches than the banking sector, where more straightforward practices, such as data sharing with competitors, are standard.\n\n\u201cThe communication that flows from the breached company to the public, the nuance of that communication is somewhat different than what you might see coming out of retail or financial services,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of been-there-done-that, and the communication is a little more frank.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
