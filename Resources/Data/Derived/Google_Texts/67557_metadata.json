The crowd was packed nearly to the rafters.\n\nBut it was the oratory of two young black men \u2014 Sherman and 28-year-old poet Joseph Solomon \u2014 that inspired standing ovations and tears among many listeners.\n\n\u201cI live in a world where many of my friends are fatherless,\u201d said Sherman, a junior at the Barack Obama Male Leadership Academy in east Oak Cliff. \u201cFor some of them, it can lead down a road with no discipline and no guidance about where they should go in life.\u201d\n\nSherman won a local Martin Luther King Jr. speaking contest in 2008, at age 9, and stunned a crowd of 17,000 with his speaking skills during a DISD convocation ceremony. Soon after, he became a YouTube sensation and made a lap around the television talk show circuit, appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and NBC\u2019s Today show.\n\nSome have called him the next Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is motivation,\u201d Sherman said, speaking about the pressure of being a young black boy. \u201cWe need somebody to show us there\u2019s something greater and more important for us in life.\u201d\n\nDemonization\u2019s effect\n\nSherman said his life so far has been insulated from racism, but he sees evidence of the demonizing of black men everywhere in pop culture. For example, he said, the new television series Empire lionizes the life of a black man who was a former thug but is now in the music business.\n\nThose subtle things, he said, factor into the split-second, life-or-death decisions made by police, the discretion used by judges in sentencing and decisions made by doctors on medical care.\n\n\u201cWhen you see over and over black men being shown as violent,\u201d he said, \u201cthat can play into a cop pulling a trigger or not pulling a trigger.\u201d\n\nMoments later inside the towering sanctuary of Concord, the Dallas mayor evoked a message intoned by King on March 31, 1968, four days before his assassination. \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long,\u201d King said in his last sermon. \u201cBut it bends toward justice.\u201d\n\nBut as many politicians have said since \u2014 including Obama \u2014 every person has a responsibility to mold that arc.\n\n\u201cIn Dallas, we have a huge issue of the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Rawlings. \u201cAnd that economic gap is mirroring an education gap in our city.\u201d\n\n\u2018You are the light\u2019\n\nThis year\u2019s first graduating class from the Barack Obama Leadership Academy is a step in the right direction, he said, while holding up the speech delivered minutes earlier by Sherman.\n\n\u201cYou are the light that will put away the darkness,\u201d Rawlings said to thundering applause.\n\nMoments later, Solomon, a traveling poet and musician from Houston, took the stage.\n\nHe read the poems \u201cWe Are Still Here\u201d and \u201cWords From My Father,\u201d which he performs on the YouTube channel chaseGodtv.\n\n\u201cMany non-Christians I know think Christians are passive,\u201d said Solomon in an interview after his presentation. \u201cThey use their faith as a way to say, \u2018Everything\u2019s OK. God\u2019s in control. He\u2019ll work it out.\u2019 But God should be a motivator for us, because he wants justice.\u201d\n\nRacism, Solomon said, makes him cynical of people\u2019s motives.\n\nAnd as to demeaning stereotypes assigned to black men, he said it\u2019s a chicken-or-egg question.\n\n\u201cWhich came first?\u201d he said. \u201cDid we do these things and then the stereotype came? Or are these things a result of systemic racism, which means we\u2019re presented a world that is much more limited than other people?\u201d\n\nGood deeds\n\nThat question was among many posed by people honoring King\u2019s legacy over the weekend.\n\nThousands lined Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to watch the 29th annual Elite News Martin Luther King Jr. Parade on Monday. It was the first parade since publisher William Blair died last year.\n\nNearby, 96 students and staff members from Dallas Baptist University volunteered to help Cornerstone Baptist Church prepare for its MLK Day program. On Sunday, more than 75 student athletes from the university fanned out across the city, working at churches, volunteering at city recreation centers and helping clean and stock a food pantry.\n\nAlso over the weekend, the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center held a health fair, helped people sign up for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hosted a candle-lighting ceremony by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A variety of local events honored the civil rights leader.", "og": {"description": "A variety of local events honored the civil rights leader.", "title": "Dallas celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. Day with inspiring speeches, good works", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-dallas-celebrates-martin-luther-king-jr.-day-with-inspiring-speeches-good-works.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-nm_19mlkparadeld13.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_19MLKparadeLD13.jpg", "height": 865}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-01-20T05:26:23Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-01-20T05:21:52Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dallas celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. Day with inspiring speeches, good works\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-dallas-celebrates-martin-luther-king-jr.-day-with-inspiring-speeches-good-works.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-mlk-glee.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/MLK+glee.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2143416\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-20T05:21:52Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"SCOTT FARWELL\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150119-mlk-glee.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/MLK+glee.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-20T05:21:52Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Thousands lined Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to watch the 29th annual Elite News Martin Luther King Jr.\nAlso over the weekend, the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center held a health fair, helped people sign up for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hosted a candle-lighting ceremony by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\nBut it was the oratory of two young black men \u2014 Sherman and 28-year-old poet Joseph Solomon \u2014 that inspired standing ovations and tears among many listeners.\nAnd as to demeaning stereotypes assigned to black men, he said it\u2019s a chicken-or-egg question.\nSunday morning at Concord Church in Dallas, cars packed parking lots in every direction for an MLK worship service with a theme of \u201cSave Our Sons,\u201d one of several weekend events that commemorated the life of Martin Luther King Jr."}
