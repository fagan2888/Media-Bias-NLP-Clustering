Weight loss, infertility treatments, chiropractic care and acupuncture are just a few procedures that are quietly covered under some insurance plans. Many so-called elective procedures \u2014 like infertility treatments, weight loss surgery, acupuncture and chiropractic visits \u2014 could be covered under your health insurance plans. And if you want to take advantage of these benefits, you still have time to enroll or change your health care plan, but the \u201cInsurance companies don\u2019t want to advertise many of these benefits because they are expensive procedures,\u201d says Ginalisa Monterroso \u2013 CEO of Medicaid Advisory Group in New York. \u201cMany of these popular benefits are hidden in the \u2018Summary of Benefits\u2019 page, which is buried inside of your health care booklet.\u201d Monterroso has more than 25 years of experience helping patients and families navigate the complicated health care system. She says many consumers are on the wrong plan, and as a result, are paying for out-of-pocket visits that could be covered under a different plan. For example, many people with back pain typically go to a chiropractor and pay-out-of pocket for their visits, but under some plans, these visits could be covered or partially covered by health insurance. So how do you determine what is covered under your healthcare plan? \u201cHealth care plans vary by where you live and the plan you choose. There is no one size fits all,\u201d says Monterroso. \u201cThe specifics of your individual plan will dictate what is covered. Benefits also change depending on whether you get your health insurance coverage through your employer or under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Other hidden benefits that could be covered under the Affordable Care Act or private-insurer plans include: Weight Loss Procedures Expensive weight loss procedures, known as bariatric or gastric bypass surgery, can cost upwards of $20,000, but Alternative Medicine Many consumers may not realize that alternative medicine is also covered under some health insurance plans.

Infertility Treatments There are 15 states that mandate some coverage for infertility treatments, but some states only cover infertility treatment on group plans, not individual policies, Birth Control Methods The Affordable Care Act plans are not required to cover male contraceptive services and products, such as condoms and vasectomies. However, many plans do cover vasectomies. Monterroso says consumers should call their insurance companies and ask specific questions in regards to their treatments, like: \u2022 Am I covered for this treatment? \u2022 Do I need a referral or prescription from my general practitioner? \u2022 Will I have to meet a deductible or pay a copay? \u2022 Am I limited to a certain number of visits? \u2022 What are some local providers in my policy network? \u201cTake the time to read the Summary of Benefits page because we are in the open enrollment period right now,\u201d said Monterroso. \u201cAfter February 1st, it will be too late to make any changes.\u201d It\u2019s one of the best-kept secrets in the health insurance industry.Many so-called elective procedures \u2014 like infertility treatments, weight loss surgery, acupuncture and chiropractic visits \u2014 could be covered under your health insurance plans.And if you want to take advantage of these benefits, you still have time to enroll or change your health care plan, but the window closes on January 31, 2015 \u201cInsurance companies don\u2019t want to advertise many of these benefits because they are expensive procedures,\u201d says Ginalisa Monterroso \u2013 CEO of Medicaid Advisory Group in New York. \u201cMany of these popular benefits are hidden in the \u2018Summary of Benefits\u2019 page, which is buried inside of your health care booklet.\u201dMonterroso has more than 25 years of experience helping patients and families navigate the complicated health care system.
