McDonald's is happy to oblige \u2013 with a stunning display of trickery.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s created this posterto advertise their hot deal of 50 McNuggets. But what\u2019s the catch?\n\nFor $9.99, you can have 50 chicken nuggets from McDonald\u2019s. And it appears that the only calories you\u2019d be adding to your belly wouldn\u2019t even touch 500. If 2,000 calories is around the average a person should eat, you could go to Atkins heaven and just binge on 200 chicken nuggets throughout the day.\n\nSeriously, can it really be that 50 pieces of glorious nuggets fried in that wonderfully golden-brown batter is only worth 497 calories?\n\nAlso Watch: McDonald\u2019s Finally Reveals How It Makes Chicken Nuggets In New Video\n\nObviously not. Word on the street is read the fine print.\n\nIn much smaller text, the poster says that this batch of 50 is meant to serve five adults. So that\u2019s 497 calories per 10 nuggets, cumulating to a total of 2,485 calories.\n\nThis was spotted in an outlet in New York City, where under the previous the Bloomberg administration, chains were required reveal their calorie counts, earlier than the rest of the nation.\n\nTrust McDonald\u2019s to taint the power of graphic design for its corporate greed.
