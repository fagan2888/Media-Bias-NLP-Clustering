It seemed like a strategy that could work, especially if he could stay in the high racing groove that gave drivers decidedly more speed off the corners.\n\nBut the Penske Racing teammates quickly proved it faulty.\n\n\u201cI just knew that clean air was going to be worth more than new tires,\u201d Kenseth said of his decision after finishing third. He said he also felt his car wasn\u2019t as strong as he liked on fresh tires. \u201cThey cleared everybody way too fast.\u201d\n\nHe still remains in great position to make the playoffs, standing fifth in the points race and first among non-winners.\n\nJimmie Johnson, slowed early by two pit road speeding penalties, rallied to finish fourth, his best result since mid-June at Michigan, and Kurt Busch was fifth.\n\nGordon remained the points leader despite a 16th-place run. He\u2019s 27 clear of Earnhardt and 42 ahead of Keselowski.\n\nWith 100 to go, it looked possible the series might get a 13th winner of the year.\n\nJamie McMurray, who led a race-best 148 laps, was leading, followed by Kenseth, and Ryan Newman was ninth. As the final laps clicked off, though, McMurray faded to eighth and Newman, once as high as seventh, dropped to 13th.\n\nKasey Kahne, another driver desperate for a victory or a surge in the point standings, led the race for 40 laps, almost to the halfway point. He then pitted under green with a loose wheel and went two laps down. He wound up 35th.\n\nIt was another rough night for Aric Almirola, who has had six of those in a row since his first career victory at Daytona made him one of the unlikeliest drivers to secure a spot in the upcoming Chase.\n\nAlmirola, who started 42nd after crashing in qualifying, completed just 37 laps before crashing.\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing race car these guys brought me \u2014 two of them \u2014 and to go out like that is certainly disappointing. But that\u2019s racing at Bristol,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get caught up in other people\u2019s wrecks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Logano became the fifth driver this season to win three times, joining the Hendrick Motorsports trio of Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Brad Keselowski, who finished second.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Logano became the fifth driver this season to win three times, joining the Hendrick Motorsports trio of Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Brad Keselowski, who finished second.", "title": "Joey Logano gets first win at Bristol as Kenseth\u2019s gamble fails", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/23/joey-logano-gets-first-win-bristol-kenseths-gamble/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/23/nascar-bristol-auto-r_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/23/nascar-bristol-auto-r_lanc1.jpg", "description": "Logano became the fifth driver this season to win three times, joining the Hendrick Motorsports trio of Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Brad Keselowski, who finished se", "card": "summary", "title": "Joey Logano gets first win at Bristol as Kenseth\u2019s gamble fails"}, "Author": "Hank Kurz Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Matt Kenseth, Bristol, Jeff Gordon, Joey Logano"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI just knew that clean air was going to be worth more than new tires,\u201d Kenseth said of his decision after finishing third.\nBRISTOL, Tenn. \u2014 Joey Logano surged past Matt Kenseth with 44 laps to go and won for the first time in his career at Bristol Motor Speedway, foiling Kenseth\u2019s gambling attempt to secure a spot in NASCAR\u2019s playoffs.\nBut that\u2019s racing at Bristol,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat an amazing race car these guys brought me \u2014 two of them \u2014 and to go out like that is certainly disappointing.\nJamie McMurray, who led a race-best 148 laps, was leading, followed by Kenseth, and Ryan Newman was ninth."}
