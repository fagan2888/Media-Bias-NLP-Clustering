The fact that the woman is his longtime friend and occasional romantic interest Pamela (Adlon) is, for some fans, enough to disassociate the incident from an attempted rape. For others who watched along in horror, it most certainly is not:\n\nAny reviewer who doesn't call what just happened between Louie & Pamela on #LouieFX sexual assault needs to quit their job. That was awful. \u2014 Katie Hegarty (@HegartyKatie) June 3, 2014\n\nEven Louis C.K., as the show\u2019s primary writer, acknowledges that a line, however blurry, has been crossed. As she successfully wrestles away from his attempts to drag her to his bedroom, yank her shirt up and kiss her, Pamela remarks, \u201cThis would be rape if you weren\u2019t so stupid. My god, you can\u2019t even rape well.\u201d I almost wrote \u201cbumbling attempts\u201d in the previous sentence, but that would have been apologetic bullshit. The simple truth is that Louie is a rather large man, and Pamela is a very small woman, and, though she managed to squirm out of his grasp, it could have easily gone the other way. In the end, she consents to a kiss \u2014 although, I don\u2019t know of too many women who would consider cowering in a doorframe begrudgingly allowing physical contact so that they can safely leave as \u201cconsent.\u201d\n\nThe scene, while funny in fragments, is disturbing. What is also disturbing is that, minutes earlier, we are asked to believe that Louie is heartbroken, struggling to get over a mostly chaste, exceedingly sweet, month-long (six episode) affair with a woman who just returned to Hungary. Indeed, we see him walking alone in the cold, pining for her, at the beginning of this episode. And, so, unless the character is an emotional infant whose affections realign in an instant, Louie\u2019s romantic aggression toward Pamela cannot possibly be construed as anything remotely genuine \u2014 not that that would absolve him anyway.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last night's episode makes it just a little harder to love Louis C.K. -- and maybe he wants it that way", "author": "Neil Drumming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Last night's episode makes it just a little harder to love Louis C.K. -- and maybe he wants it that way", "title": "\u201cThis would be rape if you weren\u2019t so stupid\u201d: \u201cLouie\u2019s\u201d most disturbing scene yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/this_would_be_rape_if_you_werent_so_stupid_louies_most_disturbing_scene_yet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/louie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last night's episode makes it just a little harder to love Louis C.K. -- and maybe he wants it that way", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/louie.jpg", "title": "\u201cThis would be rape if you weren\u2019t so stupid\u201d: \u201cLouie\u2019s\u201d most disturbing scene yet", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThis would be rape if you weren\u2019t so stupid\u201d: \u201cLouie\u2019s\u201d most disturbing scene yet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Louie, Louis CK, Rape, Sexual assault, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded7c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Louie, Louis CK, Rape, Sexual assault, TV, Entertainment NewsDuring \u201cPamela 1,\u201d the last of two episodes of FX\u2019s \u201cLouie\u201d that aired back-to-back last night, Louie C.K.\n\u2014 Katie Hegarty (@HegartyKatie) June 3, 2014Even Louis C.K., as the show\u2019s primary writer, acknowledges that a line, however blurry, has been crossed.\nAs she successfully wrestles away from his attempts to drag her to his bedroom, yank her shirt up and kiss her, Pamela remarks, \u201cThis would be rape if you weren\u2019t so stupid.\nMy god, you can\u2019t even rape well.\u201d I almost wrote \u201cbumbling attempts\u201d in the previous sentence, but that would have been apologetic bullshit.\nThe fact that the woman is his longtime friend and occasional romantic interest Pamela (Adlon) is, for some fans, enough to disassociate the incident from an attempted rape."}
