The inexorable tide of gentrification rises a little higher in Brooklyn as a new Whole Foods is set to open by the Gowanus canal at 3rd Street and 3rd Ave.

Gowanus, a once-condemned neighborhood on a sickly-green canal so infested with pollution grime it literally had gonorrhea, has become a thriving hipster hotbed with new restaurants, popular rock venue The Bell House, and a sickly-green canal still so polluted that it may well still have gonorrhea.

If you’re thinking this sounds like the perfect locale for Brooklyn’s new mecca of organic produce and farm-to-table meats, you are absolutely correct. Just to ensure that their new location couldn’t get any more “Portlandia” if it tried, the new Whole Foods location will also feature a music section strictly for vinyl records.

Oh, and for “reclaimed vinyl jewelry,” whatever that means.

“We really wanted Brooklyn to feel like this was their store,” a Whole Foods spokesman told New York Daily News. Some of the accoutrements to make locals feel at home include:

* Greens from the store’s greenhouse on the roof,

* Beer hall and restaurant on the roof overlooking the Gowanus Canal

* Ramen chef, juice bar, knife sharpening station, wood-fired pizza oven.

* Solar panels providing 25 percent of the building’s electricity,

* Wind turbines powering the parking lot lights

* Produce bins made of wood from the Coney Island Boardwalk demolished by Hurricane Sandy

No doubt the chain is hoping that all the vinyl records and reclaimed wood will keep Brooklyn shoppers from caring too much about the chain’s ultra-conservative politics or CEO John Mackey’s statement earlier in 2013 that Obamacare is like “fascism.”

Or perhaps someone forgot to tell Whole Foods that vinyl is over:
