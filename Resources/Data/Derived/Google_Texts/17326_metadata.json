I have checked many places, and it always seems to be about $200. Shouldn't that be considered a \u201cpreventative\u201d vaccination \u2014 which would be covered by insurance or medicare?\n\nAnswer: Arizona Republic health reporter Ken Alltuckerhunted down the following information to explain this scenario.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act requires private health insurance plans cover the cost of preventive care based on the recommendation of expert medical bodies such as the US Preventive Services Task Force and the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (known as ACIP).\n\n\u201cACIP has recommended the shingles vaccine for those aged 60 or older. The board of medical experts also studied the use of the vaccine for those 50 and above but made no recommendation for that age group. So that means private health insurers are generally required to cover the cost of the vaccine for those 60 and above, but consumers may be required to pay for the vaccine if they want to get the vaccine at a younger age.\n\nRELATED:Quick facts about 10 essential vaccines\n\n\u201cFor those with a Medicare drug plan, known as Part D, the cost of the shingles vaccine will be determined by your Part D plan.\n\n\u201cThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the shingles vaccine for adults 50 and above. Although ACIP only recommends the vaccine for those 60 and above, it will again evaluate its recommendation after the CDC gathers more data about the vaccine.\n\n\u201cPeople aged 50 and above face a higher risk of developing shingles and that risk increases as people age, according to ACIP. Older with shingles may experience a burning pain called postherpetic neuralgia, hospitalization or other complications, according to ACIP.\u201d\n\nDo you have a question that you just can't get answered?
