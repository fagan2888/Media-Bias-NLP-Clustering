Baker III has been funded almost entirely by two well-connected developers with extensive portfolios in the county.\n\nThe committee organized to support the extension of term limits recorded $80,050 in donations in its campaign finance reports \u2014 $50,000 from two companies owned by developer Kenneth H. Michael and a total of $25,000 from seven companies associated with developer Edward St. John.\n\nBoth developers declined to discuss their contributions, which are legal under Maryland law, which does not limit how much a person or business can donate to a political committee. But their interest in the issue of term limits, which became fashionable in the 1990s in part as a way to limit the influence of money in politics, strikes some as unseemly in a county still struggling to rehabilitate its image from the 2011 conviction of former County Executive Jack B. Johnson on public corruption charges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common to see developers who had potential business before a county or city to support those term limits abolishments,\u201d said Nick Tomboulides, executive director of the pro-term limit group U.S. Term Limits. \u201cWhen the public catches on to the fact that minority special interests are funding the campaign to destroy term limits, it looks very bad.\u201d\n\nQuiet support\n\nThe initiative on the Nov. 4 ballot, Question J, would expand the number of four-year terms that the county executive and members of the County Council could hold from two to three consecutive terms.\n\nThe new law would affect Mr. Baker, who is running unopposed for his second term and spearheaded a previous charge to abolish term limits. He has largely refrained from publicly campaigning for the initiative \u2014 instead saying he preferred to leave the issue up to voters.\n\nBut the county executive hasn\u2019t taken a backseat on the effort either.\n\nAn eight-person commission, made up of members selected by the County Council and Mr. Baker, recommended an expansion of term limits this year. The County Council voted in July to include the measure on the ballot.\n\nIn September, Mr. Baker succeeded in persuading a hesitant Democratic Central Committee to include an endorsement of the term limit expansion on their sample ballots, The Washington Post reported. In an email to supporters Tuesday, Mr. Baker urged supporters to vote to loosen the term limits restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Prince George\u2019s for Fairness in Government committee, Calvin Brown, is a Baker political appointee who serves as chairman of the county\u2019s Revenue Authority.\n\n\u201cThe County Executive has openly shared that he believes voters should ultimately determine who their elected leaders should be through elections. Term limits take away that power,\u201d Baker spokesman Scott Peterson said. \u201cHowever, throughout this election process, Mr. Baker has had limited engagement in any referendum campaigns because he has tried not to make this issue about him [but rather to] allow voters to make their decision based [on] what [they] think is best for the county.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown declined to say whether he was asked by politicians to be chairman of the committee, adding that he has been opposed to term limits since they were enacted in the county in 1992.\n\n\u201cWho asked me, and why they asked me, it\u2019s immaterial,\u201d he said.\n\nFinancial interests\n\nMr. Brown also said he had no knowledge of why the majority of donations to the committee would have come from developers.\n\n\u201cAnybody in the world can give contributions. I\u2019m not in the politics of who,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any knowledge that anybody is getting anything out of this deal.\u201d\n\nThough the committee was only registered on Sept. 10, it was able to rake in the $70,050 in donations within a span of four days.\n\nA campaign finance report due Oct. 24 but filed a week later on Oct. 31 recorded the committee as receiving $80,050 in donations. However, the report did not include $10,000 in donations contributed by the Prince George\u2019s County Firefighters Association PAC and included on the PAC\u2019s own campaign finance report.\n\nContributions made to the term limits committee include two $25,000 donations from Lanham LLLP and MLK Beltway LLC \u2014 companies that both list Mr. Michael as their resident agent. Mr. Michael is the head of one of the county\u2019s most powerful real estate and development firms, NAI Michael, where former County Executive Wayne K. Curry served as president from 2011 until his death this summer. Mr. Baker, who often referred to Mr. Curry as his mentor in politics, led the effort to try and repeal term limits in 2000 \u2014 two years before term limits sent Mr. Curry packing from office.\n\nTuesday will be the third time in 22 years that county residents will vote on whether to keep term limits \u2014 the first was in 1992, when residents approved the term limits now in place. The second time was in 2000, when Mr. Baker led an effort as a state delegate to overturn the limits. Additionally, voters in 2004 rejected a charter amendment to create two new, non-term-limited at-large council seats.\n\nThat Mr. Michael would be the primary funder of the latest campaign to loosen term limits was no surprise to longtime county activist Judy Robinson, who led the effort to collect signatures to place the term limit question on the ballot in 1992.\n\n\u201cHe paid for the last one,\u201d Mrs. Robinson said.\n\nMr. Michael supported the 2000 effort led by Mr. Baker, donating $5,000 of the $56,000 collected by the effort, The Post reported at the time.\n\nSeven companies that list Mr. St. John, head of Baltimore-based developer St. John\u2019s Properties, as their resident agent in Maryland business records made donations ranging from $3,000 to $4,000 to this year\u2019s ballot committee effort. The companies are Knecht; Maryland Science and Technology CTR LLC; Maryland Science and Technology LLC; Patapsco Avenue LLC; St. John Escrow; Technology Investors LLC; and Whittington Avenue LLC.\n\nSt. John\u2019s Property is currently developing the Melford site in Bowie, a 466-acre mixed-use project that is seeking approval from the county planning department to deviate from its original plans for the site in order to build 2,500 units of housing at the location. The county planning board is scheduled to vote on the plan Nov. 13.\n\nOld friends\n\nThe motivation for developers to donate to an effort to repeal term limits, Mrs. Robinson surmised, is to be able to keep the same politicians in power who could approve and aid their projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old friend you don\u2019t have to keep reintroducing yourself [to] every four or eight years,\u201d she said. \u201cThe names have changed, but the objectives are the same, which is to get the council to ride roughshod.\u201d\n\nOther donations recorded by the term limits committee include $5,000 from Southern Management Corporation, a property management company, and $50 from Calvin Hawkins, a county Homeland Security employee.\n\nThe latest report details the committee\u2019s finances through Oct. 19, and shows it has $37,000 left in the bank after expenses \u2014 including $27,000 in consulting fees paid to a company owned by Travis Tazelaar, a former executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party.\n\nFor the county firefighters PAC, which donated $10,000 to the effort, the reason to support the term extension was to ensure the fire department can continue with the progress that employees feel it has made under Mr. Baker\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t support the repeal of term limits, I think the extension would really give the opportunity for the fire department to get some momentum on some of those challenges, like staffing and apparatus,\u201d said Andrew Pantelis, PAC chairman and president of the county\u2019s firefighters association.\n\nThough grass-roots opposition efforts to the term limit extension have appeared around the county, spreading the word through email chains and social media, no formal group has registered as a committee to raise money to oppose the measure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A ballot initiative to extend term limits for Prince George's lawmakers that has been quietly championed by County Executive Rushern L.
