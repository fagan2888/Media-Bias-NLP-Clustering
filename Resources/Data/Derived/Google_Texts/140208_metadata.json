Plans for a new Bend ice rink and pavilion are moving forward. Central Oregon\u2019s housing market looks to build off its best year since before the recession. And 2014 means elections, lots of them.\n\nRead on for a look at major issues ahead for Central Oregon in 2014.\n\nElections\n\nFrom county offices to the U.S. Senate, many key elected positions are up for grabs this year.\n\nTwo Deschutes County commissioners \u2014 Tony DeBone and Tammy Baney \u2014 will have to win re-election in November if they want to serve beyond January 2015. Deschutes County District Attorney Patrick Flaherty faces an election challenge from attorney and former Bend city councilor John Hummel.\n\nCrook County Commissioner Seth Crawford\u2019s term is up this year, as is Sheriff Jim Hensley\u2019s. Both have filed for re-election, according to the Crook County Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nTwo Jefferson County commissioners \u2014 Mike Ahern and John Hatfield \u2014 are up for election, as well as Sheriff Jim Adkins.\n\nAhern is the only one to have filed re-election paperwork at this point, according to the Jefferson County Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nAt the state level, Gov. John Kitzhaber has announced plans to run for re-election in November.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., faces a re-election campaign for the first time since taking office in 2009. State Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend, is among the Republicans trying to unseat Merkley in November.\n\nMirror Pond\n\nIt\u2019s the Bend issue that just won\u2019t die. City councilors have debated what to do about silt build-up in Bend\u2019s iconic Mirror Pond for years: Dredge the pond to maintain its appearance, or restore the stretch of the Deschutes River into a more free-flowing waterway.\n\nThe debate took on new urgency this fall, starting with the October discovery of a leak in the dam that makes the pond. Officials with Pacifi\u00adCorp, which owns the dam, have said the dam isn\u2019t likely to be economical for much longer.\n\nCity leaders have assembled a Mirror Pond committee, made up of Bend Park & Recreation District officials, city councilors and community members, to come up with a long-term solution for the silt issue.\n\nBut no concrete decisions have been made, and the discussions are all but certain to continue well into 2014.\n\nOSU-Cascades and other schools\n\nOregon State University made 2013 a banner year for higher education in Central Oregon.\n\nAfter lining up $16 million from the state in July, OSU laid out its plan to expand Bend\u2019s Oregon State University-Cascades Campus into a four-year campus.\n\nThe school will be open for new freshmen in fall 2015. But plenty of work looms ahead in 2014 to meet that deadline. Construction crews will be busy this year converting a pumice mine off Southwest Century Drive into a 56-acre campus and getting ready to build classrooms and student housing.\n\nSeveral other school-related projects are in various development phases. Central Oregon Community College wants to build a 330-bed dormitory in time for fall 2015 and is working to complete a $8.3 million Technology and Education Center in Redmond by next fall.\n\nBend-La Pine Schools is set to build new elementary and middle schools in the coming years.\n\nDevelopment projects and local economy\n\nIt\u2019s more than just education fueling a building boom. Several major housing, hotel and recreation projects are in the pipeline as well.\n\nA 114-room Hampton Inn and Suites hotel is under construction in Bend\u2019s Old Mill District, and is set to open next summer.\n\nNearby, a 90-room Marriott hotel could be coming to the former Brooks-Scanlon crane shed property, off Industrial Way.\n\nA rebounding real estate market pushed housing inventory to some of the lowest levels on record around Bend. Developers responded with three major apartment proposals.\n\nSage Springs, a 104-unit complex off Boyd Acres Road, could be done next month.\n\nA pair of even larger proposals entered the planning process last summer. A Washington state development company is considering a 241-unit complex made of several buildings, near Reed Market and Brosterhous roads.\n\nAnd a separate developer filed planning documents for a 144-unit complex in southeast Bend, made up of 15 separate buildings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bend Park & Recreation District is planning a new ice skating rink and recreation pavilion off Simpson Avenue, using funds from a bond passed by voters in 2012.\n\nCover Oregon\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplaces opened for business in October. And while some states have successfully registered thousands of new customers online, Oregon\u2019s marketplace rollout has arguably been the worst of any nationwide.\n\nCover Oregon\u2019s website still isn\u2019t working. A team of temporary staffers is processing applications by hand in an effort to keep thousands of Oregonians from losing their health insurance this month.\n\nWith the deadline to purchase insurance pushed back to Jan. 6, many would-be customers still don\u2019t know if they\u2019re covered. On Tuesday, Cover Oregon\u2019s computer servers were down for several hours, and employees were telling customers to call back later.\n\nCover Oregon\u2019s ongoing technical problems figure to be a major issue in Central Oregon and around the state in the early months of 2014.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7820, eglucklich@bendbulletin.com\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been corrected.
