The 240-page book is published by Nimbus Publishing.\n\nAs the two shared their meal and interests that day in 1995, Robertson revealed she was tracing her family history, that it extended down into South Carolina, but she had never visited the state.\n\nWhitehead is a Charlestonian, who began her career at Charleston Museum and moved to Canada in 1972. She worked at the Nova Scotia Museum for more then 40 years.\n\nIn 1999, the two would visit Charleston to research.\n\nRobertson is descended from black loyalists who fled South Carolina to Nova Scotia, siding with the British, during the American Revolution.\n\nAndrew Izard, the first of Robertson\u2019s ancestors known to have been there, was among 800 to 1,000 mostly runaway slaves to settle there from South Carolina, the largest group from any of the former British Colonies. He was on the Ship Nisbet, bound for Port \u201cMattoon Wilson\u201d (Port Mouton), on Nov. 19, 1783, according to British records.\n\n\u201cPreviously, I had no idea that South Carolina blacks had emigrated en masse to Nova Scotia,\u201d says Whitehead, who has written \u201cBlack Loyalists: Southern Settlers of Nova Scotia\u2019s First Free Black Communities.\u201d It was published this year after 18 years of study.\n\nThough Robertson is Canadian, she grew up in Germany where her father, a retired Canadian Army officer, was stationed.\n\nShe began delving into her family\u2019s history as an adult who felt the need to know more about their lives. Her relatives\u2019 stories were limited to recent history. Her great-grandparents were not mentioned.\n\nRoberston did not expect to find a lot of information about the family of Andrew Izard, a maternal ancestor, in South Carolina. She told Whitehead that she longed to at least walk on the ground they walked on.\n\nRobertson found Andrew Izard\u2019s name in the \u201cBook of Negroes,\u201d a register the British kept of blacks evacuated by its ships. The register contains information, such as blacks\u2019 former slave owners and the plantations they lived on.\n\n\u201cIt was a godsend,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cI was working at the archives and I kind of tripped over it. I said \u2018Oh my God! You are kidding me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSome of the names of slave owners in the book are the same as those in her family, including Izard and Broughton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to know the names of the people who went before me,\u201d Robertson says of her ancestors. \u201cBut, there is so much more to a person than the names and dates. For me, being able to trace them gives me a sense of their experiences.\u201d\n\nKnowing the challenges they faced and overcame gives Robinson strength, she says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me going when things are tough. I know what my ancestors survived and that we are still in the game.\u201d\n\nWhy this book\n\nWhitehead wrote \u201cBlack Loyalists\u201d for people like Robinson whose family history has been forgotten over time, she says.\n\nIn visiting Canadian communities where black loyalist descendants live, they repeatedly told Whitehead and Robertson that all they knew about their history was that they arrived on ships.\n\n\u201cBlack Loyalists\u201d provides detailed information about what life was like for some before they fled South Carolina and as they settled in Nova Scotia. While the book focuses on those from South Carolina, it also includes information about people from Georgia and Florida.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s research of black loyalists, genealogical research by Robertson and other blacks, a traveling Nova Scotia Museum exhibit, archaeological digs and Lesley Ann Patten\u2019s documentary, \u201cLoyalties,\u201d about the search for black loyalist roots in South Carolina and Nova Scotia all signal a burgeoning interest in black loyalists. The documentary (www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTQmjpWvjh0) won several awards, including the Canada Award, during the 1999 Gemini Awards by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Televisions.\n\nLocal connections\n\nRobertson and Whitehead later traveled to South Carolina during the late 1990s and lived with Whitehead\u2019s parents in Mount Pleasant to make the local connection.\n\nTheir initial research led them to Ralph Izard\u2019s plantation ruins on a swamp near Charleston Southern University, Whitehead says. But they later figured out they should research the papers of his cousin of the same name, and who had an Izard plantation on the Combahee River for documentation of Robertson\u2019s ancestors.\n\nIn doing so, they found Andrew, Robertson\u2019s earliest known black loyalist ancestor, his parents and siblings in an inventory taken when Izard\u2019s father died.\n\nWhitehead went on to amass 47 feet of photocopied documents from repositories in Canada, the United States and England for her work. They are digitally stored and can be accessed in the special collections department at the College of Charleston\u2019s Addlestone Library, she says.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at how much information would be found on some of the people,\u201d both here and in Canada, Whitehead says. It came from sources such as ship logs, muster rolls, diaries, newspaper accounts and court cases.\n\nNames of many South Carolina slave owners were found as Whitehead researched.\n\n\u201cI either recognized their names or knew their descendants,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI was personally shocked that my great-great-great-grandfather (William Trenholm) had been captain of a slave ship a couple of times and actually made voyages to the West Coast of Africa (to collect slaves).\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was so painful that occasionally I had to stop working for a little while.\u201d\n\nBroad appeal\n\nWhite and black Charlestonians would be interested in reading the book because of the names in it, says Alexander Moore, South Carolina Colonial history expert and acquisitions editor at the University of South Carolina Press.\n\nAbout 1,800 whites also left South Carolina. The names of those people include Ball, Moultrie, Rutledge, Wragg and others. Many families were split down the middle due to complicated sets of circumstances.\n\nNot only were there divided loyalties within black families and white families, but some of those who left were of mixed lineage and became separate branches of their families, Moore says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a genealogical watershed,\u201d Moore says.\n\nGreat personal details\n\nNicholas Butler, public historian at the Charleston County Public Library, is familiar with the book.\n\n\u201cMuch of the book focuses on Revolutionary War era in South Carolina,\u201d Butler says. \u201cWhile many books focus on battlefields and marching armies during the war, \u2018Black Loyalists\u2019 also talks about what happened on the plantations after the army moved through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great view of what is going on behind the lines when the armies aren\u2019t shooting at each other,\u201d Butler says.\n\nIn talking about slaves running away, Whitehead gives great personal details as she follows them throughout the war, he says.\n\n\u201cShe carefully chose individual stories to represent what happened, making the book more readable and giving readers an accurate view of how the war affected people.\n\n\u201cI do think this book will be very useful to people doing genealogy during this episode in American history, whether they are researching enslaved people or free people running up North, white soldiers or other white folks.\n\n\u201cEven if a family member is not specifically mentioned in the book, the reader should get a sense of the breadth of resources that are available (for researching their lives). She does a great job of touching on every available document.\u201d\n\nPassing stories along\n\nMelissha Richardson of Huger is interested in the outcome of Whitehead\u2019s research for personal reasons. The two have been in touch since Whitehead told her that she and Robertson may share an ancestor.\n\n\u201cI was excited to find out there may be a connection between my ancestors and loyalists that went to Nova Scotia,\u201d says Richardson.\u201d\n\nBefore Richardson\u2019s grandfather died, he told her stories that sustain her interest in family history. She recorded his talks about her about her great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, but a house fire since destroyed the recordings and now he is deceased.\n\nRichardson is hopeful that she can trace her family even further than she thought. Any additional information about family history, including about the loyalists, would be great.\n\n\u201cIt would be something that I could pass down to the younger generations here. My cousins are always looking to me (for answers) because I was the one talking to my grandfather. I don\u2019t want to disappoint them and maybe one day I could write my own book about our ancestry.\u201d\n\nReach Wevonneda Minis at 937-5705.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Book about blacks fleeing to Canada sheds light on South Carolina\u2019s Revolutionary War history, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Carmelita Robertson was wrapping up an internship at the Nova Scotia Museum when its assistant history curator, Ruth Holmes Whitehead, invited her to lunch.", "title": "Book about blacks fleeing to Canada sheds light on South Carolina\u2019s Revolutionary War history", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20131124/131129799/book-about-blacks-fleeing-to-canada-sheds-light-on-south-carolina-x2019-s-revolutionary-war-history", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131124/PC12/131129799/AR/0/AR-131129799.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131124/PC12/131129799/AR/0/AR-131129799.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carmelita Robertson was wrapping up an internship at the Nova Scotia Museum when its assistant history curator, Ruth Holmes Whitehead, invited her to lunch.", "title": "Book about blacks fleeing to Canada sheds light on South Carolina\u2019s Revolutionary War history", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131124/PC12/131129799/AR/0/AR-131129799.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 131129799}}, "keywords": "Book about blacks fleeing to Canada sheds light on South Carolina\u2019s Revolutionary War history , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-24T11:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T15:25:00Z", "author": "Wevonneda Minis"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Carmelita Robertson was wrapping up an internship at the Nova Scotia Museum when its assistant history curator, Ruth Holmes Whitehead, invited her to lunch."}, "article_summary": "Robertson is descended from black loyalists who fled South Carolina to Nova Scotia, siding with the British, during the American Revolution.\nRoberston did not expect to find a lot of information about the family of Andrew Izard, a maternal ancestor, in South Carolina.\nThe book \u201cBlack Loyalists: Southern Settlers of Nova Scotia\u2019s First Free Black Communities\u201d can be purchased from amazon.com for $22.05 and barnesandnoble.com for $22.25.\n\u201cMuch of the book focuses on Revolutionary War era in South Carolina,\u201d Butler says.\nWhile the book focuses on those from South Carolina, it also includes information about people from Georgia and Florida."}
