And he has raised nearly $11,000 more from area donors for his principle campaign committee.\n\nBetween both accounts, Crist has raised just over $3 million for his highly anticipated 2014 battle with Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican.\n\nCrist\u2019s biggest local donor was Venice retiree Rosalie Danbury. She donated $150,000 to Crist\u2019s political action committee. The Luhrsen Law Group and Sarasota resident Marty Rauch were tied for second, having donated $25,000 each to Crist\u2019s campaign.\n\nNotable among his early donors is Siesta Key\u2019s Gary Kompothecras, a Republican. The founder of the 1-800-ASK-GARY medical referral company donated just over $500 to Crist\u2019s principle campaign committee in November.\n\nWhile the nearly $211,000 haul in the region is impressive for one month for Crist, it is far short of what Scott has raised in the region, albeit over a longer stretch. Scott has raised nearly $830,000 from Sarasota and Bradenton donors dating back to mid-2010. Of that, nearly $575,000 came since the start of 2013.\n\nHis biggest area donor has been Osprey resident and developer Randy Benderson, who gave $200,000 to Scott\u2019s fund. The next-highest donor in the region was FCCI, a Lakewood Ranch insurance company which has been responsible for $137,000 to Scott\u2019s Let\u2019s Get to Work account.\n\nOverall Scott has raised more than $42 million in the Let\u2019s Get to Work Committee, and spent about $20 million, according to state election records.\n\nMany political experts think the Florida race will be one of the most expensive and combative gubernatorial races in the nation because of the unusual matchup. Crist was a Republican governor from 2006-10, but left to run for the U.S. Senate and lost. In 2010, Scott succeeded Crist, who has since switched party affiliation twice and is hoping to beat Scott, whose voter approval ratings are among the lowest of any governor in the nation.\n\nHelp from afar\n\nDemocrat Gwen Graham is running for a congressional district based in north Florida.\n\nBut that is not stopping local Democrats from wanting to chip in to help her.\n\nGraham, the daughter of former Florida Gov. and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, was in Sarasota last week for a private fundraiser to build support for what has become one of the most watched races in the nation. Graham is challenging Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City, in what many expect to be one of the most competitive congressional battles in Florida in 2014.\n\nThey are vying for the 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of 14 counties stretching from Bay County to Taylor County. The district includes Tallahassee and Panama City.\n\nMore than 60 people attended the event in Sarasota on Wednesday, including a who\u2019s who of Democratic players in the area. Former congressional candidates Christine Jennings and Keith Fitzgerald were on the host committee for the event, which also included Sarasota Democratic Party chairwoman Rita Ferrandino, Ed Chiles (son of the former Gov. and U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles), and former Sarasota city commissioners Ken Shelin and Kelly Kirschner.\n\n\u201cIt is so humbling to have so much support in my district and outside of my district,\u201d Graham said.\n\nNationally, Democrats need to flip 17 seats currently held by Republicans to regain the majority in the U.S. House. And locally Democrats see Graham as one of their best hopes to flip a seat in Florida.\n\nShe is not the only one looking beyond her district for fundraising help. Southerland was also hitting the road for donations. He was scheduled to be in Pinellas County on Sunday to raise money for the contest with Graham.\n\nFox news co-host coming\n\nThe co-host of one of Fox News Channel\u2019s most watched programs will be the keynote speaker at the Manatee Lincoln Day Dinner early next year.\n\nAndrea Tantaros, co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d has agreed to speak at the dinner, which serves as the Manatee County Republican Party\u2019s biggest fundraising event for the year.\n\nBesides being a co-host on \u201cThe Five,\u201d Tantaros has had her own conservative radio program and was a communications specialist for several Republican political campaigns before joining Fox News Channel.\n\nManatee GOP chairwoman Kathleen King said Tantaros brings a combination of youth, credentials and experience to the annual fundraising dinner, which honors President Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican elected president.\n\nThe dinner will be on Feb. 15 at the Bradenton Area Convention Center, One Haben Blvd., Palmetto. Tickets start at $125.\n\nFor more information call the Republican Party of Manatee County at 714-0600.\n\nArea political events\n\nToday\n\n\u2022 Suzanne Dickie of the Florida League of Women Voters speaks to the Anna Maria Island Democratic Club about the Affordable Care Act.
