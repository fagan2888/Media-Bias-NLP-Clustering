Mark Hertsgaard on the new U.N. report\u2014and how Bill McKibben learned to do something about climate change.\n\nBill McKibben should feel vindicated today.\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s premier scientific body on the issue, has just endorsed the path-breaking argument he made last year in Rolling Stone that most of the Earth\u2019s remaining fossil fuels must not be burned if civilization is to avoid catastrophic amounts of global warming.\n\nHumanity can burn no more than 1 trillion metric tons if it is to have a better than 50-50 chance of limiting average global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the IPCC declared today in the \u201cSummary for Policymakers\u201d of its Fifth Assessment Report on climate science. Scientists have long warned that going beyond 2C would unleash devastating, perhaps irreversible, changes in the climate system, including harsher heat waves, deeper droughts, stronger flooding, and relentless sea level rise. For their part, the world\u2019s governments have agreed, notably at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, to respect the 2\u00b0C limit. Nevertheless, commensurate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have not been made.\n\nNow, the IPCC has for the first time embraced the concept of a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d and, by implication, McKibben\u2019s argument that most of the planet\u2019s remaining fossil fuels must remain in the ground, unburned. The IPCC calculates that humanity has already burned through slightly more than half of its carbon budget (531 metric tons by 2011) since the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. As Justin Gillis reports in a strong piece in the New York Times \u201cat the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be released somewhere around 2040\u2026. More than three trillion tons of carbon are still left in the ground as fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nIn short, humanity has roughly 30 years to quit fossil fuels and shift to a new foundation of clean, renewable sources such as solar and wind power (which, luckily, are now expanding at spectacular speed throughout the world.)\n\nThe need to keep most fossil fuel in the ground is what has driven McKibben and other activists to press President Barck Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. If built, the pipeline would transport carbon-dense tar sands from Canada across the Midwest to refineries on the Gulf Coast. McKibben has called Keystone XL \u201ca fuse to the second largest deposit of carbon on the planet.\u201d And over the past seven years, he has helped build and lead a grassroots movement that now stands a good chance of defeating the pipeline\u2014a pipeline that, until recently, was seen as a done deal.\n\nOil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist By Bill McKibben 272 pages. Times Books. $26.\n\nPart personal memoir, part organizing manual, McKibben\u2019s new book, Oil and Honey tells the inside story of how the Keystone fight has been waged, the political lessons to be drawn, and what comes next in the larger battle to preserve a livable climate. Anyone interested in the climate battle, pro or con, will find much of value here. The book also describes how McKibben\u2019s shift from being a full-time writer to a more than full-time activist has unsettled, and in many ways saddened, him personally. In this regard he writes about seeking refuge by helping a bee-keeping neighbor tend to his hives, a mission that provides a second narrative thread throughout the book that is less engaging.\n\nFor McKibben, life as an activist meant life on the road, spreading the message and rallying the troops with countless speeches and media interviews. He was away from home more often than not, enduring one bus, car or plane ride after another, punctuated by stops in cheerless budget hotels. \u201cHilton should open a budget division called Purgatory,\u201d he writes. As grueling as the travel schedule was the ceaseless torrent of emails, many hundreds a day, except on the weekends, \u201cwhen email dropped off to an almost manageable level.\u201d\n\nAll of this clashed with McKibben\u2019s true nature, he came to realize, which, as a writer, was to sit alone in a room, reflect upon the world and communicate what he had discovered to his readers. \u201cI miss, sometimes desperately, the other me,\u201d he confesses. \u201cThe one with time to think.\u201d\n\nBut time, he emphasizes, is what humanity lacks most in the face of climate change, so it was into the fray. The book\u2019s subtitle is, The Education of an Unlikely Activist, but McKibben might better be called a reluctant activist. This memoir makes clear that he gave his life over to activism not because he wanted to, and certainly not because he craved celebrity, but because he felt he had no moral alternative. Knowing all that he knew about the dangers of climate change\u2014and as the leading reporter on the beat for the past 25 years, he knew as much as anyone\u2014and seeing how little progress was being made, he felt he had no choice but to get more directly involved in the fight.\n\nWhat you have to understand about McKibben is that he is a church-going person. He has been since childhood. He doesn\u2019t make a big deal about it, but it is key to comprehending him as a writer and, now, as the activist who has put the Keystone pipeline and the larger climate crisis at the center of national politics. (Remember how Mitt Romney pledged that his first act as president would be to \u201cbuild the Keystone pipeline,\u201d even if he had to do it with his own hands? And just this week, congressional Republicans are threatening to push the U.S. government into default unless Obama and the Democrats agree not only to defund the Affordable Care Act but also to approve Keystone.)\n\nToby Talbot/AP Environmental activist Bill McKibben speaks to the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier, Vermont on Feb. 7, 2012.\n\nI should say that I\u2019ve known McKibben as a professional friend and colleague since we were young pups writing for editor William Shawn at The New Yorker in the 1980s. I can\u2019t recall ever having had a conversation with him about religion per se. But my own upbringing was similar to his (though my denomination was Lutheran, his is Methodist) and I recognize a New Testament outlook when I see it.\n\nAs corny as it may sound, McKibben takes seriously what Jesus urged in the Sermon on the Mount: to \u201cthirst for what is right and good\u201d and to treat others accordingly. McKibben has taught Sunday School and even preached sermons on occasion, but his concern with living a moral life comes across most plainly in his voluminous writings, which now include 14 books and hundreds if not thousands of articles. An anecdote in Oil and Honey demonstrates the lengths to which he\u2019ll go to honor Jesus\u2019 teaching to \u201clove your enemies,\u201d even paid lackeys of the fossil fuel companies that are broiling the planet.\n\nDuring a public debate in Washington, McKibben dared to suggest that Big Oil \u201cwas using the congressmen it funded heavily to make [the Keystone pipeline] happen.\u201d When a Republican on the panel who had received buckets of oil company campaign contributions took offense at his statement, writes McKibben, \u201cI suddenly felt bad\u2026 I was raised to be nice. Had I hurt his feelings?\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

But an activist he learned to behave like politician, which sometimes meant keeping his mouth shut. Thus when Obama, near the end of the 2012 campaign, decided to shore up his credentials as a defender of the American way of life by posing in front of a pipeline and bragging that his administration had added enough pipe over the past four years \u201cto encircle the Earth and then some,\u201d McKibben was privately appalled. But, he explains, \u201cif at that point I\u2019d said, \u2018The president is simply doing the bidding of the oil companies,\u2019 which was true, it would have made it that much easier for the White House to renege on [its earlier promise to re-evaluate the Keystone project], reasoning that I\u2019d already taken my worst shot.\u201d\n\nMcKibben\u2019s behind-the-scenes accounts of high-level political jostling are entertaining\u2014his cat-and-mouse phone calls with White House adviser Jon Carson are especially juicy\u2014but most valuable are his strategic insights about what constitutes successful activism. They are worth considering, again regardless of which side of the issue one supports, because McKibben (and his colleagues at the group he co-founded, 350.org) have achieved something that no one else managed over the past 20 years: making climate change an issue the mainstream media and politicians of every stripe must engage.\n\nThe most important of McKibben\u2019s strategic insights is also the most basic, though most big U.S. environmental groups have long failed to heed it: politics is about power, not about being right. Solid science and smart policy proposals are crucial, but they matter little without the political muscle needed to make government and corporate leaders pay attention. If being right on the merits were sufficient, McKibben\u2019s The End of Nature, the first mass market book on global warming, should have solved the problem back in 1989. It took McKibben himself until 2006, when he led his first big march against climate change, to figure out that \u201cthis fight was about power, [and] we who wanted change had to assemble some.\u201d\n\nThat meant pursuing a political strategy quite different from what most big U.S. environmental groups were following. McKibben discusses this delicate topic more diplomatically than necessary. Is it because the Christian in him doesn\u2019t want to hurt people\u2019s feelings? Or because, as an activist, he has to continue working with those groups? In any case, he opines that the environmental movement had become merely \u201ca collection of environmental groups, each doing impressive work but often without enough connection to the grassroots or to one another.\u201d These groups were \u201cmasters of the inside game\u201d in Washington, but that approach was not succeeding, \u201cmostly because there\u2019s been no outside game to go with it.\u201d McKibben set out to build that outside game\u2014\u201cthe surge of people that produces respect and maybe even a little fear in leaders.\u201d\n\nTo do so, he focused his efforts not on the mythical political center that Washington-centric politicians and journalists are always invoking but on preaching to the choir. \u201cYou might think it\u2019s a waste to preach to the choir,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut the truth is, you need to get the choir fired up, singing loudly, all out of the same hymnal\u2026. Usually, they\u2019re singing so many different tunes that no distinct harmony emerges.\u201d\n\nThat choir is far from the only religious touchstone in McKibben\u2019s activism. Inspired by the embrace of nonviolent civil disobedience by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement\u2014an embrace grounded in Christ\u2019s teaching to \u201clove your enemies\u201d\u2014McKibben and 350.org helped organized a series of mass arrests in front of the White House in August 2011 that landed 1,253 people in jail and put Keystone and climate change on TV and computer screens around the world. The big environmental groups, none of whom (save Greenpeace) had previously engaged in civil disobedience, quickly endorsed the new strategy in an open letter to Obama. \u201cThe movement we\u2019d long needed was starting to emerge,\u201d writes McKibben.\n\nThis new movement has transformed Keystone from a slam-dunk certainty four years ago\u2014when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was \u201cinclined\u201d to approve the project\u2014into a doubtful proposition today. Conventional wisdom inside the Beltway still says Keystone will be built, but that\u2019s the D.C. echo chamber talking. Consider: President Obama, in his landmark climate change speech in June, not only brought up Keystone when all the \u201cexperts\u201d said he wouldn\u2019t, he declared that the pipeline would not be approved if it \u201csignificantly exacerbate[d] the problem of carbon pollution.\u201d That\u2019s quite a limb for a president to go out on. Since Keystone would enable the burning of one of the largest, dirtiest pools of carbon on the planet, it\u2019s hard to see how Obama could now approve the project with a straight face.", "article_metadata": {"pageNum": 1, "description": "Thirty years is all the time we have to dramatically change our consumption of fossil fuels\u2014or face catastrophe.
