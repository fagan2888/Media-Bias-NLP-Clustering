A man speeding down a residential section of North Nevada Sunday morning lost control and smashed into two parked cars.

The driver's vehicle flipped over, nearly taking a stop sign down with it.

Numerous residents living along the 1700 block of North Nevada saw or heard the crash and called police.

"At 1:23 a.m. the Colorado Springs Police Department...received numerous phone calls regarding a traffic accident here," CSPD Sgt. John Ingram told 11 News.

Police and firefighters rescued the single occupant of the rolled car and rushed him to the hospital. He was pronounced dead 20 minutes after the initial 911 call.

At this time, the crash victim's identity is not known. It's also unclear if drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash.

The investigation is ongoing.
