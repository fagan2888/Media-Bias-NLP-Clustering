So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again, we\u2019re looking for you to raise your hand now \u2013 raise your hand now if you won\u2019t make that pledge tonight.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s repeatedly raised the prospect of a third-party campaign, raised his hand, drawing audience boos. He added, \u201cIf I\u2019m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent,\u201d which was unintentionally funny, but didn\u2019t seem to impress anyone.\n\nBut notice what happened the next time Trump was in the spotlight. Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly asked the candidate, \u201cMr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don\u2019t use a politician\u2019s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. You\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u2018fat pigs,\u2019 \u2018dogs,\u2019 \u2018slobs,\u2019 and \u2018disgusting animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump quickly interjected, \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d\n\nFor many viewers, it was an ugly and offensive moment, but the audience that had booed Trump minutes earlier seemed to love it. Trump was back on track \u2013 the Caricature Candidate was putting on the show that has propelled him to the front of the pack, condemning \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and basking in the warm applause of entertained voters.\n\nGoing into the debate, one of the key questions was which Republican would try to take Trump down. The answer, oddly enough, was Fox News.\n\nI\u2019ll concede that debate analysis is a bit like art analysis: quality is in the eye of the beholder. Two political experts could sit next to one another, watch the same event, and come away with wildly divergent assessments about who thrived and who flopped.\n\nThe Trump factor complicates matters further \u2013 it\u2019s challenging for many of us to relate to his partisan appeal, which makes it that much more difficult to know whether Republican primary voters are growing weary of his antics or swooning in even greater numbers.\n\nBut if Fox hoped to use last night\u2019s debate to take the inexplicable frontrunner down a peg, I think the network probably missed.\n\nAs for the rest of the field, here are some takeaways from my notes:\n\nJeb Bush: The GOP establishment must be feeling antsy right about now about the former governor\u2019s consistently lackluster performances. Asked early on about his family, Bush said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a record in Florida. I\u2019m proud of my dad, and I\u2019m certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.\u201d Maybe they called you Jeb because it\u2019s the name you told everyone to call you?\n\nScott Walker: If last night was an important opportunity for the Wisconsin governor, he missed it. He had very little to say when asked about the Black Live Matter movement, and when asked, \u201cWould you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion?\u201d Walker simply stuck to his \u201cpro-life\u201d talking points \u2013 effectively answering, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBen Carson: Apparently, the retired neurosurgeon is comfortable with torture. He also complained about \u201cthe Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots,\u201d which will probably endear him to some odd right-wing bloggers.\n\nRand Paul: He doesn\u2019t appear to like Chris Christie very much.\n\nChris Christie: He doesn\u2019t appear to like Rand Paul very much.\n\nMarco Rubio: Much of the political class seems to think the Florida senator excelled last night. I\u2019m not sure why \u2013 he presents policy gibberish in a pleasant enough way, but his attempts at wonkery are hollow. What\u2019s more, while Republicans had earlier tried to criticize Hillary Clinton by saying the presidency is no place for on-the-job training, Rubio told the audience, \u201c[I]f this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton\u2019s going to be the next president.\u201d In other words, Rubio sees Clinton as the most qualified candidate running this cycle. Good to know.\n\nMike Huckabee: The right-wing Arkansan wants to tax \u201cpimps,\u201d give constitutional rights to embryos, and defy Supreme Court rulings he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nTed Cruz: The right-wing Texan seemed to get lost in a sea of nonsense last night. At one point, he suggested he can \u201cdefeat radical Islamic terrorism\u201d through word-choice, which only served as a reminder of Cruz\u2019s willingness to treat voters like fools.\n\nJohn Kasich: The Ohio governor, playing to a hometown crowd, came across as knowledgeable and sincere, even offering an eloquent defense of the Affordable Care Act.
