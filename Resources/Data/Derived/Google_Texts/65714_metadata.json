When the Gardner couple went to see their doctor following Ashley\u2019s first round of IVF eagerly expecting one bun in the oven, they were shocked to find out they had four buns in the oven. Luckily, Alicia Hallock, a friend who happens to be a photographer, was at the ultrasound reveal and snapped some pretty memorable reaction photos.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook Facebook\n\n\u201cThis is the story of our 8 year journey with infertility ending in an IVF treatment and now pregnant with quadruplets! We feel blessed beyond measure,\u201d Ashley and Tyson said on their Facebook page. \u201cWe were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.\u201d\n\nA second ultrasound revealed that all four future Gardners, affectionately known as \u201cThe Quad Squad,\u201d will be girls. All four Gardner girls are expected for around the end of December or the beginning of January, which should make for a perfect Christmas gift.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook Facebook\n\n\u201cOur battle with infertility was a long journey and we are so happy to finally be where we are,\u201d Ashley told the BabyCenter via email. \u201cThe funny thing about us having four girls is that Tyson is the oldest of 10 kids and 8 are boys. This was the last thing anyone expected and everyone is so excited!\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook Facebook", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ashley, tyson, gardner, quadruplets", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ashley and Tyson Gardner were understandably shocked after receiving their ultrasound that revealed the couple would be having quadruplets.", "title": "Couple's Reaction To Finding Out They Are Having Quadruplets Is Exactly What You Would Expect [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couples-reaction-finding-out-they-are-having-quadruplets-exactly-what-you-would-expect-306220", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ashley-tyson-gardner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ashley and Tyson Gardner were understandably shocked after receiving their ultrasound that revealed the couple would be having quadruplets.", "title": "Couple's Reaction To Finding Out They Are Having Quadruplets Is Exactly What You Would Expect [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couples-reaction-finding-out-they-are-having-quadruplets-exactly-what-you-would-expect-306220", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ashley-tyson-gardner.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ashley-tyson-gardner.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-03T16:56:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T16:57:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ashley and Tyson Gardner were understandably shocked after receiving their ultrasound that revealed the couple would be having quadruplets."}, "article_summary": "This was the last thing anyone expected and everyone is so excited!\u201dPhoto courtesy of Facebook Facebook\nAll four Gardner girls are expected for around the end of December or the beginning of January, which should make for a perfect Christmas gift.\n\u201cThe funny thing about us having four girls is that Tyson is the oldest of 10 kids and 8 are boys.\nAfter eight years of trying to become pregnant, Ashley and Tyson Gardner turned to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in hopes of welcoming a new member of the family.\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook Facebook\u201cThis is the story of our 8 year journey with infertility ending in an IVF treatment and now pregnant with quadruplets!"}
