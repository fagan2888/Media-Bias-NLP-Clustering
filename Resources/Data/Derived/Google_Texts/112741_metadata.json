The number of Chinese individuals who became dollar millionaires (counting only their liquid wealth, not real estate) soared 82 percent last year to hit 2,378,000, according to just-released date from the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe twist to the tale? They probably didn\u2019t make that money by investing in the Chinese market.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s Strategy Has Completely Eluded Washington\n\nWhile China remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, helping to generate incredible amounts of wealth for those at the very top of what is becoming, with every passing year, an ever more unequal society, it also wrapped up 2013 as Asia\u2019s worst performing stock market. The Shanghai Composite posted a decline of 6.75 percent.\n\nNor is this disappointment a thing of the past. So far this year, the Shanghai index is down nearly 3 percent. By comparison, India\u2019s Mumbai Sensex is ahead more than 20 percent, and even Brazil\u2019s Bovespa has climbed 7 percent. Even Russia\u2019s Micex Index, in spite of the country\u2019s economic and geopolitical woes, is doing better. It\u2019s essentially flat for the year to date.\n\nRelated: India\u2019s New Leader Risks Violent Disruption for China-style Growth\n\n(Within Asia, Thailand \u2013 where political unrest has taken a deep toll on economic growth and where the military recently seized power in a coup \u2013 is seeing its stock market fare quite well. The ThaiDEX SET50 ETF, an exchange-traded fund often used as a proxy for the Thai market, is up 13.7 percent year to date.)\n\nThe problem is, as Goldman Sachs pointed out in a recent investment strategy report, that reasonably rapid economic growth \u2013 something China still boasts, even as it struggles to meet its own 7.5 percent GDP growth target this year \u2013 doesn\u2019t always translate into earnings growth or share price gains. In the two decades leading up to 2013, economic growth in China has dwarfed that of the United States \u2014 but U.S. stock market returns outpaced those earned in China to an equally dramatic extent.\n\nThere are many theories for why this is. The state continues to play a big role in business and puts its interests ahead of those of maximizing shareholder profits, for instance. Management skills may be weaker, too. None of that is likely to change any time soon. What has happened instead is that China\u2019s government appears to be at war with itself, trying to balance the tightly regulated and low-cost \u201cofficial\u201d lending system (a political necessity) with unintended consequences such as the creation of a massive shadow banking system.\n\nLast year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission calculated this network of non-bank lenders accounted for a whopping 80 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. Even if the actual figure is far lower, fears about potential abuses in the murkier parts of this shadow banking network, along with anxiety about the impact of any collapse in asset values, are enough to spook many investors.\n\nChina\u2019s current pattern of economic growth and regulation fuels the growth of its shadow banking system \u2013 and is great for those who make millions from that system \u2013 but it\u2019s bad news for anyone hoping to find a quick, straightforward way to profit from what is still the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy.\n\nAlas, that title isn\u2019t all that it used to be. True, exports are still healthy and growing; factory output is on the rise. But investment levels remain lackluster and big question marks hover over China\u2019s potentially problematic property sector.\n\nMoreover, China\u2019s reforms are aimed at boosting domestic consumption. That might suggest that investors rethink the question from a different angle. Instead of eyeing the Chinese market, perhaps it\u2019s time to winnow through the universe of global stocks \u2014 whether based in China, Southeast Asia, or the developed markets \u2014 in quest of companies that might benefit if that long-cherished policy goal finally reaches fruition.\n\nThere is at least the potential for a portfolio of consumer-oriented businesses to mimic, to some extent, the experience of commodity manufacturers over the last decade, as the boom in China\u2019s manufacturing and industrial production triggered an unprecedented demand for everything from iron ore and copper to rare earths mined in Africa.\n\nThat boom has now turned into a bust, leaving mining companies facing large losses and grappling with overcapacity. The question is whether the centuries-old dream of selling consumer goods to China\u2019s massive population might finally come true, and in the process become the best way to invest in at least the idea of China, if not the country itself. We may yet end up in a world where the best \u201cChina stocks\u201d aren\u2019t Chinese at all, but those of companies like Procter & Gamble, Yum! Brands or Nike.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "China has just harvested a bumper crop of millionaires.", "title": "BRIC by BRIC: The Best Way to Invest in China Might Not Be in China", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/12/BRIC-BRIC-Best-Way-Invest-China-Might-Not-Be-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06122014_BRICS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/12/BRIC-BRIC-Best-Way-Invest-China-Might-Not-Be-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06122014_BRICS.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "China has just harvested a bumper crop of millionaires.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf0c\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission calculated this network of non-bank lenders accounted for a whopping 80 percent of the country\u2019s GDP.\nThey probably didn\u2019t make that money by investing in the Chinese market.\nIn the two decades leading up to 2013, economic growth in China has dwarfed that of the United States \u2014 but U.S. stock market returns outpaced those earned in China to an equally dramatic extent.\nWe may yet end up in a world where the best \u201cChina stocks\u201d aren\u2019t Chinese at all, but those of companies like Procter & Gamble, Yum!\nBy comparison, India\u2019s Mumbai Sensex is ahead more than 20 percent, and even Brazil\u2019s Bovespa has climbed 7 percent."}
