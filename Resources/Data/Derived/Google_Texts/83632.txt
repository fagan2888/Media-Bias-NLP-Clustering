To the Editor:

Re “They Call Me Doctor Berry” (Sunday Review, Nov. 2):

Thank you to Carlotta A. Berry for her essay about why, as a black female engineering professor, she insists that her students refer to her as “Dr.”

Although I am white, as a woman in philosophy (which is reportedly barely 20 percent women), I know exactly what Dr. Berry experiences; I’ve had (usually young male) students display open hostility to me.

Oddly, it’s the tendency of young female students to refer to me as “Mrs.,” as if all women older than they must be married (I’m not) and that’s somehow significant information about them.

As a result, I, too, insist on “Dr.” and “Professor,” not because I’m hung up on titles but because, like Dr. Berry, I want to continually normalize for all students alike that their philosophy professor is indeed a woman.
