The hit, though legal, rubbed Seattle Seahawks cornerback Walter Thurmond the wrong way.\n\nAsked if he had anything to say to Thurmond, Welker said: \u201cNot at all, not at all. I just look forward to the game in New York. I\u2019m just really looking forward to going out there and playing hard and competing \u2014 and [winning] the game.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Thurmond told reporters: \u201cIt was really uncalled for. The receiver (Welker) ran right into the guy. I don\u2019t know the extent of the injury Talib had, but I thought we were supposed to protect football players in this league now. I guess not. I guess that only goes one way.\u201d\n\nThe NFL, however, cleared Welker of any wrongdoing for his hit in Denver\u2019s 26-16 win over the Patriots.\n\n\u201cIt was a legal hit,\u201d NFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino said on the NFL Network on Wednesday night.\n\nOn Monday morning, Patriots coach Bill Belichick called Welker\u2019s hit \u201cone of the worst plays\u201d he\u2019d seen. Talib suffered a knee injury on the play and didn\u2019t return to the game. He is not expected to need surgery.\n\nWelker ran a play across the middle that is commonly called a \u201crub\u201d or \u201cpick\u201d when he collided with Talib, but Thurmond said that what Welker did was against the rules because he never lifted his head.\n\n\u201cWelker had his head down, like he was coming down the whole time,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat should be a flag, and he should be getting fined. There\u2019s a whole bunch of things that should happen in that situation, but I don\u2019t run the NFL.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker won\u2019t get embroiled in questions about Aqib Talib hit", "title": "Wes Welker won\u2019t get embroiled in questions about Aqib Talib hit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/24/wes-welker-wont-get-embroiled-in-questions-about-aqib-talib-hit/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__SP0121WELKERHITSTALIBp1-2.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__SP0121WELKERHITSTALIBp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T15:17:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T08:28:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0563\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a legal hit,\u201d NFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino said on the NFL Network on Wednesday night.\nAsked if he had anything to say to Thurmond, Welker said: \u201cNot at all, not at all.\nThe receiver (Welker) ran right into the guy.\n\u201cWelker had his head down, like he was coming down the whole time,\u201d he told reporters.\nI\u2019m just really looking forward to going out there and playing hard and competing \u2014 and [winning] the game.\u201dOn Wednesday, Thurmond told reporters: \u201cIt was really uncalled for."}
