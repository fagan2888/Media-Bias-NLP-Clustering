Which? rates the latest Dyson and Bosch vacuum cleaners Plus our expert verdict on Asda's £25 Value model

We tested Dyson's claims for the DC28 C Multifloor

Our latest test of vacuum cleaners reveals whether Dyson's upgrade to its 'cyclone' technology really has improved suction, plus our expert verdict on the new Hotpoint vacuum range, two new Bosch vacs and a Don't Buy model so bad we think you should avoid it altogether.

We tested 12 of the latest vacuum cleaners including the Dyson DC28C Multifloor and two of Bosch's new cylinder vacs. For the DC28C (£199), Dyson claims the improved cyclone suction power can capture 'more dust than any other cyclone', and it has a mechanism designed to provide greater steering control as you move around the house vacuuming.

Meanwhile Bosch claims that its GL-50 Power All Floor vacuum cleaner (£166) is effective on all floor types and upholstery. With a large self-sealing dust bag it's also designed to need emptying less often and make this chore easier.

To see how Dyson, Bosch and Hotpoint measured up in our rigorous tests, as well as which vac scored so badly we've dubbed it a Don't Buy, go straight to our full vacuum cleaner reviews.

New Dyson vacuum - excellent at sucking up dust?

The DC28C Multifloor is the first full-sized cylinder vac we've tested with Dyson's updated suction technology.

Which? vacuum cleaner expert Matthew Knight says: 'Dyson's newest vacs include improvements designed to make them easier to manoeuvre and empty, as well as an updated cyclone system for sucking up more grime.

'Our independent lab tests take into account ease of use as well as how much dust and pet hair a vacuum can pick up, how much dust it retains and how noisy it is. We've seen variable scores from Dyson vacs in the past, so this new test confirms whether or not Dyson's claimed technological improvements really work.'

You can find out whether the Dyson DC28C scored highly enough to make our list of the Best Buy vacuum cleaners.

Do supermarket own-brand vacs measure up?

As well as big-name brands, we've also just tested some cheap vacuum cleaners from Asda, Hoover and Vax. Supermarket and store own-brand vacs can be appealing if you're shopping on a budget, and the latest Asda vacuum we've tested costs just £25. With a new Dyson model starting at around £200 and a Bosch models ranging from about £180 to £350, there's a lot of money to be saved with this Asda model. But is a cheap vac false economy?

Matt Knight says: 'Low-cost supermarket vacs are popular purchases but our tests have often found them poor, so we pit the Asda Value vac against the same tough tests we do more expensive branded vacs to see if the supermarket can buck the trend.
