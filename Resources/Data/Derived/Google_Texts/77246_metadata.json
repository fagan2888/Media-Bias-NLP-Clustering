One out.\n\nThe Broncos produced the best wide receiving tandem in franchise history this season. But Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders won\u2019t share their Pro Bowl experience.\n\nThomas will not participate because of ankle and toe injuries. He also is a pending free agent, a potential, if not udnderstandable factor in his decision.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles announced Friday that 26-year-old Jeremy Maclin will replace Thomas, granting him his first trip to the Pro Bowl. Maclin posted career-highs in catches (85), receiving yards (1,318) and tied a career-best in touchdown catches (10) in 2014.\n\nThomas was better.\n\nHe caught 111 passes for a franchise-best 1,619 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also established a Broncos record for 100-yards plus receiving games in a season with 10.\n\nThomas joins quarterback Peyton Manning as Broncos decilining to particiatipate because of injury. With the addition of Sanders last week, the Broncos have eight players scheduled to play in the Pro Bowl.\n\nTroy Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or twitter.com/troyrenck", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas out of Pro Bowl; Jeremy Maclin to replace him", "title": "Demaryius Thomas out of Pro Bowl; Jeremy Maclin to replace him", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/18/demaryius-thomas-out-of-pro-bowl-jeremy-maclin-to-replace-him/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150118__demaryius-pro-bowlp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150118__demaryius-pro-bowlp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T09:23:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:12:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9538\"", "article_summary": "The Philadelphia Eagles announced Friday that 26-year-old Jeremy Maclin will replace Thomas, granting him his first trip to the Pro Bowl.\nBut Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders won\u2019t share their Pro Bowl experience.\nWith the addition of Sanders last week, the Broncos have eight players scheduled to play in the Pro Bowl.\nMaclin posted career-highs in catches (85), receiving yards (1,318) and tied a career-best in touchdown catches (10) in 2014.\nThe Broncos produced the best wide receiving tandem in franchise history this season."}
