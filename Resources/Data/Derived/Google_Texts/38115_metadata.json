Chelsie Martinez of Sonoma County recalls that Kaiser typically made her wait about six to eight weeks for one-on-one therapy appointments for post-traumatic stress and other emotional problems, which previously drove her to attempt suicide. She says that though she preferred individualized care, Kaiser pressured her to engage in group sessions. She was told, \u201cI wasn\u2019t participating as they thought I should be, and that I needed to be more involved.\u201d But she protested, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t do groups as they were really not helping.\u201d She eventually left Kaiser\u2019s services to pay for private individual therapy, and says now, \u201calthough the expenses are a bit more, my mental health has never been better and I\u2019m not willing to give that up.\u201d\n\nBut many others may be unable to afford services outside of Kaiser\u2019s insurance system. They\u2019re stuck with a service infrastructure that has, despite billions in annual profits, been criticized for years for poor services and inadequate performance monitoring. A 2013 state audit found that despite a standard two-week wait time for non-urgent appointments, at one facility, \u201cbetween 18 percent and 32 percent of the wait times exceeded 14 days.\u201d Kaiser got fined $4 million for various service deficiencies, and has faced various patient lawsuits.\n\nThe union, National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), complained last June of systematic violations of standards of care in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, citing a facility in Redwood City that reportedly \u201cexperienced an unprecedented spate of seven suicides in a matter of months, which clinicians believe is directly connected to the serious understaffing of Kaiser\u2019s mental health clinics.\u201d\n\nWhile many converging problems have created the crunch, including rising enrollment as well as chronic understaffing and inadequate recruitment efforts, the bottom line is that these patients are insured, yet their needs have been neglected on an epidemic scale. Ad Policy\n\nThe crisis at Kaiser may intensify as the Affordable Care Act enrolls more people in new insurance plans. Moreover, these service gaps at private insurers come in a context of a nationwide mental health crisis, with massive unmet needs among highly vulnerable populations, like the uninsured, children, and the incarcerated.The union\u2019s seven-day strike was their most dramatic call yet to resolve the staffing shortages not just with acute care\u2014recruiting and hiring more staff for facilities with service gaps\u2014but also preventive measures: a new system to incorporate clinicians themselves into key personnel decisions.\n\nNUHW President Sal Rosselli says that empowering staff themselves to participate in decisions on personnel needs is the most ethical and efficient way to manage growing care needs: \u201cOur simple proposal was that we establish a committee of psychologists and managers at each clinic that work on the staffing situation for that hospital or clinic, and come up with a resolution.\u201d A third-party mediator could be called upon to resolve disputes.\n\nFor now, NUHW\u2019s negotiations are set to resume with Kaiser, and their agreement could set a nationwide template for mental health parity.\n\nKaiser, which recently negotiated another hard-fought contract with the California Nurses Association, said in a statement to The Nation, \u201cWe remain ready to return to the table,\u201d but \u201cthis agreement must be one that best serves our employees, members and patients.\u201d It called the strike \u201centirely unnecessary and counterproductive.\u201d\n\nBut the workers know what \u201cunnecessary\u201d looks like. Despite the corporation\u2019s repeated vows to strengthen services, Clifford says it should start with a basic ounce of prevention: timely initial appointments and responsive staff. That way, \u201cNot only can we avoid some of the more expensive outcomes\u201d\u2014including costly hospitalizations\u2014\u201cbut also we can provide a more ethical treatment, and avoid and decrease a lot of the\u2026needless suffering that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nParadoxically, striking was a demonstration of care amid crisis: workers felt the least \u201ccounterproductive\u201d way to use their labor was to withhold it to send Kaiser a message: waiting a week for services was still a much shorter delay than what they and their patients deal with every day.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kaiser_healthcare_strike_rtr_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Chen", "description": "Kaiser's mental healthcare workers and patients have had enough of epic waiting times and surging suicide rates.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Kaiser's mental healthcare workers and patients have had enough of epic waiting times and surging suicide rates.", "title": "These Mental Health Patients Are Being Neglected on an Epidemic Scale", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/these-mental-health-patients-are-being-neglected-epidemic-scale/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kaiser_healthcare_strike_rtr_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:48+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kaiser's mental healthcare workers and patients have had enough of epic waiting times and surging suicide rates.", "title": "These Mental Health Patients Are Being Neglected on an Epidemic Scale", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/these-mental-health-patients-are-being-neglected-epidemic-scale/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kaiser_healthcare_strike_rtr_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kaiser_healthcare_strike_rtr_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "January 26th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "These Mental Health Patients Are Being Neglected on an Epidemic Scale", "keywords": "Kaiser, California, healthcare workers, mental health, strike, National Union of Healthcare Workers, The Nation, Michelle Chen", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 113913, "sailthru.tags": "Healthcare Policy,Labor,Mental Health,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Michelle Chen", "published_time": "2015-01-26T15:35:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:48+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/mchen/"}, "sailthru.description": "Kaiser's workers and patients have had enough of epic waiting times and surging suicide rates.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kaiser_healthcare_strike_rtr_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3e9\"", "article_summary": "For now, NUHW\u2019s negotiations are set to resume with Kaiser, and their agreement could set a nationwide template for mental health parity.\nShe says that though she preferred individualized care, Kaiser pressured her to engage in group sessions.\nAd PolicyThe crisis at Kaiser may intensify as the Affordable Care Act enrolls more people in new insurance plans.\nMost Popular1 The Media Must Decide Whether to Follow Donald Trump Down the Sewer2 The Democratic Platform Committee Now Has a Progressive Majority.\nDespite the corporation\u2019s repeated vows to strengthen services, Clifford says it should start with a basic ounce of prevention: timely initial appointments and responsive staff."}
