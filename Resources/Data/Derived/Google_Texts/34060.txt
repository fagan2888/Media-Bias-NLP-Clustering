Safe working at height is the subject of a one-hour ‘Twitter Symposium’ next month organised by the Access Industry Forum (AIF).

It will start at 11am on Wednesday 16th April 2014 and it will take the form of a one-hour question and answer session. The AIF says that it will offer an opportunity to put questions to experts in every sector of the access industry. Topics up for discussion include ladders, mobile access towers, powered access, personal protective equipment, industrial rope access, edge protection and façade access.

To take part, tweet a question with the hashtag #WAHQ, or direct the question to @AIFworkatheight. All questions will be answered through tweets during the event.
