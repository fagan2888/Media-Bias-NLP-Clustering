Brett Sigmundsson, 52, belts out the lyrics of a Beatles tune while dancing in place with all the vigor of a middle-aged Mick Jagger. John Archer, 64, rises to his feet in dance. Up front, Norma Felter, 85, a former department store clerk whose eyes are glued to a TV screen showing the lyrics for \u201cHey Jude,\u201d sings into a microphone, not always in sync with the words but joyfully all the same.\n\nEven those whose thoughts appear far away sometimes sway or tap their fingers in time to the beat.\n\nThe karaoke session is a popular draw at the facility. But music, art and dance sessions like these are also the subject of intensifying interest among the scientific community.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s median age rises and baby boomers retire, the federal government, universities and health-care institutions are seeking to determine whether the arts have a quantifiably therapeutic effect on people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other age-related disabilities.\n\nMany researchers agree: Evidence seems promising that the arts can improve cognitive function and memory, bolster a person\u2019s mood and sense of well-being, and reduce stress, agitation and aggression. But many previous studies have been too limited or poorly designed to say for sure.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institutes of Health and others are pushing for more answers. At Birmingham Green, researchers from George Mason University are conducting a federally subsidized study to examine the impact of the arts on the emotional and cognitive health of older adults.\n\n\u201cThere still needs to be a lot of work done,\u201d said Sunil Iyengar, who heads the Office of Research and Analysis at the NEA. Iyengar said research into the effect of art on people with cognitive impairments has suffered from a lack of rigor.\n\nToo many studies lacked proper controls, involved samples that were too small, and were poorly defined. They also may have been looking for the wrong thing, Iyengar said.\n\nWhile searching for hard evidence of biological improvements in memory or cognition, many also overlooked measurable improvements in the mood and well-being of people with Alzheimer\u2019s, and their caregivers, too.\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cShall I Compare Thee to a Dose of Donepezil,\u201d researchers Kate de Medeiros and Anne Basting called for developing research models that would better suit interventions that involve the imagination and meaningful personal experiences, instead of those that have been used to test clinical efficacy of pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cI think these are the so-called intangibles that we as a society have tended to underplay,\u201d Iyengar said. \u201cThese are really devastating diseases for these people and their families, and anything you can do to reduce that pain is important.\u201d\n\nMEASURING JOY\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences, at the request of the NEA and NIH, convened a public workshop in March 2011 to investigate ways to bolster research into arts-related interventions for aging adults. Several studies have hinted at the promise of integrating the arts into therapy for age-related disabilities.\n\nDance and movement have been shown to help older people avoid falls. Acting sessions can strengthen the sense of social ties and community, a critical need for people whose cognitive impairment can lead to isolation. Interventions using everything from drum circles to poetry have been shown to improve psychological symptoms, such as aggression, in patients with cognitive impairment.\n\nMusic has been found to have a particularly strong effect on cognitive function. Research has shown that musical training can help older people distinguish speech better, particularly amid background noise. People recovering from brain injuries, such as a stroke, have been shown to sing words and phrases that they might not otherwise be able to speak.\n\nPerforming music also relies heavily on memory and understanding of visual and sound patterns. For these reasons, people with musical training may weather the effects of aging better than non-musicians.\n\n\u201cBut outside of these things is sheer joy,\u201d said Gary Glazner, founder and executive director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Poetry Project. Glazner said he was working at an adult day-care center in Northern California and searching for ways to connect with people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease when he discovered the power of poetry to reach people with cognitive impairment.\n\nHaving studied poetry in college, Glazner shared Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s poem \u201cThe Arrow and The Song\u201d with a resident and from the first line \u2014 \u201cI shot an arrow\u201d \u2014 hit the mark. Glazner uses poetry, particularly beloved classics learned by older adults, in call-and-response with older people and guides them in writing poems.\n\nJump-rope rhymes, even military cadences, can evoke responses from people with cognitive impairment that engage them, he said.\n\nHolly Matto, a professor of social work at GMU who is conducting the experiment at Birmingham Green, said people with cognitive impairment often feel overwhelmed by their inability to process and integrate information from their surroundings. Using the arts, particularly nonverbal arts such as painting and music, can help restore a sense of organizing their world.\n\n\u201cThose nonverbal ways of communicating are not impaired,\u201d she said.\n\nINSTEAD OF MEDS\n\nHer 18-month study, supported in part by a $25,000 grant from the NEA, involves taking groups of 10 randomly assigned people and engaging them in twice-weekly sessions using music, imagery and movement. There is also a control group.\n\nThose who participate in the study are invited to choose music for the group to listen to and then let their imaginations and memories roam. They also use painting to express what they feel in the music. And they are invited to dance. Study guidelines forbid observing the study itself, but a reporter was allowed to observe other art programs at the center.\n\n\u201cThe hypothesis is that after folks participate in this study, the people will show an improvement in mood and possibly a change in cognitive function,\u201d Matto said. She said the study subjects and control group are to be evaluated before and after the sessions begin using accepted clinical tools, such as the Profile of Mood States, cognitive assessments and the Geriatric Depression Scale, to evaluate whether the sessions have any lasting impact on the subjects\u2019 mood or well-being.\n\n\u201cIt makes me happy,\u201d said Felter, who had been rocking to the Beatles from her wheelchair. She said the music helps her adjust to the stresses of living in a communal setting.\n\nKathryn Dodd, 65, who lived in Ashburn, Va., before moving to Birmingham Green, said listening to tunes by James Taylor and Mary J. Blige allowed her mind to wander to pleasant memories from years ago.\n\n\u201cMusic brings memories. I basically try to remember the good times \u2014 I don\u2019t like to dwell on the bad times \u2014 and music brings those out,\u201d Dodd said. \u201cI got a lot out of it.\u201d\n\nAll over Birmingham Green are visual reminders of the relief art can bring.\n\nGeorge Moseley, 70, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, said his love of painting vivid murals of flowers, birds and landscapes \u2014 all showing the influence of Thomas Hart Benton and years of formal training at the Corcoran School of Art \u2014 has been instrumental in helping manage a lifelong cognitive disability, instead of medication. He describes his art in almost religious terms, saying the activity delivers him from the bondage of his condition.\n\n\u201cIt helps me to manage and cope, to have a positive attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThe paintbrush and the art give me an outlook and a feeling of serenity and peace, love, and joy. The paintbrush is the treatment for all else that has failed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/20141229-AMX-ALZHEIMERS291.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "But music, art and dance sessions like these are also the subject of intensifying interest among the scientific community.\nIyengar said research into the effect of art on people with cognitive impairments has suffered from a lack of rigor.\nUsing the arts, particularly nonverbal arts such as painting and music, can help restore a sense of organizing their world.\nStudy guidelines forbid observing the study itself, but a reporter was allowed to observe other art programs at the center.\nHe describes his art in almost religious terms, saying the activity delivers him from the bondage of his condition."}
