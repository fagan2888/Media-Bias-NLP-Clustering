Philadelphia police say they found a woman dead from multiple stab wounds in the parking lot of the Wells Lamont glove factory shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday. Police are not yet releasing her name, but she is described as a 29-year-old female.

Chief Grant Myers says investigators searched a residence on Kelley Street nearby. That search leads police to believe that the crime was committed at that home sometime during the night, and the body was moved to the parking lot later.

Chief Myers says police are now working a few leads, but they're asking anyone with more information to call CrimeStoppers at 855-485-tips. You can remain anonymous and any tip you give that leads to an arrest, could earn you a cash reward.
