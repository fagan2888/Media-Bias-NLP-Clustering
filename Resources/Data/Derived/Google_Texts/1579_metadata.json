I\u2019ve always been drawn to the absurd, the surreal and the nightmarish in art and music, and had been obsessed with Pavement and Sparklehorse since 2003. That spring I must\u2019ve been expounding on those bands at length because, on a drive to Boston with someone I can\u2019t quite remember now, \u201cAeroplane\u201d was presented to me as the inevitable next step on the path I claimed to be on, which it absolutely was.\n\nThe first listen suffused me with the certainty that there\u2019d never been a time when I had existed and those songs had not. Along with a few others from around that time \u2013 \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d \u201cLight in August,\u201d \u201cYankee Hotel Foxtrot,\u201d \u201cThe Wind-up Bird Chronicle\u201d \u2013 the album became one of the founding documents of my life. My tendency to impute religious power to works of art I love has mellowed as I\u2019ve moved through my twenties, but the teenage awe I feel for \u201cAeroplane\u201d is more than nostalgia and I think it always will be.\n\nMore so than anything else I can point to, the album holds the power of genuine mythology. It\u2019s not just mythic in scope, theme and reputation; it feels like a body of mythic experience, animated by some original energy from before the Common Era. Whoever or whatever authored the album feels as remote in time and space as the Big Bang, and as omnipresent. I file the fact that it was actually released in 1998 by a guy from Louisiana under the category of things I don\u2019t want to and don\u2019t know how to think about.\n\nI feel the same way now as then, or I did until last month, when I went to see that guy perform those songs in Brooklyn. To see him onstage \u2013 brought physically into the world in front of thousands of people he helped to define \u2013 was both elating and harrowing, proof that the primordial texts of the world are not yet fixed in the past, and that the diffuse psychic materials that make me who I am can in one night be recalled to their point of origin.\n\n*\n\nIn the first years after that drive to Boston, my worship grew as I listened to the album over and over, on my first iPod, peaking freshman year of college when I got heavily into animation and spent time alone in the studio on a scale I never had before, listening to the album probably 15 times a night, seven nights a week, for a chunk of months.\n\nThe next year, 2008, it finally hit me how staggeringly popular the album was within my increasingly well-defined demographic. Na\u00efve as it seems in retrospect, at the time I was appalled to face this reality, like that of a cheating lover, as though the intimacy of my connection to the songs were so intense there should\u2019ve been no way in for anyone else.\n\nAs my sense of belonging to this demographic became more constricting, I grew ashamed of it. The word \u201chipster\u201d entered the parlance. It got to where all I could picture was 30 people standing on a huge table and freaking out when the opening drum crash of \u201cHolland, 1945\u201d came on during a party thrown by the campus\u2019 cautiously debauched literary magazine. Through a kind of paranoid fusion, my reasons for no longer going to those parties and for no longer listening to the album became one and the same.\n\n*\n\nI shelved it until, at a Brooklyn-esque coffee shop in Cambridge in 2012, I was at the register when \u201cKing of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1\u201d came over the soundsystem, for probably the tenth time that day. Seized by an unexpectedly confrontational impulse, I asked the barista, \u201cOh, this sounds nice, what is it?\u201d\n\nHis face went deadly white and his jaw dropped in slo-mo, his eyes widening to take in the full enormity of my breach. The girl at the espresso machine had to reset him with a nudge.\n\nInforming his shock and disgust was, I think, a sense of generational obligation: All of us of a certain type have, or feel we have, a duty to keep Jeff Mangum alive during his long absence; we are all self-elected custodians of his vision. I presented myself in that coffee shop as a weak link, a nonbeliever. Just as the album\u2019s narrator feels for Anne Frank, the barista must\u2019ve felt that Neutral Milk Hotel would drift out of being for good without his emotional and historical vigilance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Could my obsessive love for a musician withstand finally seeing him perform live, surrounded by other fans like me?", "author": "David Rice", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Could my obsessive love for a musician withstand finally seeing him perform live, surrounded by other fans like me?", "title": "You ruined Neutral Milk Hotel: Nostalgia, millennials and the return of Jeff Mangum", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/you_ruined_neutral_milk_hotel_nostalgia_millennials_and_the_return_of_jeff_mangum/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neutral_milk_hotel2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Could my obsessive love for a musician withstand finally seeing him perform live, surrounded by other fans like me?", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neutral_milk_hotel2.jpg", "title": "You ruined Neutral Milk Hotel: Nostalgia, millennials and the return of Jeff Mangum", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "You ruined Neutral Milk Hotel: Nostalgia, millennials and the return of Jeff Mangum", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cool culture, Jeff Mangum, Music, Neutral Milk Hotel, Pavement, Sparklehorse, Wilco", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0a2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: cool culture, Jeff Mangum, Music, Neutral Milk Hotel, Pavement, Sparklehorse, Wilco, Innovation News, Entertainment NewsI discovered Neutral Milk Hotel\u2019s \u201cIn The Aeroplane Over the Sea\u201d in the spring of 2004, my junior year of high school.\nWhoever or whatever authored the album feels as remote in time and space as the Big Bang, and as omnipresent.\nJust as the album\u2019s narrator feels for Anne Frank, the barista must\u2019ve felt that Neutral Milk Hotel would drift out of being for good without his emotional and historical vigilance.\nThe first listen suffused me with the certainty that there\u2019d never been a time when I had existed and those songs had not.\nMore so than anything else I can point to, the album holds the power of genuine mythology."}
