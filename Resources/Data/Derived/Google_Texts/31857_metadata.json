Saturday, they got one when a family member found Tasha Brown-Williams\u2019s shoe in the woods.\n\n\"He looked at the path of the trees and he didn't think the area had been searched too much and he decided to try over there and found them.\"\n\nBoth bodies were found thanks to the family\u2019s tireless efforts.\n\n\u201cWe just got to pick up the pieces and go on and pray,\u201d said Brown-Williams\u2019 uncle Charlie Brown.\n\nBrown said he rushed to County Church Road Saturday after hearing his niece\u2019s body was found.\n\n\"That was my niece and she loved me to death,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\"There's nothing left of my house.

They ran, got into a truck and that truck was later pinned against a tree.\n\n\"The glass coming out and all the branches and stuff coming through the truck, it was scary,\" McKay said.\"It was beyond scary.\"\n\nJust next door to McKay, a mother and her 5-year-old daughter stood looking at what was left of their home.\n\n\"She's still upset, saying 'well momma, what we gonna get for Christmas.' I said, 'well we still gonna be okay,\" Kenya Williams, neighbor said. \"We're here. That's a Christmas gift enough in itself.\"\n\nWilliams was not home at the time but her legally blind father was at home. She said he went by sound to find the safest place to get during the storm.
