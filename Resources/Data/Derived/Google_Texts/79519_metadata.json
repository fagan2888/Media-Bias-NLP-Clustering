Think vintage-style advertising and artwork, lunch-counter dishware, camping motifs, midcentury surf culture. Old bakeries, drive-ins, roadhouses, garages, beach shacks. It\u2019s the kind of retro, outdoorsy charm to be found in the production design of Wes Anderson films like \u201cMoonrise Kingdom.\u201d\n\nOnline retailer Fab has jumped on the trend, with offerings like Roo Kee Roo\u2019s retro-style prints of boating and cottage motifs, made by Forest and Michael Evashevski, who grew up in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Beach towels printed with patterns from famed blanket-maker Pendleton have a vintage vibe, and would work in a bathroom as well as at the shore. And a campfire-ready collection of enamelware from Falcon includes a red teapot and serveware (fab.com).\n\nGrace Feyock\u2019s wall clock for Uttermost is made of vintage pictures of old license plates. A map made of license-plate images makes bold, graphic wall art, by David Bowman. A set of coasters printed with images of the famous Route 66 road sign make a nice addition to the cocktail cart (wayfair.com ).\n\nMartin Yeele\u2019s photographs of vintage motel and diner signage add style to serving trays from Bob\u2019s Your Uncle (bobsyouruncle.com )\n\nAt Modcloth, find Karma Living\u2019s collection of curtains and pillows in cheerful, \u201970s-style medallion and floral prints in colorful hues. A blue, purple and pink psychedelic-print tapestry looks hip and new, but boomers will remember similar icons from their college days. Also here, a little chrome table lamp styled like a vintage motorbike\u2019s headlight (modcloth.com )\n\nMagical Thinking\u2019s wooden letters are embellished with henna-inspired painting at Urban Outfitters, which also carries groovy cotton bedding in paisleys and other retro prints (urbanoutfitters.com).\n\nRetro-surfer d\u00e9cor is available at several retailers. CB2 has launched a new collection that includes surfboards, canoe paddles, chairs and other accessories. The Hula lamp brings a bit of kitsch to the design forefront. Tiki motif glassware, surfboards and Bodhi vase planters kick up the midcentury Cali vibe (cb2.com). Or find fun reproductions of surf shop and beach signs at Retroplanet (retroplanet.com).\n\n\u201cMoonrise Kingdom\u201d fans, consider prints by artist Leah Flores of Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cI had a gypsy-esque childhood growing up in various national parks around the United States,\u201d she says. \u201cSurrounded by mountains, oceans, wildflowers and redwood forests, I developed a sense of wonder with the natural world early on.\u201d\n\nFlores takes photographs of rugged roads, rivers, waves crashing on beaches and misty forests, and then adds an inspired word or phrase, such as \u201cNever Stop Exploring,\u201d \u201cLife is a Great Adventure\u201d or \u201cWanderlust.\u201d She sells through Urban Outfitters, Society 6 and her own Etsy shop at etsy.com/shop/leahfloresdesigns.\n\nThe trick is to not let this look get too kitschy, unless you want to. A few elements in an otherwise contemporary space pack design punch.\n\nBut if your style\u2019s more boho than Bauhaus, then layering textiles, art and accent items creates a comfortable, lived-in look that captures the charm of retro style.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Retro d\u00e9cor means surf\u2019s up and the road is open at your house", "title": "Retro d\u00e9cor means surf\u2019s up and the road is open at your house", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/retro-dcor-means-surfs-up-and-the-road-is-open-at-your-house/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140614_C3_FE14AHRETROp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140614_C3_FE14AHRETROp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T16:38:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:55:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a89\"", "article_summary": "But if your style\u2019s more boho than Bauhaus, then layering textiles, art and accent items creates a comfortable, lived-in look that captures the charm of retro style.\nIf you spent childhood summers on a Northern lake, grew up lunching at diners and shake shacks, or took a college road trip, you\u2019ll be all over the next big home d\u00e9cor trend: American Retro.\nAnd even if you didn\u2019t, you may appreciate the look and feel \u2014 an easygoing, aspirational lifestyle centered more on the meandering road than the techno highway.\nA set of coasters printed with images of the famous Route 66 road sign make a nice addition to the cocktail cart (wayfair.com ).\nA blue, purple and pink psychedelic-print tapestry looks hip and new, but boomers will remember similar icons from their college days."}
