But unlike roughly half of those states, Georgia is not able to process applicants into Medicaid and their children\u2019s insurance program.\n\nIn addition, the Peach State does not appear to be pursuing the option to process \u201cflat file\u201d applications of people deemed eligible, which five other states are doing.\n\nProponents of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that set up the insurance exchange, are critical of what they see as Georgia\u2019s inaction on this enrollment.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s creators expected the exchange would not only help people buy coverage, but also have a major side benefit: It would help identify and enroll people already eligible for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (known as PeachCare in Georgia).\n\nBut the difficulties in enrolling that group into those government programs have mirrored the technological problems that plagued the healthcare.gov website after its Oct. 1 debut.\n\nEven for the 18 states that are getting data more smoothly, it isn\u2019t an easy process. All those states are having to do much of the process manually, said Andrea Maresca, director of federal policy and strategy for the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\n\nThere are errors and problems in the files sent from the federal exchange to the states, especially in the applications that were sent in October and November, Maresca said.\n\n\u201cStates are still having to look for those defects in the data,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, federal officials are providing every state with so-called \u201cflat files\u201d on eligible people. These files are similar to Excel spreadsheets and provide basic information on eligible individuals. States, though, often have to follow up to fill in missing or incomplete information.\n\n\u201cWe strongly encourage all (federal exchange) states to consider enrolling eligible individuals based on the information now being shared with states,\u201d said Cindy Mann, director of the federal Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services in a recent information letter. \u201cThis will expedite enrollment for individuals and help states address workload issues.\u201d\n\nBut Georgia\u2019s Department of Community Health, in a January email to Atlanta-based NPR radio station WABE, said the state\u2019s information systems are not designed to accept a flat file. The work-around, spokeswoman Pam Keene wrote, is administratively inefficient and increases the risk of duplication.\n\nSomeone could receive benefits now, only to see them revoked later, Keene said.\n\nAccepting a flat file without state processing and validation would mean Georgia is ceding the authority to determine eligibility to the federal government, Keene said in the email. Georgia has taken the position that the state, not the federal exchange, \u201cshould evaluate and determine eligibility\u201d for Medicaid.\n\nCindy Zeldin of the consumer group Georgians for a Healthy Future is critical of what she sees as the state\u2019s go-slow approach. She noted that there are more than 200,000 uninsured children in Georgia, and most of them are eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare.\n\nGeorgia has the fourth-highest number of eligible but uninsured children in the nation, Zeldin said.\n\n\u201cThis represents a golden opportunity to dramatically improve our state\u2019s coverage rate for children and to accomplish that long-sought-after goal of finding and enrolling eligible kids into coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe encourage the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the state\u2019s Department of Community Health to work together to get these kids and their parents enrolled.\u201d\n\nStates that are running their own exchanges, meanwhile, are also experiencing problems in enrolling those deemed eligible for government coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d Maresca says. \u201cIn some states, the exchange and the state Medicaid agency systems are talking. For some, it\u2019s a manual process. It\u2019s not a seamless process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Local News, Features, Andy Miller", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2014-02-15/new-medicaid-peachcare-enrollment-stalled-georgia", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "description": "ATLANTA | More than 50,000 uninsured Georgians - many of them children - were noted as eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare coverage through the enrollment process for the health insurance exchange in a recent report.", "title": "New Medicaid, PeachCare enrollment stalled in Georgia"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcbd\"", "article_summary": "Georgia has taken the position that the state, not the federal exchange, \u201cshould evaluate and determine eligibility\u201d for Medicaid.\nGeorgia is one of 36 states using the federal insurance exchange.\nShe noted that there are more than 200,000 uninsured children in Georgia, and most of them are eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare.\nATLANTA | More than 50,000 uninsured Georgians \u2013 many of them children \u2013 were noted as eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare coverage through the enrollment process for the health insurance exchange in a recent report.\nBut unlike roughly half of those states, Georgia is not able to process applicants into Medicaid and their children\u2019s insurance program."}
