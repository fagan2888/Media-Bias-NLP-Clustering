WASHINGTON D.C. (CBS News) - World leaders wrapped up the nuclear security summit to discuss the threat of nuclear terrorism. President Obama said the ultimate goal is to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

President Obama said, “We didn't just come here to talk, but we came here to act.”

President Obama reported progress at the nuclear security summit, saying all 50 of the participating nations have enhanced security at their nuclear storage sites.

But the president urged leaders to protect some 2,000 tons of nuclear material around the world from terrorists. Pakistan is considered particularly vulnerable.

Obama said, "There is no doubt that if these mad men ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible."

The president also met with leaders who cobbled together the Iran nuclear deal.

Obama said, "This is a success of diplomacy that hopefully we'll be able to copy in the future."

But critics say the deal merely delays Iran’s nuclear progress - and doesn't end it for good.

North Korea also poses a possible nuclear threat according to Columbia professor Richard Betts:

Betts said, "It's isolated, economically weak and interested in finding sources of money and could miss calculate and sell a weapon. Not likely but not impossible.”

President Obama conceded more work needs to be done to deal with North Korea’s nuclear program.

President Obama said the U.S. released a public inventory of its supplies of highly enriched uranium, the material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Russia chose not to participate this year.
