On Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to a small group of Iowans at a "house party" event in Mason City. In this part of her speech Clinton talked about domestic issues such as the economy and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The video is from a livestream captured by Bloomberg's Jennifer Epstein on Periscope.



Clinton praised Obama for the "hard work" he's done on the economy, but lamented the "deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."



"We're not running yet but we are on our feet," Clinton said about the economy.



"The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, we know that, and so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it," Clinton also said.





HILLARY CLINTON: I'm so relieved that as I travel around the country and talk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. We're not running yet but we are on our feet. We can see the changes that are happening in people's life and can put them in a context as to where we go from here now as a country. I am very grateful to President Obama for the hard work [he's done on the economy]...



I know that although we have begun to move forward again, it is still hard to imagine exactly how we're going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead. Because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, we know that, and so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it.
