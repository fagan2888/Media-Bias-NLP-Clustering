The student, a 20-year-old psychology major named Jayce, filed his Title IX complaint in April. The department granted the school an exemption in May. What\u2019s happened since is revealing of the laws (and religious exemptions) that leave trans people vulnerable to discrimination, even when it is nominally banned and schools claim to be acting in good faith.\n\nThis month, George Fox implemented new regulations regarding housing for trans students. According the the policy, \u201cCommon residence halls are single-sex, defined anatomically.\u201d This means that students like Jayce, who began his transition more than a year ago but has not undergone transition-related surgeries, can still be denied equal access to housing. Jayce told the New York Times that he is interested in surgery, but can\u2019t afford it right now. This is a pretty common issue, particularly because insurance does not often cover transition-related care. (As Zack Ford at ThinkProgress recently noted, George Fox\u2019s student insurance policy does not cover such care.) The policy is equally discriminatory towards trans students who do not want to undergo transition-related surgeries, and believe \u2014 like the World Health Organization and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health \u2014 that surgery should not be a prerequisite for recognition.\n\nBut despite claims that it is just neutrally applying a housing policy, George Fox doesn\u2019t require the same anatomical scrutiny of all of its students, just out trans students. This is true across the culture. Anatomy \u2014 particularly genitalia \u2014 only becomes a topic for discussion when it comes to trans people trying to access basic facilities, like public restrooms and housing that corresponds to their gender identity. A spokesperson for the school told the Times that, \u201cFor 123 years, our housing policy has been to house students by their anatomy,\u201d but it\u2019s unlikely that administrators have spent the last century doing spot checks to get visual confirmation on a student\u2019s genitalia before handing them the keys to their dorm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Christian school has justified its anti-trans policies in its faith, but one of its student is fighting back", "title": "Transgender student on school\u2019s anti-trans policies: \u201cMy own tax dollars\u201d fund \u201cdiscrimination against me\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A Christian school has justified its anti-trans policies in its faith, but one of its student is fighting back", "title": "Transgender student on school\u2019s anti-trans policies: \u201cMy own tax dollars\u201d fund \u201cdiscrimination against me\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/25/transgender_student_on_schools_anti_trans_policies_my_own_tax_dollars_fund_discrimination_against_me/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/George_fox_university-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Christian school has justified its anti-trans policies in its faith, but one of its student is fighting back", "title": "Transgender student on school\u2019s anti-trans policies: \u201cMy own tax dollars\u201d fund \u201cdiscrimination against me\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/George_fox_university-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-lgbtq, anti-trans discrimination, housing discrimination, lgbtq rights, religious exemptions, sex discrimination, Title IX, Trans rights, transgender people", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc017\"", "article_summary": "But despite claims that it is just neutrally applying a housing policy, George Fox doesn\u2019t require the same anatomical scrutiny of all of its students, just out trans students.\nThis month, George Fox implemented new regulations regarding housing for trans students.\n(As Zack Ford at ThinkProgress recently noted, George Fox\u2019s student insurance policy does not cover such care.)\nThe student, a 20-year-old psychology major named Jayce, filed his Title IX complaint in April.\nJayce told the New York Times that he is interested in surgery, but can\u2019t afford it right now."}
