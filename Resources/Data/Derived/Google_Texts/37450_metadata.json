John Kasich, R-Ohio, was in the minority of his party. He was one in a field of many and was the butt of jokes within the media. Early on, it seemed he had as good of a chance to win as former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pennsylvania, or former technology executive Carly Fiorina.\n\nBut Feb. 9 changed that. Kasich pooled all of his resources in the hope of a strong finish in New Hampshire. There he finished second, breaking away from others contending for Republican establishment support. This finish and the momentum he will gain from New Hampshire are signs of promise in a previously bleak campaign, not to mention the campaign donations he will surely get from his strong performance.\n\nBut there is another reason Kasich has a chance. While Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, preach hate, wanting to wall us off from the rest of the world, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, preach about the great things going into more debt can do, Kasich\u2019s idea is a lot simpler, a lot more doable and a lot more American.\n\nHe wants us to slow down, to take a step back and reflect.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people in America who don\u2019t feel connected, they\u2019ve got victories that no one celebrates with them and they have defeats and pain that sometimes they have to absorb themselves,\u201d Kasich said in his speech after the New Hampshire primary. \u201cWe\u2019re all made to change this world, we\u2019re all made to be apart of the healing of this world and if we just slowed down we could help each other and build a community.\u201d\n\nIn a time when the country is polarizing and working together seems impossible, Kasich preaches togetherness. He wants to slow down and actually listen to the problems of every American. The 106 town halls he held in New Hampshire are evidence of his commitment to that ideology.\n\nInstead of reaching to government as the first option, he believes it should be the last resort. In his speech after New Hampshire, he explained the the need for people of this country to slow down. He said one should not rush out of their driveway, but talk to their neighbor; not rush out of the grocery store, but stop and hug your old friend you may see there. He believes our best times as a country are when we put aside our individualistic tendencies and work together.\n\nAnd though he believes government to be the last option, his compassion compels him to do anything to help those most in need, even if it means going against his own party.\n\nAs governor going around his state Legislature, Kasich expanded Medicaid using the Affordable Care Act. He was chastised by fellow Republicans and his own supporters. Instead of wasting an opportunity to help the worse off in his state, he acted in an American way, not a Republican way.\n\nWhat gives me hope in Kasich is his belief about gay rights.\n\n\u201cGuess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cBecause somebody doesn\u2019t think the way I do doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t care about them or can\u2019t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be [gay], of course I would love them and I would accept them.\u201d\n\nThat is a message of togetherness this country is built on. On Kasich\u2019s website, there is a quote from a past speech that reads, \u201cSome say the American Dream is over, that we can\u2019t recover, that the flame is beginning to flicker. That is wrong. We may have a crisis of spirit, but our strength endures and our strength comes from pulling together.\u201d\n\nAs an Independent, Trump\u2019s brashness pulls you in, Clinton\u2019s experience pulls you in and Sanders offering free everything makes you think. But Kasich stands alone as the candidate who can pull our nation together and be the shining example of positivity and community this country so desperately needs.\n\nLuke Schaetzel ([email protected] ) is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Badger Herald", "description": "As governor, he expanded Medicaid bridging political partisanship .", "title": "Trimming the field: Kasich preaches community, togetherness", "url": "https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2016/02/15/trimming-the-field-kasich-preaches-community-togetherness/", "image": "http://badgerherald.com/media/2016/02/24322168670_16e25b81dd_b.jpg", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Column", "published_time": "2016-02-15T06:15:02-0600", "modified_time": "2016-02-15T10:39:17-0600"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://badgerherald.com/media/2016/02/24322168670_16e25b81dd_b.jpg"}, "title": "Trimming the field: Kasich preaches community, togetherness", "site": "@badgerherald", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As governor, he expanded Medicaid bridging political partisanship ."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11"}, "article_summary": "Kasich pooled all of his resources in the hope of a strong finish in New Hampshire.\nAs governor going around his state Legislature, Kasich expanded Medicaid using the Affordable Care Act.\nBut Kasich stands alone as the candidate who can pull our nation together and be the shining example of positivity and community this country so desperately needs.\n\u201cGuess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay,\u201d Kasich said.\nIn his speech after New Hampshire, he explained the the need for people of this country to slow down."}
