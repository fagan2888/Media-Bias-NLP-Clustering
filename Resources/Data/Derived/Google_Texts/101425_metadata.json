The New York Times reported his saying, \u201cMr. President, this is a big [expletive] deal.\u201d The Atlantic referred to Biden\u2019s \u201caccidentally audible profanity\u201d and mentioned T-shirts sporting the slogan, \u201cHealth Reform Is a BFD.\u201d But the Huffington Post, The Guardian, Salon, and New York Magazine reported the gaffe exactly as uttered.\n\nWhere do we stand, these days, on obscenity in the news? The New Yorker\u2019s famed prudishness began to topple under the esteemed editorship of William Shawn, according to the longtime staff writer Calvin Trillin, who needed to quote a Nebraska farmer\u2019s anti-Semitic epithet in full to get the effect he needed. Though the reins quickly loosened under the editors Tina Brown and David Remnick, Trillin\u2019s quandary remains one that most obscenity-challenged media wrestle with. That is, you can expect your journalists not to lace their reports with vulgarities; you can reject fiction or poetry whose authors insist on using words you\u2019re uncomfortable with printing. But when the use of the obscenity is itself the news, the standards people at mainstream news outlets can get their panties in a twist.\n\nTom Kent, standards editor at the Associated Press, recently reaffirmed, \u201cWe use vulgar and obscene quotations only when we feel they\u2019re essential to telling a story.\u201d Such a simple and conservative guideline will presumably save proofreaders from the \u201cdisorienting\u201d experience of the New Yorker copy editor Mary Norris, who reported that \u201cit no longer occurs to me to query the use of four-letter words, even when they are used gratuitously,\u201d but who recommends a \u201cdetox facility\u201d for language checkers bombarded by the salty stuff.\n\nBut in a political season that promises to get lower and dirtier as the year wears on, the question of what to include or leave out \u2014 and how to leave it out \u2014 is bound to get vexing.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of editing vulgarities at all. The Awl\u2019s list of words creeping into The New Yorker\u2019s lexicon (I\u2019m leaning on The New Yorker here only because its standards have shifted so clearly over time) includes many that people like me might see as explicit but hardly obscene. Anal, fart, penis, testicle, vagina \u2026 let\u2019s see if my editor needs to censor any of these. Meanwhile, it\u2019s clear that many, if not most, online news sources eschew the bleeping of so-called four-letter words for any reason other than the sort of targeted offensiveness that\u2019s represented by the so-called \u201cc\u201d word for female genitalia.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s the question of what to do with the deleted material. The New York Times prefers not to signal the word with hyphens or stars (f\u2014k, s**t), but rather to indicate that the party in question used a profanity. For instance, when the editor of The New Republic announced that he was \u201cready to break [insert four-letter word for poop here],\u201d the Times noted that he would \u201cbreak stuff \u2014 though he used a profanity,\u201d whereas The Boston Globe reported that he spoke of \u201cbreaking [expletive]\u201d and The Washington Post reported the same phrase as \u201cbreaking s\u2014.\u201d The beleaguered Mary Norris even reports on the difficulty of styling the euphemism: \u201cShall it be \u2018f\u2019-word, f word, f-word, \u2018F\u2019 word, F word, or F-word? I don\u2019t like any of them.\u201d When it came to writing about a breakout Broadway play a few years back, the Times took the rather embarrassing tack of listing it as \u201cThe ________ With the Hat.\u201d\n\nThird, there\u2019s the question of distinguishing one voice from another. A certain real-estate mogul running for president is prone to habits of language markedly different from the habits of a certain former secretary of state. When we hear the candidates on television, the sudden, high-pitched interruption of the bleep generally manages to preserve the speaker\u2019s idiom. But noting politely that a candidate used a profanity, or replacing it with a more acceptable word, can tend to flatten vocabulary in ways that may not serve the purpose of journalism.\n\nChange is afoot, just as surely as it was when profanities like damn, hell, or Christ could not be reprinted when used to blow off steam; or when jackass and scumbag were considered too vulgar to print. But if the juiciest of our obscenities are to retain any of their zest, news organizations are probably obliged to help us hold them in reserve. In a creative-writing class several years ago, one of my students wrote a sestina, a poem that calls for the same six words to alternately repeat themselves as the final words of the poem\u2019s lines. One of her six words was \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the same as Joe Biden\u2019s. I watched as she read the poem aloud, and the whole class sat stiff, waiting for the word to punch its way into the poem again. We agreed, after some discussion, that she was sacrificing her poem to the shock of a single Anglo-Saxon term. We were, like Mary Norris, debilitated, suffering from a sort of profanity overdose that I would like \u2014 if only the standards editor would let me \u2014 to call f***tigue.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.6.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02df\"", "article_summary": "The New York Times reported his saying, \u201cMr.\nWe were, like Mary Norris, debilitated, suffering from a sort of profanity overdose that I would like \u2014 if only the standards editor would let me \u2014 to call f***tigue.\nA certain real-estate mogul running for president is prone to habits of language markedly different from the habits of a certain former secretary of state.\nWe agreed, after some discussion, that she was sacrificing her poem to the shock of a single Anglo-Saxon term.\nThe New York Times prefers not to signal the word with hyphens or stars (f\u2014k, s**t), but rather to indicate that the party in question used a profanity."}
