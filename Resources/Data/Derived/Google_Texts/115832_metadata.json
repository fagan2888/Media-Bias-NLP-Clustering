Chris Christie would bother to run for president.\n\nBut as Alec MacGillis laid out in his masterful profile of the man from early last year, there\u2019s always been a short-sighted, mindless quality to Christie\u2019s ambition. So despite the fact the level of enthusiasm for a Christie presidential campaign is about as low as his average rank among the GOP\u2019s many contenders, it looks very much like Christie 2016 is in America\u2019s near-future. And if the planned remarks on mass surveillance Christie released to the press on Monday are any guide, it\u2019s going to be a long slog before his inevitable defeat.\n\nAs Christie\u2019s advisors \u2014 the ones not dealing with federal indictments, I mean \u2014 are happy to tell any reporter willing to listen, the New Jersey governor is basically putting all of his campaign eggs in the New Hampshire primary basket. The idea is that Christie\u2019s signature format, the town hall, is especially well-suited for the small towns and cantons of the Granite State. There\u2019s also an ill-defined theory that Christie\u2019s previous and minor transgressions against orthodox conservatism won\u2019t cost him nearly as much in the New Hampshire primary as they will in the Iowa caucuses. (Unmentioned: The fact that it\u2019s been more than a decade since Sen. John McCain first won in New Hampshire.)\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, therefore, that Christie chose New Hampshire as the venue for what will almost certainly be the most significant speech on national security he\u2019s delivered in his relatively short and Garden State-focused political career. And the gist of his remarks will also be familiar \u2014 at least to those who remember how the governor handled himself while arguing with Sen. Rand Paul during the summer of 2013. Back then, Paul raised some reasonable and relatively mild concerns about the National Security Agency (NSA) and its habit of warrantless bulk surveillance. Christie responded with, as Vice President Joe Biden once said, \u201ca noun, a verb and 9/11.\u201d\n\nIf Christie\u2019s speech is any guide, that\u2019s a strategy he is going to hew to in 2016. Except, this time, he\u2019s throwing in Edward Snowden \u2014 that would be the noun, for those of you keeping score \u2014 in order to keep his waving of the bloody shirt contemporary and fresh. \u201cWhen it comes to fighting terrorism, our government is not the enemy,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t listen to people like Edward Snowden, a criminal who hurt our country and now enjoys the hospitality of President Putin \u2014 while sending us messages about the dangers of authoritarian government.\u201d That zinger about pallin\u2019 around with Putin is an old saw and to be expected; but Christie didn\u2019t mention that a federal court recently declared Snowden\u2019s analysis of bulk surveillance essentially correct.\n\nThe pale, bespectacled, awkward and geeky Snowden is a good foil for Christie; I can already picture reporters trying to explain reddit to septuagenarian New Hampshire conservatives, their faces turning red with rage and incomprehension. But because Christie is never one to take a risk by overestimating his audience\u2019s intelligence, he\u2019s also going to throw a more tried-and-true conservative bogeyman into his national security analysis. You see, it\u2019s not just Snowden we have to blame; it\u2019s those godless, America-hating fat cats in Hollywood, too. The reason people are so needlessly worried about the NSA, Christie argued, is because Hollywood has \u201cmade our intelligence agencies the villains in practically every movie from the last 25 years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP guv thinks 9/11 fear-mongering and blasting Edward Snowden will revive his 2016 chances.
