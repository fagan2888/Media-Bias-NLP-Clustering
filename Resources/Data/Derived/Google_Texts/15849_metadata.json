Craig\u2019s specializes in all-natural gourmet seafood products using New England recipes and already offers various Maine seafood products. Terms of the pending deal were not disclosed.\n\nCraig Rief, president of the New Hampshire company, and Alan Furth, executive director of the learning center, appeared before the Washington County Commission on Thursday as Furth sought to modify terms of county financing which the company obtained earlier through the Tax Increment Financing program. The TIF program, administered by the Sunrise County Economic Council, provides grants and loans to help start or expand businesses in the unorganized territory.\n\nThe commission voted 3-0 to approve the request, but its approval includes language that would require the financing to be revisited if the Cobscook Bay Co. processing plant is moved outside the designated territory.\n\nFurth indicated the company\u2019s production plant, which employed about 10 workers in early 2011, would remain at its current location.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention of moving that plant at this point,\u201d he told the commission.\n\nThe plant began operation in the fall of 2010. The frozen pies \u2014 shrimp, lobster, scallop and crab \u2014 are sold under the Maine Fresh label and have been available in grocery stores across North America. Jeff Johnson and John Phinney are minority shareholders of the Cobscook Bay Co. along with 20 private equity investors including the Cobscook Bay Learning Center, which receives a 25 percent share of the profits.\n\nCraig\u2019s All Natural is dedicated to continuing production in the region, said Furth, and the New Hampshire company also is committed to continuing to pay royalties to the learning center.\n\nThe acquisition will benefit the business, said Furth, who told the commission the company was \u201cout of gas\u201d and was seeking investors.\n\n\u201cTo me, it just adds horsepower that we didn\u2019t have,\u201d he told the panel.\n\nRief indicated his company, which has been in business since 2006, will be able to effectively expand the market reach and sell the line of frozen seafood pies.\n\n\u201cThis is what we do,\u201d he told the commission. \u201cWe know how to do it. \u2026 [The pie line is] very complimentary to what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a win,\u201d said Commissioner Chris Gardner about Cobscook Bay Co. succeeding in attracting private investment. \u201cThis is exactly the way this system should work.\u201d\n\nHe called the pending acquisition \u201ca very natural hand-off.\u201d\n\nCraig\u2019s All Natural provides gourmet seafood products using all natural, chemical free ingredients, according to the company\u2019s website. Ingredients come from local farms and fisheries. The company also says it is committed to sustainable natural resources, marine stewardship, and \u201cthe best environmental practices for keeping our oceans healthy.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s product line, available in Whole Foods Markets nationwide and other retailers, includes several Maine lobster products, such as bisque and chowder and lobster tails, as well as New England clam chowder, Florida spiny lobster tails and other foods.\n\nCraig\u2019s All Natural has facilities in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New Brunswick, Canada.\n\n\u201cThis is, in every way, a success story,\u201d Furth said in a news release issued by the learning center on Friday. \u201cOur goal from the beginning was to build a business that would grow the local economy, create jobs that pay a living wage to local residents, to create a market for local fisheries, and to support the learning center. This development achieves all of those goals in ways beyond what we could do without this acquisition. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Maine Fresh seafood pies are a perfect complement to our expansive line of seafood products and will benefit immensely from our national sales and distribution infrastructure,\u201d said Rief in the learning center\u2019s news release. \u201cCraig\u2019s All Natural is committed to keeping and growing this business right here in Washington County [and to supporting the learning center],\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MACHIAS, Maine \u2014 A New Hampshire company will acquire Cobscook Bay Co., which makes all-natural seafood pies, officials for both businesses disclosed Thursday.Craig\u2019s All Natural, based in Durham, N.H., will buy a majority interest in the Trescott seafood business, which is affiliated with the Cobscook Community Learning Center.
