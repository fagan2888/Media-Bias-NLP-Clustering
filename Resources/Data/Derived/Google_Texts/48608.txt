According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, 10 states and the District of Columbia are now issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants.

California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont, and Washington, as well as Washington, D.C., are all on the list and are estimated to have an illegal immigrant population of 4,120,000 combined.

It’s reported that 37 percent of America’s illegal immigrants live in an area where they can obtain a driver’s license.

According to The Washington Free Beacon:

“The number of potential applicants affects staffing and facility needs, license processing and issuance, and expected costs and revenue,” states Pew. “The cost of new personnel was the largest anticipated expense.” The report found that California, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland, Colorado, Nevada, and the District of Columbia created an additional 1,039 positions because of the policy.

Since illegal immigrants are undocumented, the question of fraud comes into play. Updating computers for this new system is also an added cost.

Breitbart reported:

California projected a need for 822 new limited-term positions, Illinois hired 100 more people, Connecticut made plans for 18 hires, Maryland 55 hires, Colorado over 17 hires, the District of Columbia three hires, and Nevada expected 14 more employees.

Despite an April YouGov/Huffington Post poll that found 64 percent of American oppose giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, states are still pushing forward with legislation.
