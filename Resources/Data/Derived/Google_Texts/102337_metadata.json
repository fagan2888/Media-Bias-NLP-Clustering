And Why\n\nThe new book \u201cMissing Microbes\u201d posits that our rampant overuse of antibiotics is not just creating antibiotic-resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d; it is contributing to many of our modern maladies, particularly those affecting children: asthma, allergies, diabetes, obesity.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea that has lately been gaining attention and adherents. But you\u2019re especially likely to pay attention and be persuaded when you\u2019re hearing about it from a leading authority on the microbial \u201cecologies\u201d in our bodies that are damaged by antibiotics: Dr. Martin Blaser, director of the Human Microbiome Program at New York University. Dr. Blaser, who wrote \u201cMissing Microbes,\u201d is in town for a microbiology conference and will be on Radio Boston this afternoon. Our conversation, lightly edited:\n\nAs you write, antibiotics are prescribed at incredibly high rates in this country. That\u2019s the big picture, and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a problem, but what\u2019s the pragmatic translation? The small picture is something more like a baby who\u2019s been screaming for days and a scared parent who needs to know, just how hard should we resist antibiotics, and in what situations?\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re starting with perhaps the most difficult question. But you see, in the United States, in order to get antibiotics, you need a prescription. And that means it\u2019s really up to the doctor. And because everyone has thought that antibiotics are \u2018free,\u2019 there has been a tendency by both doctors and parents to over-prescribe them and to over-want them. But once you start assigning a cost to them, then the situation changes. And so for parents, I advise them that when their child is sufficiently sick, that they should seek medical attention, and they should try to ensure that the doctor \u2014 and that\u2019s shorthand for doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician\u2019s assistant \u2014 that the doctor do a careful exam. And then if the doctor says your child does not need an antibiotic, that parent should be relieved. Not thinking, \u2018Why is my child deprived?\u2019\n\nBut isn\u2019t it so often unclear whether antibiotics are actually needed?\n\n\n\nIt is unclear, and in fact we know that most of the upper respiratory and ear infections that children have are caused by viruses that don\u2019t even respond to antibiotics. As I write in my book, in the U.S. in 2010, there were 258 million courses of antibiotics prescribed. That\u2019s five courses for every six people. So point number one is that that\u2019s a lot. Point number two is that there\u2019s enormous regional variation \u2014 variation that cannot be explained based on variation in the prevalence of different bacterial infections. So that means that it\u2019s a function of how medicine is practiced. And the practice of medicine involves both the doctors and the patients. Both are parties. And what I point out is that in Sweden, where the people are at least as healthy as we are, at every age they\u2019re using 40 percent of the antibiotics that we\u2019re using. And that means, across the board, that 60 percent of the antibiotics are unnecessary. And that\u2019s at every age, not just in childhood \u2013though it\u2019s especially important in childhood at every age.\n\nThough we are making some progress, aren\u2019t we? The CDC said last week that antibiotic prescriptions for cold symptoms dropped 39 percent between 1996 and 2010.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s wonderful \u2014 that\u2019s what needs to be done. What doctors do has been based on antibiotics having no cost. Once you put cost in there, it\u2019s the difference between a free road and toll road.\n\nSome recent research has also found that when you take antibiotics, your own personal risk of developing bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics also goes up \u2014 so there\u2019s not just a societal downside, there\u2019s an individual one.\n\nThat\u2019s correct. A big part of the book is about how it\u2019s not just the community cost of resistance or the individual cost of resistance, both of which are well known, but it\u2019s the cost in terms of risk of disease, like obesity and diabetes and asthma, that we and others are linking to this early life change in the microbiome.\n\nThat idea seems to be really taking hold lately \u2014 what\u2019s happening?\n\nA lot of things are coming together. More and more investigators are finding that this is actually true.\n\nIs it also that we\u2019ve gotten better tools to explore the microbiome so there\u2019s more confidence?\n\n\n\nYes, and we\u2019re doing more epidemiologic observations in people, and animal experiments.\n\nProbiotics: in the book, you sound skeptical though not totally dismissive of them. A food scientist once told me that taking a probiotic was like putting a drop of something in a swimming pool. True?\n\n\n\nYes, though if the drop of something is chlorine, it has an effect. That\u2019s part of the issue, of course. But the main issue is that if you go to the grocery store, health food store, drug store, there are hundreds of things you can buy that are labeled \u2018probiotics,\u2019 and they\u2019re very diverse \u2014 and in fact, some of them may have the same bacteria but they have different labels. So that\u2019s the first thing: there\u2019s a proliferation of them and what I can say is that they\u2019re generally safe but they are almost completely untested for efficacy.\n\nSo caveat emptor \u2014 buyer beware.\n\nCaveat emptor always rules.\n\nSome aren\u2019t even refrigerated \u2014 is it even plausible they could work?\n\n\n\nSure. Some are dried. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s that they\u2019re hardly tested and so we don\u2019t really know what they do. And furthermore, you could argue that this is just an exercise in pure marketing. Right now, it\u2019s highly marketing-driven but I\u2019m hopeful that at some point in the future, it will have a scientific basis.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk of \u2018prebiotic\u2019 diets \u2014 for example, eating fermented foods.\n\n\n\nIf they worked they would be fine. But it\u2019s the same issue, do we know that they work? \u2018Prebiotics\u2019 is the foods that you eat to encourage the good bacteria that you either have inside you or the good bacteria that you want to take. And again, the idea that kimchi is one of those prebiotics \u2014 I don\u2019t know where that comes from. Kimchi is delicious, I love it, but that\u2019s a different issue. Prebiotics could be very specific sugars, or sorts of amino acids that particular bacteria like where you could favor one over the other, but do they work?\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t you know what works in the lab, and so could work in our guts?\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not sure yet exactly which bacteria we want to facilitate and which ones not. There are a lot of open questions.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating \u2014 the theory is so persuasive, but how do we bolster our microbiomes?\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re hoping that one day there will be products that permit this. In full disclosure, I\u2019m working as a scientific consultant for several companies that have this as a goal, and it\u2019s a very worthwhile goal but nobody\u2019s in the marketplace yet.\n\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, labor and delivery \u2014 you describe how that\u2019s a setting where the use of antibiotics is particularly heavy, and again the question arises: How hard to resist? How hard to resist a C-section, which appears to affect the baby\u2019s microbiome, and the common prophylactic antibiotics for the mother, and the antibiotic eye drops for the baby, and the rest?\n\nThat\u2019s an area where I and others are working on talking to doctors, because the average person doesn\u2019t have enough information to make that kind of decision. That\u2019s a medical decision, of balancing benefit and risk, and there are many cases where it\u2019s critically important to use antibiotics. So in no way do I think that shouldn\u2019t be the case, but there are a lot of slippery slopes, where somebody has minor symptoms and people have thought, \u2018Because antibiotics have no cost, we\u2019re better off treating them.\u2019 But if antibiotics do have a cost, then maybe net-net you come out behind.\n\nFor example, you point out that every American baby is given antibiotic eyedrops against possible blindness caused by gonorrhea, which is actually a very rare prospect.\n\n\n\nThe question is, what\u2019s the net benefit of treating 4 million babies a year with eyedrops? How many cases of blindness are we preventing? And if it\u2019s a handful, which it probably is, can\u2019t we come up with a better strategy?\n\nAnd if there\u2019s a cost to the drops?\n\nIf you think there\u2019s no cost then why not do it? And the answer is, we don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s a cost or not. I\u2019m hoping to study that with some colleagues.\n\nYou also write about this very interesting idea of using gauze to swipe the vaginas of mothers who\u2019ve delivered by C-section and then transfer some of that bacteria to the baby. Where\u2019s that at, is it still totally experimental?\n\n\n\nYes, it\u2019s completely experimental. Actually, my wife is speaking about it at the Boston meeting of the American Society for Microbiology that I\u2019m attending.\n\nSo it\u2019s not something a pregnant woman should think about?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not giving medical advice here; I\u2019m reporting on the field, and this is a work in progress. But the concept of restoring what is missing because of C-sections is attractive.\n\nOne other topic: In the book, you use the term estrobolome, which I had never heard before, referring to how a woman\u2019s microbiome may affect her estrogen, her hormones. Could you explain?\n\n\n\nEstrogen is important to every woman at essentially every age, and there\u2019s a certain metabolism of estrogen: the ovaries produce estrogen and it circulates in the blood, it goes to the liver, and then the liver modifies estrogen, it \u2018conjugates\u2019 it, and now the conjugated estrogen goes out in the bile and it goes into the intestine. And if it stays conjugated, basically it\u2019s excreted. But if it meets bacteria that have an enzyme that conjugates it, then it can be re-absorbed. So whether or not it meets such a bacterium determines its fate. And so our hypothesis is that that has a bearing on estrogen metabolism and there is data in the literature that supports it. And we think this is something that\u2019s potentially modifiable; for example, certain cancers are driven by estrogen. It could also have to do with issues of menopause. There are many potential ways it could be modified if we had better scientific knowledge.\n\nBack to food: I assume you\u2019d advise that we buy antibiotic-free meats. But you also write that antibiotics are found just about everywhere \u2014 in milk, in water\u2026\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not quite everywhere. It\u2019s not in the air, and it\u2019s in food because of the industrial use of antibiotics in agriculture.\n\nYes, buy antibiotic-free food but also lobby your congressman to get antibiotics out of the food supply, because they have many effects. That\u2019s the most important thing we can do, because there\u2019s lots of obfuscation and it\u2019s been known for decades that it\u2019s bad in that it develops antibiotic resistance, but millions or tens of millions of people every day are being exposed to trace levels of antibiotics in their meat, children in their milk, people in drinking water, and we don\u2019t really know what the consequences are. Maybe they\u2019re trivial but maybe they\u2019re cumulatively very important.\n\nYou write in the book about experiments linking antibiotics to fatter mice. To what extent do you think we can attribute the obesity epidemic to early courses of antibiotics?\n\n\n\nIn my heart of hearts, I think it\u2019s quite important. Remember, that\u2019s why farmers are giving antibiotics to their farm animals, to fatten them up, to promote their growth. You know why they do it? Because it works.\n\nReaders, any burning questions for Dr. Blaser?
