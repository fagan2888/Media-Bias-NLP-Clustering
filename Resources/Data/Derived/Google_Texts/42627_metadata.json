Ryan Matthew Addison was gunned down Aug. 11 in the Bellevue neighborhood in Southwest shortly after walking a woman home from his apartment.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know who shot him. He was walking a young lady home after a date. He said goodbye. He wasn\u2019t but a couple of feet away from where she lived and they shot him up,\u201d Mrs. Addison-Herbert said of what detectives told her about her son\u2019s death.\n\nThree types of bullets were recovered from the scene, she said, suggesting three gunmen opened fire on a 29-year-old man who had no arrest record and planned to start a job as a special police officer this month.\n\nMr. Addison was the 91st homicide victim in the District this year. That the killings have only continued \u2014 a woman shot Friday afternoon by a relative was confirmed as the 99th homicide victim, two men were gunned down early Saturday in separate shootings, and a man was stabbed to death Sunday afternoon \u2014 boggles the mind of his 59-year-old mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so confused,\u201d said Mrs. Addison-Herbert, who is planning to lay her son to rest Wednesday. \u201cWhy is the world coming to this?\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the District reported a record low 88 homicides. It was the first time in four decades that slayings in the city \u2014 once known as the \u201cmurder capital\u201d \u2014 had dipped that low and the only year during Chief Cathy L. Lanier\u2019s eight years at the helm of the Metropolitan Police Department when she could boast that the city had fewer than 100 homicides.\n\nHomicide totals since 2012 seem to suggest that the record low was an anomaly rather than a new normal.\n\nIn the past, police have blamed rising homicide numbers on an uptick in domestic violence fatalities or in 2013 on the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard that left 12 people dead, but the frequency of killings this year has flummoxed law enforcement.\n\nThe Major Cities Chiefs Police Association convened in the District this month so law enforcement officials could try to develop solutions to deal with rising crime across the country. The association reported that among 35 big cities, homicides were up an average of 19 percent this year and 62 percent of cities had increases in nonfatal shootings.\n\nOver the past two months, Chief Lanier and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser have struggled to offer explanations for the rising homicides. They suggested that synthetic drugs were to blame after an American University graduate was stabbed to death on a Metro train by an 18-year-old man who reportedly was high. The chief later pointed to an uptick in random disputes over such things as dice games or arguments that turned violent, an increase in the use of high-capacity firearms on the streets and the release from custody of repeat violent offenders.\n\n\u201cThe motives of what\u2019s happening in the past several weeks are varied,\u201d Chief Lanier said last week. \u201cBut one of the common things that we are seeing: too many guns in too many homes.\u201d\n\n\u2018A sense of randomness\u2019\n\nResidents have become frustrated by the inconsistent explanations. At a particularly heated meeting in Ward 7 last week, residents questioned whether police were providing an adequate response.\n\n\u201cThe only time they are coming around is when something negative is happening,\u201d said Beverly Smith, founder of Mommas Safe Haven, a nonprofit that operates programs for children in the ward. \u201cI have been a witness to many crimes in the community, and I know they come out fairly quickly. It\u2019s just that the only time we see them is when they are questioning us.\u201d\n\nOthers have grown tired of what they see as efforts to downplay concern by comparing homicide statistics to those from more than a decade ago, when homicides were far more frequent, or by noting that the city\u2019s overall crime rate, which includes violent and property crime, is down by about 1 percent this year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing the whole entire point of why the issue is being raised and the deep concern about public safety when we step outside our homes,\u201d Anthony Lorenzo Green, a Ward 8 neighborhood representative, wrote in a message to constituents on Facebook. \u201cOf course overall crime is down because property crime is down. But when people bring crime up, they\u2019re talking about violent crime, which has skyrocketed in our city.\u201d\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said he still believes the city is safe but acknowledged that an unclear message from the mayor hasn\u2019t assuaged fears.\n\n\u201cClearly, there\u2019s been an increase and there is a sense of randomness, which is unusual,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said. \u201cThe fact there have been evolving explanations is unsettling to many people.\u201d\n\nPolice presence\n\nBoth Ms. Bowser and Chief Lanier have responded with visibility, making near-daily appearances before the media at homicide scenes or community meetings.\n\nAt the Kennedy Recreation Center in the Shaw neighborhood Wednesday, they asked residents to step up their own involvement in crime prevention by announcing an increase in reward money available for tips that lead to seizures of illegal guns or arrests and convictions in shootings. Shaw has been the site of several recent homicides, including the death of a 23-year-old business analyst who was caught in the crossfire of a daytime shootout.\n\nPolice recently deployed a community engagement tent in the neighborhood as a way to step up officer visibility. But even as dozens of officers congregated there Friday to eat pizza provided by community members, just a few feet away a memorial shrine for a woman gunned down during a barbecue this summer provided a stark reminder of the violence.\n\nCharlie Bengel, an Advisory Neighborhood Commission member, attended the gathering to chat with officers. He previously complained about gunfire near the recreation center and advocated for better deployment of security cameras in the area, but said he had seen positive results from recent community meetings with officials.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been pleased in what the mayor has done in the last few days,\u201d said Mr. Bengel, noting the fixed police posts in the neighborhood. \u201cThe reality is, we\u2019ve not see the violence since they\u2019ve been here. You can walk down the street now.\u201d\n\nCommunity activists say the efforts to step up police visibility will help but the cycle of violence will continue without a long-term commitment to provide economic opportunities to residents or stem gang rivalries.\n\n\u201cThe community is frustrated because they feel the resources are not making it to the community,\u201d said Ron Moten, who for years ran the now-disbanded Peaceoholics organization, which worked to intervene in violent disputes. \u201cIt\u2019s at the point where we are going to do something or we go back to the days that nobody wants to talk about in D.C.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The onslaught of fatal shootings in the District of Columbia this summer has pushed the city's homicide tally to 102 this year -- 36 percent higher than last year -- leaving residents angry and on edge as they plead with D.C. officials to get the violence under control.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The onslaught of fatal shootings in the District of Columbia this summer has pushed the city\u2019s homicide tally to 102 this year \u2014 36 percent higher than last year \u2014 leaving residents angry and on edge as they plead with D.C. officials to get the violence under control.", "title": "D.C. homicides spike has residents on edge, officials under fire", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/23/dc-homicides-spike-has-residents-on-edge-officials/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/23/8_232015_dsc-05198201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/23/8_232015_dsc-05198201.jpg", "description": "The onslaught of fatal shootings in the District of Columbia this summer has pushed the city's homicide tally to 102 this year -- 36 percent higher than last year -- leaving residents angry and on edg", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "D.C. homicides spike has residents on edge, officials under fire"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca6c\"", "article_summary": "Over the past two months, Chief Lanier and D.C.
