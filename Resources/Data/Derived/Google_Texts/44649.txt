Hooper Avenue near South Shore Drive is open again after an early morning crash that knocked down a utility pole closed the northbound lanes, police said.

Crews are still working in the area, but all lanes are open, police said.

Isiah Blackshear, 24, of South Toms River, was driving a 1999 Saturn north on Hooper Avenue when the car struck a pole at about 4:19 a.m., according to a news release from Police Chief Mitch Little. The force of the impact split the pole in half and dropped live wires onto the roadway, police said.

Blackshear was taken to Community Medical Center in Toms River for treatment of minor injuries, Little said. He was issued summonses for driving while under the influence and reckless driving, police said.

As of 3 p.m., northbound Hooper Avenue remained closed and traffic was diverted through Ocean County College. Drivers on Fischer Boulevard cannot turn right onto Hooper Avenue, and are being directed south, according to police.
