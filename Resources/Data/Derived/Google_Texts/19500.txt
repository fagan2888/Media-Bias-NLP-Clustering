When tragedy strikes, a few minutes can be the difference between life and death. So it was for a 26-year-old Doonside driver, who was saved by the keen eye and quick thinking of two Westmead Hospital nurses on their way home from work.

The man became trapped behind the wheel of his car after it collided with another on the Great Western Highway near Pendle Hill on Saturday afternoon. He was slumped in a way that cut off his breathing, said Ian Badham, founding director of CareFlight, which attended the scene.

The two nurses, from Westmead's intensive care unit, were driving home after a shift when they spotted the accident, ran over and tipped the man’s head up to re-open his blocked airway.

"It's fair to say they were at the right place at the right time," a spokesperson from Westmead Hospital said.

Mr Badham said the man would not have survived otherwise, and that the nurses' basic act was one everybody should be able to perform in an emergency.

"They knew what to do...they had to simply tip his head back. Without that simple act of knowing what to do and doing it quickly, he would not have been alive when the paramedics arrived," he said.

"Anybody can do what the nurses did with just a little bit of training. To be able to recognise that somebody’s in difficulty...a simple producedure and you can save a life."

CareFlight medical director Dr Alan Garner, who attended the scene, said the man suffered head, neck and chest injuries, while a woman and child in the other car escaped with minor injuries. He was in an unknown condition in Westmead Hospital on Saturday night.
