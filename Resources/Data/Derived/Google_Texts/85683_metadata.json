Police officers, military, even garbage men will all be required to have the RFID chip by the end of next month or face termination from their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe story is fake, and the website is fake.\n\nBesides the disclaimer on its website about its fake reporting, the fakeness of the site can be seen in its headlines, such as \u201cAnalysts Forecast Drop In Holiday Spending As More Families Rely On Presents From Santa Claus\u201d and \u201cNaptime Prepares Children for Socialist Entitlements.\u201d\n\nThe original fake RFID chip story is from three months ago, but the new spate of stories derived from the fake site appear to come after two follow-up stories about an \u201cRFID mascot\u201d beginning a nationwide tour \u201cto help alleviate children\u2019s fears of implantation.\u201d It referred to the mascot as \u201cChippie the RFID.\u201d\n\nThe story quoted a fake person called Doug Walker:\n\n\u201c\u2019It felt like a pinch,\u2019 explained Walker who attended a recent Chippie seminar a Carbon County, Wyoming school.\n\n\u201cHolding up his slightly swollen left hand bearing the tiny hole where the needle had been inserted he said. \u2018Now I can get free candy every time me and mommy go to the bank or the grocery store!\u2019, he beamed proudly. \u2018Chippie is my new best friend who lives inside of me!'\u201d\n\nAnother fake, totally made up person called Brading Harris was quoted:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so cool!\u201d said Harris a student at Plymouth elementary school. \u201cI love Chippie so much! He\u2019s my best friend in the whole world and I can\u2019t wait to get my very own real life Chippie implanted in my hand!\u201d\n\nThe latest follow-up was titled: \u201cMove Over Elmo \u2013 Chippie Seminars Leave Children Eager To Receive New RFID Implant\u201d\n\nAn excerpt:\n\n\u201cThe theme song drops its tempo and the curtains slowly begin to open. Gasps can be heard from the audience as they bear witness to the 7 foot tall, cylindrical character standing center stage. He starts to sing in a comically high pitched voice, and that\u2019s when absolute bedlam breaks out. Some children can be seen jumping up and down, screaming wildly. Others clap their hands, smiling and singing along, already knowing the song that is now barely audible above the shrieks and squeals of several hundred overjoyed kids.\n\n\u201cThis was the scene earlier today at Plymouth elementary school in Big Horn, Wyoming, the first stop on Chippie\u2019s nationwide RFID awareness tour. Chippie The RFID Device is a corporate sponsored mascot for the newly mandated Obamacare RFID Implantation Program. His purpose is to introduce kids and teens to the RFID technology in a fun and nonthreatening way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stories claiming RFID chips are being tested as part of Obamacare have been going viral on alternative news websites, with people claiming that a test run", "og": {"site_name": "The Epoch Times", "description": "Stories claiming RFID chips are being tested as part of Obamacare have been going viral on alternative news websites, with people claiming that a test run", "title": "Are RFID Chips Being Tested for Obamacare?
