One thing that won't be on the menu : federal dollars.\n\nThe Campbell County, Ky., district is opting out of the federal school lunch program, forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe reason: Kids didn't like their healthful lunches.\n\n\"The calorie limitations and types of foods that have to be provided ... have resulted in the kids just saying 'I'm not going to eat that,' \" said Fort Thomas Superintendent Gene Kirchner.\n\nThe 2,800-student district joins a small but growing number of school districts across the country \u2014 mostly wealthy districts that can afford to forfeit the money \u2014 that have dropped out of the federal program in the wake of stricter nutritional standards.\n\nSchools said students don't like the unsalted potatoes, low-fat cheese or the mandatory fruits and vegetables. They throw food away or decide not to eat at all.\n\nIn Kirchner's district, 166 fewer students bought lunch every day last year \u2014 30,000 fewer a year. Instead they brought lunch from home, went to nearby restaurants or skipped lunch altogether.\n\nThat's a problem because students were going hungry or choosing unhealthful fast food or snacks instead of school meals.\n\nIt's also a financial problem for the district. If kids don't buy lunch, the district loses money and has to dig into its general fund.\n\nMoney that could pay for textbooks and technology must be redirected to pay for green beans and whole-grain hot dog buns.\n\nIt simply wasn't economically feasible anymore, Kirchner said. \"The program is heading in the wrong direction,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/08/ky_school_district_drops_federal_lunch_program.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: KY school district drops federal lunch program"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff3a\"", "article_summary": "The Campbell County, Ky., district is opting out of the federal school lunch program, forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funding.\nIn Kirchner's district, 166 fewer students bought lunch every day last year \u2014 30,000 fewer a year.\nLunch at Fort Thomas Independent Schools may include more French fries, fewer vegetables and larger portions this year.\nIf kids don't buy lunch, the district loses money and has to dig into its general fund.\nThe 2,800-student district joins a small but growing number of school districts across the country \u2014 mostly wealthy districts that can afford to forfeit the money \u2014 that have dropped out of the federal program in the wake of stricter nutritional standards."}
