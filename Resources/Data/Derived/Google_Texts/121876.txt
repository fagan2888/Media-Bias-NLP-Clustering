Sioux Falls, SD

Starting Monday, you will hear a familiar sound in downtown Sioux Falls.

Trolley service in downtown Sioux Falls gets rolling again this Memorial Day.

Stellar Limousine won the Downtown Sioux Falls trolley contract last year, and this is their first full season. And for another first, they're highlighting the downtown's stories, sights, and shopping with a tour.

"The driver acts as the guide. He'll narrate as he drives down the route. He'll talk a little bit about Falls Park, some of the downtown businesses, some different key points about downtown, like one of the banks that was robbed by John Dillinger many years ago," Tom Olson of Stellar Limousine said.

Olson says up to 450 people will ride the trolley each day during the summer season, which runs until Labor Day. The tour plans to add an additional stop at "Falls Overlook Café" on the East side of Falls Park.
