Today Is Work Blood Donor Day, and this year\u2019s focus is \u201csafe blood for saving mothers,\u201d which emphasizes the need for safe blood banks to prevent maternal deaths from blood loss. All it takes is a few minutes to give blood to those who give life.\n\nA Little Bit Goes A Long Way\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, every day, 800 women die from childbirth-related complications. One of the biggest causes of death is severe bleeding during delivery and after childbirth. This year\u2019s campaign is aimed at helping women, but the blood you donate will go to those in need, no matter their sex or condition. Blood banks don\u2019t just serve for emergencies; some individuals have conditions that require regular blood transfusions. The 70,000 Americans living with sickle cell disease, and a large portion of the 1.6 million Americans who were diagnosed with cancer last year, will need regular, if not daily blood transfusions, according to the American Red Cross.\n\nThis Year\u2019s Host: Sri Lanka\n\nThroughout the world people are showing their enthusiasm for World Blood Donor Day 2014 by volunteering at their local blood drives. This year, Sri Lank is the host country for the global event, and in the Buddhist nation, blood donations are taken very seriously. \u201cBecause most Sri Lankans follow Buddhism, blood donation is religiously and culturally accepted and very much a valued concept,\u201d said Dr. Namal Bandara, senior registrar of the National Blood Transfusion Service, the WHO reports. This year the Poson Poya blood drive in the south Asian country has already collected around 3,000 units of blood in just one day. Sri Lanka is able to have a self-sufficient blood supply but other countries, such as India, aren\u2019t as lucky. As reported by The Health Site, India faces a blood shortage as high as three million units. This problem could be overcome if only an additional two percent of Indians donated blood.\n\nGet Out And Do Something!\n\nGet out and donate, it\u2019s easy to do. Most healthy adults who are at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds may donate a pint of blood every two months. The Red Cross estimates that 38 percent of the U.S population is healthy enough to donate, but statistics show that only about 10 percent actually do this. Blood drives occur in communities throughout the world.

Health magazine reported that donating blood helps the donor\u2019s blood flow better, keeps their iron levels balanced, and significantly reduces the risk of early death.\n\n\"I can`t even describe how incredibly heartwarming it is that people we don`t even know have saved her life,\u201d Kaleena Nuedling, the mother of a 4-year-old girl who, after three open heart surgeries, is alive thanks to blood donations, told Fox 6 Now.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, blood, donor, day, 2014, save, worlds, mothers, donating, blood", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Today is World Blood Donor Day, and we are all urged to donate blood while keeping in mind the mother's of the world who are in particular need due to pregnancy complications.", "title": "World Blood Donor Day 2014; Give Blood To Those Who Give Life [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-blood-donor-day-2014-save-worlds-mothers-donating-blood-288258", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/14/blood.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today is World Blood Donor Day, and we are all urged to donate blood while keeping in mind the mother's of the world who are in particular need due to pregnancy complications.", "title": "World Blood Donor Day 2014; Give Blood To Those Who Give Life [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-blood-donor-day-2014-save-worlds-mothers-donating-blood-288258", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/14/blood.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/14/blood.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-14T16:18:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T16:18:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Today is World Blood Donor Day, and we are all urged to donate blood while keeping in mind the mother's of the world who are in particular need due to pregnancy complications."}, "article_summary": "Today Is Work Blood Donor Day, and this year\u2019s focus is \u201csafe blood for saving mothers,\u201d which emphasizes the need for safe blood banks to prevent maternal deaths from blood loss.\nIf you're in the U.S., and need help finding the nearest blood drive, click here to access the Red Cross U.S. blood drive locater.\nSomeone needs blood every two seconds, and there is enough blood in each pint of donated blood to save three lives, experts say.\nThis year the Poson Poya blood drive in the south Asian country has already collected around 3,000 units of blood in just one day.\nIf saving other people's lives isn\u2019t enough to get you out to your local blood drive, what if I told you that by donating blood you could be saving your own life?"}
