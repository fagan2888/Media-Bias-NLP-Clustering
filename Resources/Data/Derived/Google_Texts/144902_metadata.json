The whaling and seal-fur industry barely exist today because Moore and others at Greenpeace put their lives on the line on the open seas.\n\nMoore\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d credentials are impeccable. But, as he explained at our conference, the eco-movement \u2014 and Greenpeace, in particular \u2014 was co-opted by radicals \u2026 and liars.\n\nA movement that started out with the best of intentions came to dedicate itself to attacking humans \u2014 especially those in the developing world, who need cheap and abundant energy to lift themselves above a level of poverty the West barely understands.\n\nThat\u2019s why, Moore said, he left Greenpeace.\n\nYou must watch AND SHARE the July 8 presentation by Patrick Moore at Heartland\u2019s latest climate conference. Moore\u2019s presentation is so entertaining \u2014 and scientifically based for one\u2019s open mind \u2014 that I will not excerpt any text.
