That equipment connects the well to the rig at the surface, and BP and Anadarko\u2019s argument was that the oil that ended up in the Gulf was released from the riser; therefore, they were not to blame.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBut the appeals court ruling rejected that argument and found that there is \u201cno dispute\u201d that the oil was discharged from the well, which BP and Anandarko affirm they were owners of.\n\nCircuit Judge Fortunato Benavides writes in the opinion:\n\n\u2026although the defendants argue that the blowout preventer should have engaged and prevented the progression of the blowout, the need for this intervention only underscores the extent to which the oil was already unconfined and flowing freely . Accordingly, we find that the well is a facility from which oil was discharged in violation of [the Clean Water Act.]\n\nBenavides specifies section 311 of the Act, which prohibits the \u201cdischarge of oil or hazardous substances into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone . . . in such quantities as may be harmful.\u201d\n\nThat section \u201cleaves no room for civil \u2013 penalty defendants to shift liability via allegations of third \u2013 party fault,\u201d he writes.\n\nAccording to reporting by Bloomberg, the ruling allows the U.S. to pursue up to $18 billion in fines from BP and up to $4.6 billion from Anadarko.\n\nThough BP was temporarily banned by the federal government from contracts in the Gulf, the company now has 11 deepwater rigs \u2014 the most it\u2019s ever had there, according to reporting by Platts.\n\n\u201cOur business is back; it\u2019s strong and it\u2019s gaining momentum,\u201d John Minge, who is also BP America Chairman and CEO, declared last month.\n\n___________________________", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was your well that released the oil so it's your fault, circuit court ruling tells oil giants.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Andrea Germanos | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "It was your well that released the oil so it's your fault, circuit court ruling tells oil giants.", "title": "Appeals Court Rejects BP, Anadarko Attempt To Skirt Blame For Gulf Disaster", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/appeals-court-rejects-bp-anadarko-attempt-skirt-blame-gulf-disaster/192083/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gulf-Oil-Spill-Annive_Webf.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06T11:28:04-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It was your well that released the oil so it's your fault, circuit court ruling tells oil giants.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gulf-Oil-Spill-Annive_Webf.jpg", "title": "Appeals Court Rejects BP, Anadarko Attempt To Skirt Blame For Gulf Disaster", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "oil spill", "published_time": "2014-06-07T05:00:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T11:28:04-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Appeals Court Rejects BP, Anadarko Attempt To Skirt Blame For Gulf DisasterIt was your well that released the oil so it's your fault, circuit court ruling tells oil giants.\nThe opinion from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirms a lower court ruling that found oil giants, as co-owners of the fated Macondo Well, liable.\nBP and Anadarko had sought to shift blame onto Transocean, which owned the riser.\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected BP and Anadarko Petroleum\u2019s efforts to evade billions of dollars in fines for Clean Water Act violations for the millions of barrels of oil that spewed from their well in the 2010 Gulf disaster.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorBut the appeals court ruling rejected that argument and found that there is \u201cno dispute\u201d that the oil was discharged from the well, which BP and Anandarko affirm they were owners of."}
