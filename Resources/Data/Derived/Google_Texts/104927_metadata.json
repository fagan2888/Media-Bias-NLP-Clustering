Biggs, Alex Brill, and Alan D. Viard, all of whom I know and admire, this new document outlines a series of reforms designed to restrain the growth of government and mitigate many of the tax code\u2019s more punitive features.\n\nCompared to current law, the plan is a huge improvement.\n\nBut huge improvement isn\u2019t the same as perfect, so here\u2019s my two cents on what\u2019s really good, what\u2019s partially good, and what has me worried.\n\nI\u2019ll start with something that\u2019s both good and bad.\n\nAccording to the latest CBO estimates, federal tax revenues for 2015 will absorb 17.7 percent of GDP and spending will consume 20.4 percent of economic output. Now look at this table showing the impact of the AEI proposal. As you can see, the burden of taxes and spending will both be higher in the future than today.\n\nThat\u2019s obviously bad. One would think a conservative organization would present a plan that shrinks the size of government!\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. Under current law, the burden of government is projected to climb far more rapidly, largely because of demographic changes and poorly designed entitlement programs. So if we do nothing and leave government on auto-pilot, America will be saddled with a European-sized welfare state.\n\nFrom that perspective, the AEI plan actually is good since it is based on reforms that stop most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the already-legislated expansions in the size of the public sector.\n\nSo here\u2019s the bottom line. Compared to what I would like to see, the AEI plan is too timid. But compared to what I fear will happen, the AEI plan is reasonably bold.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the specific reforms, staring with tax policy. Here\u2019s some of what\u2019s in the report.\n\nThe goal of our tax reform is to eliminate the income tax\u2019s inherent bias against saving and investment and to reduce other tax distortions. To achieve this goal, the income tax system and the estate and gift taxes would be replaced by a progressive consumption tax, in the form of a Bradford X tax consisting of a\u202637 percent flat-rate firm-level tax on business cash flow and a graduated-rate household-level tax, with a top rate of 35 percent, on wages and fringe benefits.\n\nAt the risk of oversimplifying, the AEI folks decided that it was very important to solve the problem of double taxation and not so important to deal with the problem of a discriminatory and punitive rate structure. Which is sort of like embracing one big part of the flat tax while ignoring the other big part.\n\nWe\u2019d have a less destructive tax code than we have now, but it wouldn\u2019t be as good as it could be. Indeed, the plan is conceptually similar to the Rubio-Lee proposal, but with a lot more details.\n\nNot that I\u2019m happy with all those additional details.\n\nTo address environmental externalities in a more cost-effective and market-based manner, energy subsidies, tax credits, and regulations would be replaced by a modest carbon tax. The gasoline tax would be increased to cover highway-related costs.\n\nI\u2019m very nervous about giving Washington a new source of revenue. And while I\u2019m open (in theory) to the argument that a carbon tax would be a better (less worse) approach than what we have now, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s wise to trust that politicians won\u2019t pull a bait and switch and burden us with both a costly energy tax and new forms of regulatory intervention.\n\nAnd I definitely don\u2019t like the idea of a higher gas tax. The federal government should be out of the transportation business.\n\nThere are also other features that irk me, including the continuation of some loopholes and the expansion of redistribution through the tax code.\n\nChild and dependent care expenses could be deducted\u2026 A 15 percent refundable credit for charitable contributions\u2026 A 15 percent refundable credit for mortgage interest\u2026 A refundable credit for health insurance\u2026the EITC for childless workers would be doubled relative to current law.\n\nThough I should also point out that the new tax system proposed by AEI would be territorial, which would be a big step in the right direction. And it\u2019s also important to note that the X tax has full expensing, which solves the bias against investment in a depreciation-based system.\n\nBut now let\u2019s look at the most worrisome feature of the plan. It explicitly says that Washington should get more money.\n\n\u2026 we also cannot address the imbalance simply by cutting spending\u2026 The tax proposals presented in this plan raise necessary revenues\u2026 Over time, tax revenue would gradually rise as a share of GDP\u2026 The upward path of tax revenue is necessary to finance the upward path of federal spending.\n\nThis is very counterproductive. But I don\u2019t want to regurgitate my ideological anti-tax arguments (click here if that\u2019s what you want). Let\u2019s look at this issue from a strictly practical perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve reluctantly admitted that there are potential tax-hike deals that I would accept, at least in theory.\n\nBut those deals will never happen. In the real world, once the potential for additional revenue exists, the appetite for genuine spending restraint quickly evaporates. Just look at the evidence from Europe about the long-run relationship between taxes and debt and you\u2019ll see that more revenue simply enables more spending.\n\nSpeaking of which, now let\u2019s shift to the outlay side of the fiscal ledger.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Social Security, where the AEI folks are proposing to turn Social Security from a substandard social insurance program, which is bad, to a flat benefit, which might even be worse since it involves a shift to a system that is even more focused on redistribution.\n\nThe minimum benefit would be implemented immediately, increasing benefits for about one third of retirees, while benefits for middle- and high-earning individuals would be scaled down to the wage-indexed poverty level between now and 2050.\n\nYes, the system they propose is more fiscally sustainable for government, but what about the fact that most workers are paying record amounts of payroll tax in exchange for a miserly monthly payment?\n\nThis is why the right answer is personal retirement accounts.\n\nThe failure to embrace personal accounts may be the most disappointing feature of the AEI plan. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the authors veered in this unfortunate direction because they put the cart of debt reduction ahead of the horse of good policy.\n\nTo elaborate, a big challenge for real Social Security reform is the \u201ctransition cost\u201d of financing promised benefits to current retirees and older workers when younger workers are allowed to shift their payroll taxes to personal accounts. Dealing with this challenge presumably means more borrowing over the next few decades, but it would give us a much better system in the long run. But this approach generally isn\u2019t an attractive option for folks who fixate on near-term government debt.\n\nThat being said, there are spending reforms in the proposal that are very appealing.\n\nThe AEI plan basically endorses the good Medicare and Medicaid reforms that have been part of recent GOP budgets. And since those two programs are the biggest drivers of our long-run spending crisis, this is very important.\n\nWith regards to discretionary spending, the program maintains sequester/Budget Control Act spending levels for domestic programs, which is far too much since we should be abolishing departments such as HUD, Agriculture, Transportation,Education, etc.\n\nBut since Congress presumably would spend even more, the AEI plan could be considered a step in the right direction.\n\nFinally, the AEI plan calls for military spending to consume 3.8 percent of economic output in perpetuity. National defense is one of the few legitimate functions of the federal government, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Pentagon should get a blank check, particularly since big chunks of that check get used for dubious purposes. But I\u2019ll let the foreign policy and defense crowd fight that issue since it\u2019s not my area of expertise.\n\nP.S. The Heritage Foundation also has thrown in the towel on personal retirement accounts and embraced a basic universal flat benefit.\n\nP.P.S. On a completely different topic, here\u2019s a fascinating chart that\u2019s being shared on Twitter.\n\nAs you can see, the United States is an exception that proves the rule. I don\u2019t know that there are any policy implications, but I can\u2019t help but wonder whether America\u2019s greater belief in self-reliance is linked to the tendency of religious people to believe in individual ethics and moral behavior.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 21 May 2015 15:21:39 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The American Enterprise Institute has published a comprehensive budgetary plan.
