Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama continue to push the Obama administration for answers on the rise of homegrown and imported terrorism\u2014an increase the two attribute to increased immigration from jihadi hot spots.\n\nThe Republican senators seek more information concerning 113 individuals in the U.S. who, by their count, \u201chave been implicated in Islamic terrorism in some manner since early 2014.\u201d\n\nCruz and Sessions renewed their call for more information in a letter Tuesday to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\n\u201cWe still do not have the requested information\u2014despite the occurrence of terrorist attacks in San Bernardino carried out by a Muslim migrant and the child of Muslim migrants,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCruz and Sessions say the administration has not been responsive to two different requests.\n\nThey say their first letter, sent in August and seeking similar information, went unanswered. And they complain that a second letter in December was ignored even after the San Bernardino terror attack left 14 dead and 22 wounded.\n\nThe senators compiled their unofficial list of 113 persons from official documents as part of their campaign to highlight the \u201castronomical\u201d cost of tracking terror suspects entering the U.S. as immigrants or refugees.\n\nTheir new letter draws attention to 14 suspected terrorists who were admitted to the U.S. as refugees. It alludes to other \u201cimmigrant terrorists\u201d who entered through other programs and \u201cwere even approved for citizenship.\u201d The letter adds:\n\nThe U.S. continues to admit approximately 680,000 migrants from Muslim countries every five years. The American people are entitled to information on the immigration history of terrorists seeking to harm them.\n\nThe White House has defended current policy as consistent with past immigration precedent.\n\n\u201cIn the Muslim immigrant today, we see the Catholic immigrant of a century ago,\u201d President Obama said at a naturalization event last month. \u201cIn the Syrian refugee of today, we should see the Jewish refugee of World War II.\u201d\n\nCruz and Sessions argue that \u201cthe American people are entitled to information on the immigration history of terrorists seeking to harm them.\u201d\n\nTheir letter comes on the day Obama is scheduled to deliver his last State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress. The president was expected to touch on both immigration and terrorism in those remarks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sens.
