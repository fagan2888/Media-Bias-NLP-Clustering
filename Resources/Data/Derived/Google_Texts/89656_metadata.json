That ended the National Security Agency\u2019s phone records program, but privacy advocates said it didn\u2019t touch the more intrusive programs that target foreigners\u2019 emails \u2014 and end up snagging Americans\u2019 communications in the process.\n\nThursday\u2019s 255-174 vote, which came as part of the debate on the annual defense spending bill, would fix that. It also would prohibit the government from insisting software companies build backdoor access into encryption algorithms that the FBI and intelligence community could use to gain access to information Americans want to keep private.\n\n\u201cThis amendment is the most meaningful step Congress can take to end warrantless bulk collection of U.S. persons\u2019 communications and data,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who joined Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, in the push for the new protections.\n\nThey led a strong bipartisan coalition, with 109 Republicans joining 146 Democrats in voting for the changes to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which granted snooping powers even before the Patriot Act was passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nThe ban still needs approval from a Senate likely to be more skeptical of turning off an important snooping tool, and senators have run into gridlock on a number of security-related issues in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats led a filibuster to block a cybersecurity bill, just two weeks after the IRS admitted it had been breached by a hack that stole personal information on more than 100,000 taxpayers and a week after the federal Office of Personnel Management said hackers stole information about millions of federal employees from OPM\u2019s databases.\n\nDemocratic leaders complained that the bill was being jammed together with the annual defense policy bill \u2014 a companion to the annual spending bill \u2014 and said their filibuster was an effort to separate the debates and allow for amendments.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the filibuster \u201cjust flat irresponsible\u201d given all the cyberattacks in the news.\n\n\u201cThese are not threats we can afford to ignore,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Republicans have themselves to blame too. They earned the support of a half-dozen Democrats and one independent, but saw three Republicans defect to vote against the bill over privacy concerns, and saw two Republicans \u2014 presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 miss the vote entirely. If the GOP had been present and unified, they could have overcome the filibuster.\n\nPrivacy and security are increasingly clashing in debates on Capitol Hill, and the FISA vote in the House was just the latest manifestation.\n\nIntelligence community backers said Congress should leave the NSA\u2019s snooping alone, saying the growing threat from terrorists must be countered with broad gathering powers.\n\n\u201cThis amendment would impose greater restrictions on the intelligence community\u2019s ability to protect national security and create a greater impediment to our government\u2019s ability to locate threat information already in our government\u2019s possession,\u201d said Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, New Jersey Republican.\n\nWhile the outlines of data gathered under Section 702 remain shrouded, some details have emerged. Under the program, the government is allowed to scoop up communications of foreigners outside the U.S. It\u2019s not supposed to target Americans, or even foreigners in the U.S., but their data can be kept and searched if it\u2019s swept up in the dragnet for foreign communications.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James R. Clapper has affirmed that the databases have been queried specifically for information on U.S. persons. He said they felt comfortable going ahead with those searches because Congress had refused to set limits on the data\u2019s use.\n\nThe proposal from Mr. Massie and Ms. Lofgren would establish those limits.\n\nSection 702 is due to expire at the end of 2017, and Mr. Frelinghuysen said the fight should be left for another day, pleading with colleagues to let the committees that oversee the intelligence community work out any changes.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue critical to our national security, and it is complicated,\u201d he said, comparing the snooping on U.S. persons\u2019 communications to state and local police conducting a wiretap on a drug dealer, but using what they hear to investigate other people\u2019s crimes too.\n\nThe defense spending bill saw several other fights erupt in addition to the snooping. The House rejected two efforts to reel in the Pentagon\u2019s program to ship surplus weapons and equipment to state and local police.\n\nRep. Henry C. \u201cHank\u201d Johnson, Georgia Democrat, had tried to limit transfer of \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and heavily armored Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, which some critics have said has led to heightened tensions between police and protesters in recent years.\n\nThe House also shot down several efforts to put a deadline on how long President Obama would have to fight terrorists under the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force against al Qaeda and in Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Riding a wave of anti-government snooping sentiment, the House voted Thursday to stop the intelligence community from poring over Americans' emails and other data scooped up as part of its dragnet collection.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Riding a wave of anti-government snooping sentiment, the House voted Thursday to stop the intelligence community from poring over Americans\u2019 emails and other data scooped up as part of its dragnet collection.", "title": "House votes to block NSA snooping through Americans\u2019 emails", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/11/house-votes-block-nsa-snooping-through-emails/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/AP334134337831.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/AP334134337831.jpg", "description": "Riding a wave of anti-government snooping sentiment, the House voted Thursday to stop the intelligence community from poring over Americans' emails and other data scooped up as part of its dragnet col", "card": "summary", "title": "House votes to block NSA snooping through Americans\u2019 emails"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Thomas Massie, Zoe Lofgren, National Security Agency"}, "article_summary": "That ended the National Security Agency\u2019s phone records program, but privacy advocates said it didn\u2019t touch the more intrusive programs that target foreigners\u2019 emails \u2014 and end up snagging Americans\u2019 communications in the process.\nDirector of National Intelligence James R.
