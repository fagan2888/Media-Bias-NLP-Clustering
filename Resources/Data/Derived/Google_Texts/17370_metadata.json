Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), left, and Libertarian Party candidate Sean Haugh, center, listen as Republican candidate Thom Tillis speaks during a debate at WECT studios in Wilmington, N.C., on Oct. 9. (Gerry Broome/Associated Press)\n\nThom Tillis sent a deep sigh and a shudder rolling through the crowd of Republican activists with just one word: \u00ad\u201cEbola.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we all agree that it would make sense temporarily to have a travel ban?\u201d the Republican Senate candidate asked about 100 supporters gathered Saturday afternoon at the local GOP headquarters in Guilford County. The crowd burst into hearty applause.\n\nThe specter of Ebola in the United States, on the heels of stories about the violent militants of the Islamic State, has made security a late-breaking wild-card issue in North Carolina\u2019s Senate race.\n\nFor much of the year, the incumbent, Sen. Kay Hagan (D), and her allies had successfully framed the campaign as a referendum on the sharp conservative turn taken by the state legislature under the leadership of Tillis, the House speaker. But in the past few weeks, the conversation has pivoted amid alarming headlines about terrorism and a virulent epidemic, further tightening what is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history.\n\nTillis has latched onto criticism of President Obama\u2019s handling of the crises and sought to connect them to Hagan, part of his campaign\u2019s broader aim to turn the race into a vote on the Democratic administration.\n\nSen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) makes a point while participating in a debate with Republican candidate Thom Tillis at UNC-TV studios in Research Triangle Park, N.C., on Oct. 7. (Gerry Broome/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cThis president has failed the American people,\u201d he told volunteers in Raleigh on Saturday. \u201cSenator Hagan has been with him, with her rubber stamp, every step of the way. Our safety and security is more threatened now than it has ever been.\u201d\n\nHagan has found herself on the defensive, acknowledging that she missed a classified briefing about national security threats to attend a campaign fundraiser in New York in February. On Friday, she called on Obama to temporarily ban the travel of non-U.S. citizens from affected countries in West Africa, just days after saying that such a tactic \u201cis not going to help\u201d unless it was part of a broader strategy.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign rejected the charge that she has not been engaged on security issues, noting that she has met with top generals in Afghanistan and Iraq and has chaired 20 meetings of a Senate subcommittee on emerging threats.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Tillis can only criticize,\u201d Hagan told reporters after a campaign stop in Charlotte on Sunday. \u201cHe has not one idea on his own that he would put forward \u2014 not one.\u201d\n\nThe changed dynamic has lifted the hopes of national Republicans, who are pumping millions of dollars into new attack ads in the state amid signs that Hagan\u2019s slight but steady lead has narrowed.\n\n\u201cEyes are now starting to turn to Washington, and that\u2019s probably the worst-case scenario for them right now,\u201d said Paul Shumaker, Tillis\u2019s campaign strategist.\n\n\u201cThe president has done a good job of helping refocus this race for us,\u201d Shumaker said, adding: \u201cThank you, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Thom Tillis talks to lawmakers on the House floor as the House and Senate re-convened at the General Assembly in Raleigh, N.C., in September 2013. (Gerry Broome/Associated Press)\n\nBut Democrats in the state are skeptical that the new story line will alter the views of what is a deeply polarized electorate.\n\n\u201cI think in the last week they have probably had a little headway in making it a nationalized election,\u201d said Morgan Jackson, a longtime Democratic strategist in Raleigh. \u201cThe question is, is it too little and too late? If this was a month ago, it would be a much different situation. But the ability to change voters\u2019 minds, that window is about to close.\u201d\n\nAllies argue that Hagan maintains key tactical strengths heading into the final two weeks of the campaign, in the air and on the ground.\n\nEven with new infusions of cash from the National Republican Senatorial Committee and conservative groups such as the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund, Tillis and his backers are still outgunned on television by Hagan and her supporters, according to people familiar with ad reservations. That is particularly true in smaller markets such as Asheville.\n\nAt the same time, the Democratic incumbent is being bolstered by two ambitious field operations: one run by the party and the other driven by well-funded interest groups such as Planned Parenthood, the League of Conservation Voters and unions, coordinated by the liberal group America Votes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that 95 percent of the voters have made up their minds,\u201d said Rep. David E. Price, a Democrat who represents the vote-rich Research Triangle. \u201cThe real game is turnout.\u201d\n\nA stop Tillis made at the state fair in Raleigh on Friday underscored the visceral impressions that voters have about the candidates.\n\nOn one hand, there were people such as Scott and Alyson Dunlap of Statesville, who greeted Tillis with ebullience. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my vote!\u201d Scott Dunlap declared as they encountered him in front of a display of giant pumpkins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re conservative, so we\u2019d like to get more conservative voices in Washington,\u201d the 59-year-old IT director said afterward.\n\nBut outside a tobacco-curing demonstration, Virginia and Jerry Wall of Clayton responded with disgust when they heard the GOP candidate was nearby.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand Tillis,\u201d said Virginia Wall, 68, a retired nurse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican, but I fear the direction the Republican Party has gone,\u201d said her husband, a 64-year-old network engineer. \u201cThis voter-ID law they passed here in North Carolina, it borders on treason. It\u2019s not what I expect from America.\u201d\n\nHagan has sought to stoke that backlash against Raleigh\u2019s conservative tilt. On Sunday, she stood in front of a big sign declaring \u201cNORTH CAROLINA FIRST,\u201d speaking to a clutch of students and educators at Charlotte\u2019s Central Piedmont Community College.\n\nShe hammered Tillis on his education record, noting that the 2013 tax cuts passed by the GOP-led state legislature led to decreased revenues for schools.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all, we didn\u2019t become the state we are by selling our students short,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail Saturday, Tillis rejected such critiques, pointing to teacher raises passed in the most recent legislative session.\n\nFor his part, he spent most of his day-long swing through the state pressing the argument that Hagan operates as an extension of Obama. He ticked off a series of issues, such as Obamacare and veterans\u2019 care, in which he said the administration \u2014 and the senator \u2014 had failed. At every stop, he added two new items on the list: the Islamic State and Ebola.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you all, but I pretty much had a sense that ISIS was a threat,\u201d he told backers crowded in a field office in Cornelius, just north of Charlotte. \u201cSenator Hagan decided that a Park Avenue fundraiser was more important than a classified briefing on ISIS,\u201d he added, using another name for the Islamic State.\n\nOn Ebola, Tillis said, \u201cSenator Hagan finally said that there should be a limited ban on travel from western Africa. Well, welcome to the club of common sense. But it\u2019s not enough. This is an opportunity where she could have proven to be independent and say, \u2018Mr. President, we need to protect the safety and security of America.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHagan vigorously disputed his characterizations, saying Tillis had ducked questions about how he would handle the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI support the airstrikes,\u201d she said Sunday, adding that she called for moderate Syrian rebels to be armed and trained \u201ca year and a half ago.\u201d\n\nAs for her position on a travel ban, \u201cnothing has changed, and Speaker Tillis knows that,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cHe is trying to distract from what the truth is. I have always said that a travel ban should be part of a broader use of tactics.\u201d\n\nWhether there are any voters left to win over remains an open question. Nearly $80 million in political ads have already inundated the state, a figure that could rise as high as $100 million by Election Day.\n\n\u201cI would argue that persuadable voters are like pink unicorns,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey are impossible to find.\u201d\n\nAnn Inman, a retired nurse who attended Tillis\u2019s rally in Greensboro, said she was deeply concerned that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had \u201cfallen down on the job\u201d handling the arrival of Ebola in the United States.\n\nBut she was not sure that issue would sway many voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the senatorial race,\u201d the 68-year-old said.\n\nInman\u2019s friend Sandra Burns disagreed.\n\n\u201cIf she didn\u2019t want to stop the flights coming in, she was with Obama on that!\u201d said Burns, 72. \u201cSo if I was a Democrat and voting, I would think, \u2018Hey, wait a minute here!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Inman mused. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Tillis said he believes recent crises resonate because they \u201care very real examples for people to understand what it means for this president to fail on foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still think, though, that jobs and the economy are still top of mind,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just these other issues have entered into the narrative in a much more prominent way than we expected them to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Security issues have tightened what is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Security issues have tightened what is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history.", "title": "Ebola, Islamic State shift dynamics for Hagan, Tillis in North Carolina\u2019s Senate race", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ebola-islamic-state-shift-dynamics-for-hagan-tillis-in-north-carolinas-senate-race/2014/10/19/f500efbe-5629-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/19/National-Politics/Images/Senate_North_Carolina_Debate-0ca55.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mateagold"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ebola-islamic-state-shift-dynamics-for-hagan-tillis-in-north-carolinas-senate-race/2014/10/19/f500efbe-5629-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "nc senate race, kay hagan, thom tillis, ebola, islamic state, isis, nc senate, senate races, midterm elections, election day, campaigns, republicans nc, nc democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f500efbe-5629-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "nc senate race, kay hagan, thom tillis, ebola, islamic state, isis, nc senate, senate races, midterm elections, election day, campaigns, republicans nc, nc democrats"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4d5\"", "article_summary": "On Ebola, Tillis said, \u201cSenator Hagan finally said that there should be a limited ban on travel from western Africa.\nThe specter of Ebola in the United States, on the heels of stories about the violent militants of the Islamic State, has made security a late-breaking wild-card issue in North Carolina\u2019s Senate race.\n\u201cSpeaker Tillis can only criticize,\u201d Hagan told reporters after a campaign stop in Charlotte on Sunday.\nOn the campaign trail Saturday, Tillis rejected such critiques, pointing to teacher raises passed in the most recent legislative session.\nPresident, we need to protect the safety and security of America.\u2019 \u201dHagan vigorously disputed his characterizations, saying Tillis had ducked questions about how he would handle the Islamic State."}
