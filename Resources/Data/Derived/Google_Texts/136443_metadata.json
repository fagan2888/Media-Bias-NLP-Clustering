The key to the president\u2019s shift in popularity is that his executive actions have been very popular with Independents. Obama has seen his approval increase by 11 points with Independents. According to CBS News, the president is also getting credit from the American people for the improving economy, \u201cMr. Obama appears to be getting some credit for an improving economy. Forty-three percent say Mr. Obama\u2019s policies have helped the economy while fewer \u2014 34 percent \u2014 say his policies have hurt. Still, these views are colored by partisanship: most Democrats think the president\u2019s policies have helped the economy, while most Republicans say they have hurt.\u201d\n\nThe extreme partisan divide in the country is going to weigh down President Obama\u2019s approval ratings. It is unlikely that he will be able to approach Bill Clinton\u2019s approval ratings over the same period, but Obama is already more popular than Ronald Reagan was at the same point in his seventh year in office. In February 1987, Ronald Reagan\u2019s approval rating was 42%. If the president\u2019s approval rating holds at its current position for a few more weeks, he will be more popular than Ronald Reagan.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s growing popularity is setting up a nightmare scenario for Republicans. Should the economy continue to improve, Obama will leave office as a popular president. The Republican Party is counting on voters to be suffering from an Obama fatigue that might not be there. The stage could be set for Hillary Clinton to run on expanding Obama\u2019s gains into an economic juggernaut. Obama\u2019s achievements combined with for Sec. of State Clinton\u2019s strong message could form a Democratic wave that no Republican nominee can stop.\n\nWhile the pundit class is focused on the who will run discussions, the political climate is shifting. The current president is gaining popular momentum, and Obama\u2019s resurgence could create a good environment for Democrats in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new CBS News poll has found that President Obama's approval rating has jumped seven points to reach its highest level in a year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A new CBS News poll has found that President Obama's approval rating has jumped seven points to reach its highest level in a year.", "title": "President Obama's Approval Rating Surges To Its Highest Point In The Last 12 Months", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/01/14/president-obamas-approval-rating-surges-highest-point-12-months.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Obama-Smile-full-side-feat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-15T12:40:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Obama approval ratings,obama poll,president obama 2015 approval ratings,president obama approval rating,president obama job approval rating,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-01-14T13:59:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T12:40:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obama approval ratings, obama poll, president obama 2015 approval ratings, president obama approval rating, president obama job approval rating"}, "article_summary": "A new CBS News poll has found that President Obama\u2019s approval rating has jumped seven points to reach its highest level in a year.\nOverall, President Obama is back on even ground with a split approval/disapproval rating of 46%/46%.\nPresident Obama\u2019s growing popularity is setting up a nightmare scenario for Republicans.\nIf the president\u2019s approval rating holds at its current position for a few more weeks, he will be more popular than Ronald Reagan.\nIn February 1987, Ronald Reagan\u2019s approval rating was 42%."}
