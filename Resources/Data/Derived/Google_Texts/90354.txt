Rosh Hashanah begins the Jewish New Year at sundown on Sept. 4 and is one of the holiest days of the calendar. It’s a special time to think about the past year and to plan for a better one ahead. There are many traditional Rosh Hashanah recipes, but a round challah with honey for dipping is essential to wish everyone a sweet new year. Braided challah, the Jewish celebration bread, is served every Friday night to welcome Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) and at every Jewish holiday with the exception of Passover, when unleavened matzo bread is eaten. Challah is usually shaped into a long braid, but at Rosh Hashanah challah is always round, to symbolize the circle of life. Jewish bakeries make beautiful round loaves, but many Jewish cooks make their own and many others aspire to. Here’s my favourite recipe for challah to help you start your own challah-baking tradition.

BONNIE’S ROSH HASHANAH CHALLAH

My grandmother Jenny Soltz had 11 children. They were very poor, but she kept her family in bread for the winter by winning first place in the county fair with her amazing challahs — the prize was flour.

I have been making challah every Friday night for many years. The more often you make it the easier it gets, but it is never more exciting than the first time. Over the years I have updated my method — I now check doneness with an instant-read meat thermometer — and ingredients (I prefer to use extra virgin olive oil), so don’t be surprised if the recipe seems a little different. I’ve had lots of inspiration and tips from friends, bakers and Lehamim Bakery Tel Aviv and their outpost in NYC Breads Bakery.

Note: For a raisin challah, increase sugar to 2/3 cup, knead in 2/3 cup raisins before shaping and omit seeds. Cover challah loosely with aluminum foil after it browns to prevent raisins on the outside from burning.

– 5 to 6 cups all-purpose flour, or half whole wheat flour

– 1 1/2 tbsp. kosher salt

– 1/3 cup sugar

– 1 tbsp. + 1 tsp. instant dry yeast (or 1 1/3 individual packages)

– 4 eggs

– 1 1/4 cups room temperature water

– 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil

Topping:

– 1 egg, lightly beaten

– 1 tbsp. each sesame, nigella (or black sesame), flax and sunflower seeds (or 1/4 cup total of your favourite seeds)

1. Combine 3 cups flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Whisk ingredients for 30 seconds to combine evenly.

2. In another bowl whisk eggs. Remove and refrigerate 2 tbsp. for the glaze. Whisk water and oil into remaining eggs.

3. Stir liquid ingredients into dry ingredients with a wooden spoon. Dough will be very sticky. Stir in 1 more cup of flour. Dough will still be sticky. Stir in enough additional flour (1/2 cup to 1 cup) until dough is too stiff to continue stirring. Dough will still be sticky. Sprinkle 1/4 cup flour on your work surface. Turn dough out onto flour. Knead (with the heels of your hands) in enough flour (adding more if necessary) so that the dough doesn’t stick to your hands but is still moist. (I used almost 6 cups flour in total but this can vary). This can also be done in a stand mixer with the dough hook. Knead about 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes in a mixer until dough becomes smooth and elastic. Don’t worry. Add extra flour gradually, but it is always better to have a slightly soft, moist dough than a hard, dry one — it is more difficult to add liquid to a dry dough than flour to a moist one. I was once told the dough should feel like a woman’s inner thigh — kind of true.

4. Oil a 4L bowl with 11/2 tbsp. olive oil. Place dough in the bowl and turn it over to oil it. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and then a tea towel. Let rise until doubled, 11/2 to 2 hours. If you use a 4L bowl the dough should fill the bowl. Gently punch dough down to release the air, knead again to form a ball. There are many ways to shape a round challah, but this one is easy and looks beautiful. Divide dough in half. Roll into two ropes about 30-inches long. Braid strands together by twisting ropes over continuously as shown. Wind the braid into a coil and tuck ends under. Gently place in an oiled 9-inch round cake pan lined with a round of parchment paper. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise 40 to 60 minutes or until doubled.

5. Brush challah gently with reserved beaten egg. Sprinkle with seeds. You can combine the seeds or sprinkle sections of the bread with different seeds. Bake in a preheated 350F oven 25 minutes. Check bread and if it is browning too much lower oven to 325F and cover the bread loosely with aluminum foil. Bake 15 to 30 minutes longer until an instant read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the bread reaches 195F. Remove bread from pan and cool on a wire rack. Makes one large round
