Majors had end-stage bladder cancer and was in renal failure. As he spoke with a doctor, he was alert but faltering.\n\nIn the dream, he said, he was in his car with his great pal, Carmen. His three sons, teenagers, were in the back seat, joking around.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re driving down Clinton Street,\u201d Majors said, his watery, pale blue eyes widening with delight. \u201cWe were looking for the Grand Canyon.\u201d And then they saw it. \u201cWe talked about how amazing, because there it was \u2014 all this time, the Grand Canyon was just at the end of Clinton Street!\u201d\n\nMajors had not spoken with Carmen in more than 20 years. His sons are in their late 50s and early 60s.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think your boys were in the car?\u201d asked Dr. Christopher W. Kerr, a palliative care physician who researches the therapeutic role of patients\u2019 end-of-life dreams and visions.\n\n\u201cMy sons are the greatest accomplishment of my life,\u201d Majors said.\n\nHe died three weeks later.\n\nFor thousands of years, the dreams and visions of the dying have captivated cultures. They appear in medieval writings and Renaissance paintings, in Shakespearean works and set pieces from 19th-century American and British novels, particularly by Dickens. One of the most famous moments in film is the mysterious deathbed murmur in \u201cCitizen Kane\": \u201cRosebud!\u201d\n\nIn the modern medical world, doctors tend to give such experiences a wide berth, because \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the hell they are,\u201d said Dr. Timothy E. Quill, an expert on palliative care medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\nNow a team of clinicians and researchers led by Kerr are seeking to demystify these experiences and understand their role and importance in supporting \u201ca good death\u201d \u2014 for the patient and the bereaved.\n\nThese events are distinct from \u201cnear-death experiences,\u201d such as those recalled by people revived in intensive care units, said Pei C. Grant, director of the research team. \u201cThese are people on a journey towards death, not people who just missed it.\u201d\n\nHospice Buffalo, in Cheektowaga, New York, cares for 5,000 patients a year, mostly with visits to private homes and nursing facilities. After doctors, nurses, social workers or chaplains ask patients, \u201cHow have you been sleeping?\u201d they often follow up with, \u201cCan you recall any dreams?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was laying in bed and people were walking very slowly by me. The right-hand side I didn\u2019t know, but they were all very friendly and they touched my arm and my hand as they went by. But the other side were people that I knew \u2014 my mom and dad were there, my uncle. Everybody I knew that was dead was there. The only thing was, my husband wasn\u2019t there, nor was my dog, and I knew that I would be seeing them.\u201d \u2014 Jeanne Faber, 75, months before her death from ovarian cancer.\n\nFor their primary study, published in The Journal of Palliative Medicine, the researchers conducted multiple interviews with 59 terminally ill patients admitted to acute care at Hospice Buffalo. Nearly all the patients reported having had dreams or visions. They described the majority of their dreams as comforting. About one in every five was associated with distress.\n\nThe dreams and visions loosely sorted into categories: opportunities to engage with the deceased; loved ones \u201cwaiting\"; unfinished business. Themes of love, given or withheld, coursed through the dreams, as did the need for resolution and forgiveness. In their dreams, patients were reassured that they had been good parents, children and workers. They packed boxes, preparing for journeys, and, like Majors, often traveled with dear companions as guides. Although many patients said they rarely remembered their dreams, these they could not forget.\n\nThis is certainly research in its infancy. Quill said he believed the studies would help make these experiences more accessible to skeptical doctors.\n\n\u201cThe huge challenge of this work is to help patients feel more normal and less alone during this unusual experience of dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more we can articulate that people do have vivid dreams and visions, the more we can be helpful.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks and days before death, the dreams of the patients in the study tended to occur with greater frequency, populated with the dead rather than the living. The researchers suggest that such phenomena might even have prognostic value.\n\n\u201cI was an aggressive physician, always asking, \u2018Is there more we can do?\u2019 \u201d said Kerr. \u201cThere was a patient who I thought needed to be rehydrated, and we could buy him some time.\u201d But, he said, a nurse, familiar with the patient\u2019s dreams, cautioned: \"'You don\u2019t get it. He is seeing his dead mother.\u2019 He died two days later.\u201d\n\nWhile the patient was lying in bed, her mother by her side, she had a vision: She saw her mother\u2019s best friend, Mary, who died of leukemia years ago, in her mother\u2019s bedroom, playing with the curtains. Mary\u2019s hair was long again. \u201cI had a feeling she was coming to say, \u2018You\u2019re going to be OK.\u2019 I felt relief and happiness and I wasn\u2019t afraid of it at all.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Stone, 13, who had Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, a type of bone cancer, a few months before she died.\n\nMany in hospice suffer from delirium, which can affect up to 85 percent of hospitalized patients at the end of life. In a delirious state, brought on by fever, brain metastases or end-stage changes in body chemistry, circadian rhythms are severely disordered, so the patient may not know whether he is awake or dreaming. Cognition is altered.\n\nThose who care for the terminally ill are inclined to see end-of-life dreams as manifestations of delirium. But the Hospice Buffalo researchers say that while some study patients slipped in and out of delirium, their end-of-life dreams were not, by definition, the product of such a state. Delirious patients generally cannot engage with others or give a coherent, organized narrative.\n\nYet the question remains of what to make of these patients\u2019 claims of \u201cdreaming while awake,\u201d or having \u201cvisions\u201d \u2014 and the not-uncommon phenomena of seeing deceased relatives or friends hovering on the ceiling or in corners.\n\nDonna Brennan, a longtime nurse with Hospice Buffalo, recalled chatting on the couch with a 92-year-old patient with congestive heart failure. Suddenly, the patient looked over at the door and called out, \u201cJust a minute, I\u2019m speaking with the nurse.\u201d\n\nTold that no one was there, the patient smiled, saying it was Aunt Janiece (her dead sister) and patted a couch cushion, showing \u201cthe visitor\u201d where to sit. Then the patient cheerfully turned back to Brennan and finished her conversation.\n\nIn her notes, Brennan described the episode as a \u201challucination,\u201d a red flag for delirium. When the episode was recounted to Kerr and Anne Banas, a Hospice Buffalo physician, they preferred the term \u201cvision.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there meaning to the vision or is it disorganized?\u201d Banas asked. \u201cIf there is meaning, does that need to be explored? Does it bring comfort or is it distressing? We have a responsibility to ask that next question. It can be cathartic, and patients often need to share. And if we don\u2019t ask, look what we may miss.\u201d\n\nThe patient had never really talked about the war. But in his final dreams, the bloody dying were everywhere. He was a 17-year-old gunner on a rescue boat, trying frantically to bring them back to the USS Texas. \u201cThere is nothing but death and dead soldiers all around me,\u201d he said. In another, a dead soldier told him, \u201cThey are going to come get you next week.\u201d Finally, he dreamed of getting his discharge papers, which he described as \u201ccomforting.\u201d He died in his sleep two days later. \u2014 John, 88, who had lymphoma.\n\nNot all end-of-life dreams soothe the dying. Researchers found that about 20 percent were upsetting. Often, those who had suffered trauma might revisit it in their dying dreams.\n\nWhen should doctors intervene? Kerr said: \u201cChildren will see their parents in an altered state and think they\u2019re suffering and fighting their dying. But if you say: \u2018She\u2019s talking about dead people, and that\u2019s normal. I\u2019ll bet you can learn a lot about her and your family,\u2019 you may see the relative calming down and taking notes.\u201d\n\nWithout receiving sufficient information from the family, a team may not know how to read the patient\u2019s agitation. One patient seemed tormented by nightmares. The Hospice Buffalo team interviewed family members, who reluctantly disclosed that the woman had been sexually abused as a girl. The family was horrified that she was reliving these memories in her dying days.\n\nArmed with this information, the team chose to administer anti-anxiety medication. The woman relaxed and was able to have a powerful exchange with a priest. She died during a quiet sleep several days later.\n\n\u201cWe should be opening the door with our questions, but not forcing patients through it,\u201d Quill said. \u201cOur job is witnessing, exploring and lessening their loneliness. If it\u2019s benign and rich with content, let it go. But if it brings up serious old wounds, get real help \u2014 a psychologist, a chaplain \u2014 because in this area, we physicians don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. \u201d\n\nIn the first dream, a black spider with small eyes came close to her face. Then it turned into a large black truck with a red flatbed, bearing down on her. Terrified, she forced herself awake. In another dream, she had to pass through her laundry room to get to the kitchen. She glanced down and saw about 50 black spiders crawling on the floor. She was so scared! But when she looked closer, she saw they were ladybugs. She felt so happy! \u201cLadybugs are nice and I knew they weren\u2019t going to hurt me,\u201d she recounted later. \u201cSo I made my way to the kitchen.\"\u2014 Rosemary Shaffer, 78, two months before she died of colon cancer.\n\nThe Hospice Buffalo researchers have found that these dreams offer comfort not only for the dying, but for their mourners.\n\nSeveral months ago, Brennan, the nurse, sat with a distraught husband, whose wife had pancreatic cancer that had spread to the liver. She had been reporting dreams about work, God and familiar people who had died. The patient thought that she would be welcomed in heaven, she said. That God told her she had been a good wife and mother.\n\n\u201cHer husband was angry at God,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI said: \u2018But Ann is not. Her dreams aren\u2019t scary to her at all. They are all about validation.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe just put his head down and wept.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/02/dying.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The Hospice Buffalo researchers have found that these dreams offer comfort not only for the dying, but for their mourners.\nOften, those who had suffered trauma might revisit it in their dying dreams.\nFor thousands of years, the dreams and visions of the dying have captivated cultures.\nIn their dreams, patients were reassured that they had been good parents, children and workers.\nBut in his final dreams, the bloody dying were everywhere."}
