It enabled the fund-raising efforts to support Shanesha Taylor, the Arizona woman who was arrested in March for leaving her kids in her car while she was at a job interview. A few years ago, after the Susan G. Komen foundation declared that it would not provide grants to Planned Parenthood, a massive online protest led it to reverse its position.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been the rise of big-name women (and men) who make feminism central to what they\u2019re selling. I hesitate to even bring up her name, so acrimonious are the divisions around her, but we\u2019re clearly going to go there eventually, so we should talk about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Lean In, her book about workplace inequity. And about Beyonc\u00e9, who in August danced in front of a giant, lit-up FEMINIST banner at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s definition of feminism playing in the background\u2014an image I never could have conjured as a young person in the \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but ...\u201d universe. There are comedians like Tina Fey, a Hollywood macher who has noted, among other things, that \u201cthe definition of \u2018crazy\u2019 in show business is a woman who keeps talking even after no one wants to fuck her anymore,\u201d and there are male entertainers, from Louis CK to John Oliver, who speak often and incisively about gender.\n\nThen there are the women working within other formerly exclusively male arenas. Three on the Supreme Court! They may be stuck in a numerically futile position, but all are eager to loudly rebuke and amend the dangerous decisions made by some of their male colleagues. There are women in Congress, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Rosa DeLauro, who are presenting legislation about paid family leave, college rape, and sexual assault in the military, while state legislators such as Ohio\u2019s great Nina Turner crusade against restrictions on voting and reproductive rights.\n\nOf course that gets us to the seriously bad stuff, which I believe is tied directly to women\u2019s increasing influence. We live in a world of ever-tightening constriction, in corporate America and in state legislatures, of the very liberties\u2014enfranchisement, reproductive health care\u2014on which women have built their contemporary power. The growing class chasm means that America\u2019s women are offered starkly divergent scales of possibility. Some profit hugely from post\u2013Second Wave economic, educational, and professional opportunities; others are pushed ever further from their rights as full citizens.\n\nSpeaking of which, I can\u2019t end this missive without acknowledging this circumstance: The two people embarking on this exchange are white, educated, middle-class women who live in New York City. In this, we are demonstrating the ways in which public feminism has developed far too little, and are emblematic of many of the mechanisms that keep big-platform feminism narrower than it should be. Which brings us to a bigger question: Is this moment actually taking us somewhere new? Is it progress?\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say so, but I don\u2019t agree that the state of the conversation about feminism is grounds for optimism. I mean, sure, it\u2019s better to have the beautiful people think the word \u201cfeminist\u201d is cool than to have them sneer at it. And there is something thrilling about watching Beyonc\u00e9 stand militantly in front of a lit-up backsplash of the term at the VMAs\u2014though it\u2019s also jarring to have the word reduced to a fetish object by a high priestess of the misogynistic cult that is American pop music, especially when she has just finished a pole-dancing number.\n\nBut feminist Internet discourse doesn\u2019t do much for me, no matter how robust it may be or how much money it gins up for the people and causes that happen to have gone viral on any particular day. People talk\u2014and talk\u2014about everything on the Internet, but that doesn\u2019t mean the talk changes anything. Too much online feminist conversation bounces around in a giant echo chamber, a cacophony of exegeses of exegeses of exegeses, each offering a diminishing return to time invested in reading. (That\u2019s my perspective.) On the other hand, it\u2019s fair to say that a smaller portion of such writing is indeed very good. (That\u2019s probably your perspective.) This is the eternal proportion of crap to real thinking on just about every subject in just about every medium in the world. So, to paraphrase the rabbi in an old joke: Maybe we\u2019re both right.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by good and bad. Good: One of my favorite feminist bloggers, Jessica Grose of Slate, who does sustained enterprise-reporting and bases her opinions on thoughtfully curated studies and data. Bad: ideological-purity-policing hashtag activism, as outlined in Michelle Goldberg\u2019s excellent \u201cFeminism\u2019s Toxic Twitter Wars\u201d in The Nation this January. Goldberg describes the preparations for a 2012 conference at Barnard on online feminism. Critics attacked its sponsors for holding the conference in New York and not paying for non\u2013New Yorkers to attend, for not addressing this issue or that one. The hostile tweets and online comments got \u201cso vitriolic,\u201d wrote Goldberg, \u201cso full of bad faith and stubborn misinformation, that it felt like some sort of Maoist hazing.\u201d Goldberg ends with a lament from Anna Holmes, late of Jezebel, now of Fusion: The women\u2019s blogosphere, said Holmes, \u201cfeels like a much more insular, protective, brittle environment than it did before. It\u2019s really depressing. ... It makes me think I got out at the right time.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s turn to feminism itself. I\u2019ve read your note twice, and I\u2019m still not sure what you think its main causes should be. I think it\u2019s necessary to prioritize, rather than just express general optimism or pessimism. A heroine of mine, Martha Nussbaum, writes that, if you care about human flourishing (a term she uses as shorthand for such things as access to health care and education, political and personal empowerment, a capacity to cultivate one\u2019s creativity, and so on), then you have to ask: \u201cAmong the many things human beings might develop the capacity to do, which are the really valuable ones, which are the ones that a minimally just society will endeavor to nurture and support?\u201d Another heroine is the political scientist Theda Skocpol, an expert on the politics of social change, who has shown, among other things, how much nineteenth- and early twentieth-century women did to lay the groundwork for the welfare state. I asked her what she thought about the welter of feminist issues abroad in the land, and she said, \u201cPolitics is about deciding what you\u2019re going to emphasize.\u201d\n\nSo let me lay out what I think we should emphasize. These issues are all bound up in each other, but for the sake of simplicity I\u2019ll take them one by one.\n\n1. Sexual violence. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job fighting it in this country. I don\u2019t know how to quantify this impression, but it seems to me that rape has never been as widely condemned as it is in the United States today. Obviously, too many people are still too confused about what rape is and too many women still don\u2019t feel safe reporting it to the police.\n\nBut here\u2019s something I\u2019ve been noticing about the campus rape scandal, the most recent focus of media outrage. Most universities do a remarkably bad job of delivering fair treatment to everyone involved\u2014victims and defendants. The entire process is fuzzy and arbitrary and all too easily swayed by external considerations, such as sparing the university from embarrassment. I don\u2019t mean to dismiss the ugliness of frat-house rape; I\u2019m just worried because I don\u2019t hear a lot of talk about the rights of the accused. Due process is a feminist issue too, because if we don\u2019t insist that rape be defined very clearly (as it is not on some campuses) and prosecuted fairly, we may find ourselves party to some pretty egregious stuff. All you have to do is remember how rape charges were used to persecute black men in the Jim Crow South to be able to imagine what overzealous and poorly regulated rape prosecutions could lead to.\n\nMeanwhile, sexual violence remains horrific in many other parts of the globe, and that seems a more significant impediment to female equality than campus rape. Yes, you can sense inklings of awareness here and there; the local as well as international outcries about the gang rape of a student in India and the sexual assaults on Tahrir Square were heartening to witness. But, for instance, according to the United Nations\u2019 2014 Human Development Report, African women are nearly twice as likely to be the victims of sexual violence as women in low- and middle-income Europe. The report also points out that mass rape is increasingly common as a weapon of war. I wish I heard as much about that in the U.S. blogosphere.\n\n2. Lack of equal opportunity for women. Equal pay for equal work, gender bias, objectification, the leaning in, the leaning out\u2014there\u2019s lots to say about all of these, but also no end of chatter about them, so I\u2019m going to gloss over them for now. I\u2019ll just say that I don\u2019t think that successful individuals who happen to be female will or can do much to help women in the workplace and in politics, since the barriers to equality are more structural than personal. (I should exclude from this generalization women in positions to introduce laws or make judicial decisions.)\n\n3. Systematic discrimination against caregivers. I\u2019ve put this last, but I actually think it ranks first in importance. And I\u2019m going to admit to some sneaking solidarity with the women of the \u201990s. I\u2019m sort of sick of the word \u201cfeminism.\u201d If I had my way, we\u2019d replace it with something less gender-specific, like \u201ccaregiverism.\u201d That\u2019s ugly, I know. We\u2019d have to come up with something better. But \u201cfeminist,\u201d to me, falls short of the meaning that Adichie describes in the clip played by Beyonc\u00e9: \u201cthe social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.\u201d We won\u2019t achieve that kind of equality just by telling girls they, too, can be ambitious, as Adichie does. We have to go much deeper. We have to make it unacceptable to denigrate the work of care, which means challenging a hierarchy of values that goes back at least to the Ancient Greeks.\n\nFeminists should become caregiverists as a way of establishing that the invisibility and unprotected status of caregivers is by no means only a women\u2019s issue. It is at the very least a national one: The stark difference in the quality of the child care available to the poor and the rich perpetuates inequality and makes a mockery of the American ideal of meritocracy. Work-life balance (that odious euphemism!) must also be seen as part of a larger structural problem. Limiting work hours used to be one of the great causes of the labor movement; even as the working day has grown longer and longer, this issue has dropped off the agenda\u2014for many reasons, among them the globalization of finance and just-in-time manufacturing, both of which make it hard to impose standard schedules. Nonetheless, without this broader perspective, we tend to think of our solutions to the problem of undone domestic labor as personal dilemmas\u2014opting out, opting in\u2014rather than as Hobson\u2019s choices imposed on us by a shrinking amount of time available to do chores. Meanwhile, women who \u201copt out\u201d pay a high price for the privilege. Ann Crittenden, in The Price of Motherhood, explains that college-educated mothers pay more than $1 million in a \u201cmommy tax\u201d\u2014the earnings they lose while they pump out new little sources of labor and raise them by the sweat of their unpaid brows. (The figure is surely higher now; that book came out in 2001.)\n\nI could (and will) get more specific about why I think caregiving should rise to the top of the list, but for now, I\u2019ll turn this over to you.\n\nHi Judith,\n\nI\u2019m not sure we disagree about the challenges facing women and men today. Where we differ is in our attitudes to what\u2019s being done to tackle them.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Internet: You write that the talk-talk-talk of online feminism doesn\u2019t do much for you. Fair enough! I acknowledged a degree of that frustration in my initial note. But I find it unproductive and frankly silly to wholly dismiss the value of the feminist Internet, especially since the Web may not make your toes tap, but it is the communicative tool of the generations following us; writing off the exchanges happening there is both disrespectful and risky. No matter how irritated you\u2014or I\u2014may be by some of the empty-calorie content of social media, it\u2019s a tool that has been crucial to real-world political events, from the Arab Spring to Barack Obama\u2019s election.\n\nYour conviction that online feminist discourse isn\u2019t worth much is a breezy dismissal of an awfully large and multifaceted phenomenon. In any social movement, there are approaches that provoke frustration; I had qualms about the usefulness of \u201cSlutwalks,\u201d for example. But your generalized scorn entirely writes off the value of contemporary organizing (as in the North Carolina exercise in civil disobedience known as Moral Mondays or the push-back against Komen) and of the airing of individual stories that shed light on issues related to gender, race, and class. What happened to Shanesha Taylor, for example\u2014one of the viral causes / people you view as random and uninteresting\u2014is symptomatic of the very inequities faced by the caregivers, mothers, and workers who you name as the number-one priority of feminism.\n\nYou voice confusion at my failure to lay out my own list of priorities. That wasn\u2019t accidental. Feminism is a massive project; I don\u2019t believe in the utility of ranking its aims. My view of its broadest goal is closest to your second priority: equality of opportunity. But inequality of opportunity is experienced in many ways: lack of child care, family leave, and equal pay protections; sexual and domestic violence; gendered, racial, and class prejudices within education; absence of respect for both paid and unpaid domestic labor, which you so correctly highlight; lack of equal representation in government and in positions of professional power; messages of diminishment sent by the entertainment industries; limits on access to reproductive health care; unjust policing practices and violence against people of color; the rock-bottom minimum wage and middle-class wage stagnation. The list is endless. These are all feminist issues, and there is no one person, group, or cause that is going to satisfactorily address them all.\n\nWhich is why I am dubious about pronouncements about what feminism \u201cshould\u201d be concentrating on. It leads to the \u201cHow can you worry about X when Y is so much more pressing?\u201d rhetorical dodge. Usually, I find, X and Y are both pressing in their own ways. I\u2019ve been suspicious of this move ever since the feminist leader Eleanor Smeal asked me, some years ago, why I\u2019d focus a story on the role of morality within the abortion battle when women were dying from fistula around the world. Yes, women suffer from fistula. But how morality has been framed within the abortion debate is also important; it\u2019s part of the rhetoric that has led to the shuttering of clinics around the United States a decade later.\n\nYou seem to be deploying this tactic when you suggest that, while sexual violence in the United States is a problem, \u201crape has never been as widely condemned as it is in the United States today,\u201d and that there should be more focus on international sexual violence. That evaluation doesn\u2019t really take us, or feminism, anywhere productive. I mean: Sure, sexual violence is a persistently horrific problem around the world and rape has never been as widely condemned as it is in the United States today. But that\u2019s a pitifully low bar, given that marital rape was legal in many states a few decades ago, and that the Centers for Disease Control have reported that one in five women have been raped in their lifetime; reported numbers are often higher for women of color. Sexual violence has not been adequately redressed, in the United States or abroad.\n\nWe agree about protecting the rights of the accused. I\u2019m married to a criminal defense attorney who has defended many an alleged rapist and am keenly aware of problematic policing and prosecutorial practices. But again (fistula), it\u2019s possible to care simultaneously about teaching men not to rape and about ensuring that those accused of any crime receive the full protections of our legal system. I don\u2019t need to cast back to the Jim Crow South to imagine the unjust punishment of questionably accused individuals; I need simply pay attention to the rate and manner in which African American men are arrested and imprisoned in 2014.\n\nYou write of your wish that coverage of international sexual violence and rape got as much ink as campus sexual assault, with a nod to \u201cinklings of awareness\u201d about the Delhi gang rape and assaults in Tahrir Square. I\u2019m surprised by your impression that even the shallow world of popular media is silent on these questions. Sexual violence around the world is a focus of an enormous amount of media and political attention. This summer, at a global summit on sexual violence, Hillary Clinton spoke of how \u201crape and other forms of sexual violence are not inevitable in war, and we can end this scourge.\u201d Delegates from 150 countries signed a pledge to end impunity for wartime rape. Make no mistake: Ending sexual violence as a war crime is a Sisyphean task, no matter how many activists, leaders, or celebrities (Angelina Jolie was a co-organizer of the summit) work away at it. But in your pessimism, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re missing a lot of the contemporary conversation.\n\nI have both patience and sympathy for your argument against the notion that \u201csuccessful individuals who happen to be female will or can do much to help women in the workplace and in politics, since the barriers to equality are more structural than personal.\u201d And yet even though the barriers are structural, that doesn\u2019t mean that individuals don\u2019t have any role to play. Big-name branding is not the be-all of a feminist revival, but the capitalist pole-dancers occupy mighty pop pulpits and their voices carry. I\u2019d rather have those voices talking about feminism than not talking about it. By all means, let\u2019s hash out the inconsistencies surrounding those figures: It\u2019s healthy to consider the fact that a woman who puts FEMINIST in lights also informs men that, if they \u201cliked it, they should have put a ring on it.\u201d And yet past battles were fought by leaders just as beset by problematic contradictions (see, for example, the racism of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, or the homophobia and white middle-class myopia of Betty Friedan).\n\nIn turn, I\u2019m also surprised by your lack of interest in the way the Internet might destigmatize feminism for young people. Surely some of these young people will leave feminism behind or disavow it. But others will become the activists, reformers, laborers, lawmakers, scientists, and businesspeople who shape the future. If they\u2019re emerging from a youthful culture that has offered them (and their peers) some feminist context, they are far more likely to enjoy support for their work.\n\nFurther, I\u2019m not convinced that trotting out examples of how bad things are for women is a compelling argument against the health of contemporary feminist discourse. Yes, things are bad for women (and men) for many reasons related to gender and power. That\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s so crucial that more people are talking about feminism, even if they\u2019re just talking.\n\nBut I don\u2019t buy that it\u2019s just talk. Paid family leave used to be a third-rail issue. Today, we may be ages from federal legislation, but on Labor Day weekend, California became the second state to pass paid-sick-day legislation. Next year, New York could follow California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island in offering paid family leave, surely among the most crucial of policy advances.\n\nLook, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that plenty is grim and not devolve into empty-headed cheerleading. But it\u2019s also important to acknowledge expansions of possibility, lest we get mired in a sense of futility\u2014which never got any social movement anywhere.\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nYou say optimism, I say pessimism\u2014let\u2019s move on. I\u2019d love to know where you think we should go from here. I know you\u2019re dubious about pronouncing on what \u201cfeminism \u2018should\u2019 be concentrating on,\u201d but I can\u2019t believe you yourself don\u2019t pick and choose off the menu of causes you so thoughtfully and encyclopedically offer. I do believe in ranking them; to your assertion that prioritizing some feminist issues above others amounts to a rhetorical dodge, I\u2019d reply that it can be an exercise in imposing philosophical rigor\u2014and political focus.\n\nRemember the Whos down in Whoville, from Horton Hears a Who, and the mean kangaroos who doubted their existence? \u201cCall a big meeting. Get everyone out. Make every Who holler! Make every Who shout!\u201d The point is that they had to do it together, with a single objective in view. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, every Who is going to end up in a beezle-nut stew!\u201d\n\nHi Judith,\n\nNo, I\u2019m not wild about ranking priorities. But I agree that we are plagued by a lack of any clear-cut agenda. Earlier generations of activists have had some real legislative bull\u2019s-eyes to shoot for: abolition, suffrage, legal abortion. Elaine Showalter recently noted that \u201ca mass movement requires a clear goal, compelling enough to unite people across the dividing lines of race, class, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, and persuade them to work collectively to achieve it. The goal must be concrete and attainable, even if its ideological underpinnings are complex or contradictory.\u201d Sure, no problem, Elaine! Let\u2019s get on that. But seriously, she has a point. So here goes:\n\nFederally mandated paid family leave (and sick-day legislation): The nation\u2019s failure to provide economic security to those who need time away from paid work to care for new children or ailing family members is both uncivilized and embarrassing.\n\nFederally subsidized child care: Do not call me crazy; I am \u201cidealistic.\u201d Americans need accessible, affordable, quality day care to make both professional and familial universes more functional and humane.\n\nFederal equal pay protection: Obviously.\n\nRaise the minimum wage: It could be done now, and it would have a direct impact on millions of Americans.\n\nRepeal Hyde: Legislatively, this is one massive national project that I would encourage feminists of every persuasion to get behind. It surely doesn\u2019t feel attainable right now, but nor did gay marriage 15 years ago. So I\u2019m going with this one from the heart: One of the keys to socio-economic justice for American women across all classes and races is to remove the provision that has, since 1976, barred the use of federal funds to pay for abortion for women in need, including Medicaid recipients.\n\nHeading into more symbolic realms, we should:\n\nPass the Equal Rights Amendment. I know, I know: It\u2019s only 24 words, but those words are so sensible that it\u2019s just nutsy that they are not in our Constitution. And the defeat of the ERA became so symbolic of the cessation of feminist advance that its adoption would send a message of resilience.\n\nElect a feminist woman president. I am not suggesting that feminists must rally around Hillary Clinton in 2016, nor issuing any kind of ovarian imperative to support a woman, any woman. I\u2019m merely suggesting that the fact that we\u2019ve only had men in the White House is no inconsequential thing\u2014and that should feminists encounter a candidate with whom they largely agree, and should that candidate also be female, then a movement to make her president would be powerful and potentially unifying. And while I know that an individual atop a screwed-up government can only do so much, research suggests that the election of one female politician makes it more likely that voters will support female politicians in the future, which in turn inspires more women to get into politics, yadda, yadda. Again: I\u2019m not saying it has to be Hillary.\n\nHaving laid out these big goals, I want to return to an exploration of why, so far, the well-intentioned energy of youthful feminism has been so diffuse and unfocused. One reason is that the Internet has permitted the conversations to become more diverse, thus increasing the number of perspectives: a good thing! But the less-good aspect is one that you edge toward in your earlier distinctions between \u201cgood\u201d feminist media vs. \u201cbad\u201d feminist media. The writers you cited affirmatively\u2014Grose, Goldberg, and Holmes\u2014are, like the two of us, paid to think about these issues. Many young activists and writers are paid little or nothing for their advocacy work while laboring elsewhere to make a living. After all, Twitter is democratizing precisely because it invites everyone to produce content for no money!\n\nWe\u2019re roughly the same age, Judith, positioned between the Second Wave, which preceded us, and the crowd of youngsters behind us. Perhaps it\u2019s the scant decade between us\u2014or maybe just our individual inclinations\u2014that leaves you slightly more attuned to the skepticism I hear voiced by our elders and me slightly more sympathetic to the scattershot exuberance of the Internet kids. But mostly we both enjoy a good and distant view of both sides of a generational chasm. And here\u2019s a pragmatic reality that that view makes clear: Young people don\u2019t have money\u2014to support their journalism or organizing or to build infrastructure. What money there is in feminism is both in the hands of older women\u2014who, for some of the very comprehensible reasons you outline, remain wary of the loosey-goosiness of young feminism\u2014and in the hands of wealthy women, like, say Beyonc\u00e9 and Sheryl Sandberg, figures whom many critics would like to chase out of feminism.\n\nTo which I say: Please, ladies of all ages and capitalist profiles, don\u2019t go anywhere! Let\u2019s sit down and warmly discuss how we might all get along better! Because the movement needs energy from some of you, Web savvy from others, and cash from everyone who has some to spare. So if we could all just hear each other out, maybe then we could focus on some tangible goals.\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to grapple with here, but time is short because I have work-life-balance problems of my own today\u2014early school dismissal, children\u2019s dentistry, the pesky critters will have teeth\u2014and I can\u2019t resist your provocation. So tell me. When have young activists and writers ever had money? For that matter, when have middle-aged ones, unless they\u2019re philanthropist- activists like Arianna Huffington or corporate feminists like Sheryl Sandberg?\n\nIf you want action, you organize. That\u2019s not new. You form pressure groups, take to the streets, work within the system or outside it. Money certainly helps make all this happen, but it has never been plentiful for outsiders trying to effect change.\n\nToo much online feminist conversation bounces around in a giant echo chamber, a cacophony of exegeses of exegeses of exegeses.\n\nIf you want an open mike for women\u2019s opinions, there\u2019s the Internet. That\u2019s also democracy in action, as you have so eloquently argued, plus of course it\u2019s emancipatingly free. Yes, it has become harder to make a living as a writer of the sort we both admire\u2014by the way, we have the Internet to blame for that\u2014and yet I don\u2019t feel as sorry for up-and-coming journalists as you do, since established ones are also losing their jobs. In any case, it has never been possible to make much of a living writing essays or books about political ideas: Almost everyone has almost always needed grants or day jobs for that.\n\nFor their part, yes, activists used to have unions to bankroll them, and no, unions aren\u2019t what they used to be, but in this age of professionalized public-interest foundations, agencies, lobbying groups, etc., would-be activists still have access to decent paychecks. They didn\u2019t, for example, during the Progressive Era, which arose as a reaction to the Gilded Age, the period in U.S. history most like ours in its extreme social inequality and immobility. Some of its most influential writer / activists were born into rural poverty (Ida Tarbell) or to families bankrupted, say, by a father\u2019s alcoholism (the crusading novelist Upton Sinclair.) Al Smith, four-time New York governor and the very exemplar of the reform politician (despite those ties to Tammany Hall) was born and raised on the Lower East Side, the son of Irish immigrants who left school to work at age 13. Sure, it\u2019s harder to agitate when you start at the bottom, but the key to being politically effective is to be loud, not rich.\n\nHi Judith,\n\nA few things, starting with your question about when have activists ever had money: Money and class have often directly played into activism, in ways that have not always been pretty. In everything from fashions (short hair and dresses) to social freedoms (women walking unaccompanied on streets), marriage patterns, and economic independence, it has often been poor women and women of color who have pioneered revolutionary behaviors, usually out of economic necessity. But it\u2019s often not until white middle-class women ape those behaviors (which turn out to be liberating) that they become discernible as revolutionary.\n\nFor instance: In the 1920s, the black writer Elise McDougald wrote about the liberating aspects of paid labor in new fields for black women in Harlem; a decade later, the black lawyer Sadie Alexander eloquently laid out the many benefits of female work outside the home. Yet it was 30 years later that Betty Friedan, a white middle-class woman addressing similar arguments to a white middle-class audience, was credited with kicking off feminism\u2019s Second Wave. (I\u2019m not endorsing this model, but rather countering your notion that past advances have existed outside a context of wealth.)\n\nOften, it has been financially comfortable people who are most able to lend their time to organizing and opining, and not to scraping by. And I don\u2019t mean to simply tag women here: Karl Marx was middle class; Martin Luther King Jr. was middle class; the Port Huron Statement begins with a description of Students for a Democratic Society activists \u201cbred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.\u201d\n\nOf course, movements have also been led by people whose experiences of subjugation shaped their activism\u2014Frederick Douglass, Fannie Lou Hamer, Dorothy Hughes\u2014and by those whose devotion to agitation over money-making has left them struggling. But the nation\u2019s economic structures have changed. Shulamith Firestone died in 2012 in her East Village apartment, which she rented for around $400 a month. It is no longer possible to live in the East Village for $400 a month\u2014or East Bushwick, for that matter.\n\nThings are bad right now for millennials\u2014the very people who are freshly invested in popularizing feminism. Young people enter adulthood hobbled by unprecedented student debt, facing a paucity of jobs and lowered earnings and even worse prospects should they forgo college; they\u2019re living with their parents, are economically barred from many of the cities that make organizing more possible.\n\nYou\u2019re right that the Internet permits a new form of gathering\u2014I think now you\u2019re making my argument about its usefulness back at me! But let\u2019s consider the efficacy of noise-making without funding today. The Supreme Court has just gutted the Voting Rights Act and created a post\u2013Citizens United world in which voting has become harder and literally purchasing representative power has become easier. The impoverishment of youthful agitators is not same-as-it-ever-was La Boh\u00e8me\u2013ism. It\u2019s a structurally supported impediment to altering the dynamics of power.\n\nSo now who\u2019s pessimistic? Though let me recover a smidgen of sunniness by saying that I believe that the restriction of freedoms for women, people of color, and poor people are the death throes of the old status quo. But it\u2019s ridiculous to pretend that money and influence have been incidental to social movements: They\u2019ve been pretty central. That\u2019s partly why it\u2019s important that we not throw the capitalists out with the bathwater.\n\nSpeaking of money and class, I\u2019ve been thinking about policy advances: how they\u2019ve worked in the past and about the likelihood that future concrete achievements will be offered up only alongside deeply destructive compromises. The 14th and 15th Amendments granted black men, but not women of any color, the franchise, creating a terrible rift between abolitionists and suffragists who had long worked in tandem. Fifty years later, Carrie Chapman Catt, the head of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, supported Woodrow Wilson\u2019s entry into World War I, enraging her pacifist feminist allies, but probably ensuring the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment, which would allow them the vote.\n\nWere we to imagine a future that included federal paid-family-leave legislation\u2014to pick an example we both believe to be vital\u2014we\u2019d have to imagine the tolls that might be exacted in its passage. Consider that, when California recently passed its paid-sick-day legislation, it left out home health care workers. And remember that, when Social Security was created in 1935, it excluded domestic and agricultural workers. It\u2019s not hard to envision a future paid-leave act that cuts out Americans who need it the most: shift workers, minimum-wage earners, home health care professionals. Such legislation could be a boon to gender equality for millions of Americans, but it could simultaneously crowbar open an even deeper class (and race) chasm between those it benefits and those it leaves out.\n\nHow do we move forward without simply walking straight into a repetition of history, in which victories tear apart the coalitions that make them possible? Is it feminist support of more economic populists like Elizabeth Warren? An intensive commitment to voting rights, to ensure that the government actually represents the diverse population it serves? How else can we realistically\u2014and optimistically\u2014prepare ourselves to get the work done without incurring major losses?\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nLet me tell you a story. During World War II, day care centers filled the land. You know why: America needed women to do the jobs formerly done by the men now fighting overseas. Newspaper stories about children left in cars and chained to trailer homes, along with the congressional testimony of female union members, convinced the government to fund the day care programs that would allow mothers to go to work. Congress passed the Lanham Act in 1940. It ultimately paid for 3,102 centers that enrolled around 600,000 children\u2014not nearly enough centers, but nothing like it had ever been seen before.\n\nThe Lanham Act was not meant to be permanent, and in 1946, Congress ended its funding and most of the centers shut down immediately. In some places, however, the centers did not close. One such place was Philadelphia, because the mothers of that city wrote letters and petitioned and erupted in protests to keep at least 20 centers open. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t done by next Thursday,\u201d a woman declared at one City Council meeting, \u201cwe will have 200 women, with the children, in the balconies of the City Council\u2019s chambers.\u201d The women kept the centers alive for two more years. In 1948, when the city decided not to allocate any more money, 150 sign-wielding mothers buttonholed councilmembers at City Hall. The police kicked them out, but the women got a permit and returned. They had public sentiment on their side\u2014\u201cnever before have readers exhibited such overwhelmingly strong support for a measure,\u201d wrote Philadelphia\u2019s The Bulletin\u2014and by 1949, they had won an imperfect victory. The mayor agreed to fund the centers out of the budget from his own office. He couldn\u2019t get the councilmembers to give public day care a single dollar out of the municipal budget. Nonetheless, ten centers operated well into the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWho were these women?\u201d asks historian Elizabeth Rose, who tells this story in Mother\u2019s Job: The History of Day Care, 1890\u20131960. \u201cThey always identified themselves as working mothers who used the child care centers ... and none of their leaders seem to have been publicly prominent in Philadelphia in subsequent years.\u201d Rose speculates that they were recruited through the centers\u2019 parents\u2019 associations and met during pick-up and drop-off.\n\nIt would make a great movie, don\u2019t you think? And it tells me that change doesn\u2019t require professional middle-class activists. (Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t be the ones leading the way. I\u2019m just saying they don\u2019t have to be.) More than middle-class approbation, change requires rage, persistence, and on-the-ground organization. A thriving network of civic associations available for mobilization doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nThis is one reason I do not agree that federally subsidized day care is far-fetched or idealistic. (We have already come so close to getting it\u2014think of the Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1971, which would have funded universal day care had Richard Nixon not vetoed it.) I feel fairly sanguine that we could secure maternalist, if not strictly speaking feminist, social welfare policies in this country. But getting such legislation passed will require shoe leather and grit and tapping into existing pressure groups more than it will depend on elites talking to elites. It will come from grassroots organizations being willing to make compromises and unlikely alliances to get the necessary votes.\n\nWhat kind of strange bedfellows might these be? Maybe Hispanic Catholics. Maybe evangelical church groups. Maybe the Bob Caseys of this world, or other Democratic candidates who fall afoul of Emily\u2019s List by not taking the right position on abortion but who are electable and have views about health care, day care, and family leave that could help millions of women. I don\u2019t mean to give short shrift to reproductive rights; goodness knows my life has been predicated on them. But if we\u2019ve got to choose for now, I choose health care, day care, and family leave. For now.\n\nOne bedfellow I personally can\u2019t stand, but you can, because you realize, correctly, that we have to take our friends where we find them: the ever-present Sheryl Sandberg and her brand of Davos feminism. Even if the COO of Facebook sounds completely tone-deaf when she brags about improving parking for pregnant employees, even if the so-called Lean In movement is a sham dreamed up by her book publicist, if she highlights the problem of unequal pay for equal work, well then, OK. Would the exclusion of mostly minority home health care workers and others at the low end of the pay scale from paid-sick-leave legislation be grotesque, unjust? Absolutely. Should we take the legislation if we can get it? Absolutely. We build from there.\n\nI wonder whether, in the end, we\u2019ve met in the middle: You sounded a whole lot more Eeyorish in your last entry than when you started, and as we go on, I find myself developing a Charlie-Brown-like hope-against-hope for change in my lifetime. You chuckle at Elaine Showalter when she says feminists need an attainable goal that will unify us across all our dividing lines, but I think she\u2019s right, and I think \u201ccaregiverism\u201d might well be that goal. What do I want? Would I like women to stop having to pay that \u201cmommy tax\u201d? Would I like to stop paying it? Hell yes. Would I be satisfied, for now, with a deeply compromised version of a federal paid-leave bill or with state-by-state rather than federal funding for day care? Yes. (What is Bill DeBlasio\u2019s universal pre-K if not New York City\u2019s baby step in that direction?) We have to do what we can to make it possible for men as well as women to work and raise families at the same time, and we have to do it in the name of social equality and economic growth, not just in the name of feminism. This \u201cis the big unfinished business of the women\u2019s movement,\u201d Crittenden once said.
