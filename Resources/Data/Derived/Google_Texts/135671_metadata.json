That program reduces or eliminates out-of-pocket costs for hormone therapy. Those costs ranged from $155 to $428 a year, on average.\n\nSeventy percent of black patients and 56 percent of Hispanic patients were in the Extra Help program, compared with 21 percent of white patients, according to the study.\n\nIn the first year of hormone therapy, overall adherence rates were similar across all races -- with around two-thirds of women taking hormone therapy as directed. However, racial and ethnic differences in adherence rates were seen among women who weren't in the Extra Help Program -- 62 percent adherence for whites and 55 percent for Hispanics and blacks, the study found.\n\nFor those in the Extra Help program, adherence rates were 71 percent for whites, 71 percent for Hispanics and 67 percent for blacks, the researchers reported.\n\nOverall, the number of patients who continued hormone therapy in the second and third year after surgery decreased, but the decline was smaller among women in all racial and ethnic groups in the Extra Help program.\n\nFindings presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about hormone therapy for breast cancer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/breast-cancer-news-94/medicare-subsidy-helps-breast-cancer-patients-afford-treatment-692671.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/BREAST.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "'Extra Help' program leads to more women on hormone therapy, study reports", "title": "Medicare Subsidy Helps Breast Cancer Patients Afford Treatment"}, "description": "'Extra Help' program leads to more women on hormone therapy, study reports", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "More informationThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about hormone therapy for breast cancer.\nIn the first year of hormone therapy, overall adherence rates were similar across all races -- with around two-thirds of women taking hormone therapy as directed.\nEn Espa\u00f1olWEDNESDAY, Oct. 15, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- A Medicare subsidy program makes it more likely that breast cancer patients in all racial and ethnic groups will continue hormone therapy after surgery for their cancer, a new study found.\nSeventy percent of black patients and 56 percent of Hispanic patients were in the Extra Help program, compared with 21 percent of white patients, according to the study.\nFor those in the Extra Help program, adherence rates were 71 percent for whites, 71 percent for Hispanics and 67 percent for blacks, the researchers reported."}
