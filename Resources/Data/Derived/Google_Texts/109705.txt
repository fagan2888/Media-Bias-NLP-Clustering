For several months, Susan Rouillier and other volunteers have been working on a history project that involves the area from Brookley Field to Dog River. The time period covered extends from Native American to the present day. The group collecting the information is seeking photos of activities, events and places such as water-skiing, fishing, duck hunting, Grand View Park and pier, the Christmas parade, old houses when they were newer, World War II soldiers in the area, early churches and storefronts on Riverside Drive or Cedar Point Road, farm and dairy scenes, Delchamps and other businesses. Owners would not have to give up their photos; the group will make a copy and return the pictures to those who lend them.

Once the data is collected, it will be assembled into a book and published.
