In fact, anyone who has ever crunched the numbers for Medicaid expansion knows that the government health care program is a budget buster. The Foundation for Government Accountability has noted that on average, a state legislature needs to find two to three dollars in cuts in their receptive budgets just to save one dollar in Medicaid spending.\n\nIn Virginia, about a quarter of doctors aren\u2019t accepting new Medicaid recipients. In fact, a 2011 University of Virginia Study showed that those without insurance actually fared better than those enrolled in this government program. But alas, those who support hitching onto this public policy bandwagon, which is a key component of Obamacare, is due to the misconception that it helps the poor\u2013and that it\u2019s free money. Well, there is no such thing as free money, and most of the new people who are eligible for Medicaid benefits are able-bodied, childless adults who don\u2019t work. Yet, back to Ohio, its Medicaid expansion has already run over budget, as Jason Hart of Watchdog wrote last month:\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 federal health law has cost taxpayers $7 billion in a little more than two years. The federal government \u2014 which is $19 trillion in debt \u2014 paid $390 million for Ohio Medicaid expansion benefits in February, bringing the program\u2019s total cost since January 2014 to $7.1 billion. Kasich frames his Obamacare expansion as a fiscally responsible way to keep drug addicts and the mentally ill out of prison, even as costs zoom past his projections. The expansion was $1.5 billion over budget after 18 months. \u201cOhio\u2019s Obamacare expansion has already run $3.1 billion over budget and is on track to run nearly $8 billion over budget by the end of next year,\u201d Jonathan Ingram, research director at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, told Watchdog.org. \u201cFinding the funding to pay for those overruns will mean fewer resources for education, public safety, and care for the most vulnerable,\u201d Ingram said. [\u2026] Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost an average of $391 million per month \u2014 more than $1.5 billion per quarter \u2014 during the past six months. At this rate, expansion will cost $14.1 billion by August 2017 and $27.5 billion by June 2020.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This is a crosspost from Townhall.com\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Expensive.", "title": "Hey Gov.
