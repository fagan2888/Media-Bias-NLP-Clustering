This is my story.\n\nSheryl Del Conte (Photo: Submitted)\n\nI was planning a wedding. Only a month and a half until the big day. I went in for a routine check-up at a Planned Parenthood because I didn't have a regular gynecologist and my insurance wasn't great. They usually are booked up but they happened to have a cancellation.\n\nThey checked to see if I was pregnant and I told them that was not possible. They did three tests in total. I was baffled. They said I was the size of a 13-week pregnancy. I was stunned.\n\nThe doctor called the hospital to schedule an ultrasound, which were usually booked out by a month or more. There was a cancellation mere moments before our call, and they asked if I could come right over.\n\nMy mom was with me and drove me to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Meriden, Conn. immediately. They could not tell me results. Only my regular doctor could \u2014 but I didn't have one. They recommended someone but he's usually booked out. They would call and see.\n\nHe had a cancellation that morning and could see me right away. My mom and I went right over and he examined me and looked at the ultrasound images.\n\nWhat he told me next would change my life: \"You have a mini soccer ball-sized cyst attached to your right ovary. We have to remove it immediately.\"\n\nThe next day was labs and the day after \u2014 Friday, Feb. 23, 1994 \u2014 was surgery. It was a blur. Two days earlier, I had been picking out a wedding cake. Well, I did pick out a cake two days after my surgery, from my hospital bed, on the phone with the bakery. I had a bridal shower two weeks later and, with the swelling, my gown no longer fit me.\n\nBut what happened next put a cake and a gown into perspective.\n\nThe cyst was cancerous.\n\nWhat.\n\nI didn't know what to do. We believe we got it all, I was told, but we took your right ovary just in case. No chemo and no radiation. But what if they didn't get everything? Can't think about it. What-ifs will drive you crazy. Just survive.\n\nMy mom was amazing. Through all of this she took care of me and even though she would have given anything to take all of it from me, she dealt with everything that came our way with love, care and support.\n\nSix weeks after surgery, I got married in a gown my mom's best friend helped me order via FedEx from the JC Penney catalog. I actually danced that day. It was a beautiful day by the ocean.\n\nI survived.\n\nWith that one ovary, I had Danielle in February 1999 and Michael in November 2000 in Connecticut. In 2004, we all moved to Wausau. I was blessed to become a stay-at-home mom after many years of being a working mom in Connecticut. I survived among the toys strewn all over the living room and episodes of Barney.\n\nIn November 2005, I gave birth to twins \u2014 Joel and Rachael. Wow, that was one successful ovary. Life became quite hectic, but I survived.\n\nWhen I got to Wisconsin, my neighbor Sue told me about the relay and how I should go for the survivor lap. I went online and registered and figured I would just check it out. My mom came with me and walked the caregiver lap too. We cried the whole way around the track. It was amazing. To see all those people was incredible.\n\nWe were surviving.\n\nThe next year, I became a team captain from First United Methodist Church because a dear friend, Carolie Kuehn, passed away from cancer and we were going to walk in her memory. Our pastor Karen Ebert, also dealing with cancer, walked that year too inside John Muir Middle School because of the bad weather outside. We lost Karen before the next year's walk and the team walked in honor and memory of both these lovely, amazing ladies. Why did I survive?\n\nLast year I celebrated 20 years of being a cancer survivor. I set up tables and two huge sheet cakes next to the track and we gave away free cake to the walkers. It was great. I am still surviving after 20 years!\n\nI've had more physical challenges after cancer. I am currently dealing with trigeminal neuralgia. It's a nerve condition and very painful and we are trying to find the right balance of medication and possibly surgery. But nothing has gotten me down. I have my mom and four beautiful children. I have my Lord and a faith that has always seen me through. I can get through anything and I will and have survived.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1S7qI3H", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I am a 21-year survivor of ovarian cancer.
