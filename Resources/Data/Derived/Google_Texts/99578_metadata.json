Rick Scott, a Republican, filed a lawsuit against the federal government over health care funding \u2014 a move that was promptly derided by the leadership of the state Senate.\n\n\"I don't think it changes anything,\" says the chairman of Florida's Senate appropriations committee, Tom Lee. \"Once he announced he was going to file a lawsuit against the federal government, I think everyone sort of shut down and lawyered up, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\nHere's a brief overview of the fight: The Republican-led state House is firmly against Medicaid expansion, while the Republican-led state Senate supports it. Scott once supported expansion but is now against it. And the federal government raised the stakes of the battle by refusing to negotiate on the renewal of a $2 billion fund called the Low Income Pool, which reimburses hospitals for unpaid bills.\n\n\"The pool money was about helping low-income people have access [to health care],\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told northern Florida's WFSU in January. \"I think we believe an important way to extend that coverage to low-income individuals is what passed in the Affordable Care Act ... this issue of Medicaid expansion.\"\n\nThe governor's lawsuit over the low income pool accuses the federal government of trying to coerce the state \u2014 requiring Florida to expand Medicaid or lose $2 billion. That sort of pressure was expressly forbidden by the U.S. Supreme Court, Scott says, when it upheld the federal health law in 2012.\n\ni toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nHouse appropriations chief Richard Corcoran recently delivered a 20-minute anti-Medicaid speech to fellow lawmakers that underscored his side's determination to block the expansion. \"Here's my message to the Senate,\" he said. \"They want us to come to the dance? We're not dancing. We're not dancing this session. We're not dancing next session. We're not dancing next summer \u2014 we're not dancing. And if you want to blow up the process because you think you have some right that doesn't exist? Have at it.\"\n\nNow, the central task that state law requires of the legislature \u2014 to pass a budget\u2014 remains incomplete. Scott tried this week to pressure the legislature to the bargaining table to craft a budget. He threatened to veto Senate priorities, but the Senate remained unmoved.\n\nScott has said he will call the legislature back for a special session to complete the budget.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's partnership with WFSU and Kaiser Health News.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Meanwhile, Gov.
