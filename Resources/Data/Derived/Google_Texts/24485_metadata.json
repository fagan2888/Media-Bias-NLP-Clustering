Bush, Journalism, Media Criticism, News, Politics News\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that \u201cTruth,\u201d the new movie about the journalistic firestorm that took down Dan Rather, has caused so much controversy. In its retelling of the scandal that engulfed Rather, his producer Mary Mapes and CBS News after their botched story about George W. Bush\u2019s time in the Texas Air National Guard blew up in their faces, \u201cTruth\u201d touches on one of the most politically and personally charged moments in recent media history. CBS is incensed enough about the film that it has refused to air any ads for it on its network. The people behind \u201cTruth\u201d have defended it as a movie that seeks to go beyond the particulars of the saga and raise broader questions about reporting and corporate America.\n\nThe reality is that neither side has covered itself in glory. CBS is guilty of, at the very least, massive corporate overreach, but \u201cTruth\u201d is so conspicuously one-sided that it was bound to provoke a heated reaction.\n\nThe outline of the story \u201cTruth\u201d tells is familiar enough to anybody who was around in 2004. Mapes, a star producer for Rather at CBS, got her hands on memos that seemingly confirmed rumors about the special treatment Bush had received during his military days, and built a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report for Rather around them. The memos, however, were torn to shreds almost instantly, with both conservative bloggers and experts disputing their authenticity. CBS ultimately retracted the story, apologized, fired Mapes, made three other producers resign, and forced Rather out of his anchor chair at the \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d\n\nEver since then, the toxicity of the scandal has lingered. Rather and Mapes insist to this day that the central contention of their story\u2013that Bush shirked his military duties and got away with it because of his connections\u2013is true, and that they were railroaded by a panicked team of corporate suits. Mapes recently said the errors fell within the range of \u201cnormal journalistic bungle.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is a quite generous reading of events. When you mess up on a highly damaging story about the president of the United States two months before an election, you\u2019re out of the realm of normalcy, no matter how much you did or didn\u2019t bungle. But that\u2019s the story \u201cTruth,\u201d which was based on Mapes\u2019s memoir, wants to tell. And that\u2019s the biggest flaw in the movie.\n\nDelve even slightly into the \u201cRathergate\u201d scandal and you will tumble down several simultaneous rabbit holes. The story of Bush\u2019s military service is decidedly murky. There\u2019s a boatload of evidence to suggest that he received preferential treatment for years, but that evidence is tied up with so much history, hearsay and rumor that it\u2019s a far cry from the tidy report that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d presented to the world.\n\n\u201cTruth\u201d does not exactly shy away from detailing the mistakes Mapes and her team made in pursuing the Bush story, but it definitely soft-pedals them. There\u2019s a central problem that, despite the film\u2019s best efforts, it can\u2019t overcome: The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report was partially centered around documents that the producers couldn\u2019t reasonably authenticate.\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good for Rather and Mapes to complain, as they have done for over a decade, that the focus on the memos obliterated any consideration of the rest of their story, which included on-camera interviews with people who said they had intervened to help Bush out during his time in the military. But that is a problem entirely of their own making. All these years later, it remains a wonder that so much caution was abandoned on such a sensitive story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A decade ago, a major journalistic scandal cost Dan Rather his job.
