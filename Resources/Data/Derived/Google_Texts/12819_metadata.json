After a preliminary hearing Friday, Fields' attorney entered not guilty pleas for her.\n\nProsecutors say Fields gave birth at home in December 2014 after not telling anyone she was pregnant.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports she told police the child was born blue and was cold to the touch. She said she put her in plastic bags and in the trash can because she was in shock.\n\nMedical testimony Friday indicated the baby was born alive and took at least one breath. The baby was full term and had no injuries.\n\nSchool records show Fields was an honor roll student at WSU in Spring, 2015. It's unclear whether she returned to school the following semester.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twenty-year-old Marissa Carol Fields is charged with first-degree felony murder and aggravated abandonment of a child.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-woman-charged-after-newborn-found-dead-in-trash-can-370372841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Marissa+Fields.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Twenty-year-old Marissa Carol Fields is charged with first-degree felony murder and aggravated abandonment of a child.", "title": "Former Wichita State student charged after newborn found dead in trash can"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Twenty-year-old Marissa Carol Fields is charged with first-degree felony murder and aggravated abandonment of a child.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-woman-charged-after-newborn-found-dead-in-trash-can-370372841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Marissa+Fields.jpg", "title": "Former Wichita State student charged after newborn found dead in trash can", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Former Wichita State student charged after newborn found dead in trash can", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Former Wichita State student charged, after newborn found dead in"}, "article_summary": "An Olathe woman and former Wichita State University student will stand trial in the death of her newborn daughter, whose body was found in a trash can.\nTwenty-year-old Marissa Carol Fields is charged with first-degree felony murder and aggravated abandonment of a child.\nThe Kansas City Star reports she told police the child was born blue and was cold to the touch.\nSchool records show Fields was an honor roll student at WSU in Spring, 2015.\nShe said she put her in plastic bags and in the trash can because she was in shock."}
