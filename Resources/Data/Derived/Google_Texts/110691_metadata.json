The Marquette product shot 56.5 percent from the floor, leading the Heat to three wins.\n\nBackground: Sure, Wade is getting old. It\u2019s showing up in games missed because of injuries, a loss of the explosive athleticism that once defined his game, and the many times Miami will sit him out for rest. But the old Flash is still in there, and in three turn-back-the clock performances, Wade showed there\u2019s still tread on his tires at age 33. His best game: 32 points and five steals in a win over the surging Cleveland Cavaliers and their superstar, LeBron James.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: What\u2019s not to love? Wade looked like the Wade we all remember \u2014 and that player was a nightly tidal wave of greatness. The backdrop of all this, even after the loss of the team\u2019s best player, Chris Bosh, is the Heat contending for a playoff berth and being re-energized by additions to the team such as point guard Goran Dragic, center Hassan Whiteside and forward Marcus Beasley. Wade is providing the steady leadership needed to get Miami back to the postseason.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dwyane Wade", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award goes to Miami's Dwyane Wade for the evaluation period of March 14-20.", "title": "Dwyane Wade: Spotlight on Miami Heat shooting guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/03/21/dwyane-wade-spotlight-on-miami-heat-shooting-guard/12759/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/03/Dwyane-Wade.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award goes to Miami's Dwyane Wade for the evaluation period of March 14-20.", "title": "Dwyane Wade: Spotlight on Miami Heat shooting guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/03/21/dwyane-wade-spotlight-on-miami-heat-shooting-guard/12759/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/03/Dwyane-Wade.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award goes to Miami's Dwyane Wade for the evaluation period of March 14-20."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1333\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Dwyane Wade, shooting guard, HeatWhen: Based on some vintage performances, The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week award goes to Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade for the evaluation period of March 14-20.\nBut the old Flash is still in there, and in three turn-back-the clock performances, Wade showed there\u2019s still tread on his tires at age 33.\nWade is providing the steady leadership needed to get Miami back to the postseason.\nThe Marquette product shot 56.5 percent from the floor, leading the Heat to three wins.\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, Wade averaged 28.7 points, 4.0 assists and 2.3 steals."}
