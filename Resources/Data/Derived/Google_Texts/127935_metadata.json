They didn\u2019t go far from the beaten path, or eat anything too unusual. But somewhere along the way, Janssen had something his stomach didn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cI lost like nine pounds \u2014 in a night,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t too much fun.\u201d\n\nThe food poisoning ravaged Janssen\u2019s body, sapping him of strength, and its effects lingered longer than anyone expected. The right-handed reliever continued to pitch for the Toronto Blue Jays, but his numbers ballooned. He has never used the illness as an excuse for poor performance. He does, however, admit that it happened.\n\nSEE ALSO: Nationals pick up Matt Williams\u2019 contract option for 2016 season\n\n\u201cIt was just one of those things,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cWe were in a race and I just wanted to pitch. I thought and I still believe that I could\u2019ve gotten three outs regardless of how I felt, and it didn\u2019t work that way. But it wasn\u2019t from a lack of effort. Just a lack of results.\u201d\n\nJanssen arrived at Space Coast Stadium on Thursday healthy and excited to begin a new season with a new team. The 33-year-old California native agreed to a contract with the Nationals late last month and is expected to fill the role of departed setup man Tyler Clippard, who was traded to the Oakland Athletics earlier in the offseason.\n\nJanssen said he has not been told specifically what his role will be in Washington\u2019s bullpen.\n\n\u201cI definitely looked at Tyler\u2019s number and they\u2019re pretty impressive. So big shoes to fill if that were the case,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cThey said I\u2019m going to pitch late. I\u2019m going to help fill the seventh, eighth or potentially the ninth inning if Drew needs a night off or something like that.\u201d\n\nFew Nationals fans knew much about Janssen before he signed with the Nationals because he spent the first eight seasons of his career in the American League. That same unfamiliarity is true for players, as well. Janssen said it will be a challenge facing hitters he has not frequently seen, but also an advantage, because they haven\u2019t seen him, either.\n\nJanssen is not a two-pitch flame-thrower. He said he has four or five pitches, including a slow curveball and a cutter, which is his go-to pitch. He described himself as \u201ca command guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep you off-balance, keep you off the barrel of the bat,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care how I get you out. I just want to get you out. There\u2019s not really a method to my madness. Just more reading swings, reading counts and trying to figure out where the least amount of damage that they can do to me is possible and I\u2019m going to try to attack that spot.\u201d\n\nHistorically speaking, Janssen has been slightly better on the road in his career than at home. He attributed part of that to the nature of the Rogers Centre, which has a fast turf infield and retractable roof. The ball, Janssen said, tends to carry there. It\u2019s a hitter\u2019s park.\n\nBut Janssen, for what it\u2019s worth, also said he truly enjoys pitching on the road.\n\n\u201cI love when everybody\u2019s against you and you\u2019re just the lone guy out there trying to shut everybody up,\u201d he said. \u201cI just love the pressure of pitching on the road and trying to accomplish that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After suffering a nasty bout of food poisoning midway through last season, Janssen arrives at spring training as a likely replacement for Tyler Clippard in the eighth inning.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After suffering a nasty bout of food poisoning midway through last season, Janssen arrives at spring training as a likely replacement for Tyler Clippard in the eighth inning.", "title": "Casey Janssen is healthy, ready to contribute in first season with the Nationals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/21/casey-janssen-healthy-ready-contribute-first-seaso/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/28/ap307250889972.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/28/ap307250889972.jpg", "description": "After suffering a nasty bout of food poisoning midway through last season, Janssen arrives at spring training as a likely replacement for Tyler Clippard in the eighth inning.", "card": "summary", "title": "Casey Janssen is healthy, ready to contribute in first season with the"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Casey Janssen, Tyler Clippard"}, "article_summary": "VIERA, Fla. \u2014 Last year, Casey Janssen spent the all-star break in the Dominican Republic with his wife, Lauren.\nBut somewhere along the way, Janssen had something his stomach didn\u2019t like.\nSEE ALSO: Nationals pick up Matt Williams\u2019 contract option for 2016 season\u201cIt was just one of those things,\u201d Janssen said.\n\u201cThey said I\u2019m going to pitch late.\nJust a lack of results.\u201dJanssen arrived at Space Coast Stadium on Thursday healthy and excited to begin a new season with a new team."}
