While ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft are shaking up transportation options in other states, they\u2019ve been put up on blocks in the commonwealth owing to outdated laws that stifle innovation and discourage competition.\n\nLast month, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles served Uber and Lyft with cease-and-desist orders, demanding that they stop providing a service that is clearly in high demand, competing on availability, affordability and convenience. There may always be plenty of people who prefer a traditional taxi \u2014 and there will probably be taxis for them to hail. Companies such as Uber, though, are more than just competitors \u2014 they are innovators, changing how people think about finding a ride.\n\nI\u2019ve learned from experience that it\u2019s almost impossible to hail a cab after a Washington Nationals baseball game, but if I punch a few buttons on my cellphone, an Uber driver will be there in minutes.\n\nThe ability to schedule a pickup by cellphone is disruptive to the industry, which is, of course, why the industry doesn\u2019t like it. However, the state\u2019s job is not to protect an industry; it\u2019s to look out for the interests of the citizens. We shouldn\u2019t be shielding existing companies from competition by insisting on strict regulations that have locked us into an unchanging 20th-century model. The arguments being advanced for today\u2019s status quo could just as easily have been made to protect switchboard operators from evolving technologies decades ago.\n\nA hundred years ago, metered cabs were a startling innovation that radically changed people\u2019s commutes. I don\u2019t know if Uber and Lyft will have that sort of impact today \u2014 but I do know they should have the right to try. More importantly, Virginia\u2019s commuters should have the right to choose the transportation options that best suit their needs, not the ones spelled out in an outmoded statute.\n\nVirginia\u2019s ban on alternative ridesharing arrangements cries out for a legislative fix, and I intend to introduce legislation freeing up the ridesharing market next year. I guarantee that I won\u2019t be the only one.\n\nUber\u2019s service relies on a predictive algorithm that models demand in real-time to position drivers before a would-be passenger even presses a button on his iPhone. Fare payments are processed automatically; no fumbling for cash or credit cards, and the tip is included. Passengers are given choices about their ride.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the taxi industry come up with these ideas? I suspect it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t have to. High barriers to entry ensured that cab companies never faced serious competition on rates or amenities. There was never any need to compete on service or value.\n\nIn a functioning market, companies respond to consumer preferences. They compete on price, convenience, comfort and reliability. The emergence of companies such as Uber and Lyft marks the return of competition to a grossly overregulated field. I applaud that entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nVirginia has been routinely named one of the best places to do business, but as the cease-and-desist letters demonstrate, there\u2019s clearly room for improvement. With those letters, we are telling entrepreneurs that we love innovation and job creation \u2014 but only so long as they\u2019re not competing with anyone. Freeing up rideshare competition will expand economic opportunity and enhance transportation options for Virginia commuters, and what\u2019s more, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nHere in the Old Dominion, we value tradition \u2014 but not without reason, nor at the cost of economic dynamism. Virginia\u2019s statutory prohibitions on rideshare arrangements are relics of a bygone era. It\u2019s time for a modern, forward-looking approach to transportation, and freeing up services such as Uber and Lyft is a good way to start.\n\nMark Obenshain is a Republican member of the Virginia Senate from Harrisonburg.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You can do a lot from your cellphone these days \u2014 but if you're in Virginia, don't bother trying to schedule your ride home with one.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "You can do a lot from your cellphone these days \u2014 but if you\u2019re in Virginia, don\u2019t bother trying to schedule your ride home with one.", "title": "OBENSHAIN: Removing Virginia\u2019s barriers to ridesharing", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/5/obenshain-removing-virginias-barriers-to-rideshari/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/7_5_2014_b3-obens-taxi-phone8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/7_5_2014_b3-obens-taxi-phone8201.jpg", "description": "You can do a lot from your cellphone these days \u2014 but if you're in Virginia, don't bother trying to schedule your ride home with one.", "card": "summary", "title": "OBENSHAIN: Removing Virginia\u2019s barriers to ridesharing"}, "Author": "Mark Obenshain", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Uber, Lyft"}, "article_summary": "Virginia\u2019s ban on alternative ridesharing arrangements cries out for a legislative fix, and I intend to introduce legislation freeing up the ridesharing market next year.\nCompanies such as Uber, though, are more than just competitors \u2014 they are innovators, changing how people think about finding a ride.\nWe shouldn\u2019t be shielding existing companies from competition by insisting on strict regulations that have locked us into an unchanging 20th-century model.\nThe emergence of companies such as Uber and Lyft marks the return of competition to a grossly overregulated field.\nHigh barriers to entry ensured that cab companies never faced serious competition on rates or amenities."}
