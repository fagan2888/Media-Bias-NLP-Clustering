The measure was enacted by the Labor government to discourage people from smoking.\n\nThe law was especially targeted at teenagers and young people. The rationale being that the bright, shiny colours on cigarette packs were encouraging young people to smoke. The debate was hotly contested by the tobacco companies who unsuccessfully sued the government to keep their branding.\n\nBut according to a Freedom of Information Act request, the number of stick cigarettes sold in Australia jumped from 2012 and 2013 by 115 million, or 0.5 percent. There was also an uptick in the sales of black market tobacco after the introduction of plain packaging.\n\nIllegal sales rose from 11.5 percent of the market in 2011 to 14.3 percent by mid-2014. There is also evidence to suggest that plain packaging encouraged switching from higher priced cigarettes to cheaper ones since the brand\u2019s signal of quality is diminished.\n\nPlain packaging was dealt a further blow in 2014 after economists Ashok Kaul and Michael Wolf found that the new packs didn\u2019t deter adults or teenagers from smoking. Australia has long been the top tier of the world\u2019s most anti-smoking countries.\n\nIn March, lawmakers in Tasmania took anti-tobacco activism to a new level with an attempt to grandfather in the full prohibition of tobacco. The proposal would see cigarettes sales banned for those born after the year 2000. Imperial Tobacco\u2019s Australian head of corporate and legal affairs, Andrew Gregson, said the law would \u201cmerely shift tobacco demand and supply onto other channels.\u201d\n\nTasmania\u2019s Health Minister Michael Ferguson echoed a similar view:\n\nNaturally, we\u2019re following the debate with interest but at this stage the Government is not convinced that the proposal can work in practice.\n\nFollow Guy on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just one year after Australia passed one of the world\u2019s most draconian anti-smoking laws, tobacco sales rose 0.5 percent after they had been falling for several years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "Just one year after Australia passed one of the world\u2019s most draconian anti-smoking laws, tobacco sales rose 0.5 percent after they had been falling for several years.", "title": "Australia\u2019s Anti-Smoking Crusade Results In More People Smoking", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-18-at-12.10.37-PM.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/australias-anti-smoking-crusade-results-in-more-people-smoking/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-18-at-12.10.37-PM.jpg", "description": "Just one year after Australia passed one of the world\u2019s most draconian anti-smoking laws, tobacco sales rose 0.5 percent after they had been falling for several years.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Australia\u2019s Anti-Smoking Crusade Results In More People Smoking"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Gov't Incompetence", "published_time": "2015-08-18T12:10:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ProducerPetersen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Illegal sales rose from 11.5 percent of the market in 2011 to 14.3 percent by mid-2014.\nJust one year after Australia passed one of the world\u2019s most draconian anti-smoking laws, tobacco sales rose 0.5 percent after they had been falling for several years.\nThe proposal would see cigarettes sales banned for those born after the year 2000.\nThe measure was enacted by the Labor government to discourage people from smoking.\nThere was also an uptick in the sales of black market tobacco after the introduction of plain packaging."}
