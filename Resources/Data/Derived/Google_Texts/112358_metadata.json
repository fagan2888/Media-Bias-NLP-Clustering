Worse, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lowered previous estimates for August and July, suggesting that the economy is not as strong as statistics made it look during the third quarter of the year.\n\nRelated: Can the GOP Bypass Its Right Wing to Revive the Export-Import Bank?\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always important not to over-react to one single data release, we\u2019ll make an exception in this case,\u201d wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist with Capital Economics. \u201cThe chances of a rate hike by the Fed this year just went way down.\u201d\n\nCalling the report \u201cdisappointing,\u201d PNC Senior economist Gus Faucher agreed that it all but takes a rate hike off the table for the remainder of the year.\n\n\u201cThis likely rules out an increase in the fed funds rate when the FOMC next meets in late October, and a mid-December rate increase now looks less likely,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial markets are now pricing in the first increase in the funds rate in March.\u201d\n\nThe report also casts some gloom on the U.S. job market\u2019s painfully slow recovery from the Great Recession. The unemployment rate may have held steady at 5.1 percent, but the underlying measures of the labor market\u2019s health all look worse as of August.\n\nRelated: A New Housing Bubble? Some Buyers Are Camping Out for Lots\n\n\u201cDigging into the report, we see that the civilian labor force participation rate declined, the employment-to-population ratio for prime age workers has continued to stagnate (sitting at 77.2 percent\u2014where it was when the year started), and wage growth is stuck at 2.2 percent,\u201d wrote Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cTaken together, these are signs of a labor market that retains a fair amount of slack and evidence that the Federal Reserve was right not to raise interest rates in September and indeed should not raise them in 2015.\u201d\n\nGould also updated EPI\u2019s estimate of how long it will likely take the U.S. to regain all the jobs that the economy was on track to create prior to the Great Recession. At the rate of growth over the last three months, she found, it could be February of 2018 before the economy has fully recovered from job losses.\n\nThe news out of the Labor Department will no doubt frustrate many in the financial services industry, where banks in particular have been chafing under rate that have tightened spreads between what they can charge borrowers and what they have to pay depositors and other sources of liquidity.\n\nAdvocates of the unemployed, by contrast, will see the announcement as evidence that continued \u201caccommodation\u201d by the Fed is necessary to create demand for labor, which in turn will drive up wages.\n\nRelated: A Bear Market Beckons.
