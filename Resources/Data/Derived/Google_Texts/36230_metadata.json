No insurance? No license plate? No problem.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a group of Big Island residents who think they have a constitutional right to travel without state and federally imposed licensing, registration and safety checks.\n\nOn Jan. 2, the group will ring in the new year with a drive to demonstrate that independence.\n\n\u201cWe will be planning the route so we do it in a safe and courteous way, but we\u2019re here to make an impact,\u201d said Paul Komara, one of the event\u2019s organizers.\n\nDubbed the \u201cFreedom Ride 2016,\u201d it will be the first such event for the group. Komara said he has no idea what the turnout will be.\n\n\u201cPlease join us as we tour the Big Island as free people, lawfully demonstrating our \u2018right to travel\u2019 without the encumbrance of state property license plates,\u201d reads a flier put out by the group.\n\nParticipants have the option of replacing their plates with a notice of personal ownership signifying the vehicle is not for hire. That\u2019s because the right to travel by private conveyance for private purposes cannot be infringed, according to the group.\n\nNo license or permission is required for travel that is not for commercial profit, said Bradley Belmarez, in an email. Belmarez is one of the organizers covering North Hawaii.\n\n\u201cThere are only requirements for registration, insurance and license for commercial drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cNot travelers.\u201d As for swapping out license plates, \u201cthat\u2019s a personal decision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe organizers of the Big Island effort held an orientation, question-and-answer session and sign-up recently at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. The departure time, place and route for the rally has yet to be decided.\n\nAsked if the Hawaii Police Department would cite out-of-compliance vehicles in the rally, spokeswoman Chris Loos said in an email that police will continue to enforce all traffic violations.
