Mike Lee, R-Utah, to the Supreme Court if he\u2019s elected president.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s main rival for the nomination, Ted Cruz, has already said he\u2019d consider his best friend in the Senate for the seat that opened with Antonin Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nConservatives are lobbying Donald Trump to say he will nominate Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to the Supreme Court if he's elected president. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nAs President Obama traveled to the University of Chicago on Thursday to deliver a speech calling for Merrick Garland\u2019s confirmation, Senate Republican leaders were expressing confidence they can hold firm through the November election in refusing to grant Garland even a hearing.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wins in November, there will be pressure to quickly confirm Garland so that she could not appoint someone who is younger and more liberal. If she loses, then the next Republican president will get to nominate someone else.\n\nWhile the rest of the mainstream media is preoccupied with the Garland battle, conservative luminaries are increasingly looking ahead to next year and quietly touting Lee as a potential nominee. Republican senators like this idea, and Democrats are figuring out how they\u2019d respond.\n\nTrump promises that he will soon unveil a list of 10 to 12 names from which he would nominate a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I\u2019m going to put up,\u201d he told The Washington Post last week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to guarantee it. \u2026 Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he\u2019ll put the wrong judge in.\u201d He said he\u2019s \u201cgetting names\u201d from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation.\n\nLee \u201cwould be a very good choice, I think,\u201d Sessions told The Washington Post.\n\nHeritage offered up a wish list of eight \u201chighly qualified candidates\u201d that includes Lee. Besides him and former George W. Bush Solicitor General Paul Clement, the six others are sitting judges.\n\nNone are surprising: William Pryor Jr. on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Diane Sykes on the 7th Circuit, Steven Colloton and Raymond Gruender on the 8th Circuit, Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit and Don Willett, who is a justice on the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nJohn Malcolm, director of the think tank\u2019s Edwin Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, devised the list after consulting with other conservatives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very bright lawyer,\u201d Malcolm said of Lee in an interview. He praised him as an originalist with \u201cintestinal fortitude.\u201d\n\nRight now, Clinton leads both Trump and Cruz in head-to-head matchups, so Republicans are currently the underdogs in the Supreme Court fight. But if they win the White House, Lee would be a dream pick for conservative activists:\n\n\u2013 He has the right pedigree: Six years ago, fueled by tea party anger, he toppled Sen. Bob Bennett at a Republican state convention. His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan\u2019s solicitor general. After graduating from Brigham Young University Law School, the senator clerked for Samuel Alito when he was on the Third Circuit and then again after Alito\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court. He was an assistant U.S. attorney in Salt Lake City and general counsel for then-Gov. Jon Huntsman before running for office himself.\n\n\u2013 He\u2019s incredibly young: Lee is just 44. That means he could squeeze four or more decades out of a lifetime appointment.\n\n\u2013 He is dependably conservative. Grassroots leaders are adamant that future Republican nominees have a long paper trail to avoid confirming stealth moderates. They still feel burned by David Souter, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and John Paul Stevens.\n\nMany Republican base voters even feel betrayed by John Roberts because of his support for upholding the Affordable Care Act. Dropping the conservative chief justice\u2019s name at a Republican campaign event is a surefire way to draw boos nowadays. Cruz often finds himself defensively explaining away his support for Roberts\u2019 confirmation. He tells audiences he would have picked Edith Jones instead of Souter in 1990 and Mike Luttig, for whom he clerked, instead of Roberts in 2005.\n\nLee, for his part, wrote an e-book in 2013 called: \u201cWhy John Roberts was wrong about Healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump says he will soon unveil a list of names from which he would nominate a Supreme Court justice.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Trump says he will soon unveil a list of names from which he would nominate a Supreme Court justice.", "title": "Donald Trump urged to name Utah senator to high court - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/831489_AP_110629050565.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2016-04-08T08:11:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/07/donald-trump-urged-to-name-utah-senator-to-high-court/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump says he will soon unveil a list of names from which he would nominate a Supreme Court justice.", "title": "Donald Trump urged to name Utah senator to high court - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/831489_AP_110629050565.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-07T20:57:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T08:11:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Conservatives are lobbying Donald Trump to say he will nominate Sen.
