We interviewed a cross-section of the industry in terms of market size (from smaller players to majors), product styles (from conventional to specialty and everything in between) and company structure (from large corporations to licensing groups to independents).\n\nLike analysts considering the U.S. economy as a whole, the industry leaders BedTimes interviewed see a rebounding economy and new ways to improve their businesses, but also plenty of challenges ahead.\n\nHere are some of their answers, in their own words:\n\n1. As we head into 2015, what are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. economy?\n\n\u201cThe economy\u2019s strengths are that unemployment continues to improve, interest rates on borrowing are low, housing has continued to improve and consumers are back spending. Weaknesses: a volatile stock market that\u2019s ripe for an adjustment and continued instability in the world.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dave Roberts, president and chief operating officer of King Koil in Willowbrook, Illinois\n\n\u201cStrengths include a steadily improving employment rate, lower interest rates and a steady but moderate recovery in housing markets. Weaknesses include continued pressure on lower-income consumers, including credit availability.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Traub, president of Serta\n\nInternational in Hoffman Estates, Illinois\n\n\u201cStrengths: Corporate profits and the stock market both continue to rise; unemployment is declining, although underemployment is still a problem; oil/gas prices are at low levels, adding disposable income and relief to those on a tight budget. Weaknesses: underemployment; lack of trained workers to fill tech positions; Middle East/Russia concerns; Ebola concerns.\u201d\n\n\u2014Denny Boyd, president of\n\nBoyd Specialty Sleep in St. Louis\n\n\u201cThe biggest strengths of the U.S. economy are our capital markets and our consumer economy, albeit constrained over the past several years. The biggest weaknesses are our growing governmental burden\u2014largely regulatory\u2014and the dramatic and growing expansion of entitlements.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jimmy Orders, president of Park Place Corp. and King Koil Mid-Atlantic in\n\nGreenville, South Carolina\n\n\u201cThe plasticity of the U.S. economy is its greatest asset. The connectedness, structure and spirit of the American culture allow us the ability to maneuver through challenging economic terrain\u2014unlike any other culture. Our weakness is when our energy to participate in the economy wanes in both work ethic and community contributions.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ron Passaglia, president of Restonic\n\nMattress Corp. in Buffalo, New York,\n\nand chairman of the International\n\nSleep Products Association\n\n\u201cThe 2015 housing market should match numbers comparable to the 1999-2002 average. Full recovery from prebubble numbers should take another two to three years. We are now taking control of our energy demands and rely less on imports. GDP needs to improve to 3% or higher for sustained growth. We will most likely have two more years of gridlock in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ron Clevenger, president of Symbol\n\nMattress in Richmond, Virginia\n\n\u201cLabor participation rates and household income continue to be a drag on the overall economy. Current government policy and the Affordable Care Act will continue to put a lot of negative pressure on the hiring of full-time employees. One strength, though, is the housing market: As prices of existing homes rebound and the sale of new homes increases, we should see a similar trend in durable goods sales.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stephen Stickler, vice president of Ashley Sleep at Ashley Furniture in Arcadia, Wisconsin\n\n\u201cThe economy is in the best shape that it\u2019s been in for a number of years\u2014led by employment, low interest rates, housing sales and a rebounding of furniture sales.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jim Nation, president of Five Star Mattress, Business Development Serta and\n\nSerta Canada at Serta International\n\nin Hoffman Estates, Illinois\n\n2. As we head into 2015, what is the biggest challenge facing the mattress industry as a whole?\n\n\u201cWe compete with the iPhone 6 introduction and other new technologies that consume billions of dollars of spendable income. (In the mattress industry), there is no truly groundbreaking technology change to cause demand. The \u2018next big thing\u2019 needs to be developed to disrupt the buying cycle.\u201d\n\n\u2014Boyd, Boyd Specialty Sleep\n\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s biggest challenge in 2015 will be igniting sustained growth across all consumer and price segments. We are seeing good recovery with the higher-end consumer but there are challenges with lower-income consumers.\u201d\n\n\u2014Traub, Serta International\n\n\u201cMany people feel that units are still way down in mattresses, but I think we, as an industry, are not capturing the growth in online sales in industry numbers. There has been tremendous growth in online sales over the past five years. The one challenge this creates, though, is the \u2018commoditization\u2019 of the category, which puts margin pressures on everyone.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stickler, Ashley Sleep\n\n\u201cThe consolidation of the industry at both retail and supplier levels heightens the need for sharp decisions with a very clear vision for each of our initiatives.\u201d\n\n\u2014Passaglia, Restonic\n\nMattress Corp.\n\n\u201cOvercapacity in the manufacturing sector and continued contraction of smaller retailers and rapid conglomeration in the retail/outlet sector for product distribution. Driver shortages and government regulation. Logistics costs will continue to climb.\u201d\n\n\u2014Clevenger, Symbol Mattress\n\n3. What do you forecast will be the most significant mattress innovation or trend in 2015?\n\n\u201cI think more and more retailers are finding innovative ways to push the power/adjustable category as a way to increase the average ticket. Mattresses are much more than just sleep surfaces these days\u2014they are living spaces where people work, read, etc. Also, bringing technology into the category to improve the quality of sleep will be very big in the coming years. Mattresses that can adjust to their users\u2014be it temperature, sleeping position, etc.\u2014will offer the first significant change to mattresses since the introduction of specialty mattresses.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stickler, Ashley Sleep\n\n\u201cWe see innerspring continuing to \u2018bounce\u2019 back and more two-sided mattresses being sold.\u201d\n\n\u2014Roberts, King Koil\n\n\u201cQuick service and direct-to-the-consumer, consumer-care programs from both retailers and suppliers. As wallets continue to tighten and marketing budgets dwindle, a solid social media strategy engaging online communities is a core strategy that will help avoid corporate Darwinism. Those who embrace this evolving media\u2014educating, engaging, relationship building\u2014and blaze trails online will reap ROI far ahead of their competition.\u201d\n\n\u2014Passaglia, Restonic Mattress Corp.\n\n\u201cInnovations that are successful don\u2019t come along every year. In 2014, all of the major brands introduced new technologies and bedding concepts: You would have to say that 2014 was a year of innovation. I believe that 2015 will be more about the manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 ability to execute. There will be some new products that are trade downs from higher-priced merchandise.\u201d\n\n\u2014Nation, Five Star Mattress\n\n4. What technology do you predict will have the biggest impact on your business or the mattress industry as a whole in 2015?\n\n\u201cThe smartphone: In the hands of the consumer, it makes all information about products and retail choices immediately available. So, our job is to make sure we are delivering her relevant and easily accessible information that aids her purchase decision whenever she needs it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Traub, Serta International\n\n\u201cThe changes going on in the advertising and marketing world are significant. A company\u2019s ability to reach consumers with its marketing message has never been easier in terms of options\u2014or more difficult in terms of knowing and leveraging what works. The days of leveraging three television channels and a local newspaper as a path to success are gone.\u201d\n\n\u2014Orders, Park Place Corp.\n\n\u201cIndividual comfort options along with the use of technology to assist consumer in selection.\u201d\n\n\u2014Roberts, King Koil\n\n\u201cThe Internet will continue to dominate the research side of selling. The retail sales associate will need to have a greater command of product knowledge as they encounter a very informed consumer.\u201d\n\n\u2014Clevenger, Symbol Mattress\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still gel and sleep systems with a cooling surface.\u201d\n\n\u2014Nation, Five Star Mattress\n\n\u201cMarrying new technology with the category that enables consumers to improve their quality of sleep will be the biggest breakthrough in a generation. Mattresses that can \u2018learn\u2019 and adjust the sleeping environment based on feedback from the customer via sensors and the consumer\u2019s input will greatly improve sleep quality and help the industry to continue to grow average tickets.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stickler, Ashley Sleep\n\n5. These days, what keeps you up at night?\n\n\u201cThe nights I lie awake, I spend reviewing Restonic consumer deliverables to enhance their experience with our brand. Knowing we need to be on social media and actually figuring out how to do it right can be as overwhelming as a transcontinental flight. Thankfully, we have a crackerjack team at Restonic who also spend their nights dreaming up new ways to reach and service our consumers.\u201d\n\n\u2014Passaglia, Restonic Mattress Corp.\n\n\u201cWith essentially two power companies having such control over retailers, will opportunities increase or diminish for the challenger brands?\u201d\n\n\u2014Roberts, King Koil\n\n\u201cWhat keeps me up at night? It certainly isn\u2019t the mattress business. Lack of leadership at the highest levels of the political landscape bothers me personally the most. What helps me sleep easier? A strong faith, family and family-owned company do wonders to keep you resting well.\u201d\n\n\u2014Orders, Park Place Corp.\n\n\u201cHow we access the numerous opportunities that are available keeps me awake. However, I sleep easy because I know that Symbol has a team of talented and dedicated professionals who are engaged in helping our customers grow their businesses.\u201d\n\n\u2014Clevenger, Symbol Mattress\n\n\u201cI always sleep great! I am a happy and very fortunate guy.\u201d\n\n\u2014Boyd, Boyd Specialty Sleep\n\nThe state of the mattress industry\n\nOn a still-to-be-determined weeknight in the dead of winter, President Barack Obama will step up to a podium and present his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. It\u2019s too early to speculate what he might say. But, taking a cue from this tradition of American politics and governance, BedTimes asked a sample of leading mattress manufacturers to assess the current condition of the bedding industry.\n\nTheir answers, by and large, convey a cautious optimism.\n\nQ \u201cHow would you complete this sentence: The current state of the mattress industry is_______.\u201d\n\n\u201cImproving.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Traub, president of Serta International in Hoffman Estates, Illinois\n\n\u201cIn a relatively good position but firmly in a transition.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dave Roberts, president and chief operating officer of King Koil in Willowbrook, Illinois\n\n\u201cStable but needs to evolve.\u201d\n\n\u2014Denny Boyd, president of Boyd Specialty Sleep in St. Louis\n\n\u201cVery competitive.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jim Nation, president of Five Star Mattress, Business Development Serta and Serta Canada at Serta International in Hoffman Estates, Illinois\n\n\u201cVery exciting and filled with opportunity, while at the same time in a state of flux.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ron Clevenger, president of Symbol Mattress in Richmond, Virginia\n\n\u201c\u2026ablaze with collaborative new players who understand that dynamic, inclusive leadership will shape the landscape of the future.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ron Passaglia, president of Restonic Mattress Corp. in Buffalo, New York\n\n\u201cImproving.\u201d\n\n\u2014Stephen Stickler, vice president of Ashley Sleep at Ashley Furniture in Arcadia, Wisconsin\n\nISPA 2015 forecast shows gains\n\nThe International Sleep Products Association\u2019s latest forecast, released in October (paywall), projects a solid year for the U.S. mattress industry in 2015. The number of mattresses and foundations shipped is expected to rise 2%, with the wholesale dollar value of those units increasing 4.5% over 2014 figures. The average unit selling price is expected to rise 2.5%. (See story on page 140.)\n\n\u201cBusiness, like the economy, is improving,\u201d writes Jerry Epperson in a column in the ISPA forecast. Epperson is a founder and managing director of Mann, Armistead & Epperson Ltd., an investment banking and advisory firm in Richmond, Virginia. He writes frequently on the furniture and mattress industries.\n\n\u201cConsumer confidence is near post-recession highs; consumer debt is down; both the stock market and home prices have risen to prerecession levels, restoring consumer wealth; inflation and interest rates are low; new and existing home sales are rising with big gains expected in 2015 and 2016,\u201d Epperson says. \u201cOur retailers are opening new stores and reinvigorating old stores, and, in my opinion, most consumers have learned to ignore the brinkmanship and exaggeration in our government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "mattress industry financials, mattress industry forecast", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "twitter": {"description": "Leaders in the mattress industry say the time is ripe for new opportunities to improve their\u00a0bottom line as the economy continues its turn-around With the new year rapidly approaching, BedTimes talked to some leading mattress manufacturers to get their take on the economy, the state of the mattress industry and what trends they see emerging\u2026", "title": "Mattress manufacturers see mostly sunny skies ahead", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://bedtimesmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Jim-Nation-2.jpg", "height": 800}, "site": "@BedTimesMag", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "3ff3946ac0ef2dcda67119abbde0dd2e"}, "google-site-verification": "YK0GRRQruT0rNYkuEjEn4FuO0bIINXVQXytqNGgTkKI", "description": "Leaders in the mattress industry say the time is ripe for new opportunities to improve their bottom line as the economy continues its turn-around"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e38\"", "article_summary": "(In the mattress industry), there is no truly groundbreaking technology change to cause demand.\nAs we head into 2015, what is the biggest challenge facing the mattress industry as a whole?\nWhat technology do you predict will have the biggest impact on your business or the mattress industry as a whole in 2015?\nWhat do you forecast will be the most significant mattress innovation or trend in 2015?\nBut, taking a cue from this tradition of American politics and governance, BedTimes asked a sample of leading mattress manufacturers to assess the current condition of the bedding industry."}
