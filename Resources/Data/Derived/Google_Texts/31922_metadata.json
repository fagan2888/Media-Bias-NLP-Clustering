As a result, in its current form even if it is passed, it will not save Afghanistan from the blacklist, the central bank and Western diplomats say.\n\nIt is unclear why some provisions were removed. Diplomats and analysts say it is possible that certain provisions were removed by Afghan officials worried about being targeted by international money-laundering laws.\n\nAfghan banks have been struggling since FATF put Afghanistan on a dark grey list early this year. They say the move has affected their ability to process transactions such as families sending money to students' abroad.\n\nChinese banks were being used as a gateway by Afghan banks to process dollar transactions with other parts of the world.
