Source: DonkeyHotey, "Map of Super Tuesday States," flickr.com, Feb. 7, 2016 Tuesday, Mar. 1, 2016 was Super Tuesday for the 2016 presidential candidates as 13 states caucused or voted in primaries. Super Tuesday is the day when the most states vote at once and more delegates are at stake than any other day leading up to the political party conventions and nominations.



The states that voted are: Alabama, Alaska (Republicans only), Arkansas, Colorado (Democrats only), Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming. Results for Colorado and Wyoming have not been calculated for Republicans yet because their caucus processes have not ended: Wyoming will decide during their Mar. 12, 2016 county conventions and Colorado will pledge delegates at the Republican National Convention on July 18-21, 2016. American Samoa and Democrats Abroad (American Democrats living overseas) also cast ballots for the Democratic candidates. American Samoa does not vote in the general election because it is a territory and not a state. The results for the Democrats Abroad primary (which includes Americans in 39 countries and comprises 13 delegates) will not be available until after voting closes on Mar. 8, 2016.



Overall, Hillary Clinton won seven states (AL, AR, GA, MA, TN, TX, and VA) and American Samoa, and added 494 delegates for a total of 585 delegates. Bernie Sanders won four states (CO, MN, OK, and VT) and earned 324 new delegates for a total of 389 delegates.



The next Democratic primaries and caucuses are Saturday, Mar. 5, 2016 in Kansas, Louisiana, and Nebraska. To win the Democratic nomination, a candidate needs 2,383 delegates.



For the Republicans, Donald Trump won seven states (AL, AR, GA, MA, TN, VT, and VA), adding 234 delegates for a total of 316 delegates. Ted Cruz won three states (AK, OK, and TX) and added 209 delegates for a total of 226. And Marco Rubio won one state (MN), adding 90 delegates for a total of 106 delegates. Ben Carson and John Kasich won no states but added 3 delegates for a total of 8, and 19 delegates for a total of 25, respectively, because each won a big enough percentage of votes to earn delegates.



The next Republican primaries and caucuses are Saturday, Mar. 5, 2016 in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Maine. To win the Republican nomination, a candidate needs 1,237 delegates.
