Envying the U.S. mortgage system?\n\nMoscow officials hoping to boost the Russian housing market have been visiting the United States for more than a year to learn how the American mortgage machine works.\n\nThat would be the machine that blew a gasket in 2007, causing a housing market crash that led to a financial crisis that then spurred on the deepest recession since the Great Depression. It\u2019s also the machine U.S. lawmakers are working to replace with a new system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Russia is one of several countries hoping to export parts of the U.S. mortgage market back home as it remains a tantalizing model for foreign officials who want to make the dream of homeownership more widely available. Emissaries from Japan, Thailand and South Korea have also been studying how the U.S. housing market finds the money for so many loans.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage)\n\n\u201cThe system that we set up has worked very well generally over the years,\u201d said Kerry Vandell, dean\u2019s professor of finance at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe caveat is that it can be abused under certain conditions.\u201d\n\nDespite the recent volatility of the American housing market, foreign officials want to emulate how the U.S. system makes 30-year mortgages available from a variety of lenders and in all corners of the country. In their countries, loans are harder to come by or have terms that can saddle heirs with debt \u2014 and they lack a system for attracting the number of investors needed to fund new loans.\n\nMuch of the interaction between foreign officials and the United States has centered on Ginnie Mae, a housing agency that backs securities made up of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration that are bought by investors \u2014 a process that helps banks get funding for more loans. Their role in the housing market is similar, but typically smaller, than the one played by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008.\n\nFor instance, Ginnie Mae President Ted Tozer has held a handful of meetings with officials from the Agency for Housing Mortgage Lending \u2014 Russia\u2019s version of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 since 2012.\n\n( POLITICO Magazine PHOTOS: The empty shells where Detroit\u2019s houses used to be)\n\n\u201cNobody has a finance system close to what we have,\u201d Tozer said.\n\nThese discussions could now be on hold following Russia\u2019s decision to seize Crimea, an event that has escalated tensions to a level not seen since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThey started, however, soon after President Vladimir Putin came back into office in 2012 as he looked for ways to help more Russians buy a home and boost the country\u2019s economy.\n\nRussian officials are particularly eager to increase the availability of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 a staple of the U.S. market.\n\nBut to do so, they will need a system in which the government will guarantee more of the losses on loans that are packaged into bonds; otherwise, investors will be reluctant to buy the securities that provide the funding for these mortgages.\n\nGinnie Mae provides an example of how this can be done.\n\nRussia has no direct mortgage insurer and government-controlled banks such as Moscow\u2019s Sberbank control the relatively small market by making new home loans and keeping them on their balance sheet. Sberbank announced in January that it issued a record 453,700 mortgages in 2013, up 43 percent from the previous year.\n\nUniversity of Arizona sociology professor Jane Zavisca, who authored the book \u201cHousing the New Russia\u201d in 2012, estimates that the government-controlled banks are responsible for 70 percent of the market.\n\nBut the loans carry interest rates often above 12 percent and have terms of up to 15 years.\n\n\u201cMortgages are not affordable to most Russians,\u201d Zavisca said. \u201cYou have to have income stability that doesn\u2019t exist for most people.\u201d\n\nThe Russians have told U.S. officials, Tozer said, that they want to expand ways to finance home loans in the country\u2019s far-flung regions that have been hard to reach for the country\u2019s banking sector.\n\nEstablishing a better legal system for its housing market is also needed and at some meetings, U.S. officials have handed over copies of federal and state property ownership laws as a template. In addition, Russia will need to figure out what currency loans would be based on because the ruble has proved to be a bad option.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The 30-year mortgage is an object of desire from abroad.", "title": "Envying the U.S. mortgage system?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/envy-from-abroad-for-the-us-mortgage-system-105414.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/04/06/121129_mortgage_ap209903064650_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Fannie Mae,Freddie Mac,Housing,Mortgages", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The 30-year mortgage is an object of desire from abroad.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfee9\"", "article_summary": "Envying the U.S. mortgage system?\n( POLITICO Magazine PHOTOS: The empty shells where Detroit\u2019s houses used to be)\u201cNobody has a finance system close to what we have,\u201d Tozer said.\nMoscow officials hoping to boost the Russian housing market have been visiting the United States for more than a year to learn how the American mortgage machine works.\nRussian officials are particularly eager to increase the availability of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 a staple of the U.S. market.\nEmissaries from Japan, Thailand and South Korea have also been studying how the U.S. housing market finds the money for so many loans."}
