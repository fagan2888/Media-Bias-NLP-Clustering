He continued that the Senate hasn\u2019t \u201cmoved.\u201d\n\nWhen the discussion turned to the president\u2019s executive action on immigration, McCarthy argued \u201cthere\u2019s no funding there, and there should be as we go forward,\u201d and denied that the Congress funded it because \u201cthe courts had put a stay on it, so there was no funding going towards that.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy was then asked, \u201cAre you willing to defund Obamacare, and use your constitutional authority? Are you willing to use your \u2014 the power of the purse to defund Planned Parenthood? Will use the power of the purse to stop the power grab of this president through the use of executive amnesty, ignoring our laws and our Constitution? If you\u2019re speaker, will you go into your conference and say \u2018This is what we should do. We need to unite together.'\u201d He answered, \u201cI will unite them, and yes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy further discussed a specific strategy on Planned Parenthood, stating that there needs to be a select committee on Planned Parenthood, and \u201cWe need America to watch those videos\u201d and that he will need the help of conservative media to do so.\n\nIn the second segment, McCarthy was asked about Obamacare funding, Planned Parenthood funding, funding for the president\u2019s executive action on immigration, and the Iran deal, and whether \u201cif Kevin McCarthy is the speaker of the House, will you tell conservative America tonight, that you will fight to the end, that you will encourage every member, to defund on all of those issues, and use that power of the purse?\u201d\n\nHe responded, \u201cYes, the answer is yes. But I\u2019m going to do it with a strategy. And you want to know how the strategy\u2019s even playing out? Watch what we\u2019re passing what is dealing with Iran, just this week.\u201d McCarthy then pointed to a bill by Representative Patrick Meehan (R-PA) that will prevent Iran from receiving the $150 billion dollars the president will send to Iran unless they pay judgments of \u201calmost $44 billion\u201d against Iran due to their terrorist actions that killed Americans.\n\nLater in the interview, when the B- he gave to Boehner came up, McCarthy said, \u201cif you judge him on what he moved out of the House, I think you would change his grade. But I\u2019m not here to argue with that. But the thing I will you, everybody gets elected on their own.\u201d\n\nEarlier, on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper,\u201d McCarthy stated on Planned Parenthood \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we challenge him [President Obama]?\u201d He further argued for starting with a select committee to \u201cwin the argument, then win the vote.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked whether his previous vow of no government shutdowns extended to a promise not to have any defaults on debt. McCarthy responded that people want a change in Washington, and \u201cyou don\u2019t want to have a cliff, you want to make that argument ahead of time. Make your case, and put your ideas, and your bill forward.\u201d McCarthy added, when asked what he would do if the president vetoed a bill to avoid a default, that welfare reform was vetoed multiple times, and that \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem to send a bill to the White House a couple times.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also said he\u2019s opposed to amnesty, and touted the importance of the rule of law, while expressing support for starting with border security first.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "McCarthy: Gives Boehner B-, Vows Defund Fight On Obamacare, PP, Exec Amnesty, Iran Deal", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "McCarthy: Gives Boehner B-, Vows Defund Fight On Obamacare, PP, Exec Amnesty, Iran Deal", "title": "McCarthy: Gives Boehner B-, Vows Defund Fight On Obamacare, PP, Exec Amnesty, Iran Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/McCarthy-929-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/29/mccarthy-gives-boehner-b-vows-defund-fight-on-obamacare-pp-exec-amnesty-iran-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "McCarthy: Gives Boehner B-, Vows Defund Fight On Obamacare, PP, Exec Amnesty, Iran Deal", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/McCarthy-929-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "McCarthy: Gives Boehner B-, Vows Defund Fight On Obamacare, PP, Exec Amnesty, Iran Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, Iran Nuclear Deal, John Boehner, Kevin McCarthy, Planned Parenthood,Abortion, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,McCarthy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-09-29T22:23:05-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Abortion,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8c8\"", "article_summary": "Are you willing to use your \u2014 the power of the purse to defund Planned Parenthood?\n'\u201d He answered, \u201cI will unite them, and yes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201dMcCarthy further discussed a specific strategy on Planned Parenthood, stating that there needs to be a select committee on Planned Parenthood, and \u201cWe need America to watch those videos\u201d and that he will need the help of conservative media to do so.\nHe further pointed to decrease in the deficit during his time as Majority Leader, and pushing for border security.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican Majority Leader Representative Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) gave Speaker Representative John Boehner (R-OH) a B- and vowed to fight to defund Obamacare, the president\u2019s executive action on immigration, Planned Parenthood, and the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nWhen asked how he would grade Bohener, McCarthy gave Boehner a B-, and pointed to the GOP\u2019s large majority in the House, deficit reduction, and the number of bills passed in the House."}
