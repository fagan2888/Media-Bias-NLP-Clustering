Move over, Terry Bradshaw — the daughter of Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) says her mom could have a second career giving the inside scoop at sporting events.

Kassidy Noem, a University of Sioux Falls volleyball player, tweeted Sunday, “My mom should be a sports analyst,” complete with a grinning emoji shown crying tears of joy.

The younger Noem’s tweet came minutes after the lawmaker posted on Twitter: “Oh wow … now we have a game going.”

Noem’s office tells ITK she was watching the Green Bay Packers take on the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship game (earning Seattle a spot in the Super Bowl) at the time of her posts.

When we inquired about any potential future in the broadcast booth, Noem replied, “Who knows! I get pretty animated in games like the Seahawks-Packers matchup because as a [Minnesota] Vikings fan, I have seen my fair share of tragic mistakes leading to a loss.”

The lawmaker heaped praise on Sea-hawks quarterback Russell Wilson, saying the team’s come-from-behind 28-22 overtime win was driven by the football pro’s “belief that he could trust his team.”

“Go for broke, and that they did,” Noem said, adding, “From now on, he will be Mr. Wilson to me.”
