(CNN) - Hackers have stolen usernames and passwords for nearly two million accounts at Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo and others, according to a report released this week.

The security breach is a symptom of a much bigger problem that the world is facing, says Shawn Henry, former executive director of the FBI, where he oversaw computer crime investigations. Henry is currently president of Crowd Strike, a security technology organization that helps companies protect sensitive information.

The hackers didn't breach Google, Yahoo, or Facebook servers, but personal home computers.

"It appears that these are home computers that were compromised by this malicious software. They implemented keystroke loggers, so everything that somebody typed into their computer was captured by these adversaries. User names and passwords for those accounts," said Henry.

"We store and transmit data electronically. We don't keep it in file cabinets anymore. It's done electronically in an infrastructure that is inherently insecure," says Henry.



"Our adversaries know it, they know what the value is and are constantly targeting our data, 24/7, 365 days a year," says Henry.
