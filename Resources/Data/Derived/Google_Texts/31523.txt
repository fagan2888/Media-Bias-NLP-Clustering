Comedy Central’s animated comedy Brickleberry returns to start its third season Sept. 16.

The debut of the 13-episode third season debut will air at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT.

In the premiere episode, “Obamascare,” President Obama visits Brickleberry to honor Woody’s 30 years of perfect attendance as a park ranger and true to Brickleberry form, pandemonium ensues. After Woody is accidentally shot, Steve volunteers to be part of a very unique solution, and Bobby Possumcods, angered by Obamacare policies, creates his own backwoods healthcare plan.

The series features the voices of Tom Kenny, Natasha Leggero, Dave Herman, Jerry Minor and Daniel Tosh. The series is created by executive producers Waco O’Guin and Roger Black, with Tosh also serving as an executive producer. It’s produced by Fox 21.
