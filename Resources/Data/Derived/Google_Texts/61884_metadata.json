The plane lost contact with ground controllers somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nHowever, searchers in a low-flying plane spotted an object that appeared to be one of the plane\u2019s doors, the state-run Thanh Nien newspaper said, citing the deputy chief of staff of Vietnam\u2019s army, Lt. Gen. Vo Van Tuan.\n\nTwo ships from the maritime police were headed to the site about 60 miles (90 kilometers) south of Tho Chu island in the Gulf of Thailand, the same area where oil slicks were spotted Saturday.\n\n\u201cFrom this object, hopefully (we) will find the missing plane,\u201d Tuan said.\n\nThe missing jetliner apparently fell from the sky at cruising altitude in fine weather, and the pilots were either unable or had no time to send a distress signal \u2013 unusual circumstances under which a modern jetliner operated by a professional airline would crash.\n\nAuthorities were checking on the identities of the two passengers who boarded the plane with stolen passports. On Saturday, the foreign ministries in Italy and Austria said the names of two citizens listed on the flight\u2019s manifest matched the names on two passports reported stolen in Thailand.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that we have the visuals of these two people on CCTV,\u201d Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference late Sunday, adding that the footage was being examined. \u201cWe have intelligence agencies, both local and international, on board.\u201d\n\nThe thefts of the two passports \u2013 one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy \u2013 were entered into Interpol\u2019s database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said. But no authorities in Malaysia or elsewhere checked the passports against the database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents before the Malaysian Airlines plane took off.\n\nIn a forceful statement, the Interpol chief, who has called passport fraud one of the world\u2019s greatest threats, said he hoped \u201cthat governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists,\u201d Noble said. \u201cInterpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights.\u201d\n\nTroubling details also emerged Sunday about the itineraries of the two passengers traveling on the stolen passports.\n\nA telephone operator on a China-based KLM hotline confirmed Sunday that passengers named Maraldi and Kozel had been booked on one-way tickets on the same KLM flight, flying from Beijing to Amsterdam on Saturday. Maraldi was to fly on to Copenhagen, Denmark, and Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nShe said the pair booked the tickets through China Southern Airlines, but she had no information on where they bought them.\n\nAs holders of EU passports with onward flights to Europe, the passengers would not have needed visas for China.\n\nInterpol said it and national investigators were working to determine the true identities of those who used the stolen passports to board the Malaysia Airlines flight. White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said the U.S. was looking into the stolen passports, but that investigators had reached no conclusions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"From this object, hopefully (we) will find the missing plane,\"  said Vietnam's Lt.
