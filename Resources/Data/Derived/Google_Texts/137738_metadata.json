Paul Ryan (R-WI) (L), Chairman of the House Budget Committee, arrives for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol where he unveiled his budget plan on March 12, 2013 in Washington, DC. U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to meet with both Republican and Democratic caucuses this week about the budget, starting today with the Senate Democrats. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAfter a day of rampant misinformation, dishonest political attacks, and misleading media reports, Congressional Budget Office director Doug Elmendorf took the stand before a House committee to explain what, exactly, his report says about Obamacare.\n\nThe president\u2019s health care law does create a new incentive for people to work fewer hours to qualify for subsidized insurance, Elmendorf told the House Budget Committee on Wednesday. But that means they are consciously deciding to forgo a higher salary because it\u2019s worth more to them to have cheaper health-care and more time for other things, he stressed.\n\n\u201cThere is a critical difference between people who want to work and can\u2019t find a job\u2026and people who choose not to work because because [they\u2019ve] decided to retire, or spend more time with their family, or spend time on a hobby,\u201d Elmendorf said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel bad about it, they feel good about it. We don\u2019t feel bad about it, we say, \u2018Congratulations.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the most part, it will be lower-income Americans making these decisions: The maximum income to qualify for the Medicaid expansion is $15,282 for a single individual and $31,322 for a family of four. Exchange subsidies phase out altogether for single people earning $45,960, and families of four earning $94,200. Since the Medicaid eligibility and exchange subsidies are scaled according to income\u2014i.e., means-tested\u2014earning less income would make it easier to get cheaper insurance.\n\nThat\u2019s prompted criticism from Republicans who argue that the new government program is a new \u201cpoverty trap\u201d that will discourage lower-income Americans from working more, as Rep. Paul Ryan declared at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cI guess I understand \u2018better off\u2019 in the context of healthcare. But \u2018better off\u2019 in inducing a person not to work who is on the low-income scale, not to get on the ladder of life, to begin working, getting the dignity of work, getting more opportunities, rising their income, joining the middle class, this means fewer people will do that,\u201d Ryan told Elmendorf. In other words, Obamacare will create more \u201ctakers\u201d not \u201cmakers,\u201d in Ryan\u2019s worldview.\n\nClick here to read more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC - The president\u2019s health care law does create a new incentive for people to work fewer hours to qualify for subsidized insurance, Elmendorf told the House Budget Committee on Wednesday...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "theGrio", "description": "MSNBC - The president\u2019s health care law does create a new incentive for people to work fewer hours to qualify for subsidized insurance, Elmendorf told the House Budget Committee on Wednesday...", "title": "Paul Ryan: Obamacare is a \u2018poverty\u00a0trap\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2572, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paul-ryan-budget.jpg?fit=2572%2C1447", "height": 1447}, "url": "http://thegrio.com/2014/02/06/paul-ryan-obamacare-is-a-poverty-trap/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1699887390250781, "pages": 75928194876}, "google-site-verification": "nGSqmdocNPXRMLRT9q_QAemkqyzj9W5Vd4tzA7hsksg", "keywords": "politics, barack obama, cbo, house budget committee, obamacare, paul ryan, poverty", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Poverty", "published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T19:15:22+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "Rep.
