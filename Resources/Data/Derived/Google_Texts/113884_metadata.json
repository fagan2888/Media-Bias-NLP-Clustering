It swung between triumph and tragedy, often in the space of a few weeks. Angela Gossow stepped down from Arch Enemy, Slayer\u2019s lineup continued to rotate like a damn rotisserie, and a Bill Ward-less Black Sabbath won a Grammy. We said a lot of goodbyes \u2014 to GWAR\u2019s Dave Brockie, to The Gates of Slumbers\u2019 Jason McCash, to Black Tusk\u2019s Jonathan Athon, to too many more.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t all been doom and gloom, though. Black Tusk (joined by longtime friend Corey Barhorst) has just announced a European tour, and GWAR\u2019s new female member, Vulvatron, has already won over the band\u2019s diehard fans. Despite typical doomsday predictions, metal has actually enjoyed a huge upswing in creativity, resulting in genre-defying new sounds and styles that see releases from Nux Vomica and the Atlas Moth nestle in comfortably alongside more orthodox practitioners like Blut Aus Nord and Death Congregation. Metal is still dogged by the issues that arise from its deep-seated conservative values, but thanks to an increase in conversations about racism, politics, and feminism, those on the right side of history have gained solid ground.\n\nAt the end of the day, metal ain\u2019t perfect \u2014 but it\u2019s ours, and we love it, warts and all. Here are a few of 2014\u2019s brightest metallic moments.
