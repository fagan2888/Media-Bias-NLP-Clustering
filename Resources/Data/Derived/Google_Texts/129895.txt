What brought you here? What has kept you here? My family moved from western Kansas to Longmont in 1975, when my father was hired as a math teacher and basketball coach at Niwot High School. My wife, Tara, and I decided to raise our family here because we love it.

What's the best part of being the principal at Lyons Middle/Senior? I love being the principal at Lyons Middle/Senior High because of our focus on excellence in academics, athletics and the fine arts. My unofficial motto is "Lyons Middle/Senior is a small school with big results."

Best change at Lyons Middle/Senior since the flood? We realized the need to expand our concurrent enrollment options in the high school. When students missed seven days of school, it caused us to think about offering online courses. We now have a partnership with Colorado State University to offer online college courses for our students.
