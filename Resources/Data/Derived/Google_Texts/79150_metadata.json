He trained as an electronic turrets mechanic and was stationed at Loring Air Force Base in Maine until he was honorably discharged in October 1957.\n\n\u201cI do want to thank the Cherokee Nation for the things they do for veterans, especially this new veterans center that sits down here,\u201d said Herman Kennicutt. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real boom for a lot of people, a lot of veterans who didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go or anyplace to go for help. The late Rogan Noble, many of you knew him, gave me a lot of help in getting me disability through the veterans administration. So, to Rogan and all of the Cherokee Nation, thank you very much.\u201d\n\nSgt. 1st Class Herman Kennicutt was born on October 15, 1934, in Tahlequah to C.H. and Onie Kennicutt.
