( Courtesy Photo )\n\nFremont County Graduations Ca\u00f1on City High School, 9 a.m. May 23 at Citizens Stadium, 1313 College Ave. Cotopaxi High School, 10:30 a.m. May 23 at 345 CR12, Cotopaxi. Florence High School, 2 p.m. May 24 at 2006 Colo. 67, Florence.\n\nCa\u00f1on City High School graduating seniors will carry on a tradition that began before any of them were even born.\n\nFor the 27th consecutive year, the CCHS Fun Fest will offer seniors an afternoon and evening of fun, food, prizes and memories from 3-11 p.m. May 22 at the school, on the eve of graduation.\n\nSunflower Bank President Larry Stringari and the late Rhody Heinen, a retired Ca\u00f1on City High School JROTC instructor, created the Fun Fest in 1988, two years after Cindy Javernick and Chris Berry were killed in an automobile accident the weekend prior to Javernick's graduation. Berry and Javernick had not been drinking, but the car that hit them was racing with another vehicle.\n\n\"We're giving them a place to be, as a group, for one last big hoorah before they walk across that stage,\" said Shad Johnson, event volunteer and co-organizer.\n\nHe said there will be more than 60 different games throughout the evening, running simultaneously. Festivities begin outside, weather permitting, then transition into the auxiliary gym around the time dinner is served.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everyone sticks around until the very end because that's when we have the major prize drawings,\" Johnson said.\n\nSome of the larger prizes include flat-screen TVs, Xboxes, laptops, iPads and more.\n\nGames are geared to suit all participants interests and abilities, whether they like more physical games or those that are mentally challenging. There will be a couple of new surprise games this year, Johnson said, that the students are sure to enjoy.\n\nWashington Elementary School teacher Shelly Stringari took part in the inaugural Fun Fest event when she was a senior in 1988. Her two oldest children, Trevor and Demi, participated in Fun Fest when they were seniors, and her son, Trenton, will take part this year.\n\n\"I love how the community, especially the people from Sunflower Bank, are making this huge impact on kids,\" she said. \"All these dedicated people are putting kids first, caring about their safety and providing them a place to go \u2014 as a parent, it's huge.\"\n\nAlong with Johnson and Larry Stringari, Claudine Paolino, Larry Weaver, Patty Ritter and Deanna Johnson also volunteer their time and services to make the event fun and memorable.\n\nSunflower Bank, formerly First National Bank, has been the main sponsor of the event, and the Ca\u00f1on City Rotary Club and the CCHS Tiger Booster Club also co-sponsor the event, along with individuals, families, groups, organizations and businesses who contribute their time, resources and prizes.\n\nContributions of cash or prizes may be dropped off or mailed to Sunflower Bank, 831 Royal Gorge Blvd., or at Mueller Financial Solutions, 303 N. Seventh St.\n\nFor more information, call Claudine Paolino at Sunflower Bank at 275-2311 or Johnson at 275-1651.\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27892780/fun-fest-aims-keep-seniors-busy-safe-before", "modificationDate": "2015-04-11T15:36:49-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0410/20150410__11DRFUNFEST~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Fremont County Graduations Ca\u00f1on City High School,  9 a.m. May 23 at Citizens Stadium, 1313 College Ave.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27892780:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-11T13:02:44-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27892780/fun-fest-aims-keep-seniors-busy-safe-before", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0410/20150410__11DRFUNFEST~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fremont County Graduations Ca\u00f1on City High School,  9 a.m. May 23 at Citizens Stadium, 1313 College Ave.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School Fun Fest aims to keep seniors busy, safe before graduation"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Fremont County Graduations Ca\u00f1on City High School,  9 a.m. May 23 at Citizens Stadium, 1313 College Ave.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School Fun Fest aims to keep seniors busy, safe before graduation", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27892780/fun-fest-aims-keep-seniors-busy-safe-before", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0410/20150410__11DRFUNFEST~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-11T13:02:44-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-04-10T21:54:47-0600", "sailthru.title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School Fun Fest aims to keep seniors busy, safe before graduation", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0410/20150410__11DRFUNFEST~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-04-11T13:04:10-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfa3\"", "article_summary": "( Courtesy Photo )Fremont County Graduations Ca\u00f1on City High School, 9 a.m. May 23 at Citizens Stadium, 1313 College Ave. Cotopaxi High School, 10:30 a.m. May 23 at 345 CR12, Cotopaxi.\nCa\u00f1on City High School graduating seniors will carry on a tradition that began before any of them were even born.\nGraduating students of the Class of 2014 take part in the annual Fun Fest at Ca\u00f1on City High School in May 2014.\nWashington Elementary School teacher Shelly Stringari took part in the inaugural Fun Fest event when she was a senior in 1988.\nHer two oldest children, Trevor and Demi, participated in Fun Fest when they were seniors, and her son, Trenton, will take part this year."}
