In contrast, a majority of respondents, 60-38, supported the employer mandate that requires companies with 100 or more workers to provide health insurance.\n\nAn earlier New York Times poll, conducted in December 2013, found that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that the Affordable Care Act would increase their medical costs; 14 percent said it would reduce costs. Thirty-six percent believed that Obamacare would worsen the quality of health care compared to 17 percent who thought it would improve it.\n\nOn the plus side for the Affordable Care Act, those surveyed by the Times decisively supported, 86-10, the requirement that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions; the requirement to cover children in parents\u2019 plans up to age 26 was supported 70-28; and 76 percent supported providing some help to poor workers who do not have employer-based coverage.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, answering my email, wrote that the tax credits in the Republican plans \u201ctend to be quite a bit less generous\u201d than under Obamacare, and that \u201clow-income people, in particular, were likely to end up with very skimpy insurance\u201d and fewer low-income people would be covered under the program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe conservative shift in public attitudes on health care and on issues of redistribution and inequality pose a significant threat to the larger liberal agenda.\n\nThe 2013 paper published in Public Opinion Quarterly that I mentioned at the beginning of this article, \u201cThe Structure of Inequality and Americans\u2019 Attitudes Toward Redistribution,\u201d suggests that Democratic programs providing tax-financed benefits to the poor are facing growing hostility.\n\nThe author of the paper, Matthew Luttig, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Minnesota, found that while \u201cnumerous political theorists suggest that rising inequality and the shift in the distribution of income to those at the top should lead to increasing support for liberal policies,\u201d in practice, \u201crising inequality in the United States has largely promoted ideological conservatism.\u201d\n\nLuttig compares public attitudes with inequality trends and reports that his data show that:\n\nBoth the absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected.\n\nI asked two experts, Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale, and Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell, if Luttig\u2019s conclusions are consistent with their own research, and both said he is on target. Luttig\u2019s conclusions run counter to the view of liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is calling on her fellow Democrats to make tackling inequality a top priority. Heather McGhee, for example, the president of Demos (motto: \u201can equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy\u201d), argues that inequality should be \u201cthe defining issue of the American political debate this campaign cycle.\u201d\n\nInsofar as Luttig is right, his findings pose a serious dilemma for Democrats and for their likely nominee, Hillary Clinton. A party that claims to pursue policies benefiting those on the bottom half of the income ladder inevitably faces questions about the issue of redistribution.\n\nDivisions within the Democratic Party run deep and are not limited to health care. There are splits on matters as diverse as the carried interest tax break, a capital-gains tax break which is a bottom line matter for major Wall Street Democratic donors, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, a test of strength between multinational corporations who favor it, and organized labor, which is opposed.\n\nIn her announcement video on April 12, Clinton chose to emphasize cultural themes of family, same-sex marriage, education and women\u2019s rights \u2013 taking the spotlight off income inequality. She avoided the issue of explicitly redistributive goals and focused instead on \u201croadblocks\u201d facing workers trying to climb the ladder.\n\nBut this kind of evasiveness can\u2019t last. Neither core Democratic constituencies on the left nor Republicans on the right will permit Clinton to remain guarded on these divisive issues. If conservative beliefs are strengthening in direct proportion to increasing inequality, however, Democrats are caught in a policy bind that has no short-term solution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe General Social Survey shows there has been a slight decrease in stated support for redistribution in the US since the 1970s, even among those who self-identify as having below-average income,\u201d according to Saez and his three co-authors, Ilyana Kuziemko, a professor at Columbia Business School, Michael I. Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Stefanie Stantcheva, a junior fellow at Harvard.\n\nEven worse for Democrats, the Saez paper found that \u201cinformation about inequality also makes respondents trust government less,\u201d decreasing \u201cby nearly twenty percent the share of respondents who \u2018trust government\u2019 most of the time:\u201d\n\nHence, emphasizing the severity of a social or economic problem appears to undercut respondents\u2019 willingness to trust the government to fix it \u2014 the existence of the problem could act as evidence of the government\u2019s limited capacity to improve outcomes.\n\nThe findings of the Saez group are consistent with Luttig\u2019s. Taken together, they suggest that even if Democrats win the presidency and the Senate in 2016, largely on the basis of favorable demographic trends, the party will confront serious hurdles if it attempts to deliver material support to working men and women and the very poor.
