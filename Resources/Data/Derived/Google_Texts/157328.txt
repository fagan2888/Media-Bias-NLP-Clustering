Wisconsin's new Supreme Court chief justice has responded to an article in the New Yorker that called the court "a disgraceful mess" by saying the writer "didn't have his facts straight."

The article, posted online Monday, said a legal fight over the chief justice position "is the latest drama in a decadelong saga that, largely through money-fuelled and often nasty judicial elections, has intensified the turn of the Wisconsin Supreme Court from a congenial, moderately liberal institution into a severely divided conservative stronghold. More to the point, the elections have reduced it from one of the nationâ€™s most respected state tribunals into a disgraceful mess."

The author was former journalist Lincoln Caplan, who is a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.

On Friday, on Wisconsin Public Television's "Here and Now" program, Chief Justice Pat Roggensack responded to the article by saying:

"I would tell you the person didn't spend any time investigating the Wisconsin Supreme Court. We are constantly cited by supreme courts of other states, by federal courts, for the reasoning and the thoroughness of our opinions. So, I don't know -- it's fine to chide someone, but it would be well if you'd know your facts first. And that writer did not know his facts. "

That part of the interview starts at about 4 minutes of this video.
