The 69-year-old, who struggles with heart disease, said his doctor's office in Concord Township in Lake County is closing, and he's worried he'll have to drive at least 30 minutes to get care.\n\n\"They have breached their contract with me,\" said Helwick, who has Medicare supplemental insurance with HealthSpan. \"Convenience was one of the reasons I signed up with them. My doctor was less than a mile from me.\"\n\nHealthSpan said it will work with Helwick and other members to ensure they find convenient care following the closure of its physicians group on March 31. But Helwick's situation highlights the potential pitfalls facing HealthSpan customers in the wake of the company's decision to exit the direct care business.\n\nAt this stage, the extent of the disruption is largely unknown. MetroHealth said last week that it is hiring the majority of HealthSpan's doctors, and the remainder will join other local health systems, move out of the area, or retire.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions, HealthSpan spokesman Nathan Kaplan said the company \"meets or exceeds\" network coverage requirements enforced by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\"We are currently evaluating our networks across the nine county service area that HealthSpan Physicians currently serves,\" Kaplan said, adding that the company remains \"committed to ensuring members will have convenient access to a network of physicians after\" the March 31 closure date.\n\n\n\nHelwick said he feels trapped. Had he known he was going to lose his doctor, he said, he would have signed up with another insurer. But he said he did not receive notification from HealthSpan in time to find another option during this year's open enrollment period.\n\n\n\n\"If I can't get out of the contract, I'm stuck until the next open enrollment with a service which is considerably degraded from the one that I contracted for,\" Helwick said. \"They're putting my premiums in their pocket and they're not delivering services.\"\n\n\n\nKaplan said the Dec. 12 announcement that it was disbanding its physicians group was not intended to prevent customers from jumping to other insurers.\n\n\n\n\"HealthSpan underwent a thorough, comprehensive review of its current and future business strategy of HealthSpan Physicians,\" he said. \"Upon completion of this review in late 2015, the difficult decision was made to no longer provide direct patient care and dissolve the medical group on March 31, 2016. The timing of this announcement was not related to open enrollment.\"\n\n\n\nHelwick said he intends to file complaints with Ohio regulators against HealthSpan for breach of contract. He said he has a farewell appointment scheduled with his doctor soon, but he isn't sure what he'll do next.\n\n\n\n\"I have a few friends who are nurses, so hopefully they'll be able to make me a recommendation,\" he said. \"I had heart failure a couple years ago, so I do need service periodically. And I need to be able to get a hold of my doctor when I need him.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "HealthSpan, healthspan, medicare, metrohealth, health, living", "title": "Facing loss of doctor, Lake County man accuses HealthSpan of breaching contract", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Facing loss of doctor, Lake County man accuses HealthSpan of breaching contract\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2016/01/facing_loss_of_doctor_lake_cou.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19583862-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17838758\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-21T12:08:13Z\", \"author\": \"Casey Ross, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@zzz\",\"healthspan\",\"medicare\",\"metrohealth\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19583862-standard.jpg", "creator": "@byCaseyRoss", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lake County resident Don Helwick said HealthSpan breached its contract with him when it closed its physicians group, a decision that Helwick worries will force him to drive a half an hour to get care."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 21, 2016, 10:33 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/lake-county-man-accuses-healthspan-of-breaching-contract-32cd0c50f8a31fa2.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"caseyross\", \"author_nickname\": \"Casey Ross, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"12550899\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Lake County resident Don Helwick said HealthSpan breached its contract with him when it closed its physicians group, a decision that Helwick worries will force him to drive a half an hour to get care.", "title": "Facing loss of doctor, Lake County man accuses HealthSpan of breaching contract", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2016/01/facing_loss_of_doctor_lake_cou.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19583862-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 21, 2016,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Casey Ross, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "Lake County resident Don Helwick said HealthSpan breached its contract with him when it closed its physicians group, a decision that Helwick worries will force him to drive a half an hour to get care."}, "article_summary": "\"HealthSpan underwent a thorough, comprehensive review of its current and future business strategy of HealthSpan Physicians,\" he said.\nThe announcement meant many HealthSpan members would be able to keep their doctors.\n\"I had heart failure a couple years ago, so I do need service periodically.\nKaplan said the Dec. 12 announcement that it was disbanding its physicians group was not intended to prevent customers from jumping to other insurers.\n\"They have breached their contract with me,\" said Helwick, who has Medicare supplemental insurance with HealthSpan."}
