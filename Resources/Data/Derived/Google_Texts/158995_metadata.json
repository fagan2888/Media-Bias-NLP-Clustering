We met up with those who stand to benefit from health care reform and those who would not.\n\nCBS News\n\nKaren Defnall did not vote for the President -- and was no fan of health care reform -- until she learned that Obamacare could be a very good deal for her.\n\n\"I perceived this as a blessing and if it comes into fruition, I'm very grateful for this,\" said Defnall.\n\nDefnall, who runs a small day care in Virginia, is about to lose her current policy with Anthem Health.\n\nHer monthly premium now, at $771, will go down under Obamacare to $221, thanks to a federal subsidy.\n\nShe also saves on out of pocket costs.\n\nDefnall's current policy has limited coverage for preventive tests, pediatric care and the emergency room. But all of that is covered under the new law, and could reduce her out of pocket costs, around $1,500 this year -- to zero.\n\nWH docs: Paper applications for Obamacare were problematic, too\n\nTake HealthCare.gov offline until it is fixed, Feinstein and Rogers say\n\nObamacare website failed in tests just before launch date\n\nCBS News\n\nHer policy under the new law covers all of that, but adds a list of new essential benefits, including pediatric dental care and maternity care -- benefits Sager does not need.\n\nBut many others feel betrayed by health care reform, and they include Anita Sager. \"I'm very upset. Very upset,\" said Sager.\n\nSager is also a business owner in Virginia and is losing a policy from Anthem Health. Her monthly premium now, $392, would rise 34 percent under Obamacare to $527 -- and she gets no federal subsidy, because her income is too high. Her current policy covers doctor visits, hospitalization and prescription drugs.\n\n\"It's not necessary for me, so why should I be forced to pay for a service I don't need? I don't think that's fair,\" said Sager.\n\nThe president is under fire now for breaking that longstanding promise that no one would lose the insurance that they like. But the president's supporters point out that before healthcare reform, people lost insurance all the time by getting sick and canceled. Under health reform, that's now illegal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under health care reform, some people would see their premiums go down, while others are told that their health insurance will be cancelled", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/06/0c53edcd-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/0e0d847f9bda93a1ca7daa35b89a6889/131106-Karen_Defnall.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Under health care reform, some people would see their premiums go down, while others are told that their health insurance will be cancelled", "title": "A tale of two insureds: One benefits, one loses under Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under health care reform, some people would see their premiums go down, while others are told that their health insurance will be cancelled", "title": "A tale of two insureds: One benefits, one loses under Obamacare", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbseveningnews", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/06/0c53edcd-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/0e0d847f9bda93a1ca7daa35b89a6889/131106-Karen_Defnall.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-tale-of-two-insureds-one-benefits-one-loses-under-obamacare/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSEveningNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "We met up with those who stand to benefit from health care reform and those who would not.\nBut many others feel betrayed by health care reform, and they include Anita Sager.\nCBS NewsKaren Defnall did not vote for the President -- and was no fan of health care reform -- until she learned that Obamacare could be a very good deal for her.\nDefnall, who runs a small day care in Virginia, is about to lose her current policy with Anthem Health.\n(CBS News) WASHINGTON -- About 3.5 million Americans have been told their health insurance will be canceled because their plans don't meet the minimum requirements of Obamacare."}
