But the group\u2019s original song \u201cSad Tomorrow\u201d (found on 1995\u2019s \u201cBlonder and Blonder\u201d) is a far better representation of their melodic punk; frontwoman Kim Shattuck\u2019s inimitable gravelly voice gives the ringing power-pop tune the perfect amount of grit.\n\nDambuilders, \u201cShrine\u201d\n\nAlthough perhaps best known today for being the first band of violinist Joan Wasser (a.k.a. Joan As Police Woman), Boston\u2019s the Dambuilders maintained a unique sound that in hindsight presaged the \u201900s indie-orchestral boom. \u201cShrine,\u201d which features a humming bass underbelly and lovely string countermelodies from Wasser, is one of their loveliest moments.\n\nBettie Serveert, \u201cRay Ray Rain\u201d\n\nDutch indie rockers Bettie Serveert fit in perfectly with the decade\u2019s open-minded mentality. The early single \u201cRay Ray Rain\u201d was introspective enough to fit in with delicate indie-folk acts \u2014 its chorus blooms with optimism and then settles into a sighing melancholic groove \u2014 but its strident guitar strumming and askew solo added welcome backbone.\n\nBest Kissers in the World, \u201cMiss Teen USA\u201d\n\nSeattle shoulda-beens Best Kissers in the World excelled at the type of off-kilter grungy power-pop that flourished during the decade. The single \u201cMiss Teen USA\u201d comes off like a Pacific Northwest Lemonheads, all distorted sweetness and burnt-sugar harmonies.\n\nMaterial Issue, \u201cValerie Loves Me\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chicago trio Material Issue released three incredible records, including 1991\u2019s \u201cInternational Pop Overthrow,\u201d which spawned this jangly power-pop classic. Deceptively upbeat, the sly song is from the point of view of a protagonist too shy (or too uncool) to catch the eye of a beautiful woman \u2014 who he then envisions growing old by herself; at that point, he has the last word: \u201cBut she can\u2019t have me.\u201d\n\nJellyfish, \u201cAll I Want Is Everything\u201d\n\nThe late, great Jellyfish deserves praise for many things: pristine harmonies, intricate classic rock homages, ornate arrangements and a kaleidoscopic psych-rock bent. How the band interpreted this challenging music live is perhaps their biggest accomplishment; this Letterman performance of \u201cAll I Want Is Everything\u201d is controlled chaos spearheaded by drummer/vocalist Andy Sturmer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"Miss Teen USA\" to \"Sister Havana,\" the '90s gems that somehow disappeared from the cultural radar VIDEO", "title": "The best \u201990s songs you completely forgot about", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"Miss Teen USA\" to \"Sister Havana,\" the '90s gems that somehow disappeared from the cultural radar VIDEO", "title": "The best \u201990s songs you completely forgot about", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/02/the_best_90s_songs_you_completely_forgot_about/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/forgotten_nineties_songs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"Miss Teen USA\" to \"Sister Havana,\" the '90s gems that somehow disappeared from the cultural radar VIDEO", "title": "The best \u201990s songs you completely forgot about", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/forgotten_nineties_songs.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Zaleski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 90s, Culture, Entertainment, Music, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bettie Serveert, \u201cRay Ray Rain\u201dDutch indie rockers Bettie Serveert fit in perfectly with the decade\u2019s open-minded mentality.\nThe early single \u201cRay Ray Rain\u201d was introspective enough to fit in with delicate indie-folk acts \u2014 its chorus blooms with optimism and then settles into a sighing melancholic groove \u2014 but its strident guitar strumming and askew solo added welcome backbone.\nBest Kissers in the World, \u201cMiss Teen USA\u201dSeattle shoulda-beens Best Kissers in the World excelled at the type of off-kilter grungy power-pop that flourished during the decade.\nDambuilders, \u201cShrine\u201dAlthough perhaps best known today for being the first band of violinist Joan Wasser (a.k.a.\nJoan As Police Woman), Boston\u2019s the Dambuilders maintained a unique sound that in hindsight presaged the \u201900s indie-orchestral boom."}
