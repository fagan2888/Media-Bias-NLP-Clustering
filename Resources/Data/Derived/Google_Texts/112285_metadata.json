For him, a tiny house is \u201cany home in which all of the space is being used well.\u201d\n\nTiny isn\u2019t new. Shafer cites Henry David Thoreau who, a century and a half ago, went into the woods for a two-year, two-month and two-day stay at a cozy, 150-square-foot cottage that cost about $836 modern-day dollars. Thoreau wanted \u201cto live more deliberately,\u201d he explains in \u201cWalden,\u201d the aftermath of his ordeal, a critique of Western culture published in 1852 that explored (still-pressing) problems like rampant consumerism and a growing disconnection from nature.\n\nBefore that, Native Americans, like all indigenous people, lived in little dwellings called teepees, wigwams, adobes, huts, etc. Later, during the industrial revolution, American workers inhabited crude, makeshift shacks with dirt floors. Today, some 20 million people occupy trailers across the United States, which have been around since 1910 and are frequently associated with poverty. For the vast majority \u2014 Shafer and Durango-based builder Greg Parham included \u2014 tiny homes remain a factor of financial necessity, not choice.\n\nThe Tiny House Movement was thrown onto the radar of America\u2019s elite and middle classes in March 2013, when The New York Times ran a minimalist manifesto by Graham Hill, a single, wealthy man who was so moved by his travels abroad he ditched a lucrative West Coast gig and sprawling urban manors for an untethered life in the most practical, 420-square-foot New York apartment money could buy.\n\nWell, the price tag wasn\u2019t so simple: After purchasing the apartment for $287,000 in 2009, Hill spent $365,000 renovating it, according to Curbed. Earlier this year, he put that micro-home on the market for $995,000 \u2014 $2,369 per square foot \u2014 transforming Thoreau\u2019s Tiny House Movement of yesteryear into something appealing to folks who, much like myself, adore the idea of simple, eco-friendly living, but lack the wherewithal to actually go into the woods to find it.\n\nForbes recently examined the steep cost of tiny homes, which typically range from $200 to $400 per square foot \u2014 far more than the average single-family Denver home, which was valued at $174 per square foot in September 2014. And, that tiny house pricetag doesn\u2019t usually include land. In Montecito, Calif., a perfectly austere 510-square-foot \u201cArtist\u2019s Retreat\u201d raked in nearly $1.2 million. Canoe Bay, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles, makes a 400-square-foot RV called the \u201cEscape,\u201d that ranges from $79,000 to $124,900.\n\nI know. We can\u2019t generalize to an entire group based on a few people. Surely some tiny housers are \u201cdriving life into a corner, and reducing it to its lowest terms,\u201d as Thoreau set out to do. These folks represent the heart of the movement, but probably not the mass. Kristen Moeller, who teensified in Conifer after her original, regular-sized home was destroyed in the 2012 wildfires there, told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a true tiny life is a sustainable lifestyle for most people.\u201d After all, even Thoreau came back.\n\nIts unclear exactly how big the tiny movement is, and Shafer says it\u2019s hard to pinpoint demographics within it because tiny house statistics don\u2019t exist. Many tiny homes are built discreetly and hidden since they\u2019re illegal under most zoning codes, Parham adds.\n\nHere\u2019s what is clear: The Hill camp doesn\u2019t buy tiny to connect with nature or live sustainably. The simplicity they seek is a materialistic interpretation of simple focusing on embellished, over-the-top minimalist aesthetic, and it succinctly captures the tiny contradiction, which is that its possible to live a simple life in a teeny, tiny home because, heck, if you\u2019d like to toss the majority of your possessions into a landfill, you can always buy more disposable, offshore stuff later.\n\nTo be fair, Hill isn\u2019t the only one to feel burdened by resources. I\u2019ve laid awake imagining a life without five junk drawers filled with green Whole Foods rubber bands and Apple chargers and missing puzzle pieces, action-sized dinosaurs and socks. \u201cThere is an inherent attraction, whether you are rich or poor, to a boiled down version of simplicity,\u201d says Shafer. If only the heart and mind could sync up.\n\nTechnically, tiny isn\u2019t what most of us want \u2014 it\u2019s what we wish we wanted. Americans aren\u2019t trading McMansions for souped-up, cardboard-box sized quarters. Over the last 40 years, the average home has increased in size by more than 1,000 square feet, from 1,660 square feet in 1973 to 2,679 square feet last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nMeanwhile, the average household size has declined from 3.01 persons per household to a record low of 2.54 persons per household during the same period. With the average new house in the United States getter larger at the same time households are shrinking, the square footage of living space per person has increased a whopping 91.2 percent since the 1970s.\n\nNow for an incongruity: Schafer estimates two-thirds of the tiny house plans he sells are intended for backyard retreats \u2014 essentially, additions to existing homes.\n\nThe Tiny House Movement isn\u2019t the only manifestation of the notion that Americans have so much we literally need nothing. In the 1990s, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d ran a game-show- style skit where a man from a developing nation was competing for a goat to bring back to his village. He floundered, though, when asked about the word used to describe a person who has enough food but won\u2019t eat it.\n\nIf \u201canorexia\u201d is tricky for those with less to understand, I wonder how the glitzy portion of the Tiny House Movement is perceived.\n\nPerhaps mainstream tiny, as distinguished from situational tiny and authentic tiny, is merely another (very sneaky) form of consumerism begging us to ditch the things we already own and buy shiny-new, better stuff. The key to genuine simplicity, though, isn\u2019t finding something that makes you happy. It\u2019s figuring out how to be happy with what you\u2019ve got.\n\nI\u2019m all for living deliberately, and I love the potential of tiny. It\u2019s the execution that\u2019s troubling because the inherent message is that having plenty isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nIf there\u2019s a way to live more consciously while simultaneously acknowledging and appreciating how great we have it \u2014 well, that\u2019s a movement I\u2019d rather get behind.\n\nJamie Siebrase is a Denver-based freelancer writer and journalist specializing in arts, culture, and parenting.
