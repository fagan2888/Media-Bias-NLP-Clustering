A recall stemming from an E. coli scare now spans more than a dozen states and includes products sold at major grocery chains, including Walmart, Safeway and Albertsons.

Contaminated celery from California-based Taylor Farms Pacific was found to be the source of Costco's chicken salad recall last week. The Food and Drug Administration expanded the recall of food products on Tuesday.

It now includes 155,000 items such as salad kits, vegetable trays and other prepared foods.

Among the stores involved are Walmart, Sams Club, Costco, Albertsons, 7-Eleven, Target and Safeway.

The products were primarily distributed in Western states, but stores in states including Georgia, Arkansas, Nebraska and Hawaii are also affected.

More than 45,000 Starbucks holiday turkey sandwiches distributed in California, Oregon and Nevada were also included.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 19 people were infected in seven states across the U.S. from eating Costco's chicken salad.

Officials are continuing to investigate the outbreak.

Chipotle was also hit with an E. coli scare in early November.
