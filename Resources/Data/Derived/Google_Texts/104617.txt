Last night’s “Saturday Night Live” cold-opened with four brunchers coming to a consensus on Clinton: “Hillary has everything I want in a president, but she’s no Bernie.”

Kate McKinnon, as Clinton, then descended on a swing to sing a rendition of Bonnie Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me.”

Another–who when told it wasn’t her feminist duty to vote for Hillary said, “Oh, then I’m voting for Bernie”–joined the group, once again summoning Hillary, this time on a piano being played by Bill Clinton (SNL announcer and alum Darrell Hammond).

“Like her for my sake,” said Bill.
