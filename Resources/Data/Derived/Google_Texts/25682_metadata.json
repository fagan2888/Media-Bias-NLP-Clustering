It hovers for a moment, then makes a sudden feint to the left and another to the right, demonstrating remarkable agility for a four-rotor helicopter smaller than a pizza box. \u201cWe love our drones,\u201d says 3D Robotics editorial director Sue Rosenstock, as she gazes at the black-and-blue craft overhead.\n\nThis is the Bay Area face of the drone revolution. Here, backyard enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are hoping to usher in a new era for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \u2014 couched much more in the starry-eyed optimism of Silicon Valley than in the grim realities of military weaponry and counterterrorism tactics.\n\nAdvocates want to see the technology used in industries ranging from agriculture and industrial engineering to movie making and journalism. Further, their goal is to make it accessible to just about anyone.\n\nDrones have been riding high in the news lately, with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos revealing on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he intends to deploy an armada of UAVs to ship products as soon as possible. There\u2019s significant money to be made, or so says the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. The group has projected the fledgling industry could produce upwards of $82 billion in economic activity in the decade after drones are allowed into the general airspace.\n\nFor now, though, as visions of an aerial assault of Amazon-branded drones dance in their heads, Americans are looking up to the sky with dual parts interest and trepidation \u2014 and wondering, what\u2019s next?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d remains unclear. The Federal Aviation Administration is mulling potential constraints on so-called unmanned aircraft systems and civil liberties advocates continue to speak out against drones for their capacity to invade privacy. Current laws are fairly restrictive: Hobbyists are allowed to fly devices weighing less than 55 pounds as long as the aircraft stay under 400 feet and avoid heavily populated areas. They also can\u2019t use the technology for commercial purposes.\n\nIn practice, the rules are considerably more fuzzy, with a final suite of regulations expected from the FAA sometime this year.\n\nThe regulations might include requiring some sort of license for UAV usage, a protocol which has yet to exist, and would likely involve a background check \u2014 a sticking point for often-iconoclastic drone enthusiasts. Another possibility would be to require UAV users to report flight activity to the FAA.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain that the government will permit drones to fly over populated areas, and the definition of \u201cpopulated area\u201d is being debated. Enthusiasts were heartened in late December when the FAA named six drone-testing teams, which will explore a \u201cbroad array\u201d of concerns and applications for UAVs. They hope at least one test site in the U.S. will be up and running in the next six months. (California was not named as a test site in a 24-state competition.)\n\n\u201cThere needs to be some type of regulation, but I also am an advocate for freedom, and people should self-regulate themselves and be responsible,\u201d said freelance UAV journalist Sally French. \u201cI sort of envision something like the ham radio license. To operate a ham radio, you need a license, but it\u2019s not terribly hard to get. You prove you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWhile regulations are in flux, drones have hit the Bay Area in growing numbers. Hobbyists regularly invade dog-walking areas and public parks to practice their skills (and occasionally lodge their devices in trees). Bay Area residents are most likely to see two types of drones \u2014 highly maneuverable, square \u201cmulticopters\u201d with multiple rotors that give them great agility, and gliding, fixed-wing aircraft that bear more resemblance to airplanes and are used for longer-distance missions.\n\nThe company most symbolic of the Bay Area drone ethos may be 3D Robotics, founded in 2009 by Chris Anderson, the former Wired magazine editor-in-chief, and Jordi Munoz, the chief technology officer. Anderson sponsors a popular do-it-yourself drone website, DIYDrones.com. His company caters to enthusiasts who prefer to build and maintain custom-made machines.\n\nBerkeley-based 3D Robotics produces the APM Universal Autopilot, which lets users control a range of vehicles in the air and on the ground with a single device. Recently it released a product known as the Iris, which sells for about $750 and is intended to allow the non-technical to purchase a drone without having to put it together themselves.\n\nThe Iris is not just another iteration of the popular and similarly priced Phantom, made by Hong Kong-based competitor DJI, according to 3D Robotics. Company leaders are promoting it as the first consumer-level drone intended to be fully autonomous. This means, if all goes as planned, even novices will be able to program a flying route using proprietary software, instead of having to pilot the device.\n\n\u201cThese autonomous craft will change the way we acquire data from the air \u2014 create a platform that hasn\u2019t existed before in any affordable way,\u201d said Pablo Lema, a director at 3D Robotics. Lema painted a picture of a strange but not necessarily unappealing future in which the family drone is loaded into the car for a vacation, right alongside the Golden Retriever.\n\nGRADUATE STUDENTS AND BATTLE DRONES\n\nMany drone enthusiasts are committed to what\u2019s known as the maker movement, prioritizing doing it yourself over buying out-of-the-box technology.\n\nAt Stanford University, members of a student UAV club meet on Thursdays to discuss their devices and on Saturdays to fly them out at the dry Lake Lagunita, where the only obstacle to their aircraft is the occasional errant, off-leash bird dog. Club founder and aeronautical engineering Ph.D. student Roberto Bunge concluded last year that UAVs were going to hit big, and he decided it was high time Stanford had a club.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the club is to enable student-driven, hands-on UAV projects, by providing a common space here at Stanford where students can come together and show their technical know-how, and get advice if they\u2019re just starting out,\u201d Bunge said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the hands-on nature of UAVs \u2014 we\u2019re not so much about talking, more about doing stuff.\u201d\n\nOther UAV enthusiasts are taking their hobby in a decidedly different direction, such as Marque Cornblatt and Eli DElia. Interested in flight and robotics, and regular attendees of maker-oriented tech get-togethers, the business partners quickly discovered an exciting application for drones: friendly combat for the masses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d show off what we were working on, but we would inevitably start fighting our projects against each other,\u201d Cornblatt said of these gatherings. \u201cAnd that really led us to try and develop drones that were very tough, could take the abuse and keep flying.\u201d DElia added: \u201cOnce we figured out how to crash it and make it not matter anymore, the fun has skyrocketed.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re seeking Kickstarter funding for their \u201cGame of Drones\u201d project. The goal is to develop exceptionally rugged flying machines, using military-grade material, that can be used for everything from recreational battling (including on paintball ranges) to usage in harsh conditions all over the world.\n\nA recent afternoon found the pair in a San Francisco park, shouting encouragement to their custom-made devices as they squared off in a scaled-down dogfight. A police car rolled by the park at a slow speed, took in the scene, and slowly rolled away. DElia scored a hit against Cornblatt\u2019s craft, and the black airframe plummeted to the ground, unharmed and ready to fly again \u2014 a vision that will likely interest UAV users scared of destroying their carefully nurtured devices with one wrong flick of the thumb.\n\nBETTER REPORTING WITH DRONES\n\nOther local drone enthusiasts are using the technology for journalism and photography, opening up interesting avenues in imaging. SkyPixel.org founder and Stanford graduate Eric Cheng had a long background in underwater photography before branching out to deploy drones in his work. His high-definition videos of surf breaks, San Francisco landmarks and other scenic wonders are some of the most popular in the genre online, while his website dispenses information on the world of quadcopters to aspiring pilots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking [drones] since 2006, and they were sort of open source and very difficult to put together,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cI always wanted to put cameras on them. I basically got little toys five years ago and flew them around the house, but I wasn\u2019t willing to put in the effort back then to try to build one because it seemed like a hobby that would take over. You\u2019d start and that would be it.\u201d\n\nCheng waited until the DJI Phantom hit the market and purchased one, modifying it to fit his needs. Now he owns multiple drones \u2014 which he modifies and customizes \u2014 and travels around the world with his devices.\n\nSally French, a Berkeley resident, graduated from the University of Missouri last year and was one of the students involved in the school\u2019s UAV journalism program, which ended after it received a cease-and-desist letter from the FAA.\n\n\u201cThe professor mentioned over lunch that he was starting a drone program, and at the time I didn\u2019t know what a drone was, two semesters ago,\u201d French said. \u201cI really had no idea, but it sparked my interest, so I asked if I could be a part of the class.\u201d\n\nDrones worked for French, who became fascinated with the technology and the potential for creative stories that it provided. Now she\u2019s freelancing full-time with UAVs, working with the San Francisco Chronicle and other major news outlets to collect one-of-a-kind footage from the air.\n\n\u201cI used a drone to cover \u2018Crissy Broadcast\u2019 at Crissy Field,\u201d said French, recalling an October performance art piece that featured performers moving in formation over a considerable area of ground.\n\n\u201cThat was another really cool purpose for the drone,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were able to see the formation of the musicians from the sky, whereas if you\u2019re on the ground watching, it\u2019s like: \u2018They\u2019re in cool shapes, but I can\u2019t tell.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nDRONE SCIENCE\n\nSome scientists are embracing consumer-level drones. San Francisco State student and archaeologist Peter Christian is working towards a master\u2019s of science in geographic information systems: He\u2019s hoping to use drones to carry out cheap surveying of natural and cultural resource, taking his machines where helicopters and satellites are too expensive or too impractical to use.\n\n\u201cThe question is, can you spend pennies to get data products you feel you can actually use and research?\u201d said Christian, who plans to make this research the backbone of his thesis project.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of economics for some cash-strapped scientists: renting a satellite costs about $10 for every 25 kilometers, according to Christian, while renting a helicopter can cost $300 to $500 an hour. Ground surveys, meanwhile, may be cheap and accurate, but don\u2019t present a good overall picture \u2014 and require a researcher to spend a whole lot of time tromping around the research area.\n\nEnter drones.\n\n\u201cThe other huge advantage is how frequently you can repeat the visit of the area with these drones,\u201d Christian said. \u201cIn terms of natural resources and water use perspectives, you want to get something directly after the storm or after a wildfire \u2014 or during a wildlife. This is stuff drones are absolutely perfect for.\u201d\n\nChristian emphasizes that he\u2019s not a big fan of controlling the device himself. \u201cIt stresses me out. I do most of my work using an autopilot. An autopilot is far better than me, and much more stable.\u201d\n\nChristian\u2019s fondness for using autopilot instead of his own reflexes puts him at the vanguard of the next wave of drone technology \u2014 autonomy, which will allow those who never were any good at video games to use these devices effectively.\n\nDrone advocates may be convinced that their chosen technology will prove transformative, but other Bay Area residents are considerably more worried about the potential implications. Just as drones can be used to conduct inexpensive surveillance of archaeological sites or national parks, so too could they be used to keep tabs on citizens. Oakland has attracted attention for its proposal to create the Domain Awareness Center, or DAC, a high-tech facility that would use surveillance \u2014 including police drones \u2014 to fight crime.\n\n\u201cDrones present too much potential for abuse, since they are small, relatively inexpensive, and have powerful surveillance capabilities such as high-definition video and infrared cameras, which can potentially surveil people even inside buildings,\u201d said Mary Madden of the Alameda County Against Drones coalition. She said her group is not particularly concerned by the usage of camera drones by private citizens.\n\n\u201cIf you have a smartphone, they know where you are and what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d said Christian, pointing to the recent NSA surveillance revelations. \u201cThe idea that drone use is a watershed event in terms of invasion of privacy is kind of ludicrous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "3D Robotics,Chris Anderson,DJI,DJI Phantom,drone,drones,Faine Greenwood,Federal Aviation Administration,Jeff Bezos,UAVs,unmanned aerial vehicles,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia,Politics & Gov,Science & Tech,Travel", "description": "In the Bay Area, backyard enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are hoping to usher in a new\u00a0era for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
