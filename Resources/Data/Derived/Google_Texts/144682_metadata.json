Michelle\u2019s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them,\" Obama said in prepared remarks at Northwestern University.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t a political speech, and I\u2019m not going to tell you who to vote for \u2014 even though I suppose it is kind of implied,\" Obama said, in a sentence that became an immediate head-scratcher as the president launched into a litany of attacks on the GOP. While it's true that many of Obama's proposed policies \u2014 such as raising the minimum wage \u2014 poll far better than the president himself, many of the Democrats running this year have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the man who has been languishing in the low-to-mid 40s in various national polls and worse in some of the battleground states that will determine control of the Senate.\n\nAfter claiming he wasn't making a political speech, Obama ripped Republicans for proposing more tax cuts, and said he wants to help the middle class instead \u2014 a theme that helped him 2012.\n\nHe dinged Republicans for blocking a minimum wage increase, pay equity, student loan refinancing and an unemployment extension.\n\n\"When push came to shove this year, and Republicans in Congress actually had to take a stand on policies that would help the middle class and working Americans ... the answer was 'no,'\" Obama said. \"One thing they did vote 'yes' on was another massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\"\n\nObama's speech, like many he's given of late, have been on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand affairs, peppered with caveats.\n\nThe economy has soared, the president bragged, on his watch. But many don't feel it, and the typical family's income hasn't budged since 1997, he said.\n\nObama touted the fact America has become the world leader in oil drilling \u2014 then pivoted to the need to cut carbon emissions.\n\nHe bragged about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 saying that slowing premium hikes since the law took effect were like \"an $1,800 tax cut\" \u2014 but said most people don't know it.\n\nRoll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama made the November elections about him during a speech Thursday, touting economic progress since he took office, laying out a list of Democratic favorites \u2014 from a minimum wage hike to an unemployment extension \u2014 and even trying to play offense on Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "President Barack Obama made the November elections about him during a speech Thursday, touting economic progress since he took office, laying out a list of Democratic favorites \u2014 from a minimum wage hike to an unemployment extension \u2014 and even trying to play offense on Obamacare.", "title": "Obama: My Policies Are on the Ballot", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/obama-ballot-unemployment-extension", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/16/2014/10/456536104-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-10-02T20:23:00Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "President Barack Obama made the November elections about him during a speech Thursday, touting economic progress since he took office, laying out a list of Democratic favorites \u2014 from a minimum wage hike to an unemployment extension \u2014 and even trying to play offense on Obamacare.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,CQToday Topic,uncategorized,unemployment-extension,exbr", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-10-02T20:23:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-02T20:23:00Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama made the November elections about him during a speech Thursday, touting economic progress since he took office, laying out a list of Democratic favorites \u2014 from a minimum wage", "title": "Obama: My Policies Are on the Ballot", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/obama-ballot-unemployment-extension", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/16/2014/10/456536104-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot.\nHe dinged Republicans for blocking a minimum wage increase, pay equity, student loan refinancing and an unemployment extension.\n\"One thing they did vote 'yes' on was another massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\"\nHe bragged about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 saying that slowing premium hikes since the law took effect were like \"an $1,800 tax cut\" \u2014 but said most people don't know it.\n\"I am not on the ballot this fall."}
