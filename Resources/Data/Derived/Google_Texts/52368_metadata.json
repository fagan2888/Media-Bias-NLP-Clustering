Kasich would not say who talked to him, but a Washington Post report last week said 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney is leading an effort to get a third-party candidate to run against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.Romney and others on the right believe Trump is not conservative enough and are pushing for a third-party alternative. Other Republicans warn that such a move would only divide the conservative vote and elect Democrat Hillary Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "john kasich, third party, run", "pubdate": "2016-05-16T17:29:32", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Ohio Gov.
