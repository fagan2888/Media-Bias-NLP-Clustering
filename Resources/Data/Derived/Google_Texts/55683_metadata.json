Once supposedly enlightened societies have decided that unborn children can be dismembered in the womb for any reason \u2014 in some particularly barbaric lands, this is permitted no matter how many months old the baby is \u2014 why should their bodies be treated with any respect whatsoever once they are removed from where they were gestating?\n\nOf course people who think it\u2019s wrong to kill innocent human beings via abortion are going to be sickened by this story. We\u2019re sickened by most things about abortion and how it makes people view human life as disposable.\n\nBut do prominent pro-choice politicians and leaders share our revulsion? Do they think it\u2019s in any way wrong to use unborn children for heating fuel? And, if so, could they explain why? I\u2019d be interested in their answer.\n\nCould a reporter please ask President Barack Obama, the country\u2019s most prominent defender of abortion rights, whether he thinks that Obamacare should ban the use of humans for fuel and, if so, why? Could a reporter ask Rep. Nancy Pelosi why it\u2019s totally OK to kill an unborn baby but not OK to use her body for fuel? How about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid? Perhaps the media\u2019s most beloved political candidate of the moment \u2014 I speak of Texas gubernatorial candidate and late-term abortion filibusterer Wendy Davis \u2014 can discuss whether Texas should save money by burning the victims of abortion for heating fuel.\n\nWhat about pro-choice leaders such as Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards? She loves to talk to the media every day. Have her weigh in.\n\nReporters and editors, you\u2019ve struggled to cover American serial murderer abortionist Kermit Gosnell. Even Gosnell didn\u2019t use his victims\u2019 bodies for fuel, though he did keep trophies of them around. You\u2019ve claimed you would do a better job of being on top of abortion news after your failures with the Gosnell coverage. And you never fail to ask pro-life politicians about whether babies should be killed if they\u2019re produced via rape \u2014 and get days of coverage out of whatever their answer.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that reporters and editors are tenacious with pro-life politicians compared to pro-choice politicians. It\u2019s also that even when there\u2019s a crazy serious hook, pro-choicers skate without questions, much less tough questions. Was any pro-choice politician grilled about Gosnell? None. Were any pro-choice activists grilled about fighting health standards for abortion clinics? No. When was the last time you saw a reporter ask a pro-choice politician why they think it should be legal to kill an unborn baby for the crime of being a little girl? (Abortion is the major means of gendercide in some countries.) Oh you have never heard that question? That\u2019s interesting.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 11:14:34 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Do pro-choice activists think it's in any way wrong to use unborn children for heating fuel?
