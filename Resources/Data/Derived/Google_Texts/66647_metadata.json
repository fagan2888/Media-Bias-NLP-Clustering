Chris Christie and former Port Authority appointee David Wildstein. The war of words has reignited the scandal, threatening to stymie Christie\u2019s efforts to recover from the episode and preserve his future political prospects.\n\nThe latest allegations surfaced Friday when the New York Times reported on a letter from Wildstein\u2019s lawyer that claimed \u201cevidence exists\u201d that Christie knew about the lane closures as they were happening.\n\nChristie\u2019s office initially responded with a statement that said the letter \u201cconfirms what the Governor has said all along \u2013 he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein\u2019s motivations were for closing them to begin with.\u201d\n\nBut his office followed up with a tougher missive on Saturday, sending an email to friends and allies blasting the Times\u2019 reporting and going after Wildstein personally. Politico\u2019s Mike Allen and Maggie Haberman detail the contents of the memo, including charges that Wildstein sued over a local school board election as a 16-year-old and had been accused by a high school social studies teacher of \u201cdeceptive behavior.\u201d\n\nThe combative nature of the message reflects Christie\u2019s style, but also signals the importance to the governor\u2019s political career that the claims he made during last month\u2019s two-hour news conference that he had no advance knowledge of the lane closures continue to hold up to scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say except to tell them that I had no knowledge of this \u2014 of the planning, the execution or anything about it \u2014 and that I first found out about it after it was over,\u201d Christie said at the Jan. 9 event in Trenton. \u201cAnd even then, what I was told was that it was a traffic study. And there was no evidence to the contrary until yesterday that was brought to my attention or anybody else\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times\u2019 Chris Megerian and Joseph Tanfani report that Christie could face more questions down the road about his handling of the Port Authority:\n\nProblems at the Port Authority run deeper than the ongoing scandal, critics say. They say that Christie, a potential Republican presidential contender who rose to prominence as a corruption-fighting U.S. attorney and pledged as governor to reel in arcane government commissions, has used the agency to reward his friends and allies. The troubled organization is the largest of its kind in the country, with a $7-billion budget, more than 7,000 employees, a dysfunctional management structure and a reputation as a secretive patronage haven.\n\nAs the bridge scandal drags on, there have been growing calls for Christie to step down as chair of the Republican Governors Association to focus on the challenges in his state.\n\nTwo top Republicans came to Christie\u2019s defense on Sunday, saying they believed Christie should continue to lead the organization.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he should step down, I think he should stay there,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said during an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he should step down because nothing has been proven, and you always give a person the benefit of the doubt in those kinds of situations, in my judgment.\u201d\n\nAnd, one year after being snubbed, Christie also scored an invitation to this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, another sign that conservatives are rallying to his side as he battles allegations over the bridge controversy.\n\nA note to our readers: Starting next week the Morning Line will be published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
