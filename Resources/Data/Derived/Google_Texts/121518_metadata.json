There\u2019s enough that we\u2019re still trying to figure out about their larger-than-life personalities, uncanny intelligence and ability to disappear in plain sight to fill an entire book \u2014 as Courage has done in \u201cOctopus!\u201c. The book follows Courage as she delves into the wide world of octopus research \u2014 and cuisine \u2014 to try and figure out what it is about the sea creature that so captures the imagination.\n\n\u201cEverybody asks, once you\u2019ve been working on a book for a while, \u2018Well aren\u2019t you tired of it?\u2019\u201d Courage told Salon. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like \u2018No, I could never actually be tired of talking about octopuses or learning about them.'\u201d\n\nCourage spoke to Salon about her boundless enthusiasm for the cephalopods and some of the many things humans can learn from them, along with some mysteries that seem as if they may never be solved. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHere\u2019s the question I\u2019m sure you get all the time: Why the octopus?\n\nMy obsession really started a few years ago. There was a study that came out that showed them using coconut shell halves as tools, and there was video, so I blogged about it for Scientific American. I was a reporter at the time, and ever since then I\u2019ve just been totally fascinated, because it\u2019s just amazing. They\u2019re these crazy invertebrates that are using tools somehow \u2014 they\u2019re not social, so how are they figuring this out individually? It\u2019s pretty remarkable.\n\nYou still blog about octopuses for Scientific American. What kind of responses do you get? Is there more interest than you would have thought?\n\nYes! I mean, I always kind of thought that they were really fascinating, and then once I started working on the book I was totally blown away \u2014 and still, even after having written a book I learn something new every day, and it\u2019s incredibly amazing. But anyway, people just come out of the woodwork to say they\u2019re so excited because they just love octopuses, it\u2019s their favorite animal, they\u2019ve loved them forever\u2026 it\u2019s just really cool that everybody seems to have a secret fascination with or obsession with octopuses.\n\nThey seem so removed from us, and yet kind of easy to anthropomorphize\u2026\n\nI think that\u2019s one of the big scientific lessons that we have to learn from them: that there\u2019s this big intelligence there. They interact with us and look at us and kind of examine us \u2014 one researcher actually likened it to a dog. Your dog will look at you and engage with you in a way that most animals don\u2019t, and octopuses will do the same, which is just really weird because we\u2019re used to dogs that live and work with us, but octopuses are not social and they\u2019ve been living in the ocean for hundreds of millions of years. So the question of why they can engage with us that way is really interesting.\n\nDo people keep them as pets, or is it mostly just researchers who have discovered this kind of thing?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. Some people do keep them as pets. They\u2019re not great pets, unfortunately, because they\u2019re pretty sensitive to water conditions, and also because they don\u2019t live very long. It\u2019s the tragedy of the octopus, because they\u2019re so smart and people do bond with them \u2014 even keepers and researchers. But most of the laboratory octopuses will only live for maybe a year or so.\n\nThat\u2019s what everybody told me when I started researching the book, actually: \u201dOh, you have to get a pet octopus!\u201d I looked into it briefly and it just probably is not a good idea.\n\nWhen you say they\u2019re smart, is that just for invertebrates? Or is there a case to be made for them being one of the more intelligent animals?\n\nI would say definitely the latter. I think they are one of the more intelligent animals on the planet, at least that we know about. Of course, they probably are the smartest invertebrates, at least by our definition. Researchers who study their intelligence will place them in with the birds \u2014 some birds can use tools and some aren\u2019t as quick. Octopuses really hold their own against vertebrates.\n\nBut they\u2019re not actually psychic, right?\n\nAs far as we know, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been testing them on that. They can do mazes and open bottles.\n\nI guess it\u2019s just another one of those mysteries.\n\nThey\u2019re mysterious animals. Perhaps we\u2019ll never know.\n\nThere\u2019s some dissonance in the book between all these anecdotes about how smart they are, interspersed with descriptions of how delicious they are.\n\nYep!\n\nDid you have any trouble reconciling that?\n\nI have to say, I strategized. I tried to front-load my research with the culinary aspect, and then do the more in-depth biology and intelligence stuff later so I wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty after learning it. I have to say, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve eaten any octopus.\n\nAt the end of interviews, I would ask researchers who studied them, kind of cautiously, if they ever eat them. And, actually, most would say, \u201cYes, here\u2019s my favorite recipe.\u201d But that\u2019s not all the researchers. A lot of them won\u2019t even touch cephalopods, won\u2019t have any calamari or anything.\n\nIt can make you wonder where their greatest value lies \u2014 as cuisine, or as something to be studied?\n\nRight, exactly. And it\u2019s interesting, when I was in Greece, looking at the cultural and culinary sides of things, and I would explain to people, \u201cOh, I\u2019m writing a book about octopuses.\u201d And it seemed so boring to them because they have octopuses hanging out all over the street drying. They\u2019re like \u201cWhy would you want to write about that? It\u2019s just food!\u201d Even in New York, it\u2019s still kind of an exotic dish, or people are intrigued by it, while here people have been catching and eating them their whole life and it\u2019s kind of an essential, fundamental element of their cuisine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Writer Katherine Harmon Courage on her cephalopod fixation VIDEO", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Writer Katherine Harmon Courage on her cephalopod fixation VIDEO", "title": "Octopuses: Big, wet, strong puppies with tools", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/03/octopuses_big_wet_strong_puppies_with_tools/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/octopus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Writer Katherine Harmon Courage on her cephalopod fixation VIDEO", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/octopus.jpg", "title": "Octopuses: Big, wet, strong puppies with tools", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Octopuses: Big, wet, strong puppies with tools", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Author Interviews, marine biology, Octopus, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf525\"", "article_summary": "Octopuses really hold their own against vertebrates.\nThey\u2019re these crazy invertebrates that are using tools somehow \u2014 they\u2019re not social, so how are they figuring this out individually?\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like \u2018No, I could never actually be tired of talking about octopuses or learning about them.\nWhen you say they\u2019re smart, is that just for invertebrates?\nIt\u2019s the tragedy of the octopus, because they\u2019re so smart and people do bond with them \u2014 even keepers and researchers."}
