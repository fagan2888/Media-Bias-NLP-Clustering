Then \u201cThe Donald\u201d came with his plans for America and this thought came to my mind:\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, a Japanese admiral made this comment \u201cI am afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant.\u201d They did!\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies have awakened a lot of folks who have not been in tune with the presidential speeches, a lot of the unconcerned people across the land. What he says is what all of us need to be concerned about: \u201cour future and our country\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nWe have heard promises from candidates over the years about what they will do when they are elected, after elected they turn around and do the opposite. So, we \u201cout here\u201d are leery about their promises but we need to be paying attention and check out their qualifications, do background checks, asking God, who knows all about them, to help us decide.\n\n\u2014 Ethel Cook, Pensacola\n\nSteve Irwin\n\nSteve Irwin died on Sept. 4, 2006. Many knew him as the \u201cCrocodile Hunter,\u201d but he was more than that. He was a conservationist, educator and father. Armed with experience in the bush and his infectious enthusiasm, he brought the world of nature to tens of millions of viewers.\n\nSteve convinced people around the world to save the endangered crocodile. Through his efforts and many others, crocodiles not only were saved, but their image was clarified from that of a man-eating killer to that of a beautiful creature, just trying to enjoy life, like us.\n\nSteve\u2019s message extends over all creatures. He came to Florida and helped the Army Rangers at Eglin Air Force Base by relocating venomous snakes the rangers encountered. This episode was \u201cWildlife in Combat,\u201d if you want to check it out.\n\nThere are those who think he was reckless, but take note: He was never bitten by a venomous snake. That speaks for itself. Even his death wasn\u2019t reckless; the freak stingray accident was only the 17th recorded stingray fatality in the last century.\n\nIf anything, he was a great conservationist and an even greater father. On the ninth anniversary of his death, remember Steve Irwin.\n\n\u2013 Truman Sharp, Pensacola\n\nSailor\u2019s Creed\n\nThank you for printing my letter in the 15 August PNJ.\n\nRegarding the capitalizing of the word \u201cSailor\u201d I offer the following:\n\n... Then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Boorda rewrote the Sailor\u2019s Creed in 1994, just a year after it had been introduced. His changes, such as substituting the word \u201cNavy\u201d for \u201cBluejacket,\u201d were designed to create a creed that applied to all and fostered a sense of unity. A year later, Navy Secretary John Dalton declared \u201cSailor\u201d to be a proper noun, ordering that it be capitalized in all Navy correspondence.\n\nI think I read it in the News Journal.\n\n\u2014 RMC Billy-Ace Baker, USN (Ret.), Pensacola\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1EKz6nf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "As I have been watching and listening to the candidates running for president, I have heard a lot of promises, what they will do if they win.", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "As I have been watching and listening to the candidates running for president, I have heard a lot of promises, what they will do if they win.", "title": "Letters to the editor: I\u2019ve heard a lot of promises", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/2015/09/06/letters-editor-heard-lot-promises/71813436/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As I have been watching and listening to the candidates running for president, I have heard a lot of promises, what they will do if they win.", "title": "Letters to the editor: I\u2019ve heard a lot of promises", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87dcd12d5505e7e355c0a262522e61568f218503/c=338-0-2024-1686&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/06/Pensacola/Pensacola/635771447034372074-Letter-to-Editor-2.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd011b\"", "article_summary": "Trump\u2019s rallies have awakened a lot of folks who have not been in tune with the presidential speeches, a lot of the unconcerned people across the land.\nPNJ letters to the editor (Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP)Lots of promisesAs I have been watching and listening to the candidates running for president, I have heard a lot of promises, what they will do if they win.\nHis changes, such as substituting the word \u201cNavy\u201d for \u201cBluejacket,\u201d were designed to create a creed that applied to all and fostered a sense of unity.\nRegarding the capitalizing of the word \u201cSailor\u201d I offer the following:...
