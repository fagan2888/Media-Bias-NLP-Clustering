A member of Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant\u2019s staff was among the attendees.\n\nWashington CAN! communications director Rosalind Brazel said the Providence-Swedish Health Alliance is coming off one of its most profitable years, yet charity care given to low-income patients declined by 39 percent at the Cherry Hill campus (1600 E. Jefferson St.).\n\nBrazel called Swedish the \u201cmost stubborn\u201d negotiators of all the medical health debt systems the grassroots lobbying organization has taken on.\n\n\u201cSwedish has been the slowest to respond,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just do not want to make changes or acknowledge that there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nSwedish spokesperson Mary Beth Lowell confirmed that the hospital\u2019s charity care spending went down year-over-year, but she said that\u2019s actually a positive because it was a result of the Affordable Care Act and an indication that many previously uninsured individuals now have access to health care through Medicaid expansion and the insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cIn the future, this coverage means people can [get] better access to preventive care and address medical conditions before they are serious enough to need treatment in an emergency department,\u201d she said.\n\nLowell added that Swedish\u2019s commitment to charity care has impacted thousands of lives, with more than 9,300 community members granted financial assistance from Swedish in 2014. For more than half of those patients, free care was covered at 100 percent, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have historically provided more community benefit than any other non-taxpayer-supported hospital in Seattle,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last three years, Swedish has spent almost a half of billion dollars in community benefit. Our community benefit includes community education programs, research, charity care and uncompensated care.\u201d\n\nProtestors on July 23 wound a string of envelopes \u2014 meant to signify medical bills \u2014 to represent the estimated 23,000-plus patients with medical debt who could have been aided by Swedish.\n\nWashington CAN!\u2019s demands include Swedish creating a charity care policy that will provide \u201cmore benefit to their community,\u201d which includes simplifying the application process and altering their \u201creally short\u201d application deadline by extending it or getting rid of it altogether.\n\nBrazel said no more pickets are currently planned, but that \u201cI believe there will be more.\u201d\n\nTo comment on this story, write to editor@capitolhilltimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "By Eric MandelApproximately 50 community members picketed the decline in charity care and medical debt forgiveness outside of Swedish Medical Center (747 Broadway) on Thursday, July 23.\nBrazel called Swedish the \u201cmost stubborn\u201d negotiators of all the medical health debt systems the grassroots lobbying organization has taken on.\n\u201cOver the last three years, Swedish has spent almost a half of billion dollars in community benefit.\n\u201cWe have historically provided more community benefit than any other non-taxpayer-supported hospital in Seattle,\u201d she said.\nLowell added that Swedish\u2019s commitment to charity care has impacted thousands of lives, with more than 9,300 community members granted financial assistance from Swedish in 2014."}
