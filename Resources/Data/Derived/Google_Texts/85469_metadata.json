Originally, the military hoped to have eight jets ready for use on its two new aircraft carriers by that time; now it wants 24 of the fifth-generation aircraft ready to go.\n\n\"We are going to step up the aircraft carrier punch of the United Kingdom. We are going to make sure that when these aircraft carriers are available, they are going to have planes that can fly from them in force,\" Chancellor George Osborne told The Sunday Times.\n\nRelated: Yet Another Costly F-35 Glitch That Won\u2019t Be Fixed Any Time Soon\n\nThat\u2019s quite a different story from Canada, where the newly-installed government has signaled it will continue to participate in the development of the plane, but also might look for a cheaper aircraft to replace the country\u2019s CF-18 Hornet fleet. Ottawa had planned to spend $9 billion for 65 F-35s.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the immediate impact of London\u2019s decision will be on the F-35 program, but in all likelihood it could drive down the unit cost for the eight partner countries that are working to develop the jet.\n\nAlong with the U.K. and Canada, the U.S., Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Denmark and Norway are working together to develop the JSF.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why 'President Trump' Might Dump the F-35\n\nEven though it has been plagued with technical and cost overruns since it launched in 2001 \u2013 causing the program\u2019s price tag to balloon to $400 billion and making it the most expensive weapons efforts in U.S. history \u2013 the Pentagon remains committed to its goal of buying 2,440 F-35s over the coming years.\n\nThe lifetime program cost for the plane is expected to exceed $1 trillion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "At a time when Canada is wishy-washy about its commitment to the pricey F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the United Kingdom this week released a national security roadmap that goes all in on the multibillion weapons effort.", "title": "Why the UK Is Going All In with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/Why-UK-Going-All-F-35-Joint-Strike-Fighter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/Why-UK-Going-All-F-35-Joint-Strike-Fighter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "At a time when Canada is wishy-washy about its commitment to the pricey F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the United Kingdom this week released a national security roadmap that goes all in on the multibillion weapons effort.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At a time when Canada is questioning its commitment to the staggeringly expensive F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the United Kingdom this week released a national security roadmap that goes all in on the multibillion weapons program.\nAlong with the U.K. and Canada, the U.S., Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Denmark and Norway are working together to develop the JSF.\nThe U.K. is also tripling of the pace of F-35 deliveries up to 2023.\n\"We are going to step up the aircraft carrier punch of the United Kingdom.\nWe are going to make sure that when these aircraft carriers are available, they are going to have planes that can fly from them in force,\" Chancellor George Osborne told The Sunday Times."}
