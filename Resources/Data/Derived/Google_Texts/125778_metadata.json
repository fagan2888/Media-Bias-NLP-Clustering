With Republicans controlling Congress this year, each chamber has voted to halt the $450 million in annual federal payments to Planned Parenthood, the party\u2019s reaction to the group\u2019s role providing fetal tissue for research.\n\nDemocrats mock the repeated votes as time-wasting political posturing. But Republicans say there\u2019s value in forcing Obama to veto legislation crippling the health law and stopping Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal dollars.\n\nWith the 2016 elections approaching, they say a veto would underscore that electing a Republican president and keeping GOP control of Congress would put both goals within reach.\n\nAggressively confronting Obama could also shield incumbent Republicans against the complaints of anti-establishment conservative voters who grumble that GOP lawmakers have been too submissive to the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking this a step further, pushing the ball down the field further than we\u2019ve been able to do in the past,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., a member of Senate GOP leadership.\n\nTHE PRICE OF AVOIDING A FILIBUSTER\n\nRepublicans have swathed the bill in a procedure that allows passage by a simple Senate majority, not the 60 votes ordinarily required to end Democratic stalling tactics.\n\nWith 54 GOP senators, that puts approval within reach. The House passed its version in October.\n\nBut there\u2019s a cost.\n\nUsing this procedure means the bill must reduce the budget deficit. Republicans can\u2019t annul the entire health law in one single-sentence stroke because the Congressional Budget Office, lawmakers\u2019 official nonpartisan referee, says repeal would increase deficits by $350 billion over a decade.\n\nAs a result, the House-passed legislation would repeal certain provisions of the health law to undermine it, including its fines against individuals who lack coverage and employers who don\u2019t offer it to workers.\n\nOther parts of the law remain intact, including some for which repeal would anger voters and jeopardize GOP incumbents\u2019 re-election prospects in competitive states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. That includes the statute\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and its federal subsidies for lower-earning people buying health coverage.\n\nThis leaves Senate Republican leaders with a challenge.\n\nGETTING TO 51\n\nSenate leaders haven\u2019t finished crafting their legislation and will tailor it to attract votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it will include the health law repeal and a halt to Planned Parenthood\u2019s money.\n\nBut some GOP senators reluctant to bar Planned Parenthood\u2019s funds might vote \u201cno.\u201d Moderate Sen. Susan Collins of Maine says she\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about that language, and Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski \u2014 all facing re-election next year \u2014 might find the decision difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, three conservative Republicans said last month that the House measure \u201csimply isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Presidential hopefuls Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as Utah\u2019s Mike Lee, said they\u2019d oppose the bill unless it \u201cfully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules.\u201d\n\nWhile that lawyerly language leaves some wiggle room, it\u2019s clear GOP leaders face a delicate task securing 51 votes.\n\nABORTION FOES WEIGH IN\n\nPowerful anti-abortion groups have begun openly pushing those conservative senators to back the legislation.\n\nIn a recent letter, National Right to Life warned senators they\u2019d include votes on the bill in their annual rating of lawmakers, which influences many conservative voters.\n\n\u201cThe pro-life vote is to pass the bill for the sake of defunding Planned Parenthood \u2014 no excuses,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn an interview, Right to Life chief lobbyist Douglas Johnson said Rubio, Cruz and Lee all have lifetime ratings of 100 percent from the group. In what seemed an unspoken reference to the Cruz-Rubio rivalry for the GOP nomination, Johnson said a lawmaker opposing the bill would lose that perfect score \u201cand would thereby be distinguished from other senators\u201d who score 100 percent.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, wrote that Rubio\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s votes would be \u201ca test of their leadership\u201d showing how as president either would \u201cimmediately take a sledge hammer\u201d to the health law and Planned Parenthood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional Republicans hope a post-Thanksgiving drive to obliterate President Barack Obama's health care law and block Planned Parenthood's federal funds will spotlight their fierce support for top-tier conservative causes, despite the certain veto awaiting should the bill reach the White House.", "pubdate": 20151124, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Congressional Republicans hope a post-Thanksgiving drive to obliterate President Barack Obama's health care law and block Planned Parenthood's federal funds will spotlight their fierce support for top-tier conservative causes, despite the certain veto awaiting should the bill reach the White House.", "title": "Republicans in Senate set to push against health law, Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RTR4HN3L.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/republicans-in-senate-set-to-push-against-health-law-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Congressional Republicans hope a post-Thanksgiving drive to obliterate President Barack Obama's health care law and block Planned Parenthood's federal funds will spotlight their fierce support for top-tier conservative causes, despite the certain veto awaiting should the bill reach the White House.", "title": "Republicans in Senate set to push against health law, Planned Parenthood", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RTR4HN3L.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "planned parenthood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "ACA, Barack Obama, congress, healthcare, obamacare, planned parenthood"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b31\"", "article_summary": "But Republicans say there\u2019s value in forcing Obama to veto legislation crippling the health law and stopping Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal dollars.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it will include the health law repeal and a halt to Planned Parenthood\u2019s money.\nOn the other hand, three conservative Republicans said last month that the House measure \u201csimply isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Presidential hopefuls Sens.\nABORTION FOES WEIGH INPowerful anti-abortion groups have begun openly pushing those conservative senators to back the legislation.\nRepublicans can\u2019t annul the entire health law in one single-sentence stroke because the Congressional Budget Office, lawmakers\u2019 official nonpartisan referee, says repeal would increase deficits by $350 billion over a decade."}
