Many proposals relate to laws passed under Obama, as critics insist the new rules mean billions in excessive costs.\n\nThe Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan for Fall 2015 sets the stage for what is expected to be a persistent effort by the Obama administration to implement key initiatives and regulatory rules ahead of President Barack Obama's exit from the White House in January 2017. In addition, the regulatory dash may be heightened given Obama's opposition in the Republican-led Congress.\n\nCritics of new regulations attached to Obama-led policies \u2013 such as the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, and the President's Climate Action Plan \u2013 say the new regulatory proposals are part of the Obama administration's latest, greatest attempt to burden the American taxpayer.\n\nFood fight: FDA targets illnesses that sicken 48 million Americans a year https://t.co/II6EYAsLBgpic.twitter.com/uW92SVsYKL \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) November 14, 2015\n\nThe Agenda and Plan, as released by the White House Office of Management and Budget, \"are preliminary statements of regulatory and deregulatory policies and priorities under consideration,\" which include \"'active rulemakings' that agencies could possibly conclude over the next year.\"\n\n\"The Plan provides a list of important regulatory actions that agencies are considering for issuance in proposed or final form during the 2016 fiscal year,\" wrote the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in its public announcement of the Obama administration's upcoming and ongoing regulatory priorities.\n\n\"In contrast, the Agenda is a more inclusive list, including numerous ministerial actions and routine rulemakings, as well as long-term initiatives that agencies do not plan to complete in the coming year but on which they are actively working.\"\n\nRead more\n\nThe regulatory costs associated with the newly released regulatory plan will boost this year's amount of compliance costs to $92.1 billion, according to the center-right think tank American Action Forum.\n\n\"(Obama) has used the rulemaking authority to implement his policy agenda, presidents do that, but he has done it to a greater degree than anyone else,\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told The Hill.\n\nSupporters of the regulatory process charge that Congress is to blame for any last-minute push, as federal agencies have to \"comply with a rule development process that is a labyrinth of complex and redundant legal and analytical requirements,\" wrote Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen. \"Congress has only added to these requirements over the years without ever removing any of them or streamlining the process.\"\n\nObama administration regulations related to the Affordable Care Act, immigration policy, and the plan to combat climate change have been challenged in court. Others, such as net neutrality rules established by the Federal Communications Commission, will likely be the focus of legal wrangling as well.\n\n\u201cI hope the administration is aware they are running out of time,\u201d Peg Seminario, safety and health director for the AFL-CIO labor union told The Hill. \u201cIf they want to get these final rules in place and in effect before the end of the administration and protected from political interference from Congress, they need to move forward.\u201d\n\nRules within in the new regulatory plan include a \"pay versus performance\" provision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission that would require companies to compare top executive pay to the company's overall performance.
