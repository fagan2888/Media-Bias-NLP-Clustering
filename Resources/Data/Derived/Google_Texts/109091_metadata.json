The new movie, \u201cTrumbo,\u201d which turns screenwriter Dalton Trumbo into an avuncular idealist, illuminates the point. Starring Bryan Cranston of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d fame, the film portrays this deeply committed Red totalitarian as one of the wisest, kindest and most principled American patriots.\n\nDetermined to eliminate the blacklist barring Communists from the movie industry, the film has Dalton successfully ending this allegedly odious practice of the Hollywood producers, defeating the anti-Communist \u201cwitch-hunters\u201d and striking a major blow on behalf of the First Amendment, which, we are led to believe, anchors Trumbo\u2019s entire belief system.\n\nIt\u2019s all nonsense, but I haven\u2019t yet met a liberal who didn\u2019t love the movie. And the Screen Actors Guild has just nominated Mr. Cranston and Helen Mirren for Oscars. (Miss Mirren plays gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.) Life is always good, so far as Hollywood\u2019s Stalinists are concerned.\n\nTinseltown, as you might expect from Communist sympathizers, has given Trumbo, as well as his subversive Hollywood friends, a serious facelift. He was never the saintly Socialist depicted, but a committed Soviet fifth columnist who covertly labored with his fellow comrades to bring about a Stalinist America (by force and violence, if necessary) \u2014 and almost did. By 1944, Hollywood\u2019s guilds and unions were swarming with Communists and screenwriter Reds were writing pictures hailing the many wonders of Joe Stalin himself.\n\nHere is what we absolutely know about Trumbo that is carefully air brushed from the movie. When he and nine other Hollywood directors and screenwriters appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee in those famous 1947 hearings, they refused to say whether they belonged to the Communist party on the grounds that this was a violation of their First Amendment rights. Known to history as \u201cThe Hollywood Ten,\u201d they went to jail for contempt of Congress and were blacklisted for failing to answer the $64,000 question.\n\nBut we know the answer and knew it back in 1947 when even liberal elites knew that Stalin was America\u2019s deadly enemy and that the Communist party was his effective catspaw. HUAC overloaded the hearings with materials proving that each and every one of the Ten was a party member, loyal to the murderous Stalin, disloyal to his own country and determined to present Hollywood as a gift to Moscow. None of this, of course, is even alluded to in the movie.\n\nTrumbo later admitted to his favorable biographer, Bruce Cook, that he joined the Communist Party in 1943 and that \u201cI might as well have been a Communist ten years earlier.\u201d After prison and a sojourn to Mexico, his papers at the Madison Historical Society inform us that he \u201creaffiliated with the party in 1954,\u201d obviously having enjoyed the tour so much the first time around.\n\nTrumbo\u2019s supposed lifelong battle for \u201cfree speech\u201d and the Constitution, as the film would have it, led Dalton to support a curious crew of world statesmen, not well known for their belief in liberty: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and North Korea\u2019s Kim Il-sung, a fourfecta of the planet\u2019s bloodiest rulers in the 20th century.\n\nTrumbo supported Stalin when he was liquidating his own people by the millions through the purges, the collective farm program and the gulags. When Stalin made his pact with Hitler in August 1939, Trumbo, on cue, jumped on the Nazi bandwagon, remaining in the pro-Hitler, virulently anti-Semitic camp for 22 months. He eagerly demonized Hitler\u2019s enemies, taking venemous aim at England and accusing FDR of \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cblack treason\u201d for supplying the British with weapons of war in their hour of peril. (Fair is fair, however: Trumbo became disillusioned with the fuehrer when he betrayed his Moscow partner and invaded Russia in 1941.)\n\nFor most of his adult life he stood with the Caligula in the Kremlin. He backed Stalin\u2019s cruel domestic and aggressive foreign policies during the 1930s and \u201840s, he was with him when he seized Eastern Europe and portions of Central Europe in the post-war period, and he was at his side when he threatened a military sweep of Western Europe in the 1940s and \u201850s. He never publicly deviated from the Soviet position. Not once.\n\nWhen North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, Trumbo jubilantly rallied to Kim Il-sung\u2019s totalitarian Red regime, a virtual Soviet puppet state. \u201cThis is not by me,\u201d Trumbo lightheartedly scribbled onto the cover of a 145-page screen treatment found in his papers. Then he boyishly confesses: \u201cAh, yes it is! For $2000 I dramatized a local child-custody case for a group composed of Paul Jarrico, Adrian Scott, Herbert Biberman, et al.\u201d (Scott and Biberman were two of the Hollywood Ten. Jarrico would lead the Hollywood section of the Communist Party in the 1950s.)\n\nTrumbo\u2019s script was titled An American Story and the heroine, Catherine Bonham, insists North Korea\u2019s invasion of South Korea in 1950 is completely justifiable for this is \u201cKorea\u2019s fight for independence, just as we had to fight for our own independence in 1776.\u201d Bonham, the voice of Trumbo, even roots for violent revolutions creating additional North Korean style governments to help brighten up the planet. And this, as the cliche goes, is the tip of the iceberg.\n\nFor decades, Hollywood\u2019s elites have been lionizing those screenwriters who diligently served the Evil Emperor in Moscow and were proud to do so. They are doing it again, with gusto.\n\n\u2022 Allan H.
