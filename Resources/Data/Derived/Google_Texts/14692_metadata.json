But with the Hawks leading only 82-79 in the final period, the point guard delivered a decisive scoring spree.\n\nTeague had three straight baskets, including two three-point plays. The second basket and free throw pushed the lead to 90-81.\n\n\u201cI tried to do something to help the team while I was out there on the floor,\u201d Teague said. \u201cIt was just me attacking.\u201d\n\nThe run came with Atlanta\u2019s backup point guard, Dennis Schroder, on the bench with five fouls.\n\nJohn Henson answered Teague\u2019s run with a three-point play before Thabo Sefolosha countered with Atlanta\u2019s only 3-pointer of the second half.\n\nPaul Millsap had 14 points and 13 rebounds and Al Horford also had 14 points to keep the Hawks\u2019 late-season surge going. They have won seven of eight and 10 of 12 to move to third place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Hawks (43-30) are a season-high 13 games over .500 and got there despite making only 5 of 32 3-pointers.\n\nJabari Parker led Milwaukee with 19 points. Henson had 17 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Bucks had only 16 assists with 15 turnovers.\n\n\u201cGuys are trying to do it themselves and sometimes that happens,\u201d Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cMoving the ball, trusting one another. Tonight we just didn\u2019t trust one another.\u201d\n\nAtlanta dodged Milwaukee\u2019s attempt for a sweep of the season series. The Bucks won the first two games against the Hawks in overtime, including a double-overtime win in Atlanta on Feb. 20.\n\nAtlanta led 51-46 at halftime. The Bucks cut the Hawks\u2019 lead to one point before Atlanta used a 10-2 run for a 75-66 lead.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeff Teague's Atlanta teammates raved about his pivotal scoring in the final quarter.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jeff Teague\u2019s Atlanta teammates raved about his pivotal scoring in the final quarter.", "title": "Teague gets 18 points, powers Hawks past Bucks 101-90", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/25/teague-gets-18-points-powers-hawks-past-bucks-101-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/20/bucks_hawks_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/20/bucks_hawks_basketball.jpeg", "description": "Jeff Teague's Atlanta teammates raved about his pivotal scoring in the final quarter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Teague gets 18 points, powers Hawks past Bucks 101-90"}, "Author": "CHARLES ODUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ATLANTA (AP) - Jeff Teague\u2019s Atlanta teammates raved about his pivotal scoring in the final quarter.\nTeague scored 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and the Hawks overcame poor 3-point shooting to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 101-90 on Friday night.\nThe Bucks won the first two games against the Hawks in overtime, including a double-overtime win in Atlanta on Feb. 20.\nThe Bucks cut the Hawks\u2019 lead to one point before Atlanta used a 10-2 run for a 75-66 lead.\nJohn Henson answered Teague\u2019s run with a three-point play before Thabo Sefolosha countered with Atlanta\u2019s only 3-pointer of the second half."}
