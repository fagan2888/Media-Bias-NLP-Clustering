Ron Barber of Arizona with an ad that claims the Affordable Care Act \u201cmeans higher costs for struggling families.\u201d It may mean higher costs for some, but hundreds of thousands of state residents are expected to qualify for Medicaid because of the law, and others will qualify for federal subsidies to buy coverage.\n\nBarber, who was an aide to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and won a special election for her seat, is seeking reelection this year. The ad, from the David Koch-founded Americans for Prosperity, starts off by highlighting President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d by calling it the \u201clie of the year.\u201d Obama\u2019s claim also made our list of \u201cWhoppers of 2013,\u201d as well as whoppers lists in past years. But then the ad offers a slanted view of the impact of the law, ultimately tying the claims to Barber.\n\nIt shows the news headline, \u201cArizona Man: Obamacare Will Double My Premiums,\u201d while an announcer says, \u201cObamacare means higher costs for struggling families.\u201d As we\u2019ve said many times, the health care law will affect Americans differently. Some who buy their own insurance will pay more and some will pay less, depending on individual circumstances, such as their health status, age and income level. Some families \u2014 whether they\u2019re \u201cstruggling\u201d or not \u2014 may face higher costs. But the ad\u2019s blanket statement is contradicted by the fact that the law expands Medicaid eligibility, offers federal subsidies to low- and mid-income Arizonans who buy their own insurance, and reduces the number of uninsured.\n\nArizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican who opposed the Affordable Care Act, nevertheless chose to expand Medicaid per the law, because of the direct impact such an expansion would have on the state. Brewer\u2019s office estimated that an additional 240,000 Arizonans would have Medicaid health insurance through the expansion, and the state would be able to continue to provide Medicaid to 50,000 adults without children in their homes. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 448,000 Arizonans would join Medicaid because of the law by 2022, with 238,000 newly eligible under the law (similar to the state\u2019s estimate) and another 210,000 who would have been eligible in the past signing up, at least partly due to the law\u2019s requirement to have insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nIn signing the law that expanded the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Brewer said that \u201cit will extend cost-effective care to Arizona\u2019s working poor, using the very tax dollars our citizens already pay to the federal government,\u201d and she thanked the Arizona Legislature \u201cfor joining me in putting the people of Arizona first.\u201d She told personal stories of a breast cancer survivor helped by Medicaid and a man without insurance facing large medical bills:\n\nBrewer, June 13, 2013: I remember Laura Gargiulo, a single mother who was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. She credited Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program, known as AHCCCS, with saving her life. Or Justin Smith. Like so many others, he lost his job \u2013 and his health insurance along with it \u2013 during the Great Recession. Then he got sick. Emergency medical care saved his life, but he is now strapped with $200,000 in hospital bills. Hundreds of thousands of uninsured Arizonans walk the same tightrope every day, knowing they are a single car wreck, illness or accident from financial ruin. Through this process, I have been humbled by the support of Arizonans like Laura and Justin. They are my strength.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. That was $15,856 for a single person and $32,499 for a family of four for 2013. State eligibility levels vary, but in Arizona, the ACA expansion increases coverage for parents, children ages 6 to 19, adults with no children in the home, and the aged, blind and disabled. Those groups had qualified for Medicaid if their household incomes were less than 100 percent of the poverty level before the ACA, though during the recent recession, the state had frozen eligibility for adults without children.\n\nThe health care law also provides federal subsidies to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level, meaning single adults making $11,490 to $45,960 and a family of four with a household income between $23,550 and $94,200 in 2013. Of course, some people could still pay more for insurance than they did before, particularly if their incomes are at the high end of those ranges and they had inexpensive coverage in the past. But others will pay less, and some will gain insurance, leaving the ranks of the uninsured.\n\nFrom October 1 through Dec. 28, nearly 28,000 Arizonans selected insurance plans on the federal marketplace, with 68 percent of the plans purchased with subsidies, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. Early Medicaid numbers show that 102,548 Arizonans were determined eligible for Medicaid in October and November, though the numbers aren\u2019t broken down by those eligible because of the expansion.\n\nAs for a headline in the ad \u2014 \u201cArizona Man: Obamacare Will Double My Premiums\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s from a Phoenix television news story about a man whose insurance carrier pulled out of the individual market in all states, citing \u201cincreased regulation\u201d under the ACA. The man told the TV station, KTVK, that he had paid $268 per month for his insurance, but when he checked the rates on the federal exchange, the premium for a comparable plan would be $563. The news story doesn\u2019t say whether he purchased that plan, or if he qualified for subsidies or would pursue insurance through other means. We were not able to contact the man.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that he, and others, will pay more for their insurance. As we\u2019ve explained, the law changes the individual insurance market, barring insurers from rejecting applicants with preexisting conditions, or charging them more. Insurers can\u2019t vary price based on gender, either, but can vary premiums based on age (to a limited degree), geography, family size and tobacco use. The law also requires policies to cover certain essential benefits, including vaccines, mental health care, prescription drugs and maternity care. These changes are good news for some \u2014 particularly those who paid higher rates or were denied due to health conditions \u2014 and bad news for others \u2014 particularly healthy folks who were happy with more limited insurance coverage.\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes for both supporters and opponents of the law. For instance, a self-employed Arizona man with leukemia had his individual insurance plan canceled when his insurer exited the market, but in the end, he was able to find a cheaper policy that included his doctor in its network. Conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, had highlighted his case, after the man told an Arizona TV station that he would have to pay $26,000 to keep his doctor. We spoke with him a month later, by which time he had found a plan with lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs on the individual market.\n\nCompeting anecdotes can\u2019t tell us how many Arizonans are saving money and how many are paying more. But we do know about 240,000 residents will be newly eligible for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid.\n\nThe ad further contends that the law means \u201cthe loss of trusted doctors for the sick,\u201d but there\u2019s no citation of any report or data to back up that general claim. There may be some individual stories out there, but how many? We asked Americans for Prosperity for support for the ad\u2019s claims, but have not received a response.\n\nContext, Please\n\nThe ad also shows a headline that reads, \u201cAbout 283,000 Arizonans May Have Health Plans Canceled.\u201d That\u2019s from a short story on the website of Arizona Public Media, which reported that 283,000 Arizonans have plans on the individual market, according to an analysis by Families USA.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether all of those people received cancellation notices from their insurers because their plans didn\u2019t meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act, such as coverage of minimum benefits for individual market plans. It\u2019s also unknown how many of them will wind up with better coverage for less money because of government subsidies. In fact, the Arizona Public Media story quoted Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a group that supports the health care law, as saying most of these Arizonans could be better off in the end. He said 74 percent of those buying their own insurance in the state would qualify for federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cAll together about 3 out of every 4 people in the individual market will qualify for these subsidies,\u201d Pollack was quoted as saying. \u201cAnd that means that people who are getting these notice, once they learn about what they can get from the Affordable Care Act can be considerably better off than they were before.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Families USA estimated that 846,000 Arizonans would gain health insurance because of the health care law, a number it calculated based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis.\n\nThe ad\u2019s announcer also says the law leads to \u201cdiminished care for those in need\u201d \u2014 of course hundreds of thousands of uninsured Arizonans stand to gain care \u2014 and shows a graphic saying, \u201cTucson Doctor: Less Care and Poorer Care Despite Higher Cost.\u201d The doctor referenced, Dr. Jane Orient, is the executive director of the conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which opposes the ACA and has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate. The group says its members appear in the media and on blog sites to \u201ccounter the emotional arguments for socialized medicine.\u201d Orient is a doctor of internal medicine who provides consultations and will not accept any insurance payments or government insurance programs. She wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Times in 2012 that is cited in the ad.\n\nThe AFP ad is one of many launched by the organization using the Affordable Care Act to attack Democrats running for reelection in Congress.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3a6\"", "article_summary": "Like so many others, he lost his job \u2013 and his health insurance along with it \u2013 during the Great Recession.\nIt shows the news headline, \u201cArizona Man: Obamacare Will Double My Premiums,\u201d while an announcer says, \u201cObamacare means higher costs for struggling families.\u201d As we\u2019ve said many times, the health care law will affect Americans differently.\nThe law also requires policies to cover certain essential benefits, including vaccines, mental health care, prescription drugs and maternity care.\nAs we\u2019ve explained, the law changes the individual insurance market, barring insurers from rejecting applicants with preexisting conditions, or charging them more.\nSome families \u2014 whether they\u2019re \u201cstruggling\u201d or not \u2014 may face higher costs."}
