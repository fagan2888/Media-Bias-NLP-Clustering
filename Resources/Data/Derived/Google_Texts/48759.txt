Health Affairs is planning a theme issue on behavioral health, which will present work pertaining to policies involved in the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services.

Among other topics, we are interested in work exploring barriers to access to care, trends in coverage, evidence and developments with respect to treatments, new models of care, the evolving role of the criminal justice system, specific populations and consumer/patient perspectives, disparities in care, strategies for curbing drug and alcohol addiction, and external influences on the effectiveness of the care system.

We invite all interested authors to submit abstracts for consideration for this issue. Abstracts must be submitted by 11:59 PM EDT on September 9, 2015. If you wish to submit an abstract, please send it as an email attachment to healthaffairs_behavioralhealth_abstracts@projecthope.org.

We plan to publish 15-20 peer-reviewed articles including research, analyses, and commentaries from leading researchers and scholars, analysts, industry experts, and health and health care stakeholders.

The issue will include several papers that will provide broad overviews and frame key issues, but we are particularly interested in empirical analyses of specific policies, programs, and practices that relate to behavioral health in the U.S. and abroad.

More information on topics and themes for this issue, as well as process guidelines and timetables, is available in the request for abstracts for the issue on the Health Affairs website. Please consult our online abstract submission guidelines for additional formatting instructions and answers to frequently asked questions. If you have further questions about this request, please email behavioral_health_queries@healthaffairs.org.

We thank you for your time and consideration. Please feel free to pass this invitation along to colleagues who might be interested, as well.
