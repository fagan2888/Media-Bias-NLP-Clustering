(RELATED: GOP Congressman Fears Replacing Boehner With \u2018Right-Hand Man\u2019)\n\nMcCarthy also blasted the EPA suggesting claiming the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cneed a strong EPA\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need to fund a lot of money there.\u201d\n\nHewitt asked McCarthy if there have been discussions about revoking the citizenship of Americans who joined the jihadists in the Islamic State and McCarthy said that there were discussion as of today with Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul to do just that because \u201cthis isn\u2019t\u2026 just happening overseas. No, they\u2019re coming here.\u201d\n\nKevin McCarthy: When America leads, the world is safer. Hugh Hewitt: So Kevin McCarthy, when you get to be speaker, at what priority do you put the national security issues vis-\u00e0-vis the other issues, which are stacked up, and there are many? There\u2019s Obamacare. Obviously, there\u2019s an EPA that\u2019s out of control. There\u2019s entitlement reform that needs to get done. But where does defense come? McCarthy: Defense comes to me at the top, because you know what, I believe in limited government. You know what? I don\u2019t need a strong EPA. I don\u2019t need to fund a lot of money there. But if we don\u2019t secure ourselves, and if people don\u2019t quite understand where Iran is now getting $150 billion, and we only used to send $16 billion, where are they going to fund this? And who are these little cells that are going to be coming into America? We have to defend America and be strong. Our military is now equal to the 1940s. Hewitt: I read the New York Times story yesterday that more than 250 Americans have gone to join the jihadists in the Islamic State. Is there any way, Leader McCarthy, that their citizenship can be revoked? I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible via statute. But have you heard it discussed? McCarthy: Yes, I was actually talking about that today with the Intel Chairman, Chairman McCaul of Homeland Security. You know, there has been, what, 67 arrests in America, too, because they had been working with ISIS. You know, this isn\u2019t, when the people look at the television, think it\u2019s just happening overseas. No, they\u2019re coming here. Think about Paris. Think about London. Think about Washington. We have seen what terror has done. And these radical Islamists, we\u2019ve got to do something about. And if you don\u2019t call them what they are, but if we also don\u2019t talk about who we are, we are exceptional, and America is good for the world.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nFollow Steve on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Guest", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy insisted defense would be his \"top\" priority if he becomes Speaker of the House in an interview with Hugh Hewitt Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy insisted\u00a0defense would be his \"top\" priority if he becomes speaker of the House, in an interview with Hugh Hewitt Tuesday.\u00a0(RELATED:\u00a0GOP Congressman Fears Repla", "title": "McCarthy Reveals His Top Priority If Elected Speaker [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/29/defense-to-be-kevin-mccarthys-top-priority-if-elected-speaker-video/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Kevin-McCarthy-e1443550798891.jpg", "height": 512}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'We have to defend America and be strong.
