Maybe \u2013 would we actually need such a tablet? As you will find out below, there are a few benefits to take into consideration as far as flexible tablets are concerned.\n\nFlexible tablets will be harder to damage\n\nOne advantage of flexible gadgets is ruggedness. Remember Samsung\u2019s Youm flexible display at CES 2013? Well, the company claimed and showed how the flexi-tech bended all around without breaking, even if dropped on the floor.\n\nSince 2013, Samsung flexible technology hasn\u2019t seen the spotlight all that much, but before MWC 2014 it was rumored that the Korean tech giant was about to demo a flexible tablet behind closed doors. Sadly, we didn't get to see anything, but we still hope that Samsung is working on something like this.\n\nFlexibility should also improve user interfaces, particularly when it comes to devices such as tablets, as the bending and twisting could make interaction more natural and intuitive for users.\n\nAnd with the technology LG uses (the kind we have seen with the 18-inch panel) such displays could turn out to be more translucent, thus serving the purposes outlined above.\n\nSince the flexible OLED screen is also semi-transparent users will be able to see what\u2019s happening both on the 1280 x 810 pixel screen and behind it, depending on the opacity.\n\nFlexible tablets would be easier to carry\n\nResearchers are also working on flexible batteries that could make it easier to create devices in unusual shapes.\n\nAs you can see, flexible display and battery technologies are advancing quite fast, so it\u2019s not hard to imagine a near future where you can really fold up or roll a tablet for easier storage.\n\nActually, this might be another important benefit of flexible tablets. They would allow you to carry tablets with bigger displays around without you complaining about the rigidity of the device. Or investing money for accessories such as protection folios and what not.\n\nFlexible tablets could act like hybrids\n\n2-in-1 tablet/notebook combos are already making a splash in the market, given their versatility. Users looking to purchase a device today are lured in by the promise of multiple functionalities. After all, a 2-in-1 can be a tablet or a notebook, depending on what you need to do with it.\n\nHowever, a flexible tablet that can be bent could also be transformed into a laptop, or a smartphone. If the tablet is bigger, the lower part might be used with a virtual keyboard, while the upper part could act as a display. Or if the tablet is smaller and has cellular connectivity, it could be folded up, put in your coat\u2019s pocket, and used to place phone calls.\n\nTo make a roundup, flexible tablets of the future could end up being tougher, unbreakable, taking up less space, and used in multiple ways. Therefore, I think they do have a potential to wow the market if they are to be given decent price tags by their manufacturers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "LG, flexible, rollable, tablets, future", "language": "english", "author": "Alexandra Arici", "og": {"site_name": "softpedia", "description": "LG will perhaps be the first to launch such tablets", "title": "Three Reasons Why Flexible Tablets Are Something to Watch Out For", "url": "http://news.softpedia.com/news/Three-Reasons-Why-Flexible-Tablets-Are-Something-to-Watch-Out-For-464518.shtml", "image": "http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Three-Reasons-Why-Flexible-Tablets-Are-Something-to-Watch-Out-For-464518-2.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Softpedia/122839394413621", "published_time": "2014-11-08T11:49:00+0000"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LG will perhaps be the first to launch such tablets", "title": "Three Reasons Why Flexible Tablets Are Something to Watch Out For", "url": "http://news.softpedia.com/news/Three-Reasons-Why-Flexible-Tablets-Are-Something-to-Watch-Out-For-464518.shtml", "image": "http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Three-Reasons-Why-Flexible-Tablets-Are-Something-to-Watch-Out-For-464518-2.jpg", "creator": "@Softpedia", "site": "@Softpedia", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "fb": {"app_id": 505430742898262}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.softpedia-static.com/_img/favicon_512.png?2015", "keywords": "LG, flexible, rollable, tablets, future", "viewport": "width=980", "description": "LG will perhaps be the first to launch such tablets"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43a8\"", "article_summary": "Flexible tablets will be harder to damageOne advantage of flexible gadgets is ruggedness.\nFlexible tablets would be easier to carryResearchers are also working on flexible batteries that could make it easier to create devices in unusual shapes.\nAs you will find out below, there are a few benefits to take into consideration as far as flexible tablets are concerned.\nFlexible tablets could act like hybrids2-in-1 tablet/notebook combos are already making a splash in the market, given their versatility.\nActually, this might be another important benefit of flexible tablets."}
