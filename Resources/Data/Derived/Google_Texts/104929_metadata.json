And no matter how you slice it, this green cannonball of nutrition is attracting scientific attention as an elixir that reduces muscle pain after workouts and a whole lot more.\n\nStudies also have shown beneficial effects on arterial plaque in cardiovascular disease, prostate and other cancers, erectile dysfunction, menopause, acid reflux and potentially Alzheimer\u2019s disease, among others.\n\nA recent study, for example, found that \u201cwatermelon extract supplementation reduces blood pressure and arterial stiffness,\u201d in older adults in cold weather, so it \u201ccan prevent the progression of hypertension and the hypertensive response to cold exposure,\u201d said the author Arturo Figueroa-Galvez, associate professor at Florida State University\u2019s department of nutrition, food and exercise sciences.\n\nAnother of his studies found that the supplement also reduced ankle blood pressure in obese adults with hypertension. Studies by others found that watermelon compounds reduced inflammation in prostate, gastrointestinal and other cancers, while a study published recently showed that lycopene, which provides the red pigmentation in watermelon and tomatoes, potentially reduced the inflammatory cascade of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn April yet another study found lycopene reduced reflux disease in animals, in part, by inhibiting acid pathways in the stomach.\n\n\u201cWatermelon is a pretty well-documented source of vitamin C, vitamin A and potassium,\u201d said Penelope Perkins-Veazie, a professor of horticulture in the Plants for Human Health Institute at North Carolina State University. She said she\u2019s been studying watermelon nutrients for 15 years.\n\nMost noteworthy are watermelon\u2019s two \u201csecondary metabolites,\u201d citrulline and lycopene, which have been the focus of recent research. Citrulline, a nonessential amino acid, is abundant in watermelon, yellow watermelons having four times that of red watermelon.\n\nAs it turns out, citrulline is involved in producing nitric oxide, a potent molecule that relaxes blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, \u201cwith benefits to the brain, heart and in a cycle of amino acids necessary to properly flush the kidneys,\u201d said Perkins-Veazie.\n\nLycopene is actually more abundant and more easily available in watermelon than in tomatoes, where it\u2019s bound up in cellular walls. Perkins-Veazie said lycopene shows clear benefits in reducing plaque buildup in arteries and preventing prostate cancer.\n\nThe longstanding bias against watermelon stems from its 21 grams of carbohydrates, mostly sugars, in every two-cup serving, with only a single gram of fiber.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about the sugar, but compared to processed products it tastes sweet but isn\u2019t loaded with sugar,\u201d Perkins-Veazie said. \u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but there is an enzyme present to regulate the glucose.\u201d\n\nDespite the sugars (equally divided among sucrose, glucose and fructose), two cups of watermelon have only 80 calories with no fat, sodium or cholesterol. \u201cUsing the same watermelon extract used in my previous human studies, watermelon supplementation did not increase body weight and improved blood lipids in rats,\u201d Figueroa-Galvez said.\n\nWatermelon originated in southern Africa and became nature\u2019s canteen. Rather than transport water long distances, travelers took watermelons, which are 92 percent water and don\u2019t begin rotting for three weeks", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003356543-FL_SAR_HFNUTRI1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f70\"", "article_summary": "In April yet another study found lycopene reduced reflux disease in animals, in part, by inhibiting acid pathways in the stomach.\nRather than transport water long distances, travelers took watermelons, which are 92 percent water and don\u2019t begin rotting for three weeks\nAnother of his studies found that the supplement also reduced ankle blood pressure in obese adults with hypertension.\nCitrulline, a nonessential amino acid, is abundant in watermelon, yellow watermelons having four times that of red watermelon.\n\u201cUsing the same watermelon extract used in my previous human studies, watermelon supplementation did not increase body weight and improved blood lipids in rats,\u201d Figueroa-Galvez said."}
