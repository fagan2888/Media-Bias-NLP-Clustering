(Photo: Town Talk file photo)\n\nThe occupants of a car involved in a collision with the late Pineville City Marshal Larry Jeane have filed a civil lawsuit against his estate, the city of Pineville, their insurance companies and others.\n\nJeane was driving a city-owned Ford F-150 pickup truck on Melrose Street just before 1 p.m. on July 18, 2014, when he crossed the center line and hit a 2007 Ford Fusion driven by Sarah Barber. A witness who was driving ahead of Barber had reported seeing Jeane slumped over truck's steering wheel as it crossed into Barber's lane, Pineville Police said while they were investigating the wreck.\n\nBoth Jeane and Barber, 37, had to be extricated from their vehicles, and all of the drivers and occupants \u2014 Jeane, Barber and three teens \u2014 were taken to Rapides Regional Trauma Center.

The original lawsuit was filed with the Rapides Parish Clerk of Court's Office in early January. In mid-March, the suit was amended to add the jury and the state as defendants.\n\nTom Wells, a Rapides Parish assistant district attorney who represents the jury, said the hearing was postponed until sometime this summer. He said he wants the plaintiff's attorney, Derrick G. Earles of the Laborde Earles Law Firm, to show how the jury is responsible in the incident. He said the jury only provides partial funding for the Pineville City Marshal's Office, but has no responsibility for the actions of the separate political entity.\n\nRelated story: Pineville City Marshal Larry Jeane dies\n\nRandall Keiser, the attorney representing the city of Pineville, said he had no comment at this time on the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the wreck was solely the fault of Jeane, and it seeks his autopsy report, any traffic citation Jeane received because of the wreck, his driving record, maintenance or driving logs on the Ford truck, the investigative file on the wreck from the Pineville Police Department and more.\n\nBarber, according to the suit, lost consciousness and suffered injuries to her head, neck, jaws, back, pelvis and right ankle.
