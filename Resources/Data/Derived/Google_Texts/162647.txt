Parkview Adventist Medical Center in Maine filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday in a pre-packaged plan to combine with area provider Mid Coast Hospital, according to Mid Coast Health Services.

Both hospitals are located in Brunswick, Maine.

The new Mid Coast – Parkview Health System will consolidate inpatient and emergency services at Mid Coast. Parkview will close its emergency department and acute inpatient care as of Thursday night, according to Mid Coast.

Amid increasing financial challenges, Parkview could no longer survive as a stand-alone hospital, according to Bob Cundiff, chairman of the Board of Directors for Parkview Adventist Medical Center.

Pending court approval, Mid Coast will purchase certain assets, assume liabilities, and preserve the Adventist mission on the Parkview campus, according to Mid Coast.

The Parkview campus will retain physician practices, a walk-in clinic, radiology, laboratory, ambulatory testing and surgery, oncology and infusion services, physical, occupational and speech therapy services, and community health and wellness programs.

All full and part-time jobs at Parkview will be preserved, according to Mid Coast.

The combined systems establish an integrated model for high quality, local care, Mid Coast said.

"While so many Maine communities continue to grapple with the loss of local healthcare options, our combined strength and spirit of partnership will serve as a living example of how local community organizations can come together to solve difficult problems and preserve convenient access to quality care,” said Barbara Reinertsen, Board chairman for Mid Coast Health Services.
