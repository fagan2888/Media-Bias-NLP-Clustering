Decety. J, Chenyi. C, Harenski. C, and Kiehl. K, A. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 2013\n\nIn nature, the psychopath feels no pain beyond his own, an island unto himself in an emotional wasteland.\n\nAs many as one percent of people \u2014 and nearly one in every four inmates in American prisons \u2014 may exhibit traits consistent with the personality disorder of psychopathy: a lack of empathy and remorse, shallow affect, glibness, manipulation, and callousness. Under the lens of modern brain scanning technology in a study of U.S. prisoners, people with psychopathy to varying degrees not only fail to experience empathy for another\u2019s pain, but also derive pleasure from the thought.\n\nIn a way, such people may be thought of as emotionally retarded, lacking a mental capacity inherent in others and integral to the networking of the social species, homo sapiens. When asked by researchers to imagine another\u2019s pain, study subjects demonstrated no activation in brain areas associated with empathy but instead experienced some activity in areas representing pleasure. In a neural-typical person, brain areas associated with empathy would activate and connect with other areas underlying affective processing and decision-making.\n\nAlthough science has established the marked deficit in affective arousal and emotional empathy within people with the personality disorder, researchers at the University of Chicago hope the neurological study may help develop applications for rehabilitation. Whereas healthy people may develop greater empathy for others from an innate capacity for affective arousal, psychopaths \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201csociopaths\u201d \u2014 tend to respond poorly to any rehabilitation efforts.\n\nIn the study, researchers used a standard diagnostic tool to separate 121 incarcerated men into three groups, including highly, moderately, or weakly psychopathic. Subsequently, they found that \u201cparticipants with high psychopathy showed a typical response within the network involved in empathy for pain, including the anterior insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus, somatosensory cortex, and right amygdala.\u201d\n\nConversely, the study subjects \u201cexhibited an atypical pattern of brain activation and effective connectivity seeded in the anterior insula and amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex\" when asked to imagine another\u2019s pain.\n\n\u201cTaken together, this atypical pattern of activation and effective connectivity associated with \u2018perspective taking\u2019 manipulations may inform intervention programs in a domain where therapeutic pessimism is ore the rule than the exception,\u201d lead investigator Jean Decety and his colleagues wrote. \u201cAltered connectivity may constitute novel targets for intervention.\u201d\n\nIn essence, researchers believe the psychopath\u2019s ability to conceptualize his own pain might provide a target for \u201ckick-starting\u201d a latent capacity for empathy via cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nSource: Decety J, Chen C, Harenski C, Kiehl KA.
