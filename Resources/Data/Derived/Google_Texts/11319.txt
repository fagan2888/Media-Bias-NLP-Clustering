Cigna Global Healthcare will now offer health coverage to U.S. and foreign customers working in Canada after Delaware's federal legislators created an exemption to the Affordable Care Act.

Under the ACA, health insurance plans like Cigna were barred from offering expatriate health insurance plans for people working outside their home country, including foreign employees working in America or Americans working abroad.

Cigna said it would be forced to lay off 500 employees at its Wilmington office if an exemption was not created. Delaware's Congressional Representative John Carney, a Democrat, authored a bill allowing insurers to offer expatriate health plans.

Cigna will offer medical, dental, vision and pharmacy benefit to Canadian expatriates and eligible family members. Customers can receive health services at discounted rates in many cases, direct claims settlement for all benefits across Canada and access to search engines to locate appropriate medical treatment.

Cowan Insurance Group, a Canadian health benefits plan provider, will partner with Cigna to facilitate the plan.
