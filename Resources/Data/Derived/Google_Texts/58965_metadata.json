It\u2019s now lower than the current national average of 5 percent.\n\nMillennial college graduates are also getting paid a lot more: Median incomes jumped to $43,000 last year, up about $3,000 from the year before, almost back to the pre-recession high of $44,737 in 2002. The top 25 percent of college graduates earn at least $60,000 a year.\n\nUnderemployment has also been falling for the past two years. The report found that as of September 2015, about 44.1 percent of workers with degrees are in occupations where college isn\u2019t required, down from 45.9 two years before.\n\nThe New York Fed also found evidence of a growing economic divide between those with a college degree and those without. The median wage for those with only a high school degree remained at $25,000, the same as the year before. The unemployment rate is 10 percent, over twice that of people with college degrees.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Memo to parents: It\u2019s time to call your decorator and redo the den, which you never th", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Millennials Are Finally Leaving Home", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Here-s-Why-Millennials-Are-Finally-Leaving-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_new_jobs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Here-s-Why-Millennials-Are-Finally-Leaving-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_new_jobs_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Memo to parents: It\u2019s time to call your decorator and redo the den, which you never th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce29e\"", "article_summary": "The New York Fed also found evidence of a growing economic divide between those with a college degree and those without.\nThe unemployment rate is 10 percent, over twice that of people with college degrees.\nRelated: \u2018Irresponsible\u2019 Millennials Saving More Than Almost Every Other GroupFrom a peak of 7.1 percent in March 2011, the unemployment rate for recent college grads fell to 4.9 percent in 2015.\nThe top 25 percent of college graduates earn at least $60,000 a year.\nThe median wage for those with only a high school degree remained at $25,000, the same as the year before."}
