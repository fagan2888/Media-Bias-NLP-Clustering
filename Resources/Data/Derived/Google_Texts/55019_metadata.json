But she thought the city could look at ways to make it easier for first responders to live there. It makes sense.\n\nSam Carter, who last week was convicted in the shooting of the elk, didn\u2019t live in Boulder. Nor do most of his former colleagues on the force.\n\nTwelve percent of Boulder cops and firefighters live in town, according to the city. And 25 percent of all city workers live there. Aside from elected officials, only the city manager and city attorney are required to have a Boulder address.\n\nThe police chief doesn\u2019t even live in Boulder.\n\nThat is completely understandable because of the high cost of living. The median price for a home there is $442,500, based on the 449 homes sold in Boulder in the past two months.\n\nMany city workers don\u2019t earn a kind of salary that could let them afford a home like that.\n\nBecker, in a column she wrote for the Daily Camera, argued that a connection is lost when people who serve the city don\u2019t live there.\n\n\u201cWhen officers live in the city where they work, they have a greater stake in the community,\u201d Becker wrote. \u201cThey are more invested in it. Residents are more likely to trust the police that serve them if they get to know them on a personal level. Chance encounters at the playground, grocery store or school potluck that help all of us to know each other better, build community.\u201d\n\nI would add, it\u2019s doubtful Carter would have killed Big Boy had he known the community had basically adopted the beast.\n\n\u201cPeople knew how that elk was very talked about, a very loved part of the town,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is amazing to live in an urban city and have an elk in the town. It was noteworthy. I wonder if something would have happened differently if they would have known what the residents are talking about.\u201d\n\nResidency requirements have long been controversial. In 1978, Denver voters approved an initiative requiring full-time city workers to live within the city\u2019s borders.\n\nThe rationale, among other things, was if municipal employees worked for the city\u2019s taxpayers and were paid out of the city\u2019s tax-supported general fund, then they should live in the same town they serve.\n\nA decade later, the legislature passed a law, spurred by the police unions, to eliminate the requirement for cities. A dozen home-rule towns at the time still had the requirements, including Denver. (Denver has since eliminated the requirement.)\n\nThe Colorado Municipal League fought the state law, challenging the issue to the state\u2019s highest court and arguing home-rule cities should have the right to require residency.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed, and Colorado Municipal League director Sam Mamet still considers the ruling the greatest legal victory for home rule.\n\nNot that cities should go back to the requirement unless they help pay for housing. But there is something to be said for hometown police officers who know the neighborhood and customs.\n\nAfter all, Mayberry\u2019s Andy Griffith would never have shot Big Boy.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
