I waited until my family went away for the weekend and I was alone in the house and I swallowed a bottle of pills,\u201d said Miller, reports E! News. \u201cI don't remember what happened over the next couple days, but I'm pretty sure come Monday morning I was on a bus back to school pretending everything was fine. And when someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I say no, because I told no one.\"\n\nMiller, 41, came out less than a month ago when he was received an invitation to be the guest of honor at the St. Petersburg International Film Festival, scheduled to be held in the middle of September. In a letter to Maria Averbakh, director of the St. Petersburg International Film Festival, the star kindly thanked her for the invitation but humbly declined.\n\n\"Thank you for your kind invitation. As someone who has enjoyed visiting Russia in the past and can also claim a degree of Russian ancestry, it would make me happy to say yes,\u201d wrote the Prison Break star in the letter, posted on GLAAD's website. \"However, as a gay man, I must decline. I am deeply troubled by the current attitude toward and treatment of gay men and women by the Russian government.\"\n\nMiller has now dedicated himself to raising awareness about not only his own challenges, but also the challenges that many gay youth face.\n\n\"Growing up I was a target. Speaking the right way, standing the right way, holding your wrist the right way. Every day was a test and there were a thousand ways to fail,\" he said at the Human Rights Campaign Gala. The actor continued to talk about paying the price of trying to be someone you are not. \u201cAnd when you failed the test, which was guaranteed, there was a price to pay. Emotional. Psychological. Physical. And like many of you, I paid that price. More than once.\"\n\nMiller explained that he had many opportunities to publicly come out early in his career but he was too nervous because he felt he wasn\u2019t ready. The actor did come out privately to family and friends, says E!
