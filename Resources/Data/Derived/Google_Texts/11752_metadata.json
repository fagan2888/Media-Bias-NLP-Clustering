Kennedy Airport Tuesday. Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to bar U.S. carriers from flying to Tel Aviv has temporarily severed part of a crucial link from New York City and Israel.\n\nOf the eight direct flights from U.S. airports to Tel Aviv scheduled on Tuesday, six were scheduled from John F. Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International airports, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website.\n\nThe FAA issued its 24-hour ban on U.S. based carriers flying to Tel Aviv after a rocket attack near Ben Gurion International Airport. The FAA\u2019s decision also came in the wake of the apparent downing by a surface-to-air missile of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in war-torn eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.\n\nThe New York City area is home to a Jewish population of 1.1 million, the nation\u2019s largest, according to a report released last year by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Religion & Public Life Project. Newark and Kennedy airports have more direct flights to Tel Aviv than any other U.S. city.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s decision drew criticism from some New York politicians with strong ties to the city\u2019s Jewish community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. When I saw the news, I was upset,\u201d New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat who had just returned from a trip to Israel on Monday. \u201cThe terrorists rejoice over things like this. This encourages them. There is no doubt about that.\u201d\n\nThe FAA\u2019s temporary ban didn\u2019t affect non-U.S. based airlines: El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. was continuing with flights Tuesday from Newark and JFK, according to FlightAware.\n\nAt JFK on Tuesday, lines at the El Al counter moved swiftly ahead of a 7 p.m. flight to Tel Aviv, although security was heightened. Members in a group of Israeli campers who had spent the past month in Milford, Penn., said they weren\u2019t overly concerned about the dangers of traveling to and from Israel.\n\nMoshe Kranz, a 22-year-old yeshiva student from Monsey, N.Y., in Rockland County, said he was one of hundreds of passengers at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport to be briefly evacuated from his flight Tuesday. Mr. Kranz, who has spent the past year studying to become a rabbi in Jerusalem, said his entire New York-bound El Al fight was evacuated amid safety concerns and he was shuttled to an emergency shelter inside the airport.\n\nHis flight was delayed about 40 minutes before he arrived late Tuesday afternoon. He has a trip planned to go back to Israel in the coming weeks but said he fears \u201cthings might not be back to normal by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched the dot on the map move across the screen as we flew,\u201d Mr. Kranz said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe until we were over the Israeli border.\u201d\n\nMr. Hikind said he didn\u2019t believe El Al would be flying if passengers faced a real danger. \u201cI would not hesitate to fly today on El Al or any airline that would fly me to Israel,\u201d he added.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a statement on Tuesday evening about his plans to fly on El Al to Tel Aviv \u201cto show solidarity with the Israeli people and to demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cI strongly urge the FAA to reverse course and permit U.S. airlines to fly to Israel.\u201d\n\nMara Gay contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to bar U.S. carriers from flying to Tel Aviv has temporarily severed part of a crucial link from New York City and Israel.", "title": "Tel Aviv Flight Ban Removes Link for New York Jews", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/22/tel-aviv-flight-ban-removes-link-for-new-york-jews/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU480_NYFAA_P_20140722172640.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Tel Aviv Flight Ban Removes Link for New York Jews", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to bar U.S. carriers from flying to Tel Aviv has temporarily severed part of a crucial link from New York City and Israel.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Andrew Tangel and Derek Kravitz", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to bar U.S. carriers from flying to Tel Aviv has temporarily severed part of a crucial link from New York City and Israel.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-22T21:43:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/22/tel-aviv-flight-ban-removes-link-for-new-york-jews/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21209", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to bar U.S. carriers from flying to Tel Aviv has temporarily severed part of a crucial link from New York City and Israel.", "title": "Tel Aviv Flight Ban Removes Link for New York Jews", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/22/tel-aviv-flight-ban-removes-link-for-new-york-jews/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU480_NYFAA_P_20140722172640.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21209", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-23T12:52:48-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d73\"", "article_summary": "Two people stand a the El Al Airlines ticket desk at Terminal 4 in John F.
