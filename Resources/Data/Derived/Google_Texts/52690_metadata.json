The three employees at the office have opted not to take their equivalent positions at the Seattle offices, ending their time with the company that\u2019s been based out of Petersburg since the mid-80s.\n\nLarry Cotter\u2014CEO of APICDA, of which Alaska Longline is a subsidiary\u2014said that juggling two offices along with high health insurance costs are the driving forces behind the consolidation of offices in Seattle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly difficult to maintain two offices, but perhaps as important is the fact that the health insurance costs of doing business in Alaska are more than double insurance costs of doing business in Washington state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said other businesses in Alaska are likely to face similar challenges as the Affordable Care Act regulations come into play this year.\n\n\u201cIf you look down the road, other people are going to experience the same thing we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Cotter.\n\nCotter added that their fleet has expanded in recent years, from two to five vessels, which has also factored into the decision to move the offices.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to have the office in Petersburg when there was one boat and maybe when there were two boats,\u201d Cotter said. \u201cBut with five boats and most of the activity occurring in Seattle, it\u2019s just not cost effective, nor is it as efficient.\u201d\n\nThe company, formerly called Prowler Fisheries, was formed in Petersburg by John Winther, Bart Eaton and Jerry Kennedy. Winther\u2019s first venture into longlinging came in 1984 when he purchased the F/V Prowler, the flagship vessel of the company. He was the managing partner of the company, which became known as Alaska Longline, heading up the Petersburg offices directing vessels operating in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea.\n\nThe company grew from there with APICDA acquiring 25 percent of it in the late 90s and adding more vessels to the fleet. In 2009, APICDA acquired Jubilee Fisheries and opened the Seattle office, joining their personnel based there.\n\nWinther passed away in late 2012 and shortly thereafter Cotter became the managing partner in his place.\n\nCotter characterized the decision to move as \u201cvery difficult,\u201d given the company\u2019s history in Petersburg and the caliber of the current three staff members.\n\n\u201cThe folks in Petersburg have been with us a long time and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job for us,\u201d Cotter said.", "article_metadata": {"revisit-after": "1 days", "og": {"url": "http://www.petersburgpilot.com/story/2015/02/12/news/alaska-longline-company-will-move-offices-to-seattle/3331.html", "type": "website", "site_name": "Petersburg Pilot", "description": "The Petersburg offices of Alaska Longline Company will be moved to Seattle by April 1.
