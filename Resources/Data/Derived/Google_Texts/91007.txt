Molina Healthcare has agreed to lease more than 73,000 square feet at One World Trade Center, the downtown Long Beach office complex that changed hands in August.

Commercial real estate firm JLL, formerly known as Jones Lang LaSalle, represented the building’s ownership along with CBRE and announced the transaction Monday.

Greenlaw Partners of Irvine acquired the 27-story, 574,000-square-foot One World Trade Center in August for $105 million. JLL’s announcement listed two other firms, Walton St. Capital and Stillwater Investment Group, as having an ownership stake in the Ocean Boulevard high rise.

Molina Healthcare’s main corporate offices are across the street from One World Trade Center and the firm also has downtown operations at the former Press-Telegram and Meeker-Baker buildings.

Molina Healthcare specializes in selling health plans to customers who are eligible for government-assisted care through such programs as Medicare, Medi-Cal and Covered California. The firm’s executives have said the Affordable Care Act has created a major growth opportunity for the company.

McKinney Advisory Group represented Molina Healthcare in the deal.
