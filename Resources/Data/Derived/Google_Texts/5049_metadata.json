He can\u2019t think about what it will be like next April to drive down Magnolia Lane at Augusta National with a shot at becoming the sixth player to capture the career Grand Slam.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d McIlroy said.\n\nHe knows that from experience, good and bad. He blew a four-shot lead at the Masters in 2011 and shot 80 in the final round. He had an eight-shot lead at the U.S. Open two months later and set two scoring records to win by eight. And just two months ago, McIlroy came from seven shots behind to win by seven.\n\nIt looks like a lost cause for Fowler, Sergio Garcia and anyone else trying to chase down a guy who has won both his majors by eight shots. The six-shot lead was the largest at The Open since Tiger Woods led by six at St. Andrews in 2000.\n\nEven so, McIlroy was doing his best to preach caution.\n\n\u201cA lot can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been on the right side of it and I\u2019ve been on the wrong side of it. You can\u2019t let yourself think forward. You\u2019ve just got to completely stay in the moment, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to do for all 18 holes tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHistory is on his side.\n\nNo one has ever lost a six-shot lead in the 121 years that The Open has been contested over 72 holes. Boy Wonder would not seem to be a candidate.\n\n\u201cWhat you have with him is he\u2019s just so explosive,\u201d Jim Furyk said after a 71 left him 10 shots behind. \u201cHe won the U.S. Open by eight shots. He obviously doesn\u2019t have any issue as the front-runner, and has no issue trying to extend that lead, much like Tiger used to.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy was at 16-under 200.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m able to go out and get off to a good start, maybe I can put a little bit of pressure on him,\u201d Fowler said after a 68. \u201cBecause he\u2019s definitely in control of the golf tournament right now.\u201d\n\nFowler tried to do his part on a cloudy Saturday with occasional rain, but not nearly what the R&A expected when it went to a two-tee start of the first time in history. Fowler, who was six shots behind going into the third round, ran off three straight birdies to start the back nine and shared the lead when McIlroy made bogey on No. 12.\n\nIt all changed so quickly.\n\nFowler made a bogey on the 14th hole. McIlroy, playing in the group behind, drilled a 35-foot birdie putt that put his lead back to two shots.\n\n\u201cRickie was just getting close to me,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI could hear the cheers in front of me. I just wanted to get ahead. To hole a putt like that was huge.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when he turned it on.\n\nMcIlroy blasted a drive on the par-5 16th hole and hit 4-iron from 252 yards over a pot bunker to the left side of the green and made a 15-foot eagle putt. That restored his lead to five shots, for Fowler had driven into a pot bunker and made a bogey.\n\nFowler recovered with a superb shot out of the pot bunker on the 18th to tap-in range for birdie. That put the American into the final group for the second straight major, both times a long way out of the lead. He trailed Martin Kaymer by five shots going into the last day of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nFowler didn\u2019t get closer than four shots from Kaymer in the final round.\n\nGarcia, who played in final group with Woods at Royal Liverpool in 2006, certainly had his chances. He was only three shots behind at the turn until missing a short birdie putt on No. 12 and failing to convert so many other chances. Garcia had a 69 and was seven shots behind, along with Dustin Johnson (71).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d\n\nThis was Rory\u2019s show, just like it was at Congressional, just like it was at Kiawah Island when he won the 2012 PGA Championship.\n\nAnd yet the biggest crowd belonged to Woods, the sport\u2019s biggest star who is playing his first major since back surgery four months ago. Woods narrowly made the cut on Friday, opened with two straight birdies and that was about all the excitement. He made another double bogey, another triple bogey and shot 73.\n\nWoods was 19 shots out of the lead.\n\nThe biggest challenge for McIlroy might be to avoid looking ahead. It was hard. Asked what it would mean to be one major away from a Grand Slam at 25, McIlroy said, \u201cIt would mean a lot of hype going into Augusta next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be in pretty illustrious company,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rory McIlroy builds 6-shot lead at British Open", "title": "Rory McIlroy builds 6-shot lead at British Open", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/19/rory-mcilroy-builds-6-shot-lead-at-british-open/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__GLF-Rory-McIlroyp1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__GLF-Rory-McIlroyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-19T17:50:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:27:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9760\"", "article_summary": "He trailed Martin Kaymer by five shots going into the last day of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No.\nHOYLAKE, England \u2014 Rory McIlroy looked as though he had just thrown a knockout punch at the British Open, and it was only Saturday.\nThe six-shot lead was the largest at The Open since Tiger Woods led by six at St. Andrews in 2000.\nHe had an eight-shot lead at the U.S. Open two months later and set two scoring records to win by eight.\nMcIlroy, playing in the group behind, drilled a 35-foot birdie putt that put his lead back to two shots."}
