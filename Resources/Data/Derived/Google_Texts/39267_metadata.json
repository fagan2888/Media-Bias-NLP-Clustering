Instead, we're measuring processes.\"\n\nFor example, he said, the federal government's Hospital Compare site features 123 metrics, 102 of which measure processes. The burden of keeping track of these measures now outweighs the benefits, according to Wallace.\n\nInstead, Wallace said, quality measures must emphasize functional outcomes, such as whether a patient can walk or climb steps after a knee replacement procedure. Reporting such measures would be more complex than simply assigning letter grades to providers, Wallace concedes, but \"there's no reason it cannot be done in the manner that consumer reviews exist for myriad products and services.\"\n\nOther industry groups have also suggested adjustments to quality metrics. For example, the American Hospital Association has long called for risk-adjusted quality measures to account for socioeconomic factors such as income, homelessness, education and Medicaid status, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nWhile outcomes are the \"true north of healthcare,\" the industry must acknowledge the imperfections of outcomes measurement, such as its need to measure vast numbers of patients to produce reliable data, Margaret O'Kane, founder and president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, told the WSJ. As such, she said, quality measures must focus on the use of evidence-based practices to prevent complications.\n\nQuality measures are under increased scrutiny in the wake of a recent study that found wide gaps among hospital rating services' measures of hospital quality. This is further proof that such ratings should be guidelines for care quality, rather than the backbone of strict protocol, and especially should not be used to determine payments, retired orthopedic surgeon Thomas Guastavino told the WSJ. At this year's Congress of the American College of Healthcare Executives, National Quality Forum President and CEO Christine Cassel, M.D., noted that most people assess healthcare providers through online review sites such as Yelp, indicating a gap between mainstream measures and what actually matters to patients, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the WSJ article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nACHE 2015: Value-based care models heighten need for science-based measures\n\nBest and worst hospital rankings often conflict, confuse consumers\n\nValue-based payment initiative raises questions about how to measure quality\n\nFeds speed plans for value-based payments\n\nAHA supports NQF's proposed quality measure recommendations\n\nNQF to consider new measures for Meaningful Use\n\nNational Quality Forum to audit 2010 safe practices", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the healthcare industry debates\u00a0which quality measures are the most meaningful, one expert told the Wall Street Journal that the problem with current benchmarks is that they focus on what is easy to assess rather than what matters most to patients.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the healthcare industry debates\u00a0which quality measures are the most meaningful, one expert told the Wall Street Journal that the problem with current benchmarks is that they focus on what is easy to assess rather than what matters most to patients.", "title": "Why healthcare quality measures don't go deep enough", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-healthcare-quality-measures-dont-go-deep-enough/2015-03-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,clinical outcomes,consumer engagement,functional outcomes,hospital ratings,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,quality measures,Scott Wallace,Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc564\"", "article_summary": "Quality measures are under increased scrutiny in the wake of a recent study that found wide gaps among hospital rating services' measures of hospital quality.\nAs such, she said, quality measures must focus on the use of evidence-based practices to prevent complications.\nInstead, Wallace said, quality measures must emphasize functional outcomes, such as whether a patient can walk or climb steps after a knee replacement procedure.\nAs the healthcare industry debates which quality measures are the most meaningful, one expert says the problem with current benchmarks is that they focus on what is easy to assess rather than what matters most to patients.\nFor example, the American Hospital Association has long called for risk-adjusted quality measures to account for socioeconomic factors such as income, homelessness, education and Medicaid status, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
