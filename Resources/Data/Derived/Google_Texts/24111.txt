Presidential Primary races will take center stage on the Sunday shows this week, with the Iowa caucus looming just one month away.

A slew of 2016 candidates will make appearances as they round the final turn to the first-in-the-nation caucus.

Ben Carson , who also held the lead in Iowa briefly, will appear as he tries to recover from a sharp decline in the polls.

Here are the rest of Sunday’s expected guests.

ABC’s “This Week”: Carson will discuss his strategy heading into the Hawkeye State, following a major shake-up that saw two leading aides leave his campaign this week.

Sanders, who is chasing Hillary Clinton for the lead in the Democratic presidential race, will follow on the program.

CBS’ “Face the Nation”: Trump headlines the show in a taped interview, followed by national security experts Michael Morrell and Tom Donilon, who will evaluate the terror threats currently facing the nation.

CNN’s “State of the Union”: Sanders makes his second appearance of the day, followed by Republican presidential hopeful Cary Fiorina.

“Fox News Sunday”: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who recently canceled ad buys in Iowa to focus on his ground game in the state, will look to pick up some momentum heading into the caucus.

He will be followed on the program by another GOP presidential candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who has recently surged in New Hampshire.

NBC’s “Meet the Press”: Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) headlines the program to give his take on the early-voting states, followed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Both are also Republican presidential hopefuls.
