It\u2019s often used in opposition with \u201cabstinence-only,\u201d but that only means that, at a baseline, it includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases. What would it mean to be truly \u201ccomprehensive?\u201d Well, in the beginning, there were single-celled organisms \u2026 The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States says \u201cComprehensive sex education includes age-appropriate, medically accurate information on a broad set of topics related to sexuality including human development, relationships, decision-making, abstinence, contraception, and disease prevention.\u201d In a new study, Nicole Haberland, a senior associate at the Population Council, makes the case that \u201ccomprehensive\u201d should include gender and power dynamics. The study, published in International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, reviewed evaluations of 22 sex-education programs for adolescents and young adults, comparing how effective they were in reducing pregnancy and STIs.\n\nTen of the programs had at least one lesson on gender and power, and 80 percent of them saw significant decreases in pregnancy or STIs compared with a control group. Of the 12 programs that did not address these issues, 17 percent led to those positive outcomes. Teaching about power and gender roles was a consistent predictor of better health outcomes, even when Haberland accounted for other variables like sample size and whether the studies were longitudinal.

Women who report having less power in their relationships than their male partners have higher rates of HIV infection and other STIs, and young men who adhere to traditional concepts of masculinity are less likely to use condoms. There\u2019s a not-at-all fuzzy link between gender inequality and poor sexual health being shown by this kind of research. Some of the curriculums in Haberland\u2019s study challenged young people\u2019s thinking on gender roles by having them discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being male or female, or by analyzing media portrayals of men and women. They asked things like, \u201cWhat is this ad saying to you about what a woman is supposed to look like and act like?\u201d Haberland says. \u201cWhat are guys supposed to feel and act like?\u201d \u201cAnother thing people might do is use case studies,\u201d she says, \u201cworking with a class to critically analyze what is really going on between these two characters. Why is it that Jane isn\u2019t able to use a condom? It\u2019s not because she doesn\u2019t want to, it\u2019s because she can\u2019t say it.
