Last week the state government issued an official-sounding \u201cadministrative bulletin\u201d putting insurers on notice that discriminating against transgender folks isn\u2019t cool anymore.\n\nIf that sounds like something that probably should have been illegal already, that\u2019s because it is. While Obamacare makes your free-market pal\u2019s blood boil, a section of it bans health care discrimination based on sex and gender identity \u2014 the first federal law of its kind, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Good stuff for the trans community, right? Except the discrimination is still happening anyway, says Joann Usher, executive director of Minneapolis-based Rainbow Health Initiative.\n\n\u201cSome of it I think is unintentional, perhaps not realizing the scope of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of it is clearly intentional. There\u2019s a suspicion that by making this coverage available it\u2019s going to cost insurance companies a lot of money.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies sometimes write transgender exclusion clauses into their policies. In 2012, a New Jersey woman won a landmark case against Aetna after the health insurance giant refused to pay for the trans woman\u2019s mammogram even though her doctor recommended it.\n\nThe Minnesota \u201cbulletin,\u201d written by the Departments of Commerce and Health, reiterates what transgender advocates said the New Jersey woman\u2019s case affirmed \u2014 that insurance companies can\u2019t deny medically necessary procedures on account of gender identity.\n\n\u201cBy this bulletin the state of Minnesota has said to insurance plans, we know that this exists and you have to abide by it or you can\u2019t sell your insurance policies in our state,\u201d Usher says.\n\nThe LGBTQ health and wellness advocate added that it also clarifies what treatments are considered medical necessary and should remove the complex criteria insurance companies made transgender people hit before agreeing to pay.\n\nWhile the state\u2019s crackdown declaration gives patients ammo to fire at insurance companies should their claims be denied, Usher isn\u2019t counting on an overnight change. Although it may tidy up the wording of people\u2019s health plans, she says there will be a considerable transitional period for insurers \u2014 and perhaps in turn, those hoping for hassle-free payments.\n\n\u201cThe other piece is that this is not going to correct problems with individuals who are processing claims,\u201d Usher notes. \u201cSo, we know that the actual implementation of this bulletin is going to take longer.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state of Minnesota wants health insurance companies to quit screwing over transgender people.
