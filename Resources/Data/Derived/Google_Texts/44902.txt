Yosemite National Park is changing the names of various landmarks within its boundaries due to a trademark dispute.

Yosemite officials announced Thursday that all hotels and and skiing area in the historic park would get new names.

That’s because the outgoing company contracted to operate the facilities, a subsidiary of massive hospitality concessionaire Delaware North Cos., is asserting trademark rights over the names.

“While it is unfortunate that we must take this action, changing the names of these facilities will help us provide seamless service to the American public during the transition to the new concessioner,” Don Neubacher, the park’s superintendent, said in a statement. “Yosemite National Park belongs to the American people.”

Many of the facilities are designated as historic landmarks. They include the Yosemite Lodge at the Falls, The Ahwahnee lodge and Curry Village.

Delaware North asserted that, since it operated the facilities for years, it owns the trademarks to them, intellectual property worth more than $50 million.

A subsidiary of Aramark Corp., another major hospitality concessionaire, will take over the contract in March, the park officials said.
