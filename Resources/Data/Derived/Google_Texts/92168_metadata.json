The development sits atop a wave of recent depressing assessments. Last week, the Center for Disease Control issued a projection that tried to allow for the infection rate beyond the official count, and that factored in the rate at which infections are doubling in the different West African countries. That report makes for sobering reading: it\u2019s the source of the latest projection of a possible 1.4 million cases by January 2015. Moreover, CDC has revised upward its estimate of the virus\u2019s morbidity rate, from roughly 50% to a more precise 71%. That\u2019s a high figure.\n\nThe World Health Organization has added to those concerns by noting that we might be witnessing a long-term shift of the virus out of the animal kingdom to become endemic in the human population. And the International Crisis Group has pointed to the social and political dynamics associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\n\nThe Ebola crisis is still swelling in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, cutting a swathe through first-line medical responders (often small in number to begin with), weakening the capacity to cope with normal medical tasks, and biting into economic productivity and tourist rates. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen a New York Times article canvassing the possibility that the virus might \u201cgo airborne\u201d; an observation from a doctor in Germany that the virus might have to \u201cburn itself out\u201d in the current areas of major infection, possibly killing five million people; and Kent Brantly\u2019s testimony that Ebola is \u201ca fire straight from the pit of hell.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s put some of that into perspective. First, the outbreak in Africa derives part of its vigor from the weak national health infrastructures deployed against it (patients are routinely turned away from over-crowded hospitals), and the culture of fear and denial that surrounds the virus (seen in the attacks upon\u2014and sometimes the killing of\u2014aid workers sent into remote communities to help raise awareness of the disease). Infrastructures can be boosted and cultures can be changed, but it\u2019s not quite as easy to do either as some claim. Countries that already have strong health systems and greater public awareness about the disease are better placed to respond to it.\n\nSecond, and less well noticed amongst the slew of bad news over the last week or so, has been an item of good news: there\u2019s evidence that the outbreak is coming under control in Nigeria and Senegal, with no new cases of infection being reported in the past 21 days.\n\nThird, experts dispute the notion that the virus can easily \u201cgo airborne.\u201d For it to do so, it would have to mutate to target respiratory cells as a preferred infection route; and it would have to become more resilient at surviving outside its host\u2019s body. Some say that\u2019s possible: that influenza made that jump in the past. Others say the possibility of Ebola making the jump is remote.\n\nFourth, the CDC points to the continuing efficacy of isolation as a primary treatment. The fact that hospitals and treatment centers can contain the disease has much to do with their ability to isolate patients and thereby decrease the transmission rate to others. If early cases are treated properly, the disease has little chance to spread.\n\nBecause of globalization, we\u2019re always worried these days by the prospect of \u201cdiseases without borders.\u201d That\u2019s a legitimate concern. Disease experts have for some years written about the growing viral superhighway that globalization provides. But not all viruses are equally adept at travelling along the highway. Monkeypox proved capable of reaching out from west Africa to Wisconsin in 2003, infecting five-year-old Schyan Kautzer: an imported Gambian giant rat in a US pet store passed the disease to a prairie dog which passed the disease to humans, one ocean and half a continent away from its usual habitat. It was observed at the time that it was easier for a Gambian rat to enter the US than it was for a Gambian: the rat needed neither passport, nor visa, nor funds to pay for its own airfare.\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"The International Crisis Group has pointed to the\u00a0social and political dynamics\u00a0associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\"", "dcterms.title": "The Ebola Crisis: \"Possibly Killing Five Million People...\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "\"The International Crisis Group has pointed to the\u00a0social and political dynamics\u00a0associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\"", "title": "The Ebola Crisis: \"Possibly Killing Five Million People...\"", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-ebola-crisis-possibly-killing-five-million-people-11393", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/14976500130_4285b1556e_o.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "dcterms.subject": "Ebola, Africa,", "abstract": "\"The International Crisis Group has pointed to the\u00a0social and political dynamics\u00a0associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\"", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "Rod Lyon", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ebola, Africa,", "news_keywords": "Ebola, Africa,", "dcterms.publisher": "The Center for the National Interest", "twitter": {"description": "\"The International Crisis Group has pointed to the\u00a0social and political dynamics\u00a0associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\"", "title": "The Ebola Crisis: \"Possibly Killing Five Million People...\"", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-ebola-crisis-possibly-killing-five-million-people-11393", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/14976500130_4285b1556e_o.jpg", "site": "@thenatlinterest", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, width=device-width", "description": "\"The International Crisis Group has pointed to the\u00a0social and political dynamics\u00a0associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0af5\"", "article_summary": "The diagnosis of the first case of \u201cimported\u201d Ebola in the US has heightened public awareness and anxiety over the current outbreak in west Africa.\nThat report makes for sobering reading: it\u2019s the source of the latest projection of a possible 1.4 million cases by January 2015.\nMoreover, CDC has revised upward its estimate of the virus\u2019s morbidity rate, from roughly 50% to a more precise 71%.\nCountries that already have strong health systems and greater public awareness about the disease are better placed to respond to it.\nAnd the International Crisis Group has pointed to the social and political dynamics associated with the outbreak, suggesting we might see the \u201ccollapse\u201d of West African nations under the burden that Ebola is imposing."}
