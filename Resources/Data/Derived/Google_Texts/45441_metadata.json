He underwent Tommy John surgery a few days later and hoped for the best.\n\n\u201cI was scared in the beginning, and then I had a setback and I had a lot of things in my mind. But thank God I\u2019m here and I came back better than before,\u201d the soft-spoken left-hander said Sunday afternoon after rewriting the Rockies record book.\n\nWATCH: Jorge De La Rosa becomes Rockies all-time leader in wins, beats Marlins and more\n\nBy authoring a 4-1 victory over Miami at Marlins Park, De La Rosa, 34, notched his 73rd win in a Rockies uniform, passing Aaron Cook for the most wins in franchise history. De La Rosa improved his career record to 88-70. He\u2019s 73-49 pitching for Colorado.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to win all of those games for this team,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope there are more.\u201d\n\nMore urgently, De La Rosa\u2019s seven strong innings gave the Rockies the boost they were seeking to snap a frustrating four-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cThat was just what we needed,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cJorge\u2019s throwing the ball really well. He\u2019s on a good run right now.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa was slowed by a left groin strain and a nasty cut on his left middle finger earlier this spring, but he\u2019s healthy now and it shows. With his changeup baffling hitters and his cut fastball keeping them off-balance, De La Rosa has pitched like an ace in his last five starts, going 4-0 with a 2.56 ERA during that span, with opposing batters hitting just .173 against him. The Rockies are 5-0 in those starts.\n\n\u201cI think I have found my rhythm, and I\u2019m throwing more strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cI walked four guys today, but still, I think (fastball command) has been my biggest key. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pitching like this.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s offense, lifeless during the four-game swoon, provided an energy shot in the first inning off Miami right-hander Dan Haren. Charlie Blackmon led off the game with a homer into the right-field corner and Nolan Arenado followed up with a two-run homer to give the Rockies a 3-0 lead.\n\n\u201cAs it turned out, Haren settled in really well, so those runs really made a difference in the game,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cWe kind of got to (Haren) early before he got a good feel for everything and it helped us win the game.\u201d\n\nBlackmon\u2019s homer, his eighth, curled just inside the right-field foul pole and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d hit it out.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough park to hit in, being that it\u2019s so big and the ball never seems to come down \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t go very far, either,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I was making sure I was running pretty hard, just in case.\u201d\n\nBlackmon\u2019s home run was the eighth leadoff homer of his career, tying Eric Young (Colorado\u2019s current first base coach) for the most in franchise history. It was Blackmon\u2019s fourth homer to lead off a game, moving him ahead of teammate Carlos Gonzalez for the club record.\n\nArenado\u2019s homer was his 16th and he\u2019s knocked in 49 runs, easily leading the team in both categories.\n\nDe La Rosa cruised threw six scoreless innings, allowing just two singles, until things got a bit messy in the seventh. A leadoff walk to Jeff Baker, a pinch-hit RBI single by Ichiro Suzuki, followed by another single by Dee Gordon, fueled the Marlins\u2019 mini-rally. But De La Rosa coaxed Donovan Solano to hit an inning-ending groundball to second.\n\n\u201cJorge threw really well all day and really competed,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Jorge does, he competes really well.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 bats were dormant from the second through the sixth innings, but DJ LeMahieu\u2019s RBI groundout scored Nick Hundley in the seventh.\n\nCloser John Axford struck out three Marlins in the ninth to get his 12th save and lower his ERA to 0.47.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nJorge\u2019s history\n\nRockies left-hander Jorge De La Rosa became the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in wins Sunday.
