Robert Menendez (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nNEWARK \u2013 Attorneys for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez claim the criminal grand-jury proceeding against him and a longtime friend was inappropriately tainted with salacious material about sexual relationships and extramarital affairs.\n\nBut government attorneys insist the Democratic senator\u2019s girlfriends, and those of his married friend, are at the center of the corruption case against the pair.\n\nAttorneys for Menendez and Dr. Salomon Melgen are seeking to have the 68-page, 14-count criminal indictment against them dismissed. One of their arguments for dismissal, outlined in motions filed in July, is that the government \u201cflooded the grand jury proceedings with inflammatory questions regarding sexual relationships, affairs and lavish gifts which are unrelated to the charges contemplated by the government.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Justice attorneys, in court papers filed last week, defended their questioning of the defendants\u2019 girlfriends. It is the women with whom Menendez and Melgen associated who attest firsthand to the value of the favors and gifts that the pair exchanged, government attorneys said in their response to the defendants\u2019 motions.\n\nMenendez and Melgen, both 61, were charged in April in an indictment alleging that Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye doctor who is major contributor to the senator\u2019s campaigns, showered about $1 million in lavish gifts upon Menendez in exchange for the senator\u2019s influence for his benefit.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. Salomon Melgen walks toward the courthouse in Newark in April.

It claims Menendez helped to secure visas for at least three of Melgen\u2019s foreign girlfriends, that he blocked potential threats to Melgen\u2019s contract for cargo-screening services with the Dominican Republic, and that he intervened on the doctor\u2019s behalf in a Medicare billing dispute worth millions of dollars.\n\nMenendez has insisted his relationship with Melgen is nothing more than a 20-year friendship, and that the charges against them are the fruits of a political smear campaign against him.\n\nDefense attorneys, in their motions, complained that the government improperly elicited testimony in the grand jury proceedings about Melgen\u2019s girlfriends receiving visas and Menendez\u2019s girlfriends enjoying trips by private jets to Melgen\u2019s Caribbean villa. They said the government called three of Melgen\u2019s girlfriends and three of Menendez\u2019s girlfriends to testify before the grand jury even though they had nothing to do with the real issues in the case.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution called every woman it could find who could provide irrelevant and prejudicial testimony concerning their alleged relationships with Dr. Melgen,\u2019\u2019 the defense attorneys said in their briefs.\n\nHeart of the allegations\n\nBut prosecutors said that the women who were called to testify do not represent all of the senator\u2019s and doctor\u2019s girlfriends, and they are at the heart of the allegations against the pair.\n\n\u201cThe government did not interview or subpoena all of defendant Melgen\u2019s or defendant Menendez\u2019s girlfriends,\u201d the government\u2019s brief said. \u201cRather, the government only subpoenaed defendant Melgen\u2019s girlfriends who were the beneficiaries of defendant Menendez\u2019s official actions, and only defendant Menendez\u2019s girlfriends who enjoyed with him the things of value provided by defendant Melgen.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be ignored that part of the corrupt exchange involved defendant Menendez using the power of his Senate office to help defendant Melgen bring his foreign girlfriends into the United States, while defendant Melgen used his wealth to help defendant Menendez take his American girlfriends on exotic overseas vacations,\u201d the government said. \u201cThe nature of these relationships is highly relevant to the defendants\u2019 motives, and to the value of each gift and official act. This goes directly to the heart of \u2018the real issues\u2019 in this case.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys argued that evidence of Melgen\u2019s extramarital affairs is irrelevant, but the government asserts that otherwise relative evidence does not become immaterial simply because it involves an extramarital affair.\n\nThe defense claimed that the government\u2019s case was tainted from the beginning because it was based on an investigation into false allegations of underage prostitution, likely initiated by political enemies.\n\nAlthough they were never proven, the government had a responsibility to investigate the serious criminal allegations, which were \u201cnot so \u2018easily disprovable\u2019 as the defendants suggest,\u201d prosecutors said in their response.\n\nFBI agents carry out boxes as law enforcement officials investigate the medical-office complex of Dr. Salomon Melgen in Florida on Jan. 30, 2013.

Melgen had flown numerous young women from the United States and other countries to the Dominican Republic on his private jet, they said. The young women included two he met while they were performing at a South Florida \u201cgentleman\u2019s club,\u201d whom Melgen flew to his villa a day after paying one of them $1,000 and the other $2,000, prosecutors said in their brief.\n\n\u201cIndeed, one of defendant Melgen\u2019s pilots described \u2018young girls\u2019 who \u2018looked like escorts\u2019 traveling at various times on defendant Melgen\u2019s private jet,\u201d the brief said. \u201cSome young women who received substantial sums of money from defendant Melgen were in the same place as defendant Menendez at the same time.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said they could not ignore the testimony simply because it might appear inflammatory.\n\nDefense attorneys also complained that prosecutors implied an illicit relationship between Menendez and a female staff member, but prosecutors say the staffer and Menendez twice stayed at Melgen\u2019s Caribbean villa and traveled there together on Melgen\u2019s private jet on flights that Menendez did not pay for or report, which they say is further evidence of the corrupt relationship.\n\nProsecutors dismissed defense allegations that they intimidated, coerced and abused witnesses, including Menendez\u2019s ex-wife and his 70-year-old sister.\n\nStill in pajamas\n\nThe defense attorneys said the indictment should be dismissed because FBI agents visited Menendez\u2019s ex-wife, Jane Jacobsen, while she was still in her pajamas.\n\n\u201cMs. Jacobsen was indeed still in her pajamas when FBI agents visited her home, but they visited her home at 9 a.m. on a weekday,\u201d prosecutors responded\n\nThe prosecutors explained that federal rules of criminal procedure define daytime as beginning at 6 a.m., authorizing agents to execute search warrants then.\n\n\u201cHere, the FBI waited until 9 a.m. on a Wednesday to knock on her door,\u201d prosecutors said. \u201cThe fact that defendant Menendez\u2019s ex-wife was still in her pajamas at 9 a.m. on a weekday is of no moment, and knocking on her door at that reasonable time of day hardly qualifies as \u2018outrageous government conduct\u2019 warranting dismissal of the indictment.\u201d\n\nThe defendants also objected to what they said were similarly aggressive tactics employed on Caridad Gonzalez, the senator\u2019s 70-year-old sister.\n\n\u201cThe FBI visited defendant Menendez\u2019s sister because she received from defendant Melgen an eight-night stay on Brickell Key, making her a fact witness in this investigation,\u201d prosecutors said in their brief. \u201cThe \u2018aggressive tactics\u2019 the defendants describe, however, were merely serving Ms. Gonzalez with a grand jury subpoena after she participated in the interview.\u201d\n\nA hearing on the motions to dismiss the indictment against Menendez and Melgen is scheduled for Sept. 17 before U.S District Judge William H. Walls in federal court in Newark.\n\nKathleen Hopkins: 732-643-4202; Khopkins@app.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
