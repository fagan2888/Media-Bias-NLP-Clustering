Of those, the Supreme Court struck down 103 \u2014 just two-thirds of 1%. Of the more than 1 million state laws passed during that same time period, the Court struck down 452; less than 1/20th of 1%. In any given year, the Supreme Court strikes down just three out of every 5,000 laws passed by Congress and state legislatures.\n\nBut the idea that federal and state legislators are hitting the constitutional strike zone more than 99% of the time with the laws they pass is preposterous. Consider a handful of representative examples:\n\nHOW YOU CARE FOR CATS\n\nThe powers of the federal government were supposed to be limited to those spelled out in the text of the Constitution, such as punishing pirates and counterfeiters.\n\nBut Americans were reminded last summer, when the Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare, that the Court has essentially given up trying to hold Congress to its constitutionally authorized powers.\n\nA federal appeals court provided a humorous illustration of that fact a few months later when it held that the Department of Agriculture had the authority to tell the Hemingway Home and Museum, in Key West, Fla., how to care for the descendents of the author\u2019s famous six-toed cat, Snowball. The Hemingway cats were, like their namesake, free spirits who preferred to sleep outside under the stars.\n\nBut Agriculture, citing the Constitution\u2019s infinitely elastic commerce clause, claimed the authority to micromanage the cats\u2019 living conditions. Noting that the cats were featured on the museum\u2019s website and on merchandise in its gift shop, the appellate court concluded that the cats substantially affected interstate commerce and were therefore subject to federal control.\n\nAgriculture already ordered up a taller fence for the house; museum caretakers worry what\u2019s next.\n\nWHO NEEDS A DEGREE\n\nThe same federal appeals court upheld a Florida law requiring a college degree, a two-year apprenticeship, and passing a two-day, $1,000 licensing exam \u2014 to be an interior designer.\n\nOnly two other states (Louisiana and Nevada, if that tells you anything) license the practice of interior design, and there has been no outbreak of mismatched couch cushions, wheelchair-swallowing shag carpets, or fire-exit-blocking couches in any of the 47 non-licensing states.\n\nConsumers likely could decide for themselves if they trust an interior designer\u2019s ability, whether or not he or she has a college degree.\n\nBut the court upheld the law anyway as a valid exercise of the state\u2019s power to protect public health and safety.\n\nTAKING YOUR LAND\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court handed down its notorious decision authorizing the city of New London, Conn., to use eminent domain to bulldoze the working-class neighborhood of Fort Trumbull and hand over the property to a private developer to build high-end houses for executives at the Pfizer facility next door.\n\nThe five-justice majority blithely disregarded the Fifth Amendment\u2019s command that private property may only be taken for public use, and substituted the term \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d which they found includes the remote possibility of increased property taxes and new jobs.\n\nBut the only jobs created by that project were for the bulldozer operators who demolished acres of perfectly nice homes and businesses. Nothing was ever built on the property, and it remains a weed-choked brownfield to this day.\n\nBesides a breathtaking disregard for individual liberty, these cases represent an abdication of the judiciary\u2019s responsibility to fully enforce constitutional limits on government power.\n\nThe antidote for this kind of judicial abdication is judicial engagement, which means consistent, conscientious judging in all cases. Unfortunately, we are not getting that these days, which is why America has more government at every level than the Constitution permits.
