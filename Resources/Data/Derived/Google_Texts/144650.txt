Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney described repeated comments by Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber insulting the intelligence of the American public as “remarkable hubris,” “not good,” and “damaging” on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Lead” on CNN.

While Carney defended the substance of the law, Carney he was critical of Gruber’s comments, saying “it’s not good, Jake. It doesn’t help when, someone who helped write, not only Obamacare, the president’s Affordable Care Act, but also the precursor to it, which was Governor Romney’s healthcare reform initiative in Massachusetts, speaks from the Ivory Tower with remarkable hubris about the American voter, and by extension, the American Congress. The fact is, that any healthcare reform that sought to control costs and expand insurance would involve winners and losers, and that’s always going to be the case. That’s certainly the case, to speak that way, very harmful politically to the president.”
