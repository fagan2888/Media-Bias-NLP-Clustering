Those rules benefit millions of people, and thankfully, they're now part of the fabric of America.\"\n\nACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\n\nStaten Islanders also have abundant access to health care providers -- there are 150.5 primary care providers general practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics per 100,000 borough residents.\n\nThe national average is 48 providers per 100,000 county residents.\n\nPeople who have access to primary care providers are more likely to seek care for an ailment, as well as receive long-term care from a provider for more serious conditions, the CDC says.\n\nCOST BARRIER TO CARE\n\nCost of health care is not an issue for most Staten Island residents -- only 10.5 percent of residents 18 and older didn't seek care from a doctor because of cost, according to the study.\n\nThe national average is 15.6 percent of residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to comprehensive, quality health care service is important for the achievement of health equity, and for increasing the chances for a healthy life. Barriers to health care service diminishes quality of care and can lead to delays in receiving appropriate care, the inability to get preventative services and hospitalizations that could have been prevented, according to the CDC.\n\n'SIMILAR COUNTIES' GUIDELINES\n\nThe \"similar counties\" category was based on the following county-level equivalent variables for all 3,143 counties studied: Population size, growth, density and mobility; percent of children and elderly, sex ratio, percent foreign born, percentage of high school graduates, the number of single-parent households, median home value, housing stress, percentage of owner-occupied housing units, median household income, receipt of government income, household income, overall poverty, elderly poverty and unemployment.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Staten Islanders, health insurance, Staten Island, news", "title": "Staten Island is a health-care haven, CDC study shows", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Staten Islanders have ample access to health care services, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control.", "title": "Staten Island is a health-care haven, CDC study shows", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/cdc_staten_island_has_ample_ac.html", "image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/20375139-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/20375139-standard.jpg", "description": "Staten Islanders have ample access to health care services, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control.", "site": "@SIAdvance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Staten Island is a health-care haven, CDC study shows"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, May 22, 2016, 11:02 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, May 22, 2016, 11:00 AM", "article_author": "Kristin F.
