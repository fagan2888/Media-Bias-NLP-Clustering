Baltimore\u2019s defense kept the Broncos out of the end zone, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cGive them credit, they got the W,\u201d said Dumervil, a former Broncos star. \u201cIt was a tough one. Peyton (Manning) always has been a great player. He made some plays, we made some plays.\u201d\n\nBaltimore\u2019s defense stymied Manning, who two years ago in the season opener threw seven touchdown passes against Baltimore. On this day, however, the Ravens frustrated the Broncos\u2019 offense, holding it to four field goals.\n\nThe lack of a touchdown pass wasn\u2019t the only blemish on Manning\u2019s statistical line. He completed only 24 of 40 passes for 175 yards, was sacked four times and cornerback Jimmy Smith intercepted him and returned it for a touchdown.\n\nSmith, a first round draft choice in 2011 from Colorado, made an acrobatic move to catch the ball while defending Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood. He returned it 24 yards for a score that gave Baltimore a 10-9 lead early in the third quarter. Smith is remembered at CU for making a big interception for a touchdown against Nebraska in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt kind of floated, and thought I could jump over the receiver and catch it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what I did.\u201d\n\nFlacco, like Manning, failed to lead his team to a touchdown drive on a day when defense took center stage. The Ravens\u2019 only drive into the red zone came on their last possession, which Stewart ended with an interception after the ball bounced off the hands of tight end Crockett Gillmore, who was hit by safety David Bruton.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ravens\u2019 defense does its job in loss to Broncos", "title": "Ravens\u2019 defense does its job in loss to Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/13/ravens-defense-does-its-job-in-loss-to-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_074157_peyton-manning.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_074157_peyton-manning.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T19:34:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:03:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1391\"", "article_summary": "The Baltimore Ravens\u2019 defense had a lot to talk about about, but linebacker Elvis Dumervil said there was nothing to celebrate on his return to Denver Sunday.\nBaltimore\u2019s defense kept the Broncos out of the end zone, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\nOn this day, however, the Ravens frustrated the Broncos\u2019 offense, holding it to four field goals.\nHe made some plays, we made some plays.\u201dBaltimore\u2019s defense stymied Manning, who two years ago in the season opener threw seven touchdown passes against Baltimore.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what I did.\u201dFlacco, like Manning, failed to lead his team to a touchdown drive on a day when defense took center stage."}
