At the end of last season, several shows with gay characters, including \u201cThe New Normal,\u201d \u201cSmash\u201d and \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d were canceled (these shows, to be clear, were of wildly varying quality). Practically all that\u2019s left among returning shows are the paired but not exactly intimate \u201cModern Family\u201d couple, who at this point seem like acquaintances who like to fight, and the kids on \u201cGlee.\u201d It\u2019s enough to make one nostalgic for the parade of short-term boyfriends Sean Hayes\u2019 Jack cycled through on \u201cWill & Grace\u201d in the early 2000s, but don\u2019t worry, Hayes is returning to TV this fall, as there are few new ideas under the sun.\n\nThe Internet is more fertile ground, it\u2019d seem, for representation of gay characters \u2014 particularly for young Adam Goldman, whose Web series \u201cThe Outs\u201d has become, in certain circles, one of the most talked-about works of art about a gay person of the past year. \u201cThe most accurate and essentially human portrayal of young gay men today can be found on the Net, not the networks,\u201d wrote Interview; the Paley Center for Media is hosting a panel on the series along with discussions on \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d Goldman recently raised some $170,000 for a follow-up series on Kickstarter, and was invited to the White House on the back of the series.\n\nAnd yet the series paints less a picture of what it\u2019s like to be gay than about what it\u2019s like to be a creative-class Brooklyn resident with rent just a little bit too high to afford. The series documents the aftermath of a breakup experienced by a temperamentally mismatched couple \u2014 who are similar, though, in many demographic descriptors. The only other primary character is the couple\u2019s straight female friend, much the same demographically (naturally). The existence of \u201cThe Outs\u201d as a sort of standard-bearer for gays on-screen \u2014 at a time when, in the gay-centric media, coverage of Russian human rights violations lives uncomfortably next to pictures of shirtless athletes \u2014 seems particularly apropos. It\u2019s a tiny corner of experience; if broadcast networks try to use \u201cModern Family\u2019s\u201d central gay couple to broadly appeal to many, \u201cThe Outs\u201d is, surprisingly given its relative success, spiky and particular. The story of what it means to be gay has never seemed less unitary, and \u201cThe Outs\u201d breaks off a small piece of that experience in just the same way as a recent HBO sitcom.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s other shows, like \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 or \u2018Girls,\u2019 when there\u2019s not a lot of a particular voice out there \u2014 in the case of \u2018Girls,\u2019 people in their mid-20s,\u201d Goldman told Salon, \u201cpeople project onto that work the expectation of representation. Certainly the way \u2018Girls\u2019 is marketed.\u201d\n\nGoldman claimed to have \u201cinoculated\u201d himself against criticism of the show, but noted that he\u2019d come in for criticism online for portraying a particular set of experiences. \u201cWhen the first episode of \u2018The Outs\u2019 came out and began with the character of Jack having anonymous sex, I went online and saw two comments right next to each other. The first said, \u2018Oh, great, another representation of the slutty gay man, that\u2019s really great for the community. Way to go.\u2019 The second one said \u2018Oh, great, another representation of the gay man with all of these dark mental problems, why can\u2019t he just be a happy slut? Way to go.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adam Goldman's \"The Outs\" tells a very gay story -- but one that depicts the white creative class exclusively", "title": "Is this the gay Lena Dunham?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Adam Goldman's \"The Outs\" tells a very gay story -- but one that depicts the white creative class exclusively", "title": "Is this the gay Lena Dunham?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/04/is_this_the_gay_lena_dunham/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/adam_goldman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adam Goldman's \"The Outs\" tells a very gay story -- but one that depicts the white creative class exclusively", "title": "Is this the gay Lena Dunham?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/adam_goldman.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, adam goldman, gay community, Girls, Glee, Lena Dunham, Modern Family, the outs, TV, Whatever This Is", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1b6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: adam goldman, gay community, Girls, Glee, Lena Dunham, Modern Family, the outs, TV, Whatever This Is, Entertainment NewsThe television landscape is little better for gay characters than it was 10 years ago.\nThe first said, \u2018Oh, great, another representation of the slutty gay man, that\u2019s really great for the community.\nAt the end of last season, several shows with gay characters, including \u201cThe New Normal,\u201d \u201cSmash\u201d and \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d were canceled (these shows, to be clear, were of wildly varying quality).\nWay to go.\u2019 The second one said \u2018Oh, great, another representation of the gay man with all of these dark mental problems, why can\u2019t he just be a happy slut?\nThe Internet is more fertile ground, it\u2019d seem, for representation of gay characters \u2014 particularly for young Adam Goldman, whose Web series \u201cThe Outs\u201d has become, in certain circles, one of the most talked-about works of art about a gay person of the past year."}
