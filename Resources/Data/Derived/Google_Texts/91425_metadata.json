How to build sea walls and draft drought rules for the looming catastrophe, and not appear to insult GOP stalwarts such as Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, who called global warming \u201cthe second largest hoax ever played on the American people\u201d?\n\nGovernments -- left-leaning or right -- are beginning to swap out thirsty civic plantings for water-saving ones, re-zone future development, cut back on heat-creating paving, and reclaim rainwater and gray water.\n\nAs the Associated Press points out, conservative strongholds are laying plans for what they\u2019ve taken to calling \u201csustainability\u201d and \u201cresilience\u201d without mentioning what\u2019s making it necessary. \u201cIn many city planning departments, it has become like Voldemort \u2026 It\u2019s the issue that cannot be named.\u201d\n\nA reliable wordsmith to conservatives, Frank Luntz, did come up with a counter-term to \u201cglobal warming.\u201d Luntz is the man who also crafted \u201cdeath tax\u201d for \u201cestate tax,\u201d which is levied on the comparatively few who die with more than $5 million. As Republicans intended, \u201cdeath tax\u201d sounded to voters like a penalty on every dead American, instead of the few one-percenters.\n\nLuntz came up with the more neutral term \u201cclimate change,\u201d but its elasticity ended up working to the Democrats\u2019 advantage, in much the same way that the jeer \u201cObamacare\u201d was embraced by the White House as a terrific brand.\n\nPoliticians can also thank the Pentagon for protective camouflage; it\u2019s taking the global consequences of climate change \u2013 refugees from rising oceans, wars over water and food \u2013 as serious threats to national security. If the Pentagon\u2019s doing it, how can anyone call us wimps for doing the same?\n\nYet in North Carolina, legislators dealt with threatened coastal damage by banning government agencies from using scientific tools that included climate change data. As a result of the law and adroit lobbying, the policy statement by the state\u2019s Coastal Commission deleted the projection of a 39-inch sea level rise within 90 years, and substituted a 30-year projection and eight-inch rise.\n\nAnd in Fayetteville, Ark., the city\u2019s \u201csustainability and resilience\u201d director helped to persuade a Republican-led legislature to approve tax-free bonds for water- and energy-saving projects. Yet according to a conspiracy theorist website, that man's work is really about promoting a United Nations-inspired conspiracy to deny Americans their rights.\n\nIncluding, maybe, the right to be drowned by that imaginary global warming.\n\nFollow Patt Morrison on Twitter @pattmlatimes", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Why is climate-change preparation like Lord Voldemort?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "\u201cGlobal warming\u201d is a phrase so identified with Democrats and Al Gore that now that the reality is upon us, it\u2019s not only creating extreme weather, but a dilemma for conservatives:", "title": "Why is climate-change preparation like Lord Voldemort?", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-ol-climate-change-preparation-voldemort-20140915-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5417403f/turbine/la-ol-climate-change-preparation-voldemort-20140915", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "climate change, global warming, voldemort, republican, democrat", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81374837", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-15", "Description": "\u201cGlobal warming\u201d is a phrase so identified with Democrats and Al Gore that now that the reality is upon us, it\u2019s not only creating extreme weather, but a dilemma for conservatives:   What should they call this phenomenon without sounding like they\u2019ve caved in to liberal ideas?
