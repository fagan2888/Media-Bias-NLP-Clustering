It was about Oliver North\u2019s 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb, a Democrat from Virginia. Despite the title, North turned out to be less than perfect; he lost to a scandal-wounded but resilient Robb despite a Republican tidal wave.\n\nThere will never be a perfect candidate, unless brilliant genetic engineers assisted by Watson the computer decide to undertake the task in the distant future. Until then, parties are left with flawed human beings, those bundles of virtues and vices that get proctoscopic treatment during long campaigns.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs long as she runs, Hillary Clinton appears to check most of the boxes that Democratic activists require, and one of her advantages is that her strengths and weaknesses are unusually well known. It\u2019s hard to believe that voters will learn anything big about Hillary in 2016 that they don\u2019t already know or suspect.\n\nNot so for the potential nominees of the Grand Old Party. Republicans lack not only a frontrunner but also politicians who could thread every needle thrust forward by the party\u2019s interest groups while still remaining electable in November.\n\nFor a moment, though, let\u2019s drop the naysaying. Suppose the Republicans could construct an ideal contender for 2016\u2014someone who could actually win without repealing the essential components of the GOP platform. What would the candidate look like?\n\nPOLITICO cartoonist Matt Wuerker, with some brainstorming (but not artistic) help from myself and the U.Va. Center for Politics\u2019 Crystal Ball team, has cleverly assembled some of the possible \u201cbody parts\u201d for the ideal Republican competitor. You can be the judge, but the internal contradictions of ideology and personality would likely rip apart this friendly Frankenstein fairly quickly. No party can have everything, a White House nominee cannot be all things to all people and choices must be made.\n\nThe Republican eventually crowned in Cleveland is bound to be pro-free markets, pro-life on abortion and critical of Obamacare, high taxes, big spending and massive debt, to mention just a handful of issues. Political parties, with a few historical exceptions (such as William Jennings Bryan in 1896 and George McGovern in 1972 for the Democrats and Barry Goldwater in 1964 for the Republicans), prefer evolution to revolution.\n\nYet even some hidebound conservative Republicans understand that their party needs to change or else conceivably go the way of the Whigs. Losing 80 percent of the nonwhite vote, at least 60 percent of young people, and around two-thirds of single women, as the GOP White House nominee now does normally, appears to be a formula for consistent defeat, especially when demographic changes favor disproportionate growth in most of the voter categories where Republicans have the least appeal. So is there a reasonable evolutionary path for the GOP that could produce a Cleveland Concordat\u2014a platform with sufficient red meat to turn out hungry conservatives but enough tasty fruit, vegetables and dessert for persuadable moderates?\n\nYou know the next line: It won\u2019t be easy. Conservatives will insist that no real change is needed since a hard-right nominee will generate record turnout among the true-believing base (as though the same nominee won\u2019t generate high turnout among the Democratic faithful who fear the hard right). Other Republicans will say a congenial Reaganesque nominee is all that\u2019s required to charm voters into amnesia about the party\u2019s rough edges. Maybe, but there\u2019s really been no Reagan since Reagan.\n\nEven assuming the GOP nominee will have the requisite charisma, surely the party would have to present a somewhat different face. So what would a Republican winner have to say and do? Here\u2019s a partial menu from which to pick and choose.\n\nAct on changing demographics: Republican leaders have been urging this since the party\u2019s \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project\u201d report from March 2013. Without a reasonable immigration plan to run on, the nominee will have a hard time improving much on Mitt Romney\u2019s awful 2012 percentages among Hispanics (27 percent) and Asian-Americans (26 percent). Substance matters more than image, but diversifying the GOP ticket can\u2019t hurt. The era of two white males per ticket ended with Romney-Ryan. Assuming Republicans have something to sell to minorities\u2014not just symbolic identity politics but issue positions that appeal to targeted groups\u2014the ticket must campaign aggressively in those communities. Otherwise, key states that used to be solid pieces of winning GOP electoral maps\u2014such as Colorado and Florida\u2014become harder to win.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "What would the ideal candidate\u2014someone who could actually win without repealing the platform\u2019s essential components\u2014look like?", "title": "Does the GOP Need a FrankenCandidate?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/does-the-gop-need-a-frankencandidate-108878.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/14/140714_wuerker3.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Gay Marriage,2016 Elections,Immigration,Republican Party,Politics,Rand Paul,Rick Perry", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "What would the ideal candidate\u2014someone who could actually win without repealing the platform\u2019s essential components\u2014look like?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce178\"", "article_summary": "Substance matters more than image, but diversifying the GOP ticket can\u2019t hurt.\nEven assuming the GOP nominee will have the requisite charisma, surely the party would have to present a somewhat different face.\nOtherwise, key states that used to be solid pieces of winning GOP electoral maps\u2014such as Colorado and Florida\u2014become harder to win.\nSuppose the Republicans could construct an ideal contender for 2016\u2014someone who could actually win without repealing the essential components of the GOP platform.\nNo party can have everything, a White House nominee cannot be all things to all people and choices must be made."}
