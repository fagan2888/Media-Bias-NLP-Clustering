For our accounting students, this is a great opportunity to get some \u201chands-on\u201d experience working with clients and filing taxes.\n\nIt seems as if there are tax code changes every year. This year, there are changes to the tax penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act, adjustments to tax brackets for inflation, increases in standard deductions and personal exemptions, and more. Students who are filing their taxes for the first time and experienced tax filers sometimes need a little guidance to complete this process in a timely and accurate manner.\n\nIn an effort to help anyone who needs assistance, aspiring accountants from Husson University\u2019s College of Business are donating their time to help others file the appropriate state and federal tax forms by this year\u2019s deadline. Individuals must have an income of less than $62,000 per year to quality for this free service.\n\nThe IRS Taxpayer Assistance Program is open to any local area resident or Husson University student who needs some help with their tax form preparation. Individuals interested in participating in this program are encouraged to bring any receipts, W-2s and other documents that might be needed for filing their returns to the Husson accounting students at the Richard E. Dyke Center for Family Business on the University\u2019s Bangor campus. No appointment is necessary.\n\n\u201cThis service benefits both our students and the individuals they assist,\u201d said Dewey Martin, CPA, director of the School of Accounting at Husson University. \u201cFor our accounting students, this is a great opportunity to get some \u201chands-on\u201d experience working with clients and filing taxes. In addition, members of the community and the first-time filers who may be concerned about the process, receive coaching from well-prepared students on filling out their tax forms correctly. Everyone wins.\u201d\n\nThe IRS Taxpayer Assistance Program is open five days a week between now and April 15.\n\n\n\nMonday: 9:00 a.m. \u2013 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday: 12:15 p.m. \u2013 3:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday: 9:00 a.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m.\n\nThursday: 12:15 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m.\n\nFriday: 9:00 a.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m.\n\nStudents and members of the community interested in learning more about this service should contact Shannon Graves at gravess(at)husson(dot)edu.\n\nFor more than 100 years, Husson University has prepared future leaders to handle the challenges of tomorrow through innovative undergraduate and graduate degrees.
