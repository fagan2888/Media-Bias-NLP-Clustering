I was healthy, I was in love, and at 29, I was seemingly the youngest pregnant person in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling this will be very easy for you,\u201d my doctor confessed as my due date approached. \u201cIn my experience, women with freckles rarely have complications.\u201d\n\nBut a few days after I delivered a healthy baby boy, there was a problem. Between every breast-feeding session I was rushing to the bathroom. I had expected all sorts of postpartum aches and pains, but diarrhea?\n\nWithin two weeks, I weighed less than I had pre-pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t keep anything in my stomach for longer than a few minutes. My world shrank to the size of my bed and my bathroom: all day I alternated between caring for my baby and caring for myself. I was exhausted, in pain and afraid.\n\nAbove all, I was humiliated. I was the type of Kate-Middleton-worshipping girl who used the word \u201crestroom.\u201d My colleagues had recently thrown me a baby shower and gifted me \u201cBoudreaux\u2019s Butt Paste\u201d just to hear me say the name. I had been raised by a Southern mother who taught me to cross my legs at the ankle and \u201cnot chase boys\u201d\u2014but even she thought my modesty went too far when I asked her to leave the dressing room while we shopped for my wedding dress. There was no logical reason for my shyness about my body. My bachelorette weekend devolved into a therapy session on sharing a bathroom with a boy. \u201cHe\u2019ll be your husband!\u201d the girls shrieked over champagne.\n\nNow here I was, trapped with that boy in a tiny New York apartment, living my worst nightmare. There was no hiding my humanity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten your figure back,\u201d Eric offered lovingly, but I could tell he was worried.\n\nA gastroenterologist on the Upper East Side explained that the antibiotics I received during delivery had killed bad bacteria, but also all of the healthy bacteria that I relied upon to digest properly.\n\n\u201cTry eating Activia,\u201d she suggested.\n\nI ate gallons of yogurt with no results. The plastic cartons piled up on my kitchen counter next to the menacing breast pump equipment. I pushed my way into other doctors\u2019 offices, and to my great horror, tested positive for something called Clostridium difficile.\n\nThe doctor looked at me apologetically and said that it was true: antibiotics had killed off all of my friendly \u201cgut flora\u201d\u2014something I had never even considered\u2014and \u201cbad guys\u201d had taken over. On the ride home, I looked up C. diff and WebMD assured me that this was no regular case of \u201cD.\u201d I was captive to the king of bacterial infections, which kills more than 14,000 people per year.\n\nMedication kept my symptoms at bay for a few weeks, but the C. diff came raging back and I was rushed to the emergency room. \u201cThe bacteria is getting smarter and more resistant,\u201d the doctor said. He wrote me a different prescription, with no promises.\n\n\u201cI love you, Duchess of Diff,\u201d my husband said, wrapping me up in the warm hospital blankets.\n\nIf I was an aspiring Kate Middleton, delighting in the storm of teacups and thank-you notes that our wedding precipitated, my husband was a double for Mitt Romney. A string-bean financier with a 4.0 GPA, he approached everything in his life with precision.\n\nBut whatever calculations had gone into the match of a priss and a perfectionist were now deconstructed. My moment with seduction\u2014at least the physical kind\u2014was long gone. The only thing that could take its place, I dared to hope as I looked in the mirror and saw dark under-eye circles and baby spit-up in my hair\u2014would be a kind of emotional seduction. The spell of two people cocooned in a never-before and never-again situation.\n\nI smiled at him, knowing how terrible I looked in the hospital bed, and realized that he was the person I wanted closest to me\u2014no matter what.\n\n\u201cC. diff?\u201d a nurse who was refilling my IV asked, and shuddered. \u201cI used to work for a doctor who fixed that stuff with stool transplants. That\u2019s just a fancy way of saying he puts someone else\u2019s poop in your colon to restore the good bacteria. He\u2019s kind of a nutty professor, but it works like 95 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nHorrified, I clutched my prescription for the next drug and whispered to my husband to pull the car around.\n\nThe days after that I felt optimistic. The new drug seemed to be working. I identified the neighborhood coffee shops with no front steps, and pushed the stroller confidently in their direction. There was a bakery that made cupcakes in the shape of hydrangeas; the baby watched while I photographed and devoured them.\n\nBut within hours of finishing the medication, fever struck and my insides ached.\n\nThis third bout with C. diff replaced my embarrassment with ice-cold fear. If this disease was stronger than drugs, would I have it forever? Worse yet, would it kill me? I thought of the baby and his chubby cheeks that looked full of acorns. I thought of the years ahead of him and my throat constricted. Taking four pills a day could keep the symptoms at bay, but C. diff still owned me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On my wedding day, I was nervous about sharing a bathroom with a boy.
