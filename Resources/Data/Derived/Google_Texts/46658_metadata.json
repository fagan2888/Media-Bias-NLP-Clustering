Shares of Humana surged to an all-time high on Friday, while the shares of rivals like Aetna and Cigna also rose sharply.\n\nUnderpinning the expectations of an increase in deal-making among insurers are two contrasting themes. Revenues have been on the rise, bolstered both by the federal health law\u2019s requirement that individuals have health insurance and by rising enrollment in Medicare plans offered by private companies. But profit margins are being squeezed through continued declines in Medicare Advantage funding and increased transparency for consumers shopping for policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBecause of the Affordable Care Act, the whole insurance market is shifting towards a lower margin model,\u201d said Chris Rigg, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cGenerally speaking, the bigger you are, the better.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had been expecting a wave of industry mergers to begin sooner rather than later. The last wave occurred in 2011 and 2012, when Cigna acquired HealthSpring for $3.8 billion; and Aetna bought Coventry Health Care in a deal valued at $5.7 billion.\n\nBased in Louisville, Ky., Humana is one of the smaller of the big five insurers by market capitalization. And it has struggled to meet analysts\u2019 profit expectations for much of the past year, though its membership rolls and revenue rose in the first quarter.\n\nBut it is considered a particularly ripe prize because it gets the bulk of its revenues from its Medicare Advantage business, which has been growing rapidly as baby boomers age and choose to enroll in a plan operated by private companies rather than the traditional version of the federal program.\n\nPhoto\n\nUnitedHealth is the largest purveyor of Medicare Advantage plans, with Humana a close second. That has led analysts to discount UnitedHealth as a potential buyer, since the size of the companies\u2019 combined Medicare Advantage business could raise the ire of antitrust regulators.\n\nAnalysts and investors have instead focused on peers like Aetna, Cigna and Anthem, which generally have smaller Medicare Advantage operations, as potential suitors.\n\nSome of those companies were among those that had expressed interest in Humana, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nAny deal for Humana would be expensive: The insurer had a market value of about $27 billion before The Wall Street Journal reported on the company\u2019s deliberations. Humana\u2019s shares jumped 20 percent, closing on Friday at $214.65.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther rivals are of similar size. Cigna had a market capitalization of about $35 billion as of Friday\u2019s market close, while Aetna is valued at about $40 billion and Anthem at $43 billion.\n\nThe potential suitors, whether Aetna, Anthem or another company, are well aware that much of the organic growth opportunity that exists for health insurers today can be found in Medicare Advantage, said Todd Van Tol, a partner in the health and life sciences practice at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cThese programs now have enough critical momentum to be politically protected, viable and stable, and Humana has proven to be exceptionally good at the program,\u201d Mr. Van Tol said.\n\nWhile analysts like Ana Gupte at the research firm Leerink Partners predict the five largest companies in health insurance could merge to become the three biggest, she and others think that any deal could also usher in a second wave of deals involving smaller companies.\n\nAmong the most likely targets in that category are companies that specialize in offering coverage in the public Medicaid programs, including Centene, WellCare and Molina Healthcare.\n\nThose companies have also been active in offering plans for individuals now buying coverage through the exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe potential for increased profitability in a merger would come through consolidating and streamlining back office operations, including claims processing and call centers, analysts say.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150529154440, "twitter": {"description": "After approaches, the giant health
