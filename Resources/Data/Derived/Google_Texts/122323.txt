So, Uber pays its drivers better than the Sunshine Cab Co. Now what?

Uber cabbies, a new study finds, make more than professional cabbies, on average about $6 an hour more. It’s an insight into how the controversial startup operates, but it isn’t likely to quell the furor that accompanies this noisy upstart.

“How much they made was always up for discussion,” MarketWatch’s Caitlin Huston said this morning on the MoneyBeat show. “This company isn’t very transparent with what they’re telling you. So this was big news in that they were giving you this study.”

However, the study isn’t necessarily definitive. It doesn’t, for instance, account for the expenses Uber drivers have in their vehicle upkeep. Moreover, she said, it isn’t likely to blunt any of the other issues facing the company, including surge pricing, criticisms of its policies, and allegations it sabotaged its competitors.

“But it does paint a nice picture for the company and for its drivers,” she said.
