Ever think about all the constructive activities you could be performing while your time is wasting away in your doctor’s office waiting room? Especially when you’re going in for a simple consultation that may end up costing you more than you bargained for. A new iPhone app that launched on Friday aims to cut down the amount of time you spend waiting to see your dermatologist while still providing you with an accurate diagnosis regarding your acne.

Spruce provides its users with a personalized treatment plan from a dermatologist in your state as well as a prescription that is filled digitally with your pharmacy without leaving your house. All you have to do to create an account is take a few selfies (you probably do this part already) and answer questions about your skin while adding any questions of your own. If users are dissatisfied with their “visit,” Spruce also provides a messaging link between patients and a “care coordinator” who can answer any questions they may have.

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 million and 50 million in America are affected by acne, making it the most common skin disorder in the United States. Over 40 percent of adolescents suffer from acne or acne scarring by their mid-teens when treatment by a dermatologist is required. In 2009, around 34 million people, more than half of which were between the ages of 25 and 64, visited nonfederally employed, office-based dermatologists in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
