During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body goes from an autonomous form to an incubator for a new life, tasked with growing, feeding and eventually birthing a baby.\n\nWith so much going on biologically during that nine-month span, it is common for those expectant mothers to have several questions before, during and after pregnancy.\n\nDr. Kristina Mixer of Spectrum Health Obstetrics and Gynecology in Greenville answers a few important questions many expecting mothers may have and should ask their doctors:\n\n1) What over-the-counter medications are safe?\n\nWomen often have a need for non-prescription medication during their pregnancy. Your provider typically will provide you with a list of recommended over-the-counter medications safe to take in pregnancy. While all medications have some risks, those typically recommended include:\n\n\u2022 Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for headache, pain and fever\n\n\u2022 Vitamin B6 and doxylamine (Unisom) for nausea and vomiting\n\n\u2022 Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for cold symptoms and nausea\n\n\u2022 Fiber supplement for constipation\n\n\u2022 Saline nasal spray for allergic rhinitis\n\n2) What does it mean if I am cramping or bleeding in the first trimester?\n\nIn the first trimester, it is not uncommon to experience some cramping and/or bleeding or \u201cspotting.\u201d As a normal pregnancy implants and begins to grow inside the uterus, a patient may experience occasional cramping and light spotting. Persistent cramping and/or bleeding can be a more concerning sign of one of the following:\n\n\u2022 Possible miscarriage\n\n\u2022 Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterine cavity) or other abnormal pregnancy (Molar pregnancy)\n\n\u2022 Infection \u2014 vaginal or uterine\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent cramping and/or bleeding you should contact your provider.\n\n3) How much weight should I gain in pregnancy and what exercise is safe?\n\nWeight gain in pregnancy is typically modified to your pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by weight and height. General BMI are:\n\n\u2022 For underweight women (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), weight gain would be between 28 to 40 pounds\n\n\u2022 For women in the normal weight range (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), 25 to 35 pounds\n\n\u2022 For overweight women (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), 15 to 25 pounds\n\n\u2022 For obese women (BMI \u226530.0 kg/m2), 11 to 20 pounds\n\nFor exercise, a wide range of recreational activities are safe in pregnancy, including walking, swimming, yoga and strength training with some modifications to avoid abdominal trauma and prolonged periods of time in the supine position (especially in the second half of pregnancy). Additionally, pregnant women are advised to avoid exercises that are likely to lead to dehydration and overheating.\n\n4) What vaccinations are recommended during pregnancy?\n\nOnly two vaccines are currently recommended for routine use during pregnancy. They include:\n\n\u2022 Primary or booster doses of adult type tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap).\n\n\u2022 Inactivated influenza vaccine (seasonal and H1N1)\n\n5) How long can I work when I\u2019m pregnant?\n\nDepending on your job, you will probably be able to work up until you deliver. It is important, however, to discuss any physical or emotional stressors you are experiencing at work with your provider throughout the pregnancy. You should also discuss any maternity leave requirements with your employer. Oftentimes, your employer will require forms to be filled out by you and your provider. These forms may take a few business days to be completed by your provider\u2019s office therefore you should plan accordingly.\n\n6) Do I need a birth plan?\n\nA birth plan is not required but many women choose to make one in an effort to familiarize themselves with the labor and delivery process and provide a comprehensive list of personal preferences during that process. Reviewing your birth plan with your provider prior to labor will provide an opportunity to discuss expectations and review concerns you and your provider may have regarding your labor and delivery experience.\n\n7) What happens during a typical labor and delivery?\n\nThis will depend on your provider and the facility where you choose to deliver. Typically, during labor and delivery, you will have your blood drawn and an IV placed. There will be monitoring of your baby and your uterine activity with two monitors placed on your belly with soft straps. The nurse or provider will perform cervical exams intermittently to assess cervical dilation and effacement. Interventions for your well-being and the baby\u2019s well-being may be recommended throughout the labor and delivery and should be explained to you as those situations arise. Pain management options will be reviewed with you throughout the various stages of labor. Recommendation for cesarean delivery can be made at any time during labor or delivery, even after pushing for some time. The entire experience will depend on a number of factors, some of which cannot be predicted. Your provider will do their best to keep you apprised of concerns as they arise and include you in any treatment decisions as they see fit. Another important question to ask you provider prior to labor is who you can expect to be your delivering provider.\n\n8) What are my risk factors for a Cesarean delivery?\n\nThis is obviously going to be different for every person. Common risk factors for Cesarean section include:\n\n\u2022 Maternal obesity\n\n\u2022 Gestational diabetes\n\n\u2022 Suspected macrosomia (larger than average baby)\n\n\u2022 Nulliparity (a mom who has never delivered a baby before)\n\n\u2022 Post-term pregnancy (going past your due date)\n\n\u2022 Previous cesarean delivery\n\n\u2022 Increasing maternal age (especially > 35 years old\n\nIt is important to review your personal risks with your provider prior to labor.\n\n9) What support is available for breastfeeding mothers?\n\nThis is a very important question for all women who are considering breastfeeding to ask their provider prior to delivery. There are a number of practices in place to encourage and support breastfeeding moms and babies. Skin-to-skin contact immediately after delivery, rooming in with baby 24 hours a day and avoiding any pacifiers or artificial nipples has been shown to improve breastfeeding success. Discuss with your provider what access you have to lactation consultants and other support services, both during your hospital stay and after you go home.\n\nDr. Mixer, of Rockford, specializes in minimally invasive surgery, infertility and contraception and has been with Spectrum Health in Greenville since 2010.
