Both trade groups have expressed opposition to reclassifying the Internet in order to enforce stronger net neutrality rules.\n\nNicol Turner-Lee, vice president of Minority Media & Telecom Council, will also testify. Her organization has previously argued against reclassification under Title II of the Communications Act.\n\nPaul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy, is also slated to attend.\n\nAmazon is a member of The Internet Association, which has previously applauded President Obama's and other advocates\u2019 calls for reclassification.\n\nOn Thursday, the group said it would continue to push the FCC to act. But it said legislation or FCC action \"is not a binary choice.\"\n\nEtsy chief executive Chad Dickerson will also testify. His company is also a member of The Internet Association, and he previously wrote an op-ed calling for stronger rules to make sure Internet service providers cannot block or slow traffic, or create \u201cfast lanes\u201d to certain websites.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Officials from the cable and wireless industry made the witness list for the House hearing.", "description": "Officials from the cable and wireless industry made the witness list for the House hearing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Officials from the cable and wireless industry made the witness list for the House hearing.", "title": "Amazon, Etsy officials to testify on open Internet", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/229739-amazon-etsy-officials-to-testify-on-open-internet", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/229739-amazon-etsy-officials-to-testify-on-open-internet", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-16T09:19-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-16T09:19:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Net neturality, Hearing,,Etsy, Amazon, CTIA-The Wireless Association, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, Minority Media & Telecom Council", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/229739-amazon-etsy-officials-to-testify-on-open-internet", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Officials from the cable and wireless industry made the witness list for the House hearing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Amazon, Etsy officials to testify on open Internet"}, "dcterms.title": "Amazon, Etsy officials to testify on open Internet"}, "article_summary": "Amazon is a member of The Internet Association, which has previously applauded President Obama's and other advocates\u2019 calls for reclassification.\nEtsy chief executive Chad Dickerson will also testify.\nNicol Turner-Lee, vice president of Minority Media & Telecom Council, will also testify.\nPaul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy, is also slated to attend.\nHis company is also a member of The Internet Association, and he previously wrote an op-ed calling for stronger rules to make sure Internet service providers cannot block or slow traffic, or create \u201cfast lanes\u201d to certain websites."}
