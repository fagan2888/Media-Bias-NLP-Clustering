Paul LePage said in his State of the State address last week. \u201cIt\u2019s tearing at the social fabric of our communities. \u2026 We are losing the war on drugs.\u201d\n\nJust a month earlier, Vermont Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin notably dedicated nearly his entire speech to \u201ca crisis bubbling just beneath the surface\u201d - the rising problem of heroin and painkiller abuse in his state. And on Thursday, New Hampshire Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan noted the growing drug problem in her State of the State address. But while Shumlin and Hassan see improving treatment and halting addiction before it begins as the way forward, LePage offered a different strategy for combating drug abuse by ramping up law enforcement efforts to \u201chunt down dealers and get them off the streets.\u201d\n\nLePage wants to add 14 new drug enforcement agents to the 32 already working as well as four drug prosecutors and four judges for special drug courts - a roughly $3 million proposal his administration says aims to cut off the problem at the source: the dealers.\n\nIn Maine, the number of babies born affected by drugs skyrocketed to more than 900 last year, or about 7 percent of all births, LePage said, up from roughly 160 in 2005. Meanwhile, 28 people died from heroin overdoses in 2012, four times as many as the year before, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAcross the rest of northern New England, the statistics are just as sobering.\n\nIn New Hampshire in 2009, the last year for which health officials have statistics, the rate of babies born affected by drugs was 8.7 per 1,000 births, above the U.S. rate of 3.6 per 1,000. Officials expect the rate has continued to climb and note that maternal drug use has increased \u201csignificantly\u201d in the past decade.\n\nLaw enforcement in New Hampshire say the state is in the midst of a heroin \u201cepidemic.\u201d At least 61 people died of heroin overdoses in New Hampshire in 2013, compared with 38 the previous year, according to Kim Fallon, chief forensic investigator for the state medical examiner.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire has among the highest rates in the country of drug and alcohol abuse and dependence but ranks at the bottom in accessing treatment,\u201d Hassan said in her State of the State address. \u201cWe must focus on improving access to treatment for all substances, especially among our young people.\u201d\n\nIn neighboring Vermont, the number of heroin overdose deaths last year doubled from nine to 17. The number of babies treated for opiate withdrawal syndrome at Vermont hospitals has increased tenfold since 2002, according to the state health department.\n\nShumlin wants to boost funding to slash waiting lists for drug treatment programs, create a system that would allow some addicts to be sent for treatment immediately after their first contact with law enforcement and implement tougher sentences for drug traffickers and addicts who commit violent crimes while seeking money for drugs.\n\n\u201cNone of us have the silver bullet to know how best to deal with this crisis,\u201d Shumlin told The Associated Press last week. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that we\u2019ve been trying the singular path of law enforcement for decades and we\u2019ve been losing the battle. So what we\u2019re trying to do in Vermont is find a new way of dealing with a crisis and a battle that we\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\nHighlighted by the recent death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, officials nationwide say heroin has become the cheap alternative for addicts after successful crackdowns on prescription painkiller abuse. The number of recorded heroin overdose deaths in the U.S. increased from 1,842 in 2000 to 3,036 in 2010, according to the most recent statistics available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They remain a small percentage of total drug overdose deaths.\n\nMaine\u2019s Democratic lawmakers and advocates say LePage\u2019s focus on enforcement will take the state down a path that has already failed, while the rest of the country moves toward a health-based approach of increasing diversion programs and education opportunities for people with drug-addiction problems.\n\n\u201cThis is just a continuation of the tough-on-crime rhetoric that we have been seeing and hearing for 40 years,\u201d said Rachel Healy, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. \u201cAt first glance, that may seem like the best approach. But in reality we know now that doesn\u2019t work and that it\u2019s time to explore other options and to put our limited resources into programs we know do work.\u201d\n\nLePage\u2019s administration says it has drug treatment programs in place for Maine residents to utilize and is willing to listen to all ideas to continue combating the drug problem. But with limited resources, there is only so much that the state can do right now, LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to tackle the problem, and it\u2019s going to take time to make a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to start somewhere.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Beth Garbitelli in Montpelier, Vt., and Lynne Touhy in Concord, N.H., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aedurkin", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the rural towns and cities of northern New England, a rising drug-abuse problem is overwhelming law enforcement, affecting hundreds of infants each year and sparking calls to action by state leaders who say enough is enough.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/9/northern-new-england-tackles-growing-drug-problem/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In the rural towns and cities of northern New England, a rising drug-abuse problem is overwhelming law enforcement, affecting hundreds of infants each year and sparking calls to action by state leaders who say enough is enough.", "title": "Northern New England tackles growing drug problem"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "In the rural towns and cities of northern New England, a rising drug-abuse problem is overwhelming law enforcement, affecting hundreds of infants each year and sparking calls to action by state leader", "card": "summary", "title": "Northern New England tackles growing drug problem"}, "Author": "ALANNA DURKIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Lepage, Peter Shumlin, Paul Lepage, Margaret Wood Hassan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4ee\"", "article_summary": "Maggie Hassan noted the growing drug problem in her State of the State address.\n\u201cThere are many ways to tackle the problem, and it\u2019s going to take time to make a difference,\u201d she said.\nOfficials expect the rate has continued to climb and note that maternal drug use has increased \u201csignificantly\u201d in the past decade.\nPeter Shumlin notably dedicated nearly his entire speech to \u201ca crisis bubbling just beneath the surface\u201d - the rising problem of heroin and painkiller abuse in his state.\nAcross the rest of northern New England, the statistics are just as sobering."}
