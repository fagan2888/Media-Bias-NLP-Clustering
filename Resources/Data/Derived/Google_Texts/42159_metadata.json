Furious, he ordered the therapist out and complained to the agency that sent him. But older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, including those among the first to come out as a political and social force, are increasingly apprehensive about encountering discrimination as they grow older and more dependent on strangers for care.\n\nAn estimated 2 million Americans 50 or older identify as LGBT, with that number expected to double by 2030, according to the Institute for Multigenerational Health at the University of Washington. About 15,000 are estimated to live in the Washington metropolitan region.\n\nThose over 65 grew up in what their younger counterparts now see as a dark age, when doctors viewed homosexuality as a disorder and gay men and lesbians were sometimes committed to psychiatric wards.\n\n\u201cThey came of age and lived through an era when it was particularly dangerous to be out,\u201d said Susan Sommer, senior counsel and director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, an LGBT advocacy group. \u201cThey risked losing employment, losing family, losing friends, and even violence. They became habituated to a closeted existence.\u201d\n\nThose in their 50s came of age during a more tolerant time. Nevertheless, anti-LGBT attitudes are still common among people over 50, with just 50 percent of baby boomers and 47 percent of the Silent Generation saying they think homosexuality should be accepted by society, according to two Pew Research Center polls conducted this year. Among Generation X, the number was 63 percent, and among millennials it was 71 percent.\n\nSince 2010, federal law has mandated such rights as hospital visitation for same-sex partners. But as they get older, many feel less comfortable standing up for themselves, particularly if they are not wealthy, and they are increasingly vulnerable to being pushed back into the closet, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting public assistance, you often have very little say on who\u2019s assigned to you,\u201d said Wendy Lustbader, a University of Washington professor of social work who specializes in aging. \u201cMany people actually accept various kinds of abuse from health-care workers because they are dependent on their care.\u201d\n\nA 2011 survey by six LGBT and older adult advocacy groups found that just 22 percent of LGBT aging adults said they felt it was all right to be open about their sexual identity in a nursing home or assisted-living facility. Fear of discrimination from other residents was almost as high as fear of discrimination from staff, the survey found, and 43 percent said they had experienced mistreatment at facilities.\n\nOlder LGBT people are four times less likely to have children and grandchildren and twice as likely to live alone as their straight counterparts, according to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.\n\nMany became estranged from their families when they came out, and many also saw their social support systems decimated by the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\u201cI lost 100 friends, and after 100, I stopped counting,\u201d said Wes Morrison, 66, a District resident. \u201cSo all the people that I would have relied on, people that would have been friends that I had known for years and years and years, are all gone.\u201d\n\nThe more isolated LGBT people are, the more likely they are to return to the closet, advocates say, especially if they are middle- or low-income. Many of the LGBT retirement communities popping up across the country are high-end, some with move-in fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. But LGBT people earn less than their straight counterparts, and many must look for general-population facilities where they will feel comfortable.\n\nIt is not an easy prospect. \u201cThe existing senior housing that\u2019s out there has not been welcoming to the LGBT community,\u201d said Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, N.Y., adding that it can be risky for a facility to openly advertise itself as gay-friendly. \u201cIf they put that in their marketing and bring in 10 or 12 people, is the rest of the world going to turn away? They might. . . . I think the Greatest Generation will have difficulty accepting\u201d openly gay-friendly facilities, he added.\n\nOne retired federal employee in Arlington County, who is 80 and has not come out, said he plans to move to a retirement community because he has no relatives. But he is apprehensive about how he would be received.\n\n\u201cWho would want me in there and not after a short time suspect that I was gay, and then bricks would start flying \u2014 you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\nHe said he plans to try living at a couple of facilities for a week at a time and discreetly talk to single men about what it is like to live there.\n\nAlthough there is no systematic rating of the gay-friendliness of the facilities, there are informal ways to assess them. \u201cThere are places we\u2019ve reached out to that say, \u2018Well, this doesn\u2019t pertain to us because we\u2019ve never, ever had an LGBT person here,\u2019 \u201d said David Mariner, director of the D.C. Center, an LGBT nonprofit community center. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just not true. . . . It means they\u2019re not comfortable being out.\u201d\n\nA facility can employ more subtle messages of openness \u2014 a brochure that includes a photo of two men or two women, a questionnaire that uses the word \u201cspouse\u201d instead of \u201chusband\u201d or \u201cwife,\u201d or the placement of advertisements in gay publications.\n\nAnd older LGBT people let each other know which facilities are open-minded.\n\n\u201cAt one facility around five years ago, somehow the kitchen staff got access to medical records of some of the folks that were in the program\u201d who were HIV positive, said Mariner, who declined to name the facility. \u201cThey were given separate plates and different utensils with their names on them. So they were kind of outed in front of the other seniors, both in terms of being gay and their HIV status.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are facilities such as the Residences at Thomas Circle in the District, which holds events with LGBT organizations. A group gathered there recently for a screening of \u201cGen Silent,\u201d a documentary about the difficulties of aging for LGBT people. Afterward, the audience sipped coffee and exchanged stories.\n\nMary Paradise, 61, who lives alone in Glover Park, talked about how she had cared for her mother, who had Alzheimer\u2019s, and had a realization. \u201cIt just occurred to me, \u2018Who\u2019s going to be here for me?\u2019 \u201d Her voice choked up. \u201cI don\u2019t have a daughter. I just felt lost.\u201d\n\nOne possible solution stood propped up on a nearby easel \u2014 an architectural plan for Mary\u2019s House for Older Adults, a residential facility that Imani Woody, head of the D.C. affiliate of Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE), hopes to build on land she inherited in the District\u2019s Fort Dupont neighborhood. The house, which would provide affordable communal living for eight older LGBT people, would have a therapeutic hot tub and a shared kitchen and would be the first of its kind in the metro region.\n\n\u201cYou can bring your whole self to the table,\u201d said Woody, who has applied for 501(c)(3) status and hopes to raise $800,000 to build the facility.\n\nFor District resident Cecelia Smith, 69, it can\u2019t come soon enough. \u201cMy heart just bleeds for people who all your life you have to fight tooth and nail for your rights and then when you get old you get treated shabbily by some people,\u201d said Smith, who attended gay rights marches four decades ago.\n\nReferring to Woody\u2019s plan, she said, \u201cGirl, you gotta build it, because I might need it! It\u2019s important that we have our own. . . . We ought to be able to die with dignity.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, experts say more education is needed for caregivers. \u201cWe have to ensure that people can provide competent care to LGBT older adults, so that they always feel safe to be who they are,\u201d said Karen Fredriksen-Goldsen, director of the Institute for Multigenerational Health, which has been funded by the National Institute on Aging to lead the first longitudinal study of LGBT health and aging. \u201cIt\u2019s important to create cultures that are inclusive.\u201d\n\nJones-Hennin guesses that the physical therapist who tried to drive out his demons had noticed images of male nudes and an LGBT banner on the walls of his home and had heard him and his partner call each other \u201cBaby.\u201d\n\nHe said the incident underscored the different forms that discrimination can take.\n\n\u201cIt can be a one-sentence comment, but that can trigger something, because you\u2019re not used to it coming from the medical profession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be strong enough to say, \u2018Stop. I don\u2019t need you praying for me.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As they age, lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people cite discrimination from caregivers", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tarabahrampour", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As they age, lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people cite discrimination from caregivers", "title": "Gay men, lesbians struggle to find caregivers and old-age facilities that don\u2019t discriminate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/gays-and-lesbians-struggle-to-find-caregivers-and-old-age-facilities-that-dont-discriminate/2013/10/05/22d57d0c-2b00-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/10/Local-Enterprise/Images/LBGTSENIORS%205501378848614.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TaraBahrampour"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "lgbt seniors, lgbt aging, lgbt elders, gay and lesbian seniors, gay and lesbian aging, gay and lesbian elders, Gen Silent, LGBT Aging Project, Pew Research Center", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tarabahrampour"}, "eomportal-uuid": "22d57d0c-2b00-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "lgbt seniors, lgbt aging, lgbt elders, gay and lesbian seniors, gay and lesbian aging, gay and lesbian elders, Gen Silent, LGBT Aging Project, Pew Research Center"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeca7\"", "article_summary": "And older LGBT people let each other know which facilities are open-minded.\nWe ought to be able to die with dignity.\u201dAt the same time, experts say more education is needed for caregivers.\nA group gathered there recently for a screening of \u201cGen Silent,\u201d a documentary about the difficulties of aging for LGBT people.\nBut LGBT people earn less than their straight counterparts, and many must look for general-population facilities where they will feel comfortable.\nAlthough there is no systematic rating of the gay-friendliness of the facilities, there are informal ways to assess them."}
