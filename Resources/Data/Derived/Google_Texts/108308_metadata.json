Rick Scott over changes to the popular merit-based scholarship program in the years since Scott took office, some of the key changes were put in place while Crist was in the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nSince fiscal 2010-11, the number of students receiving a Bright Futures scholarship has declined from 179,076 students in 2010-11 to 154,160 in fiscal 2013-14. That number is expected to continue to drop. The state estimates about 83,571 students will receive a Bright Futures scholarship in fiscal 2017-18.\n\nTroy Miller, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the Florida College Access Network, said the state made several changes through the years that led to the decrease in recipients and costs.\n\nAmong those changes were efforts to increase the SAT and ACT requirements to qualify and a legislative decision to pay a flat rate instead of 100 percent or 75 percent of tuition costs.\n\nEstablished in 1997, Bright Futures expanded an existing program for high-achieving high school students. The goal of the program was to help students who \u201cwould likely be successful in higher education,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cBright Futures was not established to keep the best and the brightest in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was to encourage that kid of mass point underneath the very best and the brightest.\u201d\n\nWhen it was established, the scholarship paid for either 100 percent or 75 percent of a student\u2019s tuition at state colleges or universities, depending on a student\u2019s grade point average and college entrance exam score.\n\nIn 2009, the state Legislature tossed out the 100 percent and 75 percent coverage in favor of flat rates. In fiscal 2014-15, a Florida Academic Scholar would be awarded $103 per credit hour at a state university for a four-year program; a Florida Medallion Scholar would receive $77 per credit hour.\n\nDuring the 2010 legislative session, credit hour award amounts were reduced in the state budget. That same year, lawmakers began increasing SAT/ACT test scores needed to qualify for the two college-bound scholarships \u2014 the Florida Academic Scholar and the Medallion Scholar programs.\n\n\u201cWe supported some cutbacks to Bright Futures at the time, when it was very clear the state had a budget gap,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt was very serious. There were cuts across all policy areas.\u201d\n\nCrist, the state\u2019s former Republican governor, served from 2007 until 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked he wants to bring it up because what he did is devastating,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe thing that should disappoint people is when Charlie took office, Bright Futures covered pretty much everything, but they don\u2019t cover his 15 percent (tuition) differential that he signed.\u201d\n\nAccording to the state Office of Student Financial Assistance, lawmakers signed off on changes to test score requirements during the 2011 legislative session.\n\nIn 1997-98, students needed to score a 970 on the SAT or a 20 on the ACT to qualify for Florida Medallion Scholars, the mid-level scholarship. By 2012-13, the required scores had increased to 980 on the SAT and 21 on the ACT.\n\nThis year a student must score an 1170 on the SAT and a 26 on the ACT to qualify for the Florida Medallion scholarship. By comparison, a Florida Academic Scholar recipient needs to score a 1290 on the SAT and a 29 on the ACT to qualify.\n\nLawmakers in 2011 also increased community service requirements for all award levels. While Florida Academic Scholars had previously been required to do community service, those students competing for the Florida Medallion scholarship did not.\n\nThat changed in 2011, according to the Office of Student Financial Assistance, when the Medallion Scholars were required to complete 75 hours of community service to be eligible for the program.\n\nLori Brooks, the coordinator of school counseling services for the Lee County School District, said fewer Lee County students have been getting the scholarship in the past few years. Brooks said she thinks part of the reason was because of the \u201cdrastic change in the program requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest changes has been what Rick Scott has done,\u201d Crist said. \u201cThe bottom line is, he\u2019s cut it in half. What matters to me is about 30,000 fewer students are going to have the opportunity (to go to college). It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\n\nCrist said he would work to restore the cuts to the Bright Futures program if elected. The program costs dropped from $429 million in 2008-09 to $306.9 million in 2013-14. That sum is expected to continue to decrease: the state estimates that the cost will drop to $180.4 million by 2017-18.\n\nScott said he\u2019s already making strides to make higher education more affordable. This year, Scott signed a measure that removed universities\u2019 ability to raise tuition above the amount set by the state Legislature. The bill also removed the provision that allows for automatic inflationary increases at postsecondary institutions.\n\nAnd while educators said they\u2019d like more students to take part in the Bright Futures program, some said they understand why the state has made getting a scholarship tougher.\n\n\u201cThere has been some discussion, and this is just in the community, that Bright Futures is trying to minimize the amount of money (spent) on students and the way to do that is to raise the bar,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cMy personal philosophy is that the standards with Bright Futures should be in alignment for college admission.\u201d\n\njmbuzzacco@naplesnews.com\n\n(239) 263-4805", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 01 Sep 2014 23:47:15 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The battle over Bright Futures has begun.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The battle over Bright Futures has begun.", "title": "Scott, Crist both face criticism for changes to Bright Futures program", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/scott-crist-both-face-criticism-for-changes-to-bright-futures-program-20140901/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-09-01T23:47:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Scott, Crist both face criticism for changes to Bright Futures program"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-01T23:47:15Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-01T23:47:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd255e\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201dCrist said he would work to restore the cuts to the Bright Futures program if elected.\n\u201cMy personal philosophy is that the standards with Bright Futures should be in alignment for college admission.\u201djmbuzzacco@naplesnews.com(239) 263-4805\nSince fiscal 2010-11, the number of students receiving a Bright Futures scholarship has declined from 179,076 students in 2010-11 to 154,160 in fiscal 2013-14.\nRick Scott over changes to the popular merit-based scholarship program in the years since Scott took office, some of the key changes were put in place while Crist was in the governor\u2019s mansion.\nThe state estimates about 83,571 students will receive a Bright Futures scholarship in fiscal 2017-18."}
