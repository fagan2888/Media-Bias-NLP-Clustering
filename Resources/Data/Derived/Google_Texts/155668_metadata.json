Casey Foundation, which tracks 16 indicators of child well-being that are used to rank the 50 states. Based on those indicators, New Mexico ranks 49th overall in child well-being.\n\nThe annual report is not all bad news for the Land of Enchantment, said Sharon Kayne, spokeswoman for New Mexico Voices for Children.\n\nThe rate of high school students not graduating on time went from 29 percent to 26 percent; the rate of children not having health insurance dropped from 9 percent to 7 percent; and the teen birthrate improved from 47 per 1,000 teens to 43 per 1,000 teens.\n\nDuring the 2008 recession, \u201cNew Mexico made some of the deepest cuts in the nation in K-12 per-pupil spending,\u201d according to the data book. That spending was increased in the 2015 legislative session, though still not enough to lift us above the \u201cpre-recession per-pupil spending levels when adjusted for inflation.\u201d Preschool enrollment for 3- and 4-year-olds declined drastically in 2010, and we\u2019re just now getting back to pre-recession levels, Kayne noted.\n\nThe improvement in the number of children with health insurance can be attributed to the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, while the lower rate of teen births is likely attributable to age-appropriate, comprehensive sex education in schools, starting in sixth grade, Kayne said.\n\nThose areas of improvement mimic national trends, she said.\n\nThe data book also looks at the role of race and ethnicity in child outcomes, and concludes that non-Hispanic white children have better outcomes than children of other races and ethnicities in all 16 indicators, Kayne said.\n\nIn New Mexico, \u201cchild poverty is the main issue, and it impacts all the other issues and has the biggest impact on child well-being,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to improve in child poverty until we help parents get ahead with programs to help improve their education, and until we support programs like child care assistance and paid sick leave.\u201d\n\nOther measures that would improve the lives of children and families include raising the minimum wage and bringing higher-paying jobs to New Mexico, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 New Mexico is now worst in the nation in the percentage of children living in poverty, according to ...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rick Nathanson | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/708288/nm-now-worst-for-child-poverty.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/plugins/journal-open-graph/img/albuquerque-journal.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "New Mexico is now worst in the nation in the percentage of children living in poverty, according to ...", "title": "NM now worst for child poverty"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In New Mexico, \u201cchild poverty is the main issue, and it impacts all the other issues and has the biggest impact on child well-being,\u201d she said.\nWhile the state\u2019s child poverty rate improved slightly from 31 percent to 30 percent, Mississippi\u2019s rate went from 34 percent to 29 percent, dislodging New Mexico from its 49th position among the 50 states.\nBased on those indicators, New Mexico ranks 49th overall in child well-being.\nThe Kids Count program is run by the Annie E.
