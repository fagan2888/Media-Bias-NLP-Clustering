Instead, we must have the freedom to choose what is best for our families and build on proven successes.\n\nAdvancing technology and innovation can reduce costs and increase efficiency but every individual must always own and control their personal medical information.\n\nStates should have maximum flexibility to design the programs that serve their citizens.\n\nEmployers and individuals purchasing health insurance must always be free to buy coverage and benefits consistent with their moral and religious beliefs.\n\nPhysicians are the backbone of our healthcare system and deserve to practice in an environment free of unnecessary, frivolous and costly lawsuits.\n\nAs The Daily Caller reported last week, Carson, who some conservatives are urging to run for president in 2016, is scheduled to meet with the lawmakers of the Congressional Health Caucus on Thursday to discuss health care.\n\nBut he isn\u2019t the only potential 2016 candidate offering a his own replacement plan. On Wednesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal unveiled a conservative health-care proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Plans to release full plan later this year", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson on Thursday released seven principles he says will guide him as he develops his own conservative alternative to Obamacare.
