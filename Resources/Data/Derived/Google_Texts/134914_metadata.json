Paul Ryan\u2019s memoir-cum-manifesto, \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d and there\u2019s explosive stuff that plainly had to be kept under wraps before Tuesday\u2019s launch. Are you sitting down? The Wisconsin Republican loves his home town of Janesville. He adores his wife, Janna. He thinks President Obama is leading the country in the wrong direction. And \u2014 spoiler alert \u2013 if Republicans can only recapture Ronald Reagan\u2019s sunny spirit and conservative ideals, American renewal is within reach.\n\nTruth is, a book like this tells us less about what Ryan thinks than what Ryan thinks about his audience \u2014 and how that shapes his almost certain quest for higher office. What do we learn? He\u2019s speaking exclusively to Republicans. His caricatures of \u201cliberal progressive\u201d thinking (a double slur, in Ryan\u2019s usage) are so larded with straw men I stopped keeping count. His ideas about economics are either deeply confused or deeply disingenuous. Yet Ryan\u2019s homage to his mentor Jack Kemp and his growing engagement with poor Americans suggests more than just a felt need for \u201ccompassionate\u201d cover in 2016. If Ryan can push his party to take upward mobility seriously \u2014 a big \u201cif,\u201d because it would mean rethinking tenets of his own plans that make the worst off worse off \u2014 it could help redeem his otherwise regressive policy reflexes.\n\nThe most disturbing part of Ryan\u2019s analysis is his attempt to paint the meltdown of 2008 as the climax of a morality play involving runaway spending. Forget reckless, overleveraged banks, housing hijinks and a shadowy derivatives market run amok; Ryan, the champion of small government, is the proverbial man with an anti-spending hammer who sees nails everywhere. As the economy collapsed, Ryan the fiscal scold seemed less focused on the human toll of vast joblessness than on the prospect that budget deficits would suddenly soar. If Ryan had been king when the bottom fell out, he\u2019d have been the second coming of Herbert Hoover \u2014 cutting spending and urging the Fed to sit on its hands in a \u201cvirtuous\u201d purge that would have guaranteed another Depression.\n\nRyan\u2019s re-telling of the Obamacare wars is just as morally and economically blind. You\u2019d think the Affordable Care Act was an attempt by \u201cliberal progressives\u201d to seize the commanding heights of the state for its own sake \u2014 rather than an adaptation of Mitt Romney\u2019s sensible approach to ending the shame of millions of uninsured who were subject to financial ruin from illness. Obamacare\u2019s roots in Romney\u2019s Massachusetts plan (and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s thinking) can never be underscored enough, no matter how hard Ryan and his ilk work to airbrush it from the picture.\n\nBut such bald revisionism (or honest confusion, take your pick) is just a warmup for Ryan\u2019s broader, fevered critique. Ryan asserts that Obama\u2019s policies \u201crepresent an ideological mission to reorder the human condition through state action,\u201d part of a liberal scheme in which \u201cgovernment defines success, strictly prescribes roles and outcomes, [and] tries to replace our civic institutions.\u201d The telling thing is that such rants, repeated like a tic throughout the book, never get specific. How could they, when Ryan would then have to explain how a modestly higher minimum wage or voluntarily adopted state math standards amount to some evil communist plot?\n\nAs I read I couldn\u2019t help wondering: Does anyone outside the echo chamber of the right believe this nonsense? Someone, please, pry the drooled-upon pages of Ayn Rand from author Ryan\u2019s sleeping grasp.\n\nYet for all his ideology, Ryan is spot-on about one big thing: the need to tackle the United States\u2019 out-of-control health-care costs. In my recent run for Congress in Los Angeles, I told startled Democrats that Ryan has this right: We can\u2019t go on spending twice as much per person on health care as every other advanced nation without better results. Is it really wise (or even politically smart) to trash Ryan for \u201csavaging\u201d Medicare by proposing to slow its growth, when we\u2019re already paying twice what other rich nations do to deliver quality care to seniors? Better to turn our guns on a medical-industrial complex that\u2019s diverting a trillion dollars a year from every other public and private purpose. If the left doesn\u2019t lead on reining in such excess, a decade from now we\u2019ll still have stagnant wages, and there won\u2019t be a public penny free to spend on a poor child.\n\nIt\u2019s the vital issue where Democrats ought to find common ground with Ryan. Unfortunately, the only thing as cartoonish as Ryan\u2019s lectures on liberals is the left\u2019s attack on Ryan for wanting to throw \u201cGranny\u201d off a cliff. Look for fresh protests at a Ryan book event near you.\n\nA man who goes out of his way to say he won\u2019t watch \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d because of Frank Underwood\u2019s adultery and who cheers when his 10-year-old daughter bags \u201ca really nice ten-point buck\u201d with the rifle he bought her isn\u2019t for everyone. But Paul Ryan isn\u2019t trying to be for everyone just yet. To get that chance, you have to be the GOP presidential nominee first. And if the Wisconsin Republican has read his readers right, Ryan\u2019s way forward points up.\n\nRead more from Matt Miller\u2019s archive or follow him on Twitter.\n\nMatt Miller is the host of the public radio week-in-review program \u201cLeft, Right & Center.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Matt Miller, Paul Ryan: the way forward, paul ryan memoir, review, obamacare, mitt romney,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His new memoir\u2019s bald revisionism speaks exclusively to Republicans.", "title": "Paul Ryan sings to the choir", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-paul-ryans-memoir-sings-to-the-choir/2014/08/19/8588af96-278a-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/RNC_Meeting-04043-3658.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-paul-ryans-memoir-sings-to-the-choir/2014/08/19/8588af96-278a-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Matt Miller, Paul Ryan: the way forward, paul ryan memoir, review, obamacare, mitt romney,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "8588af96-278a-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "His new memoir\u2019s bald revisionism speaks exclusively to Republicans."}, "article_summary": "Truth is, a book like this tells us less about what Ryan thinks than what Ryan thinks about his audience \u2014 and how that shapes his almost certain quest for higher office.\nAnd if the Wisconsin Republican has read his readers right, Ryan\u2019s way forward points up.\nHis caricatures of \u201cliberal progressive\u201d thinking (a double slur, in Ryan\u2019s usage) are so larded with straw men I stopped keeping count.\nBut such bald revisionism (or honest confusion, take your pick) is just a warmup for Ryan\u2019s broader, fevered critique.\nI signed a non-disclosure agreement to get an early copy of Rep.
