It is deep and authoritative, colored by the Southern drawl of a man born, raised, and still living in Mississippi. Thompson, whose words travel 6,500 miles from Sao Paulo, Brazil to reach my ear in Palo Alto, is frank. He casually throws around obscenities and offers interviewing tips mid-interview.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Thompson interrupts as I abruptly switch topics. \u201cCan I give you an interviewing tip? Ask the question you want to ask. You\u2019re listening to your inner polite person. Don\u2019t ever ever pull a punch.\u201d\n\nThis is Wright Thompson, a brutally honest 37-year-old journalist who holds himself accountable for every question he asks and every story he writes. An Emmy-award-winning senior writer at ESPN.com and ESPN the Magazine, Thompson says, while standing on a hotel balcony in Sao Paulo, that working for the largest sports media empire was never the plan.\n\n\u201cYou end up somewhere,\u201d he said, \u201cbased on tiny little connections that add up in a way you never could have seen.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s journey to become one of the most respected sports journalists in the business is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a family-instilled work ethic and curiosity in the human condition that made all those tiny connections happen.\n\nGrowing up in Clarksdale, Miss., on a family farm, Thompson always wanted to be a writer. At eight he created a newspaper called the TNT Times, writing stories on Ole Miss football games. \u201cMy mom still has all the issues,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIn the same stack there is the TNT Times and ESPN the Magazine.\u201d\n\nNot only did Thompson write, but he loved to read, sitting in his home \u2018library,\u2019 which was wall-to-wall books. At 16, Thompson was held out of school due to illness, and read every book in the house. \u201cIt was the most educational three weeks I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nOne book, \u201cNorth Toward Home,\u201d a memoir by Mississippi writer Willie Morris, was about the coming of age of a Southern boy who experiences cultural and political change on his way to becoming editor of Harper\u2019s Magazine. Thompson was inspired. Suddenly, being a writer felt reachable.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I could see a life with a narrative and a plan that was possible,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThompson pursued his dream at the University of Missouri. It was in this competitive environment as a beat reporter for the Missouri football team that the lessons his father, Walter Thompson, taught him, became a driving force in achieving his career aspirations.\n\n\u201c[My father] taught me diligent hard work,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt was how he lived.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Thompson was sent by his father, a lawyer and head of the family farm, to work on different farms in the area. Walter didn\u2019t want people treating his son differently because he was the boss\u2019s kid. \u201c[My father] worked very very hard to make sure that his success didn\u2019t damage us,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a reporter, Thompson relished the grind in a way few others did. But not everyone saw his drive as valuable.\n\nIn November 1999, Thompson\u2019s junior year of college, most journalism students had secured summer internships. After applying to every newspaper in the country, Thompson didn\u2019t receive a single offer. \u201cI could not convince a single person in American journalism to give me a shot,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNo one.\u201d\n\nIt was at Wildman\u2019s, a bar in Missouri, where this disappointment and emotion spilled over.\n\n\u201cWright didn\u2019t have an internship yet,\u201d recalled Seth Wickersham, Thompson\u2019s friend and colleague from Missouri, who now also writes for ESPN. \u201cHe was distraught. He was almost crying because he was so upset. I remember him saying, \u2018I can do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nA few days later, Thompson was given that shot, as an intern at the New Orleans Times-Picayune. When he arrived in New Orleans his father\u2019s lessons about hard work and determination immediately set him apart. \u201cI went down there and decided I was going to outwork every other person who was around me for the rest of time,\u201d Thompson said. Seven years later, Thompson was writing for ESPN.\n\nThompson is a sports fan, but never anticipated being a sports journalist. He is less drawn to sport as an event, and more as an arena from which to tell stories about the human condition.\n\n\u201cTo a certain extent he doesn\u2019t write about sports,\u201d said Wickersham. \u201cHe likes finding ways to write about other things that are tangentially related to sports.\u201d\n\nWhen Lebron James left Cleveland, Thompson wrote a 7,500-word story about Cleveland for ESPN. He leveraged James\u2019s decision to talk about what the city of Cleveland was experiencing and why James mattered. Thompson did not interview James. Instead, he hung out in Cleveland bars, spent a day with a local congressman, and told the story of the city.\n\nThompson wrote:\n\n\u201cI really began to understand this difficult city, and understand the things that matter here and the things that don\u2019t. [Clevelanders] didn\u2019t love Ilgauskas only because he was a great player; they loved him because he appreciated where he came from. They loved LeBron James for the same reason.\u201d\n\nThompson strives for his journalism to read like short stories. His favorite piece, \u201cThe Losses of Dan Gable,\u201d published in 2013, stands apart from the rest to him, because, he said, \u201cit reads like a piece of fiction.\u201d Like fictional shorts, Thompson\u2019s stories often don\u2019t have conclusions. They are shaped like short stories, thematically centered around conflict and change.\n\n\u201c[Thompson] writes \u2018quest\u2019 stories,\u201d said Jay Lovinger, Thompson\u2019s editor and mentor. \u201cWhat makes great art is when there is a discovery and then there is change. Wright tells these stories.\u201d\n\nThe quests Thompson writes about are not journeys to a championship. They are about internal quests and personal journeys.\n\n\u201cAll [storytelling] is figuring out the central complication of someone\u2019s life and how on a daily basis they go about solving it,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cEvery single story has a character that encounters an obstacle and is changed by it.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s stories are powerful because he uncovers the struggles, problems and complications in the lives of his subjects. He tells athletes\u2019 stories not through how many points they score, but through their very real, vulnerable and human struggles, such as failure and personal loss.\n\n\u201cWith Wright\u2019s stories, he finds those moments that affect people, that bring them to tears,\u201d Wickersham said. \u201cThe moments or questions in their own lives that they don\u2019t have answers for yet.\u201d\n\nIn his well-received profile of a 50-year-old Michael Jordan, published in ESPN The Magazine in February of 2013, Thompson exposed Jordan\u2019s daily struggle with the passing of time. From the physical breakdown of his body, to the death of his father, to a pent-up competitive drive, Thompson revealed a fragile and empathetic side of Jordan.\n\nThompson wrote:\n\n\u201cOn the floor, leaning against the wall, waiting to be hung, is a framed print Jordan moved here from Chicago. It\u2019s of an empty arena, dark and quiet, with a bright white light coming out of the open tunnel doors, beckoning. Really, it\u2019s about dealing with losses: with aging, with retirement, with death. In it, Jordan is walking toward the light and there\u2019s a ghost walking next to him, with a hand on his shoulder. It\u2019s his dad.\u201d\n\nThe Jordan story is not the only Thompson piece that explores the daily difficulty a son goes through after losing a father. Profiles on Ohio State coach Urban Meyer and golf\u2019s Jack Nicklaus traced the obstacles they faced after losing their fathers.\n\n\u201cI write about things that are personal to me,\u201d said Thompson, whose father died of pancreatic cancer at 58 in 2004. \u201cVery often I try to profile people about whom I suspect they\u2019re asking the same questions that I might be asking.\u201d\n\nThompson searches for moments that allow him to write about his subject, and also himself. His stories have emotional depth because they delve into questions vital in his own life. This honest and sincere portrayal of emotion powers his stories.\n\n\u201cHis dad was a huge presence in his life,\u201d Wickersham said. \u201cI think that he processes [Walter\u2019s death] by asking his subjects, who are in similar circumstances, how they handle it. He looks for those moments when he is unconsciously writing about himself.\u201d\n\nThompson admits he has a melancholy streak, and although he struggles with his father\u2019s death less and less as time passes, Walter is always with him, whether pushing him to work harder than other journalists, or as a nostalgic reminder of the past.\n\nAs my conversation with Wright Thompson ends, a purple and pink evening sky washes over Palo Alto. Darkness falls over Sao Paulo. Thompson has a 3 a.m. flight to Uruguay to write a story about Uruguayan soccer star Luiz Suarez. As a final question, I turn Thompson\u2019s own profiling question back on him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you struggling with every day?\u201d\n\nIt is the first question of the interview where Thompson must pause and think. Silence.\n\n\u201c[My struggle] is figuring out how to slow down and enjoy some of the fruits of so many years of hard work,\u201d he said, finally, \u201cwithout betraying the college junior who sat in that bar with Seth and swore that nobody would ever outwork him.\u201d\n\nHomepage image screenshot via ESPN FC website and video, \u201cA Portrait Of Luis Suarez.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Austin Meyer,ESPN,Sports,Wright Thompson,Frontpage Featured,Culture & Features", "description": "Thompson\u2019s journey to become one of the most respected sports journalists in the business is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a family-instilled\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe239b\"", "article_summary": "Wright tells these stories.\u201dThe quests Thompson writes about are not journeys to a championship.\nAfter applying to every newspaper in the country, Thompson didn\u2019t receive a single offer.\n\u201cWright didn\u2019t have an internship yet,\u201d recalled Seth Wickersham, Thompson\u2019s friend and colleague from Missouri, who now also writes for ESPN.\n\u201c[My father] taught me diligent hard work,\u201d Thompson said.\n\u201c[Thompson] writes \u2018quest\u2019 stories,\u201d said Jay Lovinger, Thompson\u2019s editor and mentor."}
