He repeatedly apologized and dismissed as \u201cmean,\u201d \u201cglib\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d a series of controversial remarks about the passage of Obamacare and the \u201cstupidity\u201d of the American voter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI am not a political adviser nor a politician,\u201d said Gruber, who was a key economic adviser during the drafting of the law. And in his most pointed mea culpa, he allowed: \u201cIt was inexcusable that I tried to appear smarter by insulting others.\u201d\n\nGruber also drew the ire of committee Republicans for not disclosing all his income from state and federal consulting contracts, and Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa threatened to subpoena information on how much Gruber was paid for all of his Affordable Care Act work. Gruber, who has been a sought-after speaker in recent years, advised Washington and a number of states.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: McConnell's Obamacare gambit)\n\nGruber would only confirm he received close to $400,000 under a contract with HHS and referred the committee to his attorney to determine what other payments may be released.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was the GOP\u2019s last best shot at Obamacare this Congress, and even Democrats showed their annoyance with Gruber\u2019s videotaped comments attributing Obamacare\u2019s passage to a lack of transparency and voter ignorance. Those tapes have become a conservative media sensation and created a highly unwelcome distraction for the White House. Fox News carried the opening portions of the hearing live.\n\n\u201cAre you stupid? \u2026 Does MIT employ stupid people?\u201d Issa said to Gruber, before asking him to explain his remarks as a \u201csmart person\u201d at a respected institution. Later Gruber was asked if he understood what a \u201ctax\u201d was, as the Republicans tangled with him about the health care law\u2019s individual mandate penalty.\n\nCMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner was the other key witness, and she also spent her time on multiple apologies \u2014 in her case, for giving the committee inflated Obamacare enrollment numbers earlier this fall. The Obama administration included nearly 400,000 dental plans in that count, giving the false impression that it had surpassed its 7 million enrollment goal.\n\nTavenner said that was an error arising from counting all payments to health plans instead of tallying the number of people with medical coverage.\n\n( POLITICO Magazine: Will Jonathan Gruber topple Obamacare?)\n\nIssa called Gruber and Tavenner \u201ca perfect pairing, a pairing of individuals who are responsible for what we know and don\u2019t know before during and after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But he and his fellow Republicans reserved most of their ire for Gruber, leaving Tavenner \u2014 a senior administration official with broad authority over the law\u2019s implementation \u2014 sitting virtually unnoticed for long stretches of the four-hour hearing.\n\nThe \u201cstupidity\u201d remarks have fueled \u201cGrubergate\u201d but a different videotaped statement has been quoted in a lawsuit that threatens a central pillar of Obamacare. In that tape, Gruber seemed to endorse the argument in King v. Burwell, the case before the Supreme Court that contends Obamacare subsidies, designed to make insurance more affordable, are illegal for people who use the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov.\n\nThirty-seven states are using HealthCare.gov in 2015, either because they decided not to set up their own health insurance exchanges or because they tried and failed.\n\nGruber \u2014 who did crucial economic analysis while the bill was being written but said he was not among its drafters \u2014 repudiated any support for that lawsuit and said the remarks on the video lacked context. He said his own economic model, which was the basis for his work on the health law, had always assumed that the subsidies would be available in all states, whether they ran their own exchange or used the federal option.\n\n\u201cI have a longstanding and well-documented belief that health care reform in general, and the ACA in particular, must include mechanisms for residents in all states to obtain tax credits,\u201d Gruber said.\n\nIssa called on Tavenner to account for the inflated enrollment numbers provided Congress in September. The exaggeration continued in another estimate last month.\n\nTavenner said the inclusion of nearly 400,000 dental plans in the total sign-up count \u2014 a break with past practice \u2014 was \u201can inexcusable mistake.\u201d Federal officials later dialed back the estimate to 6.7 million people with Obamacare medical coverage as of Oct. 15.\n\nBut she did clarify, in response to a question from Oversight Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, that she did not know at the time the number was inflated with dental plans. She also said repeatedly that it was an error and that she didn\u2019t believe anyone on her staff was trying to dupe lawmakers or the public.\n\n\u201cI do not believe anyone tried to deceive the American people, and I believe the error was inadvertent,\u201d Tavenner said. She said that the revised figure \u201cwas a large number that we are pleased with\u201d and again apologized for the mistake.\n\nThe GOP has demanded details, however, and Issa said that CMS has not been forthcoming.\n\nHe said that a \u201chuge data dump\u201dof 19,000 pages \u2014 delivered Monday night on the \u201cmisleading\u201d enrollment numbers \u2014 did not include documents on the talking points that allowed Tavenner to use \u201ccareful language so that you didn\u2019t lie, but you did deceive.\u201d\n\nTavenner pledged to work with the committee to provide those documents.\n\nCummings said he was \u201csorry\u201d both for Gruber\u2019s comments and the mistaken enrollment numbers.\n\n\u201cWhat it does is it distracts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt distracts from all the good things that are being done by this law. And that\u2019s the most painful part about all of this.\u201d\n\nThe hearing Tuesday was Issa\u2019s last as chairman of the Oversight Committee. Later this week, Congress is expected to pass a bill that will fund nearly all of the government through this fiscal year and then recess until January, when the new Congress will be sworn in.\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Also: \u201cIt was inexcusable that I tried to appear smarter by insulting others.\u201d", "title": "Gruber: I'm not 'the architect' of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/obamacare-house-oversight-hearings-113419.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/09/img_4441_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,Republicans,Health Care,Jonathan Gruber,Darrell Issa", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Also: \u201cIt was inexcusable that I tried to appear smarter by insulting others.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd038\"", "article_summary": "John Shinkle/POLITICO POLITICO Pro Gruber: I'm not 'the architect' of ObamacareBeleaguered Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber declared he was not \u201cthe architect\u201d of the health law as House Republicans on Tuesday hit hard at a pair of scandals that have overshadowed an otherwise successful launch of the second sign-up season.\n\u201cI was not the \u2018architect\u2019 of President [Barack] Obama\u2019s health care plan,\u201d the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist told the House Oversight committee.\nLater Gruber was asked if he understood what a \u201ctax\u201d was, as the Republicans tangled with him about the health care law\u2019s individual mandate penalty.\n( POLITICO Magazine: Will Jonathan Gruber topple Obamacare?)\nGruber, who has been a sought-after speaker in recent years, advised Washington and a number of states."}
