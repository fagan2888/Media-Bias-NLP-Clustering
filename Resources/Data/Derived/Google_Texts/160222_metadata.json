Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Amy Ford said crews worked around the clock to repair Colo. 119, which was heavily damaged by the floods.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're very much excited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the partnerships we've had with the local agencies and the patience from the residents.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll the needed repairs aren't finished, she said, but the road is in good enough shape to open one-lane of traffic both ways between Boulder and Nederland. She said motorists should expect to see some delays in the coming weeks as work is completed on the road. After the flooding, about 20 percent of the road was damaged, with some areas washed away entirely.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon, about two dozen cars lined up waiting for the road to open. As drivers started up, they honked, cheered and yelled their thanks. The road has been closed since Sept. 12.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're fortunate and happy to have the road,\u201d said Joel Edson as he and Sandra Taylor, who live in Sugarloaf and commute, waited for the go-ahead.\n\n\n\nAnnette Croughwell, a Nederland trustee who cheered on drivers at the opening, said residents were \u201cbuzzing\u201d about getting access to the road again after the Boulder Office of Emergency Management announced it this afternoon via Twitter.\n\n\n\nAs a commuter herself, she said, she's thrilled. She drove 900 miles in three weeks taking various roundabout routes through the foothills, with one drive to Boulder topping two-and-a-half hours.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people are counting their blessings,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nNicole Silk, who lives off of Magnolia Road outside Nederland, had to be creative with two children who attend Boulder schools.

A total of $91.5 million in state money has been set aside for those efforts.\n\n\n\nPermanent repairs to Colorado's highways are expected to cost an estimated $475 million.
