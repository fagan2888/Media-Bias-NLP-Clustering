And star pitcher Masahiro Tanaka magically helped out, even after his record winning streak turned into a pumpkin.\n\nThe details: The Tohoku Rakuten Eagles Sunday night beat the Yomiuri Giants 3-0 in the deciding Game Seven of the Japan Series, giving the team from the region slammed by the 2011 quake-tsunami-nuclear disaster its first-ever championship.\n\nThe victory followed a heart-breaking loss for the Eagles Saturday against the 22-time champion Giants, who gave Rakuten ace Tanaka his first loss in more than a year, ending a record 30-game winning streak.\n\nTanaka added a touch of drama to Sunday\u2019s win, coming in to pitch the ninth inning in relief, earning the save. Tanaka\u2019s appearance was remarkable \u2014 and risky for his pitching arm \u2014 coming the day after he threw a full nine-inning complete game, tossing a career-high 160 pitches.\n\nSunday\u2019s save allowed Tanaka to end on a high note his memorable season \u2014 and likely his career in Japan. He\u2019s widely expected to follow fellow Japanese star pitchers like Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers and Koji Uehara of the Boston Red Sox, and jump next season to Major League Baseball in the U.S.\n\n*** *** *** ***\n\nOriginal Item, posted under headline \u201cJapanese Baseball Fairytale Popped\u201d:\n\nIt seemed too good to be true. And, in the end, that was the case.\n\nThe longest winning streak for a pitcher in the history of baseball came abruptly to an end Saturday \u2014 delaying, and possibly denying, a storybook championship for Japan\u2019s hardscrabble Tohoku region.\n\nRewind to Saturday evening, Japan time, at Kleenex Stadium in Sendai. (Yes, that\u2019s right. Kleenex Stadium). Game Six of the Japan Series. The Rakuten Golden Eagles were leading the feared Yomiuri Giants \u2014 the New York Yankees of Japan \u2014 three games to two. A victory would give the team its first-ever championship, a heartwarming boost to the hard-hit northeast region still struggling from the 2011 triple-disaster earthquake-tsunami-nuclear meltdown.\n\nVictory seemed assured. The mighty Masahiro Tanaka was on the mound \u2014 most likely his last start in Japan before an expected jump to the U.S. for next season. And Tanaka had been unbeatable, literally, all season. Tanaka had, in fact, set a world record for unbeatability. He was last tagged with a loss on August 19, 2012. Since then, he had racked up 30 straight victories in regular season and post-season games. The last professional pitcher to come anywhere close to that streak was New York Giants hurler Carl Hubbell, who notched 24 consecutive wins over the 1936 and 1937 seasons.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game began predictably, and auspiciously, for Tanaka, starting the day after his 25th birthday. The Eagles jumped ahead with two runs in the second inning, while Tanaka held the Giants scoreless. Things fell apart in the fifth. Tanaka gave up a two-base hit to the first batter. Then Jose Lopez, a journeyman infielder who had come to the Giants after bouncing around the majors for a decade, most recently with the Chicago White Sox, came to the plate. Lopez had been 0-15 in the Series, but smacked a 2-2 pitch over the left field wall to tie the game. The Giants scratched out another run against Tanaka in the same inning to take the lead, and padded it with one more in the sixth.\n\nIt was, according to Kyodo News, the first time Tanaka had given up more than three earned runs in 36 starts.\n\nIn the U.S., Tanaka would certainly have been pulled for a reliever at that point. But he refused to leave the mound. He ended up pitching a complete game, throwing a career-high 160 pitches in the 4-2 loss.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t play well \u2014 that\u2019s number one,\u201d Tanaka is quoted as saying in an article on Daily Sports Online. \u201cI threw a lot of poor pitches. And they hit them.\u201d\n\n\u201cRakuten\u2019s Tanaka \u2014 The Myth of Invincibility Finally Crumbles,\u201d blared a headline on the website of NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster.\n\nWhile Tanaka\u2019s streak is done, Tohoku\u2019s hopes are still alive. The deciding Game Seven is scheduled for Sunday in Kleenex Stadium. And despite his long outing Saturday, Tanaka \u2014 who came in late in earlier post-season games to pitch relief \u2014 said he\u2019s ready for another inning or two, if it would help seal a late lead.\n\n***\n\nCorrection: Masahiro Tanaka\u2019s name was misspelled as Masahiru in an earlier version of this post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Japan's Cinderella baseball team lived happily ever after, after all.
