Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, said Friday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that problems are growing for the White House as ObamaCare moves from a theoretical debate to real numbers, and as some health insurance providers drop customers.

“The problem for the administration is they can spin it…but it doesn’t matter,” he said. “Ultimately, the numbers are what they are. People are getting these notices.”

Hayes went on to attack the argument that those who get coverage through employers are not affected by the health care law.

“That’s total and utter nonsense…You talk to people across the country, and they tell you their premiums are going to be increasing.”

He added, “This affects everybody.”
