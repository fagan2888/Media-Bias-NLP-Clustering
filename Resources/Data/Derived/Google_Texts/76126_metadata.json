The surgeon told Happli and his wife that although she had never successfully performed a Whipple procedure \u2014 the pancreatic cancer operation widely regarded as among the most difficult in surgery \u2014 she believed she could do it with the help of a second surgeon.\n\nBut Happli\u2019s operation had to be aborted after it proved too difficult. Several months later, the pipe fitter, now 58, traveled to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, 175 miles from his home. His operation, one of 127 Whipples done at Froedtert last year, was performed successfully by chief surgeon Douglas B. Evans.\n\nThe procedure involves removing part of the pancreas and small intestine as well as the gallbladder, and reconnecting the digestive organs. It proved to be particularly complicated in Happli\u2019s case, Evans said, because of tissue damage caused by radiation treatment for his lymphoma.\n\n\u201cIf this patient is not getting referred [to a specialist], then who is?\u201d asked Evans, who said he has seen a recent uptick in patients treated unsuccessfully by inexperienced surgeons at smaller hospitals.\n\nThe largely unfettered ability of surgeons with minimal expertise to perform high-risk procedures \u2014 particularly at hospitals that lack experience caring for significant numbers of patients \u2014 has been the subject of a contentious, long-running battle known as the volume-outcome debate.\n\nA groundbreaking 1979 Stanford study found that patients who underwent operations at hospitals that did more of those surgeries had significantly lower death rates than those treated at hospitals where they were done infrequently. That finding has since been replicated repeatedly across many specialties and found to apply to surgeons as well as hospitals. Last month, a large study found that the risk of complications was far higher among surgeons who performed only one thyroid removal annually than among those who did 25 or more of the tricky procedures per year.\n\nRecently the volume battle was reignited when a trio of prominent health systems \u2014 Johns Hopkins, Dartmouth-Hitchcock and the University of Michigan \u2014 pledged that they will require their surgeons and 20 affiliated hospitals to meet minimum annual thresholds for 10 high-risk procedures. The three systems have asked other hospital networks around the country to join them.\n\nUnder the terms of the volume pledge, believed to be the first of its kind, surgeons must perform at least five pancreatic cancer surgeries annually in hospitals where 20 such operations are done each year. For knee or hip replacements, the requirement is 25 per surgeon and 50 per hospital. There are provisions for emergency surgery and for surgeons who sometimes do not meet the threshold because they were on leave; such surgeons might be required to perform a certain number of procedures under supervision.\n\n\u201cThere is this intractableness of patients undergoing surgical care in places that have no business doing it\u201d or performed by \u201chobbyists\u201d \u2014 surgeons who infrequently perform risky surgeries, said John Birkmeyer, chief academic officer at Dartmouth. Birkmeyer devised the pledge with Peter Pronovost, an internationally known expert who directs the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAt large teaching hospitals, Birkmeyer noted, \u201cthere are usually one or two or three surgeons who are recognized as go-to doctors\u201d for certain procedures and do them frequently. \u201cBut there\u2019s this tail of other surgeons who do only a few a year,\u201d such as a shoulder surgeon who performs a handful of hip replacements or a breast cancer surgeon who occasionally attempts a Whipple.\n\n\u201cWe decided to use volume as a pilot case, an initial foray into setting quality and safety standards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we wanted to do it in a way\u201d that was not subject to the discretion of hospital officials.\n\nCritical Information\n\n\n\nAs smaller community hospitals affiliate with larger ones, the questions of which surgeons should do which procedures and where are increasingly confronting health systems. Hospitals of all sizes \u2014 both large academic centers and smaller community institutions \u2014 face a variety of sometimes competing incentives: to retain lucrative surgical cases and to avoid angering surgeons, who fiercely prize autonomy and wield considerable clout because they generate substantial revenue. And while hospitals formerly reaped a financial reward if patients suffered complications and had to be readmitted, they now face penalties under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit organization that represents large employers and purchasers of health care and seeks to advance patient safety, has focused on volume in its hospital rating system. \u201cVolume is a really critical piece of information,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief executive officer, Leah Binder.\n\n\u201cI think every medical staff should be grappling with these volume benchmarks,\u201d she said, endorsing the pledge. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental.\u201d\n\nAshish K. Jha, a practicing internist and professor of health policy at Harvard\u2019s T. H. Chan School of Public Health who has written about efforts to improve medical quality, calls the pledge \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d\n\nLow-volume hospitals, he said, typically lack specialized teams to care for patients as well as state-of-the-art equipment and systems designed to prevent or quickly spot complications \u2014 critical factors in improving outcomes. \u201cNone of us care about volume; we care about outcomes, and volume is a surrogate\u201d measure of outcomes, Jha noted. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve been talking about this for 35 years, a ton of high-risk surgery still happens among low-volume providers.\u201d\n\nBut surgeons\u2019 groups and the president of the Joint Commission, the Chicago group that accredits the nation\u2019s hospitals, have criticized the pledge as simplistic and overly prescriptive. Some officials say they fear it could unfairly penalize low-volume surgeons and smaller hospitals that have good outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room to improve in low-volume and high-volume hospitals,\u201d said Kevin Bozic, chairman of the department of surgery at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, who heads the committee on research and quality for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. \u201cThere are high-volume, low-quality hospitals\u201d as well as the converse.\n\n\u201cI know Harvard may be better than McPherson, Kansas,\u201d said Tyler Hughes, a surgeon at the 25-bed hospital in McPherson and a director of the American Board of Surgery. \u201cBut for many patients, the best possible surgery is closest to home.\u201d\n\nIrate Surgeons\n\n\n\nAlthough patient-safety experts and some insurance companies have long encouraged patients, especially those with serious illnesses or complex diagnoses, to seek care from experienced specialists at high-volume hospitals, there is little to prevent doctors and hospitals from doing whichever surgeries (other than organ transplants) they see fit, no matter how rarely they do them.\n\nMany patients don\u2019t know to ask a doctor about volume or outcomes or are unable to ferret out relevant information when choosing a surgeon or hospital. One reason, Leapfrog\u2019s Binder said, is that much important information such as complication rates remains hidden. Hospitals report detailed data about surgical outcomes to registries for internal use, but the information is not publicly available.\n\nKerry O\u2019Connell, 59, a Denver construction executive, said that only after a botched elbow operation that required seven corrective surgeries did he learn that his was the second such procedure his orthopedist had performed. \u201cI went to the one clinic where the ER sent me, and the surgeon seemed like a nice guy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough transparency in health care,\u201d Binder said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing everyone wants to know: Who\u2019s the best surgeon? And anyone in health care picks up the phone and asks their friends.\u201d\n\nRecently, Binder notes, there have been new efforts to inform patients. In the past year, the journalism organization ProPublica and Consumer\u2019s Checkbook have launched databases that rate surgeons. Since 1995 New York state has published some data on heart surgeons. And Consumer Reports and the federal government\u2019s Hospital Compare website provide hospital-specific information.\n\nA report by Leapfrog found that in 2013, one-third of hospitals that performed procedures to remove all or part of the esophagus, a demanding surgery to treat cancer, did only one or two annually, far below the level needed to achieve proficiency. A CNN investigation of an extremely low-volume Florida heart surgery program launched in 2011 found that six babies died in a two-year period, far more than expected; the program has since closed. And a U.S. News analysis last year found that Medicare patients who had knee replacements at the lowest-volume hospitals in the country were 70 percent more likely to die than those whose surgery was performed at the highest-volume centers; for hip replacement, the figure was 50 percent.\n\nDisparities can be seen among hospitals in the same system, Birkmeyer noted.\n\n\u201cOne of our highest priorities is insuring consistent quality and safety\u201d regardless of where a patient seeks treatment, he said. In the past decade, Dartmouth has grown from a single hospital in Hanover, New Hampshire, to eight in northern New England. Baltimore-based Hopkins has affiliated with smaller hospitals in Washington, D.C. and suburban Maryland.\n\nAmong the most irate reactions Birkmeyer said he encountered came from about 10 surgeons affiliated with Dartmouth\u2019s main hospital who were told they would no longer be allowed to do procedures for which they didn\u2019t meet annual minimums. \u201cThey said things like, \u2018I\u2019ve been credentialed to do this for 20 years and I\u2019ve never had a complication, and now you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t do it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat anger and the months required to get the boards of hospitals and their executive committees to agree to the new rules may be among the reasons only three systems have signed on so far, Birkmeyer said. More than a dozen others have expressed interest.\n\nSome surgeons say that the focus on volume is misguided.\n\nThe problem \u201cis actually much more complicated than volume\u201d said David Hoyt, executive director of the American College of Surgeons. Hoyt said that the group is drafting its own guidelines that will address volume.\n\nBeyond Numbers\n\n\n\nTo Mark Chassin, president of the Joint Commission, the pledge misses the mark. \u201cThe surgeon\u2019s contribution to the outcomes patients experience is only one component,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cVolume should never be used by an accrediting organization as a measure of quality\u201d because it is too imperfect a measure, Chassin added.\n\nPatients can help protect themselves, he added, by taking \u201cas much responsibility and interest\u201d as possible in their care.\n\nIn the view of general surgeon Linda Halderman, doctors are the best judges of their abilities. \u201cEvery surgeon has to exercise judgment of their own capabilities\u201d and know when to refer to a more experienced colleague, said Halderman, who is based in Selma, California.\n\nBut Harvard\u2019s Jha disagrees. Many surgeons, he said, tell him they \u201chave excellent results and I\u2019ll say, \u2018How do you know? Do you actually track your outcomes?\u2019 \u201d Most, he said, do not.\n\nTwo months ago, Linus Linaweaver, 76, chose to undergo elective abdominal surgery in his home town of McPherson, Kansas, after robotic prostate surgery at a larger hospital in Wichita nearly killed him and left him with a colostomy.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be back in our town,\u201d he said, adding that he had confidence in Tyler Hughes, his surgeon, and McPherson Hospital. His seven-hour operation went well, and Linaweaver recently said he is \u201calmost back to normal.\u201d\n\nJames Happli is back at work after a year\u2019s medical leave. Following his failed Whipple surgery, the local surgeon proposed trying again. That offer was withdrawn after a second specialist refused to participate. At that point, Happli was referred to Evans in Milwaukee.\n\nIf he had it to do over again, Happli said, \u201cI would have gone to a bigger place\u201d and a more experienced surgeon the first time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A contentious, long-running battle focuses on the largely unfettered ability of surgeons with minimal expertise to perform high-risk procedures.", "pubdate": 20160427, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A contentious, long-running battle focuses on the largely unfettered ability of surgeons with minimal expertise to perform high-risk procedures.", "title": "These hospitals are trying to reduce surgeries by inexperienced doctors", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-493216361.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/these-hospitals-are-trying-to-reduce-surgeries-by-inexperienced-doctors/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A contentious, long-running battle focuses on the largely unfettered ability of surgeons with minimal expertise to perform high-risk procedures.", "title": "These hospitals are trying to reduce surgeries by inexperienced doctors", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-493216361.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "surgery"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, hospitals, surgery"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNone of us care about volume; we care about outcomes, and volume is a surrogate\u201d measure of outcomes, Jha noted.\nThat finding has since been replicated repeatedly across many specialties and found to apply to surgeons as well as hospitals.\nSome officials say they fear it could unfairly penalize low-volume surgeons and smaller hospitals that have good outcomes.\nA groundbreaking 1979 Stanford study found that patients who underwent operations at hospitals that did more of those surgeries had significantly lower death rates than those treated at hospitals where they were done infrequently.\nAt large teaching hospitals, Birkmeyer noted, \u201cthere are usually one or two or three surgeons who are recognized as go-to doctors\u201d for certain procedures and do them frequently."}
