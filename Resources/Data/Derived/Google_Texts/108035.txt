A new building for the business school at the University of Kansas will bear the name Capital Federal Hall in recognition of two alumni who donated to the construction project.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports that the name of the $65.7 million building was approved Wednesday by the Kansas Board of Regents.

A gift of $20 million from the Capital Federal Foundation was made to assist with the construction. It is the charitable arm of Topeka-based Capital Federal Savings, which is led by John B. Dicus, a 1983 graduate of the business school.

University officials say it has been the practice to name buildings in honor of donors regardless of whether they were individuals or foundations.

Dicus' father, John C. Dicus, earned his degree from the business school in 1955.
