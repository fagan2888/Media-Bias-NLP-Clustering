The East Central Mississippi’s Kennel Club's annual Dog Fest was held at the Lauderdale Co. Ag Center.

There were many activities for the dogs and owners to participate in, such as best bark contest, lure coursing and the ugliest dog contest. Organizers say it is good for people to take their dogs out to do different things.

"It's celebrating all of the different things you can do with your dog for fun, how to just get him out of the backyard and play with him and there's so many things we have here that people can do with their dogs,” East Central MS Kennel Club President Sue Sexton says.

And as you can tell the pets really enjoyed their time today as well.
