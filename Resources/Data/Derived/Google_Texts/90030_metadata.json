Ray Rice, recently released by the Baltimore Ravens, and Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson won\u2019t play either.\n\nPeterson was placed on the inactive list late last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on a child abuse charge. He tweeted a photo on Sunday of a highlighted religious devotion that cautions people against passing judgment.\n\nRice, meanwhile, might never play again, since the NFL suspended him indefinitely after a video was posted online that showed him punching out his now-wife in February.\n\n\u2018Zero applause for the Panthers\u2019\n\nAuthorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina.\n\nCritics had wondered how Rice could be suspended while Hardy had not. Even after the Panthers deactivated him Sunday, it was too little too late for some.\n\n\u201cZero applause for the Panthers,\u201d Sports Illustrated\u2019s Richard Deitsch tweeted. \u201cThey ceded to press/public pressure. It was disgrace it took this long.\u201d\n\n\u2018Climate has changed\u2019\n\nThe Panthers drew heated criticism over its handling of Hardy even while speaking out against domestic violence. Owner Jerry Richardson, while accepting a civic award last week, began to cry while speaking about domestic violence.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to domestic violence, my stance is not one of indifference. I stand firmly against domestic violence, plain and simple,\u201d he told the audience in Charlotte. \u201cTo those who would suggest we\u2019ve been too slow to act, I ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not mention the words \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in his post-game remarks, Panthers coach Ron Rivera obliquely acknowledged the controversy looming over not just Hardy, but over the entire league.\n\n\u201cThe climate has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really do have to get this right. Believe me. I understand that\u201d\n\nHarsher penalties for domestic violence\n\nIn the wake of the Ray Rice incident, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced more severe punishment guidelines to the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nAccording to an August 28 memo sent by Goodell to all 32 teams, anyone in the league \u2014 players or team personnel \u2014 will be suspended for a minimum of six games for a first offense of domestic violence. Players are granted the opportunity to appeal. Ray Rice has until midnight Tuesday to file his appeal, if he chooses to do so.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is whether the NFL would apply these new guidelines retroactively, which is perhaps one explanation as to why Hardy \u2014 sentenced a month before Goodell\u2019s memo \u2014 has not yet been dealt with by the NFL. Another explanation could be that the league is waiting for the legal process to play itself out. Hardy has another trial scheduled for November.\n\nCNN reached out to the NFL Sunday but had not immediately heard back.\n\nMeanwhile, Hardy will continue be paid while he is on the inactive list.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was convicted of domestic violence this summer, did not play Sunday in his team's win over the Detroit Lions.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "(CNN) \u2014 Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was convicted of domestic violence this summer, did not play Sunday in his team\u2019s win over the Detroit Lions.
