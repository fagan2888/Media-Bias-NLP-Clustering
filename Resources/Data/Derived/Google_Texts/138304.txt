(CNSNews.com) – U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s oldest son, Eugene Scalia, told Fox News’ “The Kelly File” on Tuesday that the lesson his father will bequeath to the country will be his “very strong view of the role of the court” and the Constitution, as well as “the court’s importance, but also its limited role.”



“He had a very strong view of the role of the court, the role of the Constitution, the court’s importance, but also its limited role, and hopefully, that’s a lesson that he will bequeath to the country,” said Eugene Scalia, an attorney.





Scalia said his father cared about the opinions “he wrote and joined and getting it right as a judge, and that’s what mattered.” Antonin Scalia got used to the grief he received about his “jurist prudence” and whether people “in the media or elsewhere” agreed with him was not important to him, Eugene Scalia said.



“In terms of his jurist prudence, like I said, he kind of got used to grief on that, and what he cared about was the opinions that he wrote and joined and getting it right as a judge, and that’s what mattered. And I don’t mean to be disrespectful in saying that whether people agreed with him or not in the media or elsewhere wasn’t really very important to him,” Eugene Scalia said.

Scalia said his father was both “extraordinarily intelligent” and “very funny.”



“He loved opera on the one hand and hunting on the other. We certainly in our family – the children and my mother – remember his humor, his warmth, his example,” Scalia said.



Besides his role as Supreme Court Justice, Eugene Scalia said part of his father’s legacy will be his nine children and 36 grandchildren.
