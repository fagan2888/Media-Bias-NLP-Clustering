INDIANAPOLIS – U.S. Rep. Todd Young, R-9th District, will deliver the Weekly Republican Address on Saturday for the second time this year.

Young first delivered the GOP speech in July alongside Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ariz.

When he gives the response on Saturday, it will be the seventh time this year that an Indiana Republican has handled the address.

It will also make for back-to-back addresses from Hoosier Republicans, as Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., delivered the speech last weekend.

Young previously spoke on a bill to delay the employer and individual mandates of the Affordable Healthcare Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. This time, he will discuss the impact Obamacare has had on Hoosier families and will cite specific examples from his constituents.

Young’s address will be available to view and download on Saturday at Speaker.gov.
