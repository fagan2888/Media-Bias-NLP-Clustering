Photo: Getty Images\n\nA double from prolific striker Jodie Taylor lifted Sydney FC to a comfortable 3-1 derby win over Western Sydney Wanderers to leave the reigning champions a point clear at the top of the W-League ladder with one round remaining.\n\nLeena Khamis put the Wanderers on the back foot with an early goal, while Taylor added two more before the hour mark as Sydney FC rebounded in style from their midweek defeat by Canberra United.\n\nWestern Sydney Wanderers\u2019 Catherine Cannuli netted from the penalty spot in the dying seconds in her final home match. The former Matildas\u2019 forward announced her retirement during the week.\n\nTaylor now seems assured of winning her maiden golden boot as the league\u2019s leading goal scorer after taking her tally to 10, three clear of Melbourne Victory duo Caitlin Friend and Lisa De Vanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictory leaves Sydney assured of a home semi-final but a final-round meeting with second-placed Canberra United will determine which team ends as premiers for finishing top of the ladder.\n\nThe Sky Blues\u2019 three goals in the derby established a new W-League high of 36 goals for the season.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have had a tough schedule, but we have been rotating players and it seems to have worked for us,\u2019\u2019 said Sydney FC midfielder Khamis.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is always great to win the derby and we have earned a home semi-final so we couldn\u2019t be happier.\u2019\u2019\n\nCanberra ensured the race for top spot will continue until the final round after cruising to a club record-equalling 5-0 win over an outclassed Newcastle Jets.\n\nThe match was marked by the return of popular Matildas midfield stalwart Sally Shipard who marked her first W-League appearance for nearly two years with a goal after just 10 minutes.\n\nThe win allowed Canberra to leapfrog Melbourne Victory, whose nine-match unbeaten run came to a surprise end at the hands of Perth Glory.\n\nThe injury-hit Glory went ahead with an early Kate Gill goal and they survived some oppressive heat and a second-half onslaught from the Victory to claim all three points.\n\nMeanwhile, a late equaliser from teenager Emily Condon earned Adelaide United a 1-1 draw as fourth-placed Brisbane Roar continued their erratic form.\n\nSYDNEY FC 3 (Leena Khamis 8m, Jodie Taylor 37m, 57m) bt WESTERN SYDNEY WANDERERS WL 1 (Catherine Cannuli 90+5m pen) at Campbelltown Stadium.
