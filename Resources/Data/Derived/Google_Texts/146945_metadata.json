(You can watch the video at the bottom of the story.)\n\nBut does the video get things right?\n\nIt begins with a back-and-forth between Clinton and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper during the Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas in October 2015.\n\n\"You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the \u2018gold standard.\u2019 Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it,\" Cooper asked. \"Will you say anything to get elected?\"\n\n\"Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles,\" she responded. The video cuts off the rest of the sentence, \"But, like most human beings \u2014 including those of us who run for office \u2014 I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world.\"\n\nPolitiFact has documented Clinton\u2019s shifting stances on a number of issues since 2008, including most mentioned in the video -- and a few not mentioned. Our Flip-O-Meter ratings are not value judgments on changed positions, which some say demonstrate flexibility and ability to compromise and others say are born from a lack of conviction or political expediency. The video, for instance, describes them as a lie.\n\nThat being said, we wanted to provide some additional context to the video of Clinton\u2019s statements.\n\nOn same-sex marriage\n\nThe first Clinton contradiction highlighted by the video is on same-sex marriage. PolitiFact gave Clinton a Full Flop for her stance on the issue, but there\u2019s some nuance the video leaves out.\n\nFrom 1999 to at least 2007, she continuously opposed same-sex marriage while consistently supporting civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. She also spoke on the Senate floor against a proposed federal ban on gay marriage in 2004 and said she supports states making the decision for themselves in 2006.\n\nClinton reversed course and announced her support for gay marriage in 2013, as the viral video accurately notes. However, the video samples a 2014 interview Clinton did with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross in which she seems to deny her changed position.\n\n\"You\u2019re trying to say that I used to be opposed and now I\u2019m in favor and I did it for political reasons. And that\u2019s just flat wrong,\" Clinton is heard saying in the video, \"I have a strong record. I have a great commitment to this issue.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not all the whole story. Before the excerpted part in the video, Gross asked, \"Would you say your view evolved since the '90s or that the American public evolved, allowing you to state your real view?\"\n\n\"I think I'm an American,\" Clinton responded. \"And I think we have all evolved, and it's been one of the fastest, most sweeping transformations.\"\n\nOn \u2018core principles\u2019\n\nThe video then segues to Clinton shifting between calling herself a progressive and a moderate. While it\u2019s accurate and fair to charge Clinton with wearing multiple political labels, the video\u2019s most damning evidence requires some additional context.\n\nThe video features CNN\u2019s Cooper asking Clinton, \"Just in July in New Hampshire, you told a crowd you, \u2018take a backseat to none when it comes to progressive values.\u2019 Last month in Ohio, you said you, \u2018plead guilty to being kind of moderate and center.\u2019 Do you change your political identity based on who you\u2019re talking to? Just for the record, are you a progressive or a moderate?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m a progressive,\" Clinton says in the video before it cuts out to the next topic.\n\nHere\u2019s her next sentence: \"But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.\"\n\nOn her emails\n\nThere are still many unknowns in the email controversy, and the FBI is currently conducting an investigation. Though Clinton may be able to make the case that she \"complied\" with the rules, experts on government transparency and records preservations have told us her actions are hard to defend. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear at all whether she breached national security laws.\n\nThe YouTube video includes a clip of Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina arguing with Clinton over how many emails she\u2019s turned over to the State Department.\n\nClinton says she has turned over about half. Out of over 60,000 emails on her private server, Clinton and her staff deleted 31,000 emails she says were personal and released the remaining 30,940.\n\nBut the video suggests the deleted emails may not have been personal by sampling a clip of former President Bill Clinton saying he\u2019s only ever sent two emails. But that\u2019s taken out of context and it was a joke, one that he\u2019s made repeatedly.\n\nThe Bill Clinton quote comes from a panel Clinton moderated for the Clinton Global Foundation in June 2015. Clinton was referring to his email practices when he was president (starting around 46:50), more than a decade before Hillary Clinton set up her email server.\n\nOn Wall Street\n\nNext, the video features Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street. This section is a mixed bag of information in terms of accuracy.\n\nA clip of Clinton from the 2015 Las Vegas debate saying she told Wall Street to \"cut it out\" in 2007 is followed by chopped up comments Clinton actually made in 2007, in which she seems to hold homebuyers, not Wall Street, responsible for the housing crisis. This gives a misleading impression.\n\nThe 2007 comments are taken from Clinton\u2019s speech at the Nasdaq stock exchange that December. Some argue that the speech was more sympathetic to the financial sector than Clinton has suggested, and she does say homeowners and borrowers should shoulder some of the blame for the housing crisis.\n\nBut the video leaves out the part when she also names irresponsible mortgage lenders and brokers, the government and regulators, credit rating agencies, speculators and Wall Street \"which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending.\"\n\nAs PolitiFact has previously reported, Clinton called for more oversight and transparency in the financial sector in several speeches and dating back to March 2007. From then to 2008, she repeatedly suggested and introduced a bill to establish national standards and regulations for loan brokers and lenders.\n\nThe video also points out Wall Street has been contributing to Clinton\u2019s campaign. This is accurate. PolitiFact looked into a viral image highlighting Clinton\u2019s top 10 donors and found that five were financial firms, two were law firms that do a lot of corporate work, and two were media conglomerates.\n\nOn universal healthcare\n\nContinuing the theme, the video then exhibits Clinton\u2019s (somewhat hypocritical) waffling on universal health care between her 2008 campaign to her 2016 bid. This is accurate.\n\nWhen she was running in 2008, Clinton aired an attack ad that said she \"has the only health care plan that covers every American.\" We found that she was the only candidate that year, including then-Sen. Barack Obama, with a health care mandate for everyone \u2014 in other words, universal coverage.\n\n\"Since when do Democrats attack one another over universal health care?\" she said, as excerpted in the viral video.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton and her surrogates repeatedly have criticized rival Bernie Sanders for his universal health care proposal. As we\u2019ve previously reported, Clinton said single-payer \"will never, ever come to pass\" and now wants to build upon and defend Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. And her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, received a Mostly False rating for saying Sanders would empower Republicans \"to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.\"\n\nOn Bosnia visit\n\nUp next, the video highlights Clinton\u2019s Pants on Fire claim that she landed \"under sniper fire\" when she visited Bosnia a decade earlier.\n\nAs the video aptly demonstrates, she arrived on the tarmac under no visible duress and was greeted by a child who offered her a copy of a poem.\n\nFlying into Bosnia was dangerous in 1996 and Clinton later said she misspoke, but \"it's hard to understand how she could err on something so significant as whether she did or didn't dodge sniper bullets,\" we wrote in 2008.\n\nOn NAFTA\n\nFinally, the video concludes with Clinton\u2019s flip-flop on the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 another accurate charge.\n\nThis is a point that Obama made in 2008, when he said that Clinton \"was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president.\"\n\nDespite the Clinton campaign\u2019s protests, Obama\u2019s claim is True. Clinton publicly supported NAFTA in 1996, in her 2003 memoir Living History, and in 2004. But as a 2008 presidential candidate, Clinton said NAFTA was a mistake.\n\nClinton\u2019s free trade zigzagging is not limited to just NAFTA. During her first bid for the White House, she opposed the bilateral free trade deals with South Korea and Columbia. As secretary of state, however, she supported both.\n\nSimilarly, Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the \"gold standard in trade agreements\" in 2012, but opposed it in the 2016 race. We rated her position on TPP a Full Flop.\n\nYou can see all of Clinton\u2019s PolitiFact ratings here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A YouTube video mash-up of Hillary Clinton comments claims to show &quot;Hillary Clinton lying for 13 minutes straight.&quot; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been viewed more than 7 million times as of May 2016.
