The United Way of North Central Florida will offer free tax-filing services through its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program beginning today.

The program will help those with low incomes in the United Way's six-county service area of Alachua, Bradford, Dixie, Gilchrist, Levy and Union counties secure all the refunds and credits they're eligible for, including the earned income tax credit, according to a news release.

This year, volunteers have been trained in the Affordable Care Act. Tax preparers will be able to answer any questions concerning the act and handle all types of returns.

There will be 10 different sites for tax preparation in Alachua County, including the University of Florida Levin College of Law, United Way of North Central Florida, Alachua Branch Library, Library Partnership, Cone Park Library, SWAG Resource Center, Reichert House, Santa Fe College, Santa Fe Blount Center (Downtown) and Buchholz High School Academy of Finance.

Appointments can be made for Monday through Saturday, through April 12, by calling 2-1-1 or by accessing the self-registration page coming soon to www.unitedwayncfl.org.

Appointments are required for all in-person tax assistance. Individuals also can visit www.myfreetaxes.com to do their taxes from home.
