But the prospect of paying for health costs after he retires weighs on him.\n\n\u201cWithin health care,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s all kinds of uncertainties.\u201d\n\nMr. Strack hasn\u2019t decided yet when he\u2019ll stop working full time. But he doesn\u2019t expect any retiree health coverage from his employer, which now provides insurance for him and his wife, Penny, a retired educator. If he leaves work before he turns 65, he won\u2019t be eligible for Medicare \u2014 so they\u2019ll have to buy interim coverage on the private market. He hopes affordable plans will be available, but the rocky debut of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance market worries him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows how this is going to play out,\u201d said Mr. Strack, who in the meantime is saving cash in a tax-advantaged health-savings account to help pay future medical costs.\n\nMr. Strack isn\u2019t alone in his concern. As the American population ages and insurers try to rein in costs, the share of health and medical costs that retirees can expect to shoulder is becoming more formidable.\n\nA look at estimates of retiree health costs suggests that, if long-term care costs are included, it is not difficult to come up with a situation in which a couple\u2019s tab for out-of-pocket costs post-retirement could approach \u2014 or even exceed \u2014 $1 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGetting to such a large number can mean combining some bleak possibilities \u2014 say, both spouses ending up in a nursing home in a high-cost part of the country \u2014 and factoring in extended life spans. But it is not far-fetched.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible,\u201d said Paul Fronstin, a researcher at the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it is likely for most people. But it does suggest that most need to think about saving a lot more for health costs in retirement. Half of Medicare beneficiaries have below $77,500 in personal savings, according to the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center.\n\nThat is far less than the estimated amount retirees will need to pay out of pocket for basics like doctor visits and prescription drugs, never mind long-term care or other retirement needs or wants. Fidelity Investments estimates that the average married couple retiring this year at age 65 need $220,000 to cover health costs throughout retirement. That has actually fallen from last year\u2019s estimate of $240,000 because of lower-than-expected Medicare spending, Fidelity said; also, people have cut back on medical care during the lackluster economy, and increases in payments to doctors and health plans have slowed under the Affordable Care Act. But the number is still daunting.\n\nAdjusting some of the assumptions used to arrive at the estimate can also make the amount grow substantially.\n\nConsider: The estimate assumes the couple have traditional coverage under Medicare, the federal health plan for those over 65, which means they are sharing in the cost of their medical care through premiums, deductibles and coinsurance (your share of the cost after you meet your deductible). Most people don\u2019t pay a premium for Part A, which covers hospital care; but almost everyone pays a premium for Part B, which covers doctor\u2019s visits and other care. The estimate also factors in premiums and co-payments for prescription drug coverage, known as Medicare Part D.\n\n(About a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have private Medicare Advantage plans, which offer lower out-of-pocket costs and restricted doctor networks; having such a plan would lower the estimate.)\n\nThe estimate assumes the couple have no employer-provided retiree coverage to help pay for care, but does factor in \u201cMedigap\u201d coverage that many beneficiaries buy to help budget for some of the costs that traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover. Sunit Patel, senior vice president of Fidelity\u2019s Benefits Consulting group, said the estimate doesn\u2019t assume a specific type of gap insurance. But having a \u201cless generous\u201d supplemental plan, he said, could mean your individual costs would exceed the average.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe couple are assumed to be of average health, based on medical claims. (The numbers come from a sample of anonymous claims released each year by Medicare.) It does include costs for vision tests, glasses and hearing aids, which aren\u2019t covered by Medicare; but it doesn\u2019t include any costs for over-the-counter drugs or dental care, neither of which Medicare covers. Significantly, it doesn\u2019t include any costs for long-term care \u2014 help at home or in an institution with daily tasks like eating, bathing and dressing, when you can no longer do those things yourself.\n\nThe estimate expects the man to live 17 more years, to age 82, while the woman is expected to live 20 more years, to 85.\n\nEric Ross, a financial planner with Truepoint in Cincinnati, said the $220,000 estimate could be low, based on the life expectancies used. \u201cWith a healthy couple at 65,\u201d he said, \u201cwe like to plan into their early 90s.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, assuming a longer life span adds to the cost, Mr. Patel said. If the husband and wife live to be 92 and 94, the estimate balloons to $355,000.\n\nSomeone with higher-than-average health claims might also need more money. On the other hand, the person might die sooner because of illness, which would tend to lower lifetime costs.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131119181849, "twitter": {"description": "The share of medical costs shouldered by retirees is growing, highlighting the need to save a lot more now.", "title": "You Plan Your Retirement, Then You Get the Health Bill", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/you-plan-your-retirement-then-you-get-the-health-bill.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002559849"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/you-plan-your-retirement-then-you-get-the-health-bill.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002559849", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/you-plan-your-retirement-then-you-get-the-health-bill.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "hdl_p": "You Plan Your Retirement, Then You Get the Health Bill", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 19, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Elderly,Retirement,Long-Term Care Insurance,Nursing Homes,Medicare,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Elder Care,Fidelity Investments,Employee Benefit Research Institute,American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "news_keywords": "Old age,Retirement,Medicare", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ann Carrns", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ANN CARRNS", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The share of medical costs shouldered by retirees is growing, highlighting the need to save a lot more now.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The share of medical costs shouldered by retirees is growing, highlighting the need to save a lot more now.", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 19, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_carrns/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance", "published": "2013-11-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "slug": "20SPEND", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160101182503, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/you-plan-your-retirement-then-you-get-the-health-bill.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The share of medical costs shouldered by retirees is growing, highlighting the need to save a lot more now.", "title": "You Plan Your Retirement, Then You Get the Health Bill"}, "pdate": 20131119, "des": "Elder Care", "articleid": 100000002559849, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "You Plan Your Retirement, Then You Get the Health Bill", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1822\"", "article_summary": "But it does suggest that most need to think about saving a lot more for health costs in retirement.\nFidelity Investments estimates that the average married couple retiring this year at age 65 need $220,000 to cover health costs throughout retirement.\nBut the prospect of paying for health costs after he retires weighs on him.\n\u201cWithin health care,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s all kinds of uncertainties.\u201dMr. Strack hasn\u2019t decided yet when he\u2019ll stop working full time.\nBut he doesn\u2019t expect any retiree health coverage from his employer, which now provides insurance for him and his wife, Penny, a retired educator."}
