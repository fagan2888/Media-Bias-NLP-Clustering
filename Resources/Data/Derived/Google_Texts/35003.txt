Jacob Murillo, 23, received a temporary prosthetic foot and lower leg after his surgery at University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, where part of his lower left leg was amputated to remove the cancer.

More than 400 people gathered Sunday afternoon for a fundraiser at Wellman's Pub and Rooftop in West Des Moines.

They raised nearly $98,000 in the fundraiser and auction called "The Struggle," which will help Murillo and his family offset his medical expenses.

“Feels really good to be out here. It’s definitely overwhelming, especially with all the people here -- feels good to be back home, and back with people I’m familiar with and just getting some normalcy back, you know,” Murillo said.

Murillo had a rare soft-tissue tumor called myxoid liposarcoma, which called for amputating his leg below the knee.

The 23-year-old expects to receive a permanent prosthetic in one month.
