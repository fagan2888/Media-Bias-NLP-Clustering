He wore an \u201cI Love LA\u201d shirt and warbled that song on national TV to pay off a bet. He even donned a pirate outfit \u2014 puffy shirt and all \u2014 to join his equally outlandishly costumed family for a hipster parade in Brooklyn.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio is not afraid to be bold \u2014 and, at times, downright goofy \u2014 in his appearance and manner, creating an approachable persona that is a stark contrast to his predecessor, buttoned-up billionaire Michael Bloomberg. It\u2019s an everyman image that experts say meshes with de Blasio\u2019s populist politics, a liberal call to reach out to poor and working-class New Yorkers who felt left behind by the city\u2019s growing income inequality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy from Brooklyn who happened to be elected mayor who likes hanging out with his wife and talking about his kids,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant. \u201cPeople can relate to that, and, for some, it\u2019ll be easier when he has to bear bad news.\u201d\n\nAlthough anyone with the ambition to lead the nation\u2019s largest city clearly possesses some ego, de Blasio \u2014 a Democrat who took office in January \u2014 has repeatedly shown that he doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. He misses few opportunities at what reporters have labeled \u201cdad humor,\u201d such as the time he offered to do a mock strip tease when asked how many layers he was wearing on a snowy day. The 6-foot-5 de Blasio also can\u2019t help but poke fun at the relative shortness of his aides.\n\nAfter successfully navigating his first city budget negotiations and Albany legislative session, de Blasio has repeatedly embraced the lighter side of his job. When the New York Rangers lost the Stanley Cup Finals to the Los Angeles Kings in June, he made good on a bet he made with his Californian counterpart and appeared on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d singing \u2014 badly \u2014 the Randy Newman love song to the City of Angels.\n\nLater that month, he donned a bright purple shirt, sunglasses and a rainbow tie to march in the city\u2019s massive gay pride parade alongside his wife, Chirlane McCray. But that outfit, which drew cheers from throngs from onlookers, was far from his most adventurous of the month.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s teenage children, Dante and Chiara, were named King Neptune and Queen Mermaid for the Coney Island Mermaid Parade, an annual rambunctious march attended by thousands of people, many in revealing costumes. Chiara, a 19-year-old college student, sported blue-green body paint, a gold and turquoise dress and a crown adorned with shells. Sixteen-year-old Dante wore blue body paint paired with a fishnet toga-style outfit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "title": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "title": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/13/nyc_mayor_bill_de_blasio_isnt_afraid_to_be_goofy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/nyc-mayor-image.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "title": "NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/nyc-mayor-image.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Lemire", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab42\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 He sported a rainbow tie for the Gay Pride Parade.\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio is not afraid to be bold \u2014 and, at times, downright goofy \u2014 in his appearance and manner, creating an approachable persona that is a stark contrast to his predecessor, buttoned-up billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\nHe even donned a pirate outfit \u2014 puffy shirt and all \u2014 to join his equally outlandishly costumed family for a hipster parade in Brooklyn.\nHe wore an \u201cI Love LA\u201d shirt and warbled that song on national TV to pay off a bet.\nAfter successfully navigating his first city budget negotiations and Albany legislative session, de Blasio has repeatedly embraced the lighter side of his job."}
