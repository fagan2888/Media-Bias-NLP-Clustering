He is probably already helping him in other states.\n\nIn 2014, Missouri GOP Chairman and RNC member Ed Martin, protested Barbour\u2019s tactics in the Mississippi U.S. Senate primary and asked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to appoint an investigative task force on disreputable campaign conduct, but no investigative task force was appointed, and no action was taken to condemn disreputable campaign tactics, or against Barbour, the nephew of former RNC Chairman and Mississippi Governor, Haley Barbour. Martin is now Executive Director of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum, a conservative and pro-family interest group. In February, Schlafly, one of the architects of the modern conservative movement and an opponent of mass immigration, said that Marco Rubio should be disqualified from the presidential race for dishonesty, Rubio having said one thing about amnesty in English and another in Spanish. Rubio, nevertheless, was able to dodge the well-documented accusation in the last debate, just as he has successfully dodged answering the few serious questions about the Schumer-Rubio amnesty bill of 2013 and his recent legislation, the I-Squared Act, which by tangled language allows for massive increases in H-!B foreign technical workers from 65,000 to 255,000 per year. Fox and other TV networks have consistently thrown soft balls to Rubio in debates and hardballs especially to Trump but also to Cruz.\n\nIn her recent book, Sold Out, dealing with the betrayal of America\u2019s best and brightest workers, Michelle Malkin, details the utter dishonesty of both of Rubio\u2019s legislative bills. The I-Squared bill, which Malkin points out really means \u201cI\u2019m screwed\u201d for American workers, would also continue the moral outrage of directly replacing American workers with cheaper H-1B foreign workers. This recently happened in Florida, where Disney workers being laid off actually had to train their foreign replacements to receive a termination bonus.\n\nMarco Rubio and Henry Barbour believe in amnesty and are birds of the same feather in campaign rhetoric and tactics.\n\nTrump and Cruz had better be alert for dishonest tactics including ethically questionable push- polls and robo-calls in the 2016 Florida primary. In fact, all voters everywhere should be alert to such disreputable tactics.\n\nHere is a condensed and slightly revised version of my 2014 article:\n\nWill Mississippi Primary Unravel GOP? Time to Rediscover Our Principles.\n\n\u201cThe ripple effect of questionable campaign tactics used by some of the Republican establishment supporters of incumbent U.S. Senator Thad Cochran against his challenger, Republican State Senator Chris McDaniel, is beginning to look more like the early stages of a moral hurricane threatening GOP unity and hopes in 2016.\n\nLike South Carolina, Mississippi is an open primary state. Registered voters participate in whatever primary they choose but are prohibited in voting in runoffs, if they voted in the other party\u2019s initial primary. This has resulted in extensive opposing party manipulation of Republican primary results. In both South Carolina and Mississippi, it was Democrat oriented voters crossing over to influence the 2014 Republican primary. In South Carolina, cross-over voting and $8.5 million from pro-amnesty Pacs allowed, Lindsey Graham, one of the GOP\u2019s most liberal U.S. Senators to beat three formidable conservative opponents. Graham got 56 percent of the vote. Due to cross-overs, only 113,000 voted in the Democratic Primary, down 75,000 from the 2010 primary.\n\nA huge part of the national background on this was a full-court press by powerful Republican establishment leaders; including the Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), Reince Priebus; the Speaker of the House, John Boehner; the recently defeated Republican House Leader, Eric Cantor; and the four Republican members of the Senate Gang-of-Eight\u2014John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and Jeff Flake\u2013authors of a Senate amnesty bill legalizing at least 11 million unlawful immigrants. Slipped into this bill were provisions that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says will bring in at least 20 million additional legal foreign workers over the next decade. The last four senators have been crying that there is a labor shortage, even though 20 million Americans want a full-time job and cannot find one. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) also just released a report confirming that the entire net gain of 5.7 million in U.S. employment since 2000 went to immigrants. U.S. born workers suffered a net employment loss of 127,000 over the same period. In addition, 7.5 million workers were reduced from full-time to part-time.\n\nIn Mississippi, the conduct of Cochran\u2019s campaign staff and supporters may have reached a new low in Republican ethical standards. Literature was distributed saying that McDaniel\u2019s Tea Party supporters wanted to stop blacks from voting. The British Daily Mail reported that one \u201ccommercial\u201d or robo-call tried to connect McDaniel to an alleged supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. The narrative of this \u201ccommercial\u201d included this sentence: \u201cIf the Tea Party with their racist ideas win, we will be set back to the \u201850s and \u201960s.\u201d The ad further warned that voting for McDaniel could mean losing food stamps, school lunches, and other government programs. Another robo-call voiced by a woman began: \u201cThe time has come to say no to the Tea Party, no to their disrespectful treatment of the first African-American President.\u201d\n\nAlso according to the Daily Mail, the ads were tagged \u201cpaid for by Citizens for Progress,\u201d which is not listed with the Federal Elections Commission. The name has been used before, however, by Atlanta Pastor Mitzi Bickers, who is on the payroll of Mississippi Conservatives a \u201cSuper-PAC\u201d created by former Mississippi Governor and prominent amnesty/cheap labor lobbyist, Haley Barbour, and run by his nephew, Henry Barbour. The largest donors to Mississippi Conservatives are liberals. Henry Barbour has admitted hiring Bickers to do robo-calls, but has denied running any racially charged commercials. Allegations of cash vote buying also surfaced. In addition, McDaniel alleged that there was significant illegal primary voting. Run-off voting was up 40 percent in heavily black counties.\n\nDisreputable campaign tactics win many elections, but it is a vital national interest to punish rather than reward unethical campaign tactics.\n\n\u201cAn honest man is the noblest work of God\u201d\n\n\u2013Alexander Pope (1688-1744)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Disreputable campaign tactics win many elections, but it is a vital national interest to punish rather than reward unethical campaign tactics.\nHere is a condensed and slightly revised version of my 2014 article:Will Mississippi Primary Unravel GOP?\nIn both South Carolina and Mississippi, it was Democrat oriented voters crossing over to influence the 2014 Republican primary.\nThis has resulted in extensive opposing party manipulation of Republican primary results.\n\u201cThe ripple effect of questionable campaign tactics used by some of the Republican establishment supporters of incumbent U.S."}
