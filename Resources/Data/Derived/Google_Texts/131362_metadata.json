Despite a virtually unbroken litany of terror, war, and disease since ancient times, we have survived\u2014and thrived. \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014\n\nWe live in a scary world. We can\u2019t completely control how scary it gets, but we can control how scared we get. #HopeOverFear \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014\n\nYes, they want you to be afraid, but evidently not of the things that can really harm you. #HopeOverFear \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014\n\nThat last tweet came after Brazile retweeted a story about the new Ebola case in Texas.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, \u201cthey want you to be afraid\u201d but you shouldn\u2019t be. Because Ebola isn\u2019t dangerous, even though it was transmitted to a health care worker in Texas.\n\nOr something.\n\nIt\u2019s Donna Brazile.
