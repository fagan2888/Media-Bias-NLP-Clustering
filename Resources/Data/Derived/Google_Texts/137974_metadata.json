Until now, attention has focused on the individual insurance market: people buying coverage for themselves and their families from insurance companies. Policies have been canceled because they don\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But the individual market is small, representing about 5 percent of the non-elderly population . But cancellations, under today\u2019s law, will ultimately spread to the largest insurance market: employer-provided coverage.\n\nSo Chapter Two of the broken promise looms. In 2012, 171 million Americans received health insurance from their employers, reports the Census Bureau. This dwarfs Medicaid (51 million) and Medicare (49 million), the next largest sources. Given the ACA\u2019s complexity, it\u2019s hard to know how many Americans with employer coverage might be hit with policy cancellations. But plausible assumptions suggest between 25 million and 50 million, mostly at small firms.\n\nJust because policies are canceled, of course, doesn\u2019t mean people lose insurance. Gary Claxton of the Kaiser Family Foundation says that modest modifications \u2014 presumably at some extra cost \u2014 might bring many plans into ACA compliance. Still, it seems increasingly clear that the ACA was sold on a premise that simply isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe debate\u2019s tenor was that the coverage mandated by the law would be an add-on to the status quo. As the president said, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d The pledge was not a one-time exaggeration but a regular part of the administration\u2019s pitch.\n\nThe White House faced a dilemma. On the one hand, it didn\u2019t want to scare people satisfied with their insurance; they had to be reassured. On the other, it wanted to define some basic level of \u201cessential benefits\u201d provided by insurance; otherwise, individuals and firms could buy flimsy policies to comply with the law\u2019s insurance mandates. So, for example, the ACA imposes an upper limit on patient deductibles: $2,000 for single coverage, $4,000 for a family. Policies with higher deductibles generally would not comply with the ACA.\n\nBut the goals collide: The stricter the standards for mandated coverage, the harder it becomes for existing policies to comply \u2014 and the more likely they\u2019ll be canceled. That\u2019s now happening in the individual market. For legal reasons, most potential cancellations in the employer market are probably at least a year away.\n\nThe employer market divides into two parts. Most big firms (the IBMs, Procter & Gambles) self-insure. They define workers\u2019 benefits and pay the costs directly. The ACA largely exempts these plans from the \u201cessential benefits\u201d standards on the apparent assumption that the plans are generous. When the president said people wouldn\u2019t lose their existing coverage, he was probably referring to self-insured firms. About 60 percent of workers with employer-provided insurance receive it from these companies, according to government figures.\n\nThe other 40 percent get it from mostly smaller firms that buy coverage from insurance companies. The ACA \u201cgrandfathered\u201d policies that existed when the law was passed. People could (as Obama promised) keep those plans, even if they didn\u2019t meet the law\u2019s standards. But there was a big catch that largely nullifies this protection: Minor changes to existing policies would cause firms to lose their \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status. Not surprisingly, that\u2019s happened. In 2014, perhaps three-quarters of small firms (fewer than 100 workers) will no longer be grandfathered, estimates economist Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nHow many people might be affected by cancellations is unclear. Veuger\u2019s estimate of vulnerable firms implies a maximum of about 50 million workers and dependents, but it could be much lower. Still, even half of that would be a lot. Cancellations won\u2019t hit immediately, because the administration allowed firms to renew existing policies through most of 2014. Interestingly, though the ACA doesn\u2019t require firms with fewer than 50 full-time workers to provide insurance, they must comply with the ACA\u2019s standards if they do buy it. This might cause some firms to drop coverage.\n\nEmbarrassed by cancellations in the individual market, the White House has urged states \u2014 which approve insurance policies \u2014 to allow old policies to be renewed for another year. It has also requested a further extension of existing policies in the small-employer market. Most states are considering the requests. Meanwhile, it\u2019s an open question whether the ACA would have been enacted if its supporters had acknowledged that millions of Americans couldn\u2019t keep their old plans.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, obamacare, affordable care act, private ensurance, you can keep your plan, employer-provided insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "More people can\u2019t keep their health-care plans.", "title": "Robert Samuelson: More people can\u2019t keep their health-care plans", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-more-people-cant-keep-their-health-care-plans/2013/11/26/4c43eee4-56b6-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/18/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2013-11-15T205747Z_01_WASW209_RTRIDSP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-1661.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-more-people-cant-keep-their-health-care-plans/2013/11/26/4c43eee4-56b6-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, obamacare, affordable care act, private ensurance, you can keep your plan, employer-provided insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4c43eee4-56b6-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "More people can\u2019t keep their health-care plans."}, "article_summary": "Until now, attention has focused on the individual insurance market: people buying coverage for themselves and their families from insurance companies.\nThe ACA largely exempts these plans from the \u201cessential benefits\u201d standards on the apparent assumption that the plans are generous.\nBut cancellations, under today\u2019s law, will ultimately spread to the largest insurance market: employer-provided coverage.\nVeuger\u2019s estimate of vulnerable firms implies a maximum of about 50 million workers and dependents, but it could be much lower.\nIt has also requested a further extension of existing policies in the small-employer market."}
