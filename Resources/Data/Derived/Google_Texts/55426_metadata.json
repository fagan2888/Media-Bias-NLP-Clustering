For Belgium\u2019s national team, Kompany is the most accomplished of an emergent generation of superbly skilled players, responsible for forging individual talent into a cohesive group.\n\nMany consider Belgium a dark horse in the World Cup, even if its attack has been more plodding than alluring so far.\n\nPhoto\n\nDefensively, the Red Devils conceded a lone goal \u2014 on a penalty kick \u2014 in the group phase.\n\n\u201cVincent is a natural-born leader,\u201d his fellow defender Jan Vertonghen said. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader on and off the pitch. That\u2019s how everyone sees him. He\u2019s not fake. He\u2019s like the father of the team, taking care of everything and everyone.\u201d\n\nYet Kompany has also been frequently unavailable because of injury. According to Le Soir, a French-language Belgian newspaper, he has missed 700 days to injury during his 11-year professional career with his club and national teams. Another newspaper, L\u2019Avenir, calculated that Kompany\u2019s 61 appearances for Belgium might have been 100 by now, except for 39 absences, many because of injury.\n\nDuring World Cup qualifying, Belgium won three away games without Kompany. Belgium\u2019s team doctor suggested to Le Soir that as Kompany had built his body to accommodate the physical play and demanding schedule of the Premier League, he might have inadvertently become more susceptible to injury, though no more so than any other player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen as the leader of the band,\u201d said Marc Degryse, a newspaper columnist and retired forward who played in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups for Belgium. \u201cHe\u2019s a motivator. He\u2019s really aware of his responsibility of taking his team forward. That\u2019s his only weak point. He has to stay fit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe son of an activist who left the Democratic Republic of Congo as a political refugee, Kompany was born in Brussels and made his first appearance for the Belgian national team at 17. It was not his dream simply to play in the World Cup, he told reporters recently. It was his dream to perform.\n\n\u201cI want to prove something,\u201d he said.\n\nIt may be hard to believe now, but as a teenager, Kompany could be casual toward training, arriving late and sometimes appearing indifferent, said Eddy Snelders, who was an assistant coach for Belgium in Kompany\u2019s early years. But as he moved up the club-team ladder from Anderlecht to Hamburg to Manchester City, his resolve matured with his skills.\n\n\u201cHe was not the same Vincent Kompany as he is now,\u201d Snelders said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking much more responsibility and he\u2019s much stricter in his behavior.\u201d\n\nAnd he has developed a social conviction, perhaps unsurprising for someone whose father fled to Belgium after being imprisoned for protesting against the protracted Congolese dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko.\n\nPierre Kompany, his father, later drove a taxi in Brussels and put himself through school to become an engineer, according to news accounts.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140629195649, "twitter": {"description": "Vincent Kompany is the leader of the
