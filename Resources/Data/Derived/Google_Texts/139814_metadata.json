A week later, it acknowledged the second intrusion of the security clearance data, but the agency took another month to figure out the total number of people affected.\n\nAlmost all of the 4.2 million in the initial breach have been notified, the OPM said. Roughly 3.6 million people were hit by both breaches.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The OPM is working with federal agencies to set up a centralized system.", "description": "The OPM is working with federal agencies to set up a centralized system.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The OPM is working with federal agencies to set up a centralized system.", "title": "OPM hack notifications could take weeks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247968-opm-hack-notifications-could-take-weeks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/opm_060514getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247968-opm-hack-notifications-could-take-weeks", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-15T08:02-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T08:02:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247968-opm-hack-notifications-could-take-weeks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The OPM is working with federal agencies to set up a centralized system.", "card": "summary", "title": "OPM hack notifications could take weeks"}, "dcterms.title": "OPM hack notifications could take weeks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a90\"", "article_summary": "The OPM initially said in early June that it had been hit by a breach that exposed 4.2 million federal workers\u2019 personnel files.\nIt could be weeks before the federal government notifies the 21.5 million people whose personal information was exposed by a breach in the government\u2019s security clearance database.\nAlmost all of the 4.2 million in the initial breach have been notified, the OPM said.\nThe OPM will eventually look to hire an outside contractor to help with the eventual outreach but has not yet requested bids.\nA week later, it acknowledged the second intrusion of the security clearance data, but the agency took another month to figure out the total number of people affected."}
