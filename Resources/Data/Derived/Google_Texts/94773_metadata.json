It\u2019s not going to create a single job, raise anyone\u2019s wages or strengthen our families,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton\u2019s keynote address Thursday night at the conference in New York City had been planned before she launched her campaign, a spokesperson for her campaign said.\n\nWith the second week of her candidacy reaching its end, Clinton has thus far avoided attacking Republicans and instead focused on her small-grain campaign rollout in Iowa and New Hampshire, where she spoken at roundtables, visited factories and local businesses.\n\nRead more: How New Hampshire\u2019s Women Paved the Way for Hillary Clinton\n\nWhen Republicans last weekend impugned Clinton for controversies surrounding her philanthropies acceptance of foreign donations, she called the attacks \u201cdistractions.\u201d\n\nClinton said earlier this week in New Hampshire she wants to rise above partisan attacks during her campaign. \u201cI am tired of people running to elect their fellow citizens by being nasty to each other,\u201d she said at a house party in Claremont, New Hampshire. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t solve a problem. Enough with the attacks and the anger, let\u2019s find answers together and figure out what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nNow, however, as her campaign ramps up, Clinton appears ready to offer more direct criticism over GOP policies.\n\n\u201cWe have to have leaders who recognize that the time has come. There are those who offer themselves as leaders who see nothing wrong with denying women equal pay,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cor would defund the country\u2019s leading provider of family planning, and want to let health insurance companies charge women once again just because of our gender\u201d \u2014 a reference to Republican efforts to defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t leadership,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Hillary Clinton made her first substantial criticism of GOP policies at a speech Thursday in New York City", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "She criticized Republican stances on Obamacare and immigration.", "title": "Clinton Makes First Attacks on GOP", "url": "http://time.com/3833801/hillary-clinton-immigration-obamacare/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hillary-clinton10.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hillary-clinton10.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Clinton Makes First Attacks on GOP", "description": "She criticized Republican stances on Obamacare and immigration.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "hillary clinton, 2016 election, immigration, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, 2016 election, immigration, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ed2\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton aimed the first substantial attacks of her new candidacy at Republican policies during a speech in New York City on Thursday, criticizing the GOP on immigration, health care and the delayed nomination of Loretta Lynch to Attorney General.\nEnough with the attacks and the anger, let\u2019s find answers together and figure out what we\u2019re going to do.\u201dNow, however, as her campaign ramps up, Clinton appears ready to offer more direct criticism over GOP policies.\nIt\u2019s not going to create a single job, raise anyone\u2019s wages or strengthen our families,\u201d she said.\nClinton\u2019s keynote address Thursday night at the conference in New York City had been planned before she launched her campaign, a spokesperson for her campaign said.\nRead more: How New Hampshire\u2019s Women Paved the Way for Hillary ClintonWhen Republicans last weekend impugned Clinton for controversies surrounding her philanthropies acceptance of foreign donations, she called the attacks \u201cdistractions.\u201dClinton said earlier this week in New Hampshire she wants to rise above partisan attacks during her campaign."}
