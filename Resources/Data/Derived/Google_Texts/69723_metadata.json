The federal government, meanwhile, is still struggling to make HealthCare.gov, the portal that serves states without their own exchanges, a viable Web site.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake: A well-designed Web site was critical for the state to serve more than a million New Yorkers that are expected to apply for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nStates that run their own health care exchanges, including New York, Kentucky and Nevada, have fared better in managing the load of insurance sign-ups mandated by the Affordable Care Act, compared with the federal insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov, which has struggled due to software bugs, inadequate testing and insufficient server capacity at launch.\n\nAs of Dec. 3, more than 91,000 New Yorkers had enrolled in health insurance plans through the state HIX and 284,000 people have completed applications and are eligible for insurance, New York State of Health reported.\n\nIn June 2012, primary contractor Computer Sciences Corp., which built the state\u2019s Medicaid management systems, began working on developing a \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d Web-based exchange for New York State. The state required the contractor to implement a UI architecture by design consultancy Ideo.\n\n\u201cExtensive planning, organization, coordination and execution within the department and among its contractors and stakeholders are of utmost importance to ensure success of a project of this magnitude,\u201d Donna Frescatore, executive director for NY State of Health, told CruxialCIO in an email. \u201cAs a result of these efforts, the NY State of Health marketplace is operating very smoothly.\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s technology backbone consists of IBM Websphere Application Server, which is compliant with the Java 2 Enterprise Edition API and runtime environment.\n\nCSC broke the project down into a series of tracks, releases and builds. Each build in the site was tested independently, and multiple tracks included shop, plan management, small business, eligibility and enrollment, oversight and reporting, customer service and communications.\n\n\u201cFrom a reliability and performance perspective, those things are absolutely critical because the citizens of New York are going to be using it for their insurance,\u201d CSC project manager Chris Harmer said in an interview.\n\nPerformance testing began in June 2012. The contractor tested for thread capability with regard to regression, Harmer said. Regression testing is a type of software testing aimed at finding new software bugs, or regressions. \u201cTesting proceeded on an incremental path as well but included regression testing,\u201d Harmer said.\n\nThe exchange comprises 40 interfaces that connect to the system.\n\n\u201cWhat strikes most people about exchanges is that they are very complex and have a lot of touch points,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cThe reliability must extend not only from the information provided by the insurers but also all the touch points where you\u2019re pulling data, including the applicant information.\u201d\n\nNYSoH connects with the federal Data Services Hub as well as agencies such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service to verify income information.\n\nBefore going live, what helped CSC and the state pull the project together was the realization that the Oct. 1 deadline set by the federal government was \u201cimmovable,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cYou have to be aware that you have a date that\u2019s not going to move so you need to box everything into that time,\u201d Harmer said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxialcio.com/new-york-health-exchange-model-feds-2937", "type": "article", "site_name": "CruxialCIO", "description": "On Oct. 1, 2013, New York State of Health, the Empire State\u2019s health insurance exchange (HIX), went live.
