But Tulsa then seemed to fall asleep, and Little Rock caught fire. The result was a 64-60 Golden Hurricane loss in front of a mostly quiet crowd of 3,821 at the Reynolds Center.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

Once they are making their run, we missed open shots, and we weren\u2019t able to get stops consistently.\u201d\n\nTulsa (4-2) led by double digits much of the first half, and by as many as 15 points, at 26-11. The Golden Hurricane took a 33-24 lead into halftime in what was the fewest points they had allowed in the first half all season.\n\nBut the Golden Hurricane\u2019s offense went dormant in the second half, and Little Rock seemed like it couldn\u2019t miss. The Trojans hit 6 of 7 3-pointers in the second half, and 14 of 22 shots from the field (63.6 percent) after halftime.\n\n\u201cThey made some really tough shots, give them credit,\u201d Haith said. \u201cTough shots over guys\u2019 hands, 28-footers, That happens.\u201d\n\nLittle Rock (5-0) shouldn\u2019t have been taken lightly despite going 13-18 last season. First-year coach Chris Beard\u2019s team gained attention earlier this season with a victory at San Diego State, a team that won an NCAA Tournament game last season.\n\nTulsa was led by James Woodard with 16 points, followed by 14 from D\u2019Andre Wright, and 11 by Rashad Ray.\n\nShaquille Harrison had only four points, however, and Pat Birt, averaging 10.8 points coming into the game, was held scoreless.\n\nThe key for the school formerly known as Arkansas-Little Rock was stopping Harrison, Tulsa\u2018s leading scorer with a 23.4 average coming into the game. Harrison was credited with only one field-goal attempt \u2014 a 3-pointer. He got fouled driving to the basket a few times, but he couldn\u2019t knock down his free throws, either, hitting only 4 of 10 from the line.\n\nWith the Little Rock defense sagging off Tulsa shooters, daring them to shoot from the outside, TU continually missed open shots, especially in the second half. Tulsa made only 9 of 31 from behind the arc for the game (29 percent).\n\n\u201cWe did get some good looks; we just didn\u2019t make them,\u201d Haith said. \u201cWe have to fix some things defensively.\n\nTulsa saw its nine-point halftime lead turn into a 36-33 deficit. Tulsa finally broke the 15-0 run that went back to the first half, and reclaimed the lead by as many as four points, 42-38, at just over the midway point in the second half.\n\nBut Little Rock\u2019s Josh Hagins kept making shots. He led the Trojans with 17 points and eight rebounds.\n\nLittle Rock took the lead back for good at 51-49 with 7:18 remaining on a layup by Hagins.\n\nTulsa trailed by as many as seven points with just under two minutes left, but it still had a chance to tie the game with a 3-pointer in the final minute. But a Tulsa turnover and basket by the Trojans followed, and Tulsa was doomed.\n\n\u201cOnce we took the lead, once we got back into the game, that\u2019s when we needed to clamp down our defense, and we weren\u2019t able to do that,\u201d Haith said.\n\nThe Trojans shot 63.6 percent from the field in the second half and outscored the Hurricane 40-27.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Golden Hurricane struggle on offense and defense in second half", "title": "Second-half slump dooms Tulsa men in loss to Little Rock", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/second-half-slump-dooms-tulsa-men-in-loss-to-little/article_61f4ba32-13ed-5cc9-ac2f-6bb806d5a91e.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/7c/a7cbcf63-70f9-5bf1-9ef8-64775ba78323/565a45f8b47c8.image.jpg?resize=821%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Golden Hurricane struggle on offense and defense in second half", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "tulsa golden hurricane basketball,tulsa golden hurricane men s basketball,tulsa metropolitan area,tulsa,tulsa oklahoma,frank haith,tulsa golden hurricane,reynolds center,first year coach,james woodard,shaquille harrison,ncaa tournament,josh hagins,tu coach,chris beard,ncaa,arkansas,pat birt,andre wright,rashad ray,energy,tuhomepage2,sportsextra,collegebasketball,tu,mensbasketball,tusportsextra", "news_keywords": "tulsa golden hurricane basketball,tulsa golden hurricane men s basketball,tulsa metropolitan area,tulsa,tulsa oklahoma,frank haith,tulsa golden hurricane,reynolds center,first year coach,james woodard,shaquille harrison,ncaa tournament,josh hagins,tu coach,chris beard,ncaa,arkansas,pat birt,andre wright,rashad ray,energy,tuhomepage2,sportsextra,collegebasketball,tu,mensbasketball,tusportsextra"}, "article_summary": "But the Golden Hurricane\u2019s offense went dormant in the second half, and Little Rock seemed like it couldn\u2019t miss.\nLittle Rock took the lead back for good at 51-49 with 7:18 remaining on a layup by Hagins.\nBut Tulsa then seemed to fall asleep, and Little Rock caught fire.\nWith the Little Rock defense sagging off Tulsa shooters, daring them to shoot from the outside, TU continually missed open shots, especially in the second half.\nWhen Tulsa basketball fans looked at the schedule for the 2015-16 season and saw a home game against Little Rock, many probably automatically penciled in a win in their minds."}
