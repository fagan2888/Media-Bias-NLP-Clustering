Sponsored by PBS and AOL, the conference heard from a veritable who\u2019s who of respected women leaders from Gwen Ifill to Ellen DeDeneres to Carol Burnett to, well, Gloria Steinem.\n\nAlong with many Catholic women of my generation, I am a big fan of Steinem. She is modest, calm, reasoned, and strong. She leads a movement that is changing the lives of women worldwide for the better. After Aniston asked her \u201cWhat do you think the biggest problem with feminism today is? Steinem named religion as one of three \u201cbiggest problems\u201d after anti-feminism and income disparity: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t talk about enough is religion. I think that spirituality is one thing. But religion is just politics in the sky. I think we really have to talk about it. Because it gains power from silence.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure I agree that religion is \u201cjust politics in the sky\u201d one can easily see why Steinem might believe it. Look at the political flak American sisters experienced from church leaders for supporting expanded access to healthcare for low income people. U.S. bishops opposed the Affordable Care Act because of the quintessentially \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d of access to family planning. Would anyone deny that the \u201cpolitics of religion\u201d influenced this struggle? Not me. And then the sisters were criticized for being \u201cradical feminists\u201d (whatever that is) to boot.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza\u2019s definition of feminism quoting British suffragist Rebecca West: \u201cFeminism is the radical notion that women are people.\u201d People in the same way men are people. And that means women have the same basic human rights and responsibilities, to themselves and to the human family that men do.\n\nBut our world doesn\u2019t believe that. Up to 70 percent of women worldwide encounter violence and one in three will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her life. Six out of ten migrant women from Central America are raped on their journey to the United States. Too often civil and religious authorities look the other way or blame the victims.\n\nGet a FREE issue of NCR. You won't believe what you're missing!\n\n\n\nIf standing up for basic human rights for women makes me a \u201cradical feminist\u201d then I am proud to plead \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International has launched a new \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights are Human Rights\u201d campaign to address escalating violence and oppression against women throughout the world. They are pushing the United States to join 185 other countries and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW or the Treaty for the Rights of Women). Already the CEDAW has had far reaching influence in fostering the development of domestic violence laws in Turkey, Nepal, South Africa, and the Republic of Korea as well as anti-trafficking laws in the Ukraine and Moldova.\n\nIt is shocking that the United States is the only industrialized democracy and the only country in the Western Hemisphere that has not yet ratified this treaty. Amnesty International is encouraging calls to U.S. Senators and President Obama to ratify and implement the CEDAW. You can find out more at this link.\n\nBut I digress. To me Steinem\u2019s question could also be framed the other way: \u201cIs feminism the biggest problem facing religion today?\u201d I say this after 20 years at FutureChurch working to bring to visibility women\u2019s leadership in the early church. This fire in my belly came after watching too many women friends leave the Catholic church because they found it hopelessly chauvinist, not to say misogynist. These are not lightweight women. One had tirelessly organized diocesan-wide women\u2019s listening sessions in the 1980\u2019s to provide input for the ill-fated U.S. bishops\u2019 pastoral on women. She left after watching her work explode against a brick wall in Rome.\n\nIn the early \u201880\u2019s, U.S. bishops had truly listened to nationwide feedback from Catholic women and approved the first draft of what came to be called the \u201cwomen\u2019s pastoral.\u201d Among many other things, the bishops included the women\u2019s suggestion that \"continuing reflection, dialogue and even controversy\" on the topic of women\u2019s priestly ordination would be valuable. It also asked to open the diaconate to women.\n\nBut American bishops would encounter vigorous opposition in Rome. Nine years later, the Vatican\u2019s heavily edited fourth and final draft had not only deleted the voices of women, but also those of their own bishops. It now required for U.S. bishops to teach that Jesus deliberately chose to exclude women. To their everlasting credit, on Nov. 17, 1992, by a substantial majority and for the first time in its history, the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Conference voted against issuing the doomed pastoral.\n\nToday, many good women just won\u2019t give Catholicism the time of day. And is it any wonder?\n\nBy far the worst outcome of this wounding \u201cpolitics of religion\u201d by Catholic leaders is that it is done in the name of Jesus who never excluded anyone. Someone once asked me if I ever experienced any conflict between my feminism and my Christianity. To the contrary, I replied, my belief in Jesus gives me strength to be a good feminist.\n\nI am among those cheering Pope Francis on as he works to put more responsive and accountable structures in place in church governance. I am dismayed, however, by the apparent back-burner prioritization of women\u2019s concerns. While Cardinal Walter Kasper\u2019s recent call for women to be incorporated more fully into church hierarchy is hopeful, we have heard it all before.\n\nThe real elephant in the room is that jurisdictional authority in the church rests only with men. This is what no one wants to talk about, even though one obvious first step is to ordain women to the diaconate. Delaying the discussion of women\u2019s full equality in church ministry and decision-making comes at no small cost. We risk losing even more women, especially the next generation of wives and mothers who anchor religious belief and practice in Catholic families.\n\nWaiting to address the \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d continues to paint Jesus with the chauvinist brush of those who think they fully represent him. This at a time when feminist biblical scholarship and theology could be breaking open radiant new understandings of Jesus and the God-mystery throughout the whole church, and not only in academia. Surely it can\u2019t be that hard to convene a papal commission of feminist theologians, biblical scholars and activists, both male and female, from all over the world.\n\nRather than wait, couldn\u2019t we do what Steinem suggests? Couldn\u2019t we begin to talk about it?\n\n[A Sister of St. Joseph, Sr. Christine Schenk served urban families for 18 years as a nurse midwife before co-founding FutureChurch, where she served for 23 years.]\n\nEditor's note: We can send you an email alert every time Christine Schenk's column, Simply Spirit, is posted.
