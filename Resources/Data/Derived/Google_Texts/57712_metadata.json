Hit with serious cash flow issues, SIH is one- to two-and-a-half weeks behind on payroll and looking at closure if it can\u2019t come up with $13,000 to pay its license fee in two days.\n\nClose to 100 community members provided a lot of input as well as an impromptu fund-raising effort to cover the license. By the time a sign-up clipboard had circulated through half of the audience, a total of $7,000 was pledged with more than a dozen donors signed on with no amount specified.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t saved the ship,\u201d Jaque Hickman said. \u201cWe\u2019re still bailing. The license money is only a short-term fix.\u201d By the end of the meeting, regionalization, or partnering with other health care providers, emerged as the strongest possibility.\n\nDavid Sandberg with Focus and Execute was on hand to facilitate, but the crowd wasn\u2019t in the mood to be facilitated. Following Chief Executive Officer Lee Barron\u2019s outline of some of the complexities of rural health care under the Affordable Care Act where reimbursements lag far behind program requirements, Inyo County staff and 5th District Supervisor Matt Kingsley offered some suggestions. \u201cWe\u2019re all worried,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cWe hear the rumors of no payroll, staff leaving.\u201d He suggested saving on administrative costs through associations with Ridgecrest Regional Hospital and/or Northern Inyo Hospital.\n\nJosh Hart, planning director and Inyo\u2019s Local Agency Formation Commission officer, has already begun exploring partnering possibilities with Inyo and Mono counties\u2019 health care providers.\n\nIn the middle of Barron\u2019s outline of regulatory changes, Russ Monroe approached alleging the hospital had denied services to his daughter. Barron responded verbally and left the hall. Administrative Assistant Mary Gonzalez stepped up, explaining in more detail SIH\u2019s situation. \u201cWe just paid $69,000 for emergency room physicians,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for $13,000\u201d for the licensing fee, \u201cand $25,000 to pay for employee insurance. Our day\u2019s income was $1,500.\u201d In terms of payroll issues, Gonzalez said \u201ceverybody\u2019s (administrators) taking a hit.\u201d\n\nAs Sandberg tried to steer the meeting toward a group exercise, Hickman laid down a few rules: \u201cNo personal attacks, no personal experiences,\u201d she said. As for the exercises, \u201cwe\u2019re out of the mood.\u201d\n\nJim Suver, Ridgecrest\u2019s chief executive officer, said he had discussed collaborating with SIH with his board of directors. \u201cFirst you have to stabilize the cash flow and deal with major insurers,\u201d he said. Some of the advantages of developing partnerships, he explained, are rotating specializations on call and access to capital.\n\n\u201cThis is not about who\u2019s going to be the top hospital,\u201d said NIH\u2019s Interim CEO Kevin Flanigan. \u201cYou have to figure out how to get to a month by month situation not day to day.\u201d Flanigan\u2019s recommendations included figuring out what size hospital the district could support and then looking for partners. \u201cYou have to have partnerships with a focus on quality health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you decide what you want to do, come and talk.\u201d\n\nOther suggestions from community members and staff were forming a hospital foundation, beginning a dialogue on pending legislation and political action and looking at the hospital as a business. \u201cWe should have done this two, three, five years ago,\u201d said Doug Thompson. \u201cThe most important things are (the hospital\u2019s) employees and trust. We\u2019re losing both.\u201d Thompson also suggested looking to the county\u2019s major employers, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, all of whom send employees injured on the job to SIH and NIH.\n\nDuring her explanation of health care complexities, Barron said the hospital was losing money on emergency services and there had been a drastic shift from inpatient to outpatient care. In 2014, SIH had 179 days of inpatient care, compared to six in 2015 and the emergency room was losing money.\n\nToward the end of the meeting, ER Dr. Doug Bushell put that information into perspective. The ER doesn\u2019t just stabilize and transfer, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a frontier level hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cdoing what they would at the highest level trauma centers. We had 179 days (in 2014) with patients admitted that shouldn\u2019t have been admitted. They were put at risk.\u201d He explained criteria that required a hospital to transfer patients. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the services required, we have to transfer.\u201d In the past, SIH admitted emergency cases without the equipment or services to support them.\n\nBushell was supportive of Barron\u2019s efforts to keep the hospital open. \u201cShe\u2019s a magician,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sierra Wave: Eastern Sierra News", "description": "By Deb Murphy Tuesday evening\u2019s meeting at Lone Pine\u2019s Statham Hall was billed as a workshop to garner community input on Southern Inyo Hospital\u2019s future.
