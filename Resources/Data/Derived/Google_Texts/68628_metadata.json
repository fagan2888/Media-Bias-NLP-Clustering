Conservatives are convinced that Rogers is lying or hiding the ball or simply mistaken about the appropriations process. Citing a banal restatement of Congress\u2019 legislative powers, the conservative website Breitbart concluded that Rogers \u201cis wrong, and that Congress can in fact block funding for President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty order.\u201d\n\nBut conservatives are just talking past Rogers. Ultimately, he\u2019s saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not pick a shutdown fight,\u201d and they\u2019re replying, \u201cNo, let\u2019s do precisely that.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, in capitulation to reality, House GOP leadership weighed in on Rogers\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cThe House will vote this week on a symbolic immigration bill and then take up a two-part government funding bill next week,\u201d according to Politico, \u201ca spending bill which keeps most of the government funded through September 2015, but sets March as a deadline to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nDisenchanted Republicans are writing this plan off as a punt. But I think it\u2019s basically complete surrender.\n\nThe idea here is to remove the threat of a complete government shutdown for the rest of the fiscal year and then fight Obama over the deportation program in the spring. If Obama doesn\u2019t cave in March, the only collateral damage would be to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAs threats go, this is just about the opposite of threatening not to increase the debt limit. In a debt limit fight, the threat sounds mild\u2014even politically popular\u2014while the actual stakes are horrific. Threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security, by contrast, sounds insanely reckless, but would actually accomplish very little, and, most importantly, it would leave the deportation program completely intact.\n\nIn September of last year, DHS issued procedural guidance for agency staff (PDF) in anticipation of a government shutdown. The memorandum listed a variety of DHS functions that would be exempt\u2014i.e. that would continue to operate\u2014in the event of a funding lapse. These included Citizenship and Immigration Services, which will execute the deportation policy, but also criminal law enforcement operations, passenger processing and cargo inspection functions, Secret Service, counter-terrorism, and the select administrative personnel required to carry out these duties. In other words, DHS' core functions would continue, and most of the employees carrying out those functions would stay on the job.\n\nOther personnel including planning, research, development and support staff would be furloughed. So shutting down DHS doesn\u2019t entail zero costs, but it\u2019s a pretty toothless threat. On the other hand, it sounds like a gonzo threat to sacrifice the security of the United States on the altar of nativist immigration policy. The idea is to append a rider that deauthorizes the deferred action program to a bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security and send it off to Obama for signature. Then, if Obama vetoes it, Republicans can say he\u2019s the one who\u2019s putting America at risk.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t clear that such a bill could clear the Senate, which would leave the ball for defending the American Homeland\u2122 squarely in Republicans' court. And even if it could pass, Obama would have a much easier time communicating the nature of the GOP\u2019s threat than he did when Republicans were threatening not to increase the debt limit. I can think of few more effective ways for Republicans to re-surrender national security as an issue to Obama than by taking the Department of Homeland Security hostage like this. Yet if Boehner\u2019s leverage is illusory, then Republicans are essentially admitting that they have no good moves here, other than to kvetch about amnesty for months on end while the well-attuned Hispanic voting population watches in disgust. This is something I imagine Obama understood all along.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In the nearly two weeks since President Obama announced he would protect millions of deeply rooted immigrants from deportation, conservatives have been impressively obtuse about how they hope to respond and whether they'll try to shut down the government again.&nbsp;Republicans had hoped to use regular spending legislation\u2014which must pass before the government shuts down on December 11\u2014to fund all...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Republicans aren't punting.
