Those in the coaching profession do not look at it that way, he said.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many coaches are out there that maybe are not at a school that would help them get to a Final Four?\u201d Calipari said. \u201cThere are coaches that took teams to the Elite Eight and that\u2019s like winning the national championship for the school they were at.\n\n\u201cWe know who can coach, who is a good guy, who gets his teams better, who cares about his players,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they made it to the Final Four, great. If they didn\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t change my opinion of them.\u201d\n\nUnsung hero.According to Calipari, senior backup guard Jon Hood has played with 17 Wildcats who would make it to the NBA, not including the future pros on the current roster. Hood contributed to the team in many ways, Calipari said, especially by working hard in practice to help the starters improve.\n\n\u201cI mean, a lot of that time Jon was part of the \u2018Washington Generals,\u2019 \u201d Calipari said, referring to the foil for the always victorious Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nHood, a former Mr. Kentucky Basketball honoree, fought through an anger stage when he realized that Calipari would always bring in another band of blue-chippers that kept him on the bench.\n\n\u201cAnd then it became, \u2018You know. I\u2019m going to have fun doing this,\u2019 \u201d Calipari said. \u201cHe is so much a better player and so much fun to be around.\u201d\n\nLearning from the master. Evidently, Wisconsin players have gained more than an appreciation of X\u2019s and O\u2019s from their head coach. Ryan\u2019s sense of humor, deadpanned style, also has rubbed off.\n\n\u201cOne of our players actually made a comment as we were driving in (to AT&T Stadium): \u2018So this must be the road to the Final Four,\u2019 \u201d Ryan said with a grin.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kensler: Final Four appearances not always indicative of coaching acumen", "title": "Kensler: Final Four appearances not always indicative of coaching acumen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/05/kensler-final-four-appearances-not-always-indicative-of-coaching-acumen/", "image": {"width": 495, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140406__uconn-kevin-olliep1.jpg", "height": 421}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140406__uconn-kevin-olliep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T20:16:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:23:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s easy to rank coaches on the basis of national championships or Final Four appearances \u2014 just as NFL quarterbacks often are evaluated by their number of Super Bowls.\n\u201cDo you know how many coaches are out there that maybe are not at a school that would help them get to a Final Four?\u201d Calipari said.\n\u201cWe know who can coach, who is a good guy, who gets his teams better, who cares about his players,\u201d he added.\nWisconsin\u2019s Bo Ryan and Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari said they have thought about all the coaches who never reached a Final Four \u2014 but certainly not to slight them in any way.\nHood contributed to the team in many ways, Calipari said, especially by working hard in practice to help the starters improve."}
