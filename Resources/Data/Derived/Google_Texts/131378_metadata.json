The federal government must still wait until the end of a public review to issue its final ruling. The fight over the funds tore apart Florida's regular legislative session in late April and prompted Gov. Rick Scott to sue the federal government.\n\nThe Obama administration, hospitals and the state Senate wanted to expand Medicaid to roughly 800,000 Floridians to give them insurance directly instead of paying hospitals that care for the uninsured retroactively. But Scott and House Republicans are opposed to taking money tied to so-called Obamacare. Instead, the state will use $400 million from general revenue to funnel money to the hospitals by increasing Medicaid provider rates.\n\nScott's lawsuit accuses the Obama administration of withholding the hospital funds because the state won't expand Medicaid. In recent court documents, Scott showed no signs of withdrawing the lawsuit despite Tuesday's announcement, noting the underlying disagreement between Florida and the Obama administration remains.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TALLAHASSEE | The Obama administration and the state have reached an agreement in principle to continue funding Florida's hospital low-income pool for two more years but at a much lower cost, officials said Tuesday.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-A7968EA5-87E6-4A7A-A1AC-DDA873E34ABF-pubLL"}, "og": {"site_name": "TheLedger.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE | The Obama administration and the state have reached an agreement in principle to continue funding Florida's hospital low-income pool for two more years but at a much lower cost, officials said Tuesday.", "title": "Florida, Feds Agree To Extend LIP Funds", "url": "http://www.theledger.com/article/20150623/NEWS/150629730", "image": "http://www.theledger.com/global/images/fb/LL.png", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150623, "p": {"domain_verify": "5a74aa3de0ac0491b3d50e8c82e773ca"}, "fb": {"app_id": 161550337228215}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150629730-pubLL"}}, "keywords": "TALLAHASSEE (FL),  Politics,  Politics (general),  Article,  Update,  TALLAHASSEE (FL),  Politics,  Politics (general),  Article,  Update"}, "article_summary": "Scott's lawsuit accuses the Obama administration of withholding the hospital funds because the state won't expand Medicaid.\nIn recent court documents, Scott showed no signs of withdrawing the lawsuit despite Tuesday's announcement, noting the underlying disagreement between Florida and the Obama administration remains.\nFlorida will receive $1 billion this year \u2014 about half of what the state has been receiving \u2014 and $600 million for 2016-2017.\nInstead, the state will use $400 million from general revenue to funnel money to the hospitals by increasing Medicaid provider rates.\nTALLAHASSEE | The Obama administration and the state have reached an agreement in principle to continue funding Florida's hospital low-income pool for two more years but at a much lower cost, officials said Tuesday."}
