Stridently homophobic right-wing pundit and Fox News contributor Erick Erickson is scrapping with a fellow member of the Fox News universe again — and this time, it’s theological.

As flagged by Luke Brinker of Media Matters, Erickson engaged in a Twitter back-and-forth with Kirsten Powers over her recent USA Today column criticizing Kansas Republicans for nearly passing a bill that would make it legal for private and public sector workers to refuse to provide services to those they suspected of being gay.

Powers is an evangelical Christian, but nevertheless felt the Kansas proposal (which is being copied by Republican lawmakers throughout the country) was a mistake and would amount to a new, anti-gay form of Jim Crow. As part of her argument, Powers notes that Christians work with people they consider sinners all the time, including serving “unrepentant murders through prison ministry.”
