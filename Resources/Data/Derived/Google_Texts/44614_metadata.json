Bloomberg News\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s stock exchange on Monday began offering physical gold trades in the spot market for the first time, to help Seoul curb the transactions in the black market that deprive it of hundreds of billions of won in tax revenue each year.\n\nSouth Korea is one of the world\u2019s toughest places to tax physical gold trades, more than 60% of which go undocumented through black-market transactions valued at about $3 billion every year.\n\nThe gold spot market was launched Monday with 57 securities firms, refiners and jewelers as members. Korea Exchange Inc. said in a joint statement with the Financial Services Commission that traders would receive tax benefits as a reward for making transparent transactions in the open market.\n\nTraders on the Korea Exchange will pay no import duties on gold and also enjoy corporate- and income-tax reductions on transactions made on the trading platform. Trades that don\u2019t involve the delivery of gold bullion also won\u2019t be subject to the 10% value added tax on the exchange that applies to taking physical delivery of gold, it said.\n\nGold is traded in one-gram units and delivery is done in one-kilogram units on the spot market that runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nFSC Chairman Shin Je-yoon said in a speech that the development of the gold spot market might take \u201ca considerable amount of time as well as trials and errors\u201d but its launch was the right step to take.\n\nThe opening of the gold spot market is part of the government\u2019s efforts to boost revenue by exposing the \u201cunderground economy\u201d\u2013accounting for one quarter of the country\u2019s output\u2013to taxation.\n\nFSC data show that as much as 110 tons of gold are traded every year in South Korea, and up to 70 tons, valued at about 3.3 trillion won ($3 billion), are bought or sold without being taxed properly at home.\n\nBuying gold on the black market is a popular way to hide income or dodge taxes in South Korea. Gold owned by South Korean individuals is estimated at about 700 tons in total.\n\nDuring the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis that almost emptied the nation\u2019s foreign-exchange coffers, millions of South Koreans came forward with a total of more than 200 tons of gold to join a nationwide campaign to help the government pay back the sovereign debt.\n\nThe Bank of Korea holds 104.4 tons of gold as part of its foreign-exchange reserves.\n\nFollow Kwanwoo Jun on Twitter @Kwanwoo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nA New Car From Hyundai-But First, and Apology\n\nWired Korea Trips Over \u201990s Relic", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "South Korea\u2019s stock exchange on Monday began offering physical gold trades in the spot market for the first time, to help Seoul curb the transactions in the black market that deprive it of hundreds of billions of won in tax revenue each year.", "title": "Korea Exchange Launches Spot Gold Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/24/korea-exchange-launches-spot-gold-market/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CB225_krtgol_P_20140324043918.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Korea Exchange Launches Spot Gold Market", "description": "South Korea\u2019s stock exchange on Monday began offering physical gold trades in the spot market for the first time, to help Seoul curb the transactions in the black market that deprive it of hundreds of billions of won in tax revenue each year.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Kwanwoo Jun", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Korea Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Korea Real Time", "article.summary": "South Korea\u2019s stock exchange on Monday began offering physical gold trades in the spot market for the first time, to help Seoul curb the transactions in the black market that deprive it of hundreds of billions of won in tax revenue each year.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-24T08:50:20-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/24/korea-exchange-launches-spot-gold-market/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-KRTB-5328", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "South Korea\u2019s stock exchange on Monday began offering physical gold trades in the spot market for the first time, to help Seoul curb the transactions in the black market that deprive it of hundreds of billions of won in tax revenue each year.", "title": "Korea Exchange Launches Spot Gold Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/24/korea-exchange-launches-spot-gold-market/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CB225_krtgol_P_20140324043918.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Korea Real Time", "article.id": "BL-KRTB-5328", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-24T09:17:27-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb675\"", "article_summary": "The gold spot market was launched Monday with 57 securities firms, refiners and jewelers as members.\nThe opening of the gold spot market is part of the government\u2019s efforts to boost revenue by exposing the \u201cunderground economy\u201d\u2013accounting for one quarter of the country\u2019s output\u2013to taxation.\nBuying gold on the black market is a popular way to hide income or dodge taxes in South Korea.\nGold is traded in one-gram units and delivery is done in one-kilogram units on the spot market that runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays.\nTraders on the Korea Exchange will pay no import duties on gold and also enjoy corporate- and income-tax reductions on transactions made on the trading platform."}
