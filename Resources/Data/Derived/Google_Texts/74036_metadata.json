In their 2012 senior season, the Skeeters were 11-1 before losing to Allen in the second round of the Texas state playoffs. That season, Higgins had 69 receptions for 1,136 yards and 10 touchdowns, while Gamblin had 49 catches for 716 yards and six touchdowns. The Skeeters\u2019 quarterback, Alex Cooper, is a junior guard on the basketball team at Arkansas-Fort Smith.\n\n\u201cHe was just texting my phone,\u201d Higgins said of Cooper about an hour after the Rams improved to 6-5. \u201cHe was just saying how good of a game that I had and he wished Dameon Gamblin would get the ball more at New Mexico. He was our quarterback and he knows what both of our talents are.\u201d\n\nThe option-oriented Lobos threw the ball only 10 times Saturday, completing four, and Gamblin had two receptions for 17 yards. Higgins had eight catches for CSU, for 140 yards.\n\nPivotal period. A key sequence in the Rams\u2019 victory came when New Mexico was leading 21-20, had first-and-goal from the 10-yard line and had to settle for Zack Rogers\u2019 field-goal attempt of 23 yards, which was blocked by CSU\u2019s DeAndre Elliott. From there, the Rams went on the 87-yard drive for their game-winning touchdown.\n\nDown on the farm. The site of Saturday\u2019s game, University Stadium, is adjacent to Isotopes Park \u2014 the home of the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Rockies\u2019 Triple-A affiliate. The strange part is that while the Lobos have a baseball team (unlike Colorado State and Colorado), it plays at another smaller stadium in the same South Campus complex that also includes The Pit, the famous basketball arena.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rashard Higgins looks familiar to Lobo", "title": "Rashard Higgins looks familiar to Lobo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/rashard-higgins-looks-familiar-to-lobo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__Higginsp1.jpg", "height": 477}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__Higginsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T21:52:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:55:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "That season, Higgins had 69 receptions for 1,136 yards and 10 touchdowns, while Gamblin had 49 catches for 716 yards and six touchdowns.\nALBUQUERQUE \u2014 After Colorado State\u2019s 28-21 victory over New Mexico on Saturday, each team\u2019s top receiver \u2014 the Rams\u2019 Rashard Higgins and the Lobos\u2019 Dameon Gamblin \u2014 posed for a photo together.\n\u201cHe was just texting my phone,\u201d Higgins said of Cooper about an hour after the Rams improved to 6-5.\nIn their 2012 senior season, the Skeeters were 11-1 before losing to Allen in the second round of the Texas state playoffs.\nThe site of Saturday\u2019s game, University Stadium, is adjacent to Isotopes Park \u2014 the home of the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Rockies\u2019 Triple-A affiliate."}
