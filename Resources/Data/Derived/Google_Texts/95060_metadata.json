All times are Eastern.\n\n\n\nTop pick\n\nThe Carmichael Show (NBC, 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.): Normally we hate repeating either ourselves or our fellow What\u2019s On Tonight correspondents by elevating the same show to top pick status twice in the same week. However, we\u2019re making an exception as after a Wednesday special preview The Carmichael Show moves to its regular home on Sunday nights, and this show is good enough that all of you need to be aware of when it\u2019s on the air. It had a more conventional start to the season, but tonight it lives up to its reputation as a sitcom willing to get into serious topics and still joke about them with a discussion of the Bill Cosby controversy. Joshua Alston called it \u201cthe most prematurely talked-about episode\u201d of season two, and he\u2019s excited to see the Carmichaels have this conversation and then jump into a conversation about that conversation with his review. (He also said that he needs some more Nekeisha in this episode, so hopefully the show can do him a solid in that regard.)\n\nAlso noted\n\n30 For 30 (ESPN, 9 p.m.): If a discussion of Cosby\u2019s crimes isn\u2019t enough harsh truth for you, ESPN has you covered with their latest 30 For 30 documentary. Ten years after the Duke lacrosse rape allegations, director Marina Zenovich takes a look at the wounds caused by the incident and how things have either healed or failed to do so in the intervening decade. Noel Murray is there to offer his own diagnosis.\n\nThe Simpsons (Fox, 8 p.m.): Following in her father\u2019s footsteps, Lisa signs up to go to space with a one-way ticket on a Martian expedition. Will she answer the question if there\u2019s life on Mars? Will she ever know if she\u2019s in a best-selling show? Dennis Perkins just hopes the episode isn\u2019t a saddening bore, because he\u2019s written that ten times or more.\n\nVinyl (HBO, 9 p.m.): We\u2019d like to think that Richie knows what\u2019s best for American Century, but his plan to have dinner with one of the label\u2019s most important artists seems risky. Why? That artist\u2019s name is Hannibal, and there\u2019s a long track record of dinners with Hannibals being as dangerous as they are delicious. If the menu includes any combination of oysters, acorns, and marsala, Dan Caffrey is calling for the check immediately.\n\n\n\nThe Walking Dead (AMC, 9 p.m.): Zack Handlen said on Twitter last week that tonight\u2019s episode is for \u201canyone concerned that there\u2019s been a shortage of the word \u2018bitch\u2019 on The Walking Dead.\u201d Did the producers pull the wool over our eyes and find a way to bring Aaron Paul back into the AMC fold? Or are the writers just having a little bit too much fun writing for hatefully misogynistic characters? Probably the latter, though that\u2019s a reminder that Paul\u2019s new Hulu show looks pretty interesting.\n\nThe Family (ABC, 9 p.m.): We\u2019re giving weekly coverage of this one a shot at The A.V. Club, and have assigned Gwen Ihnat to the case because she\u2019s not busy enough on Sunday nights between juggling fairy tales and troubled adult friendships. Tonight, \u201cAn FBI agent joins the investigation.\u201d Is there a Quantico crossover going on that ABC has failed to promote?\n\nThe Last Man On Earth (Fox, 9:30 p.m.): Last week saw Matt Miller back on Earth and heading for Tuscon to hunt for survivors (and somehow inexplicably not needing to adjust after three years of living without gravity). Is it possible the entire back half of this season could be him road-tripping across the country, every week finding a new survivor played by a Sons Of Anarchy regular and a new hallucination of a sibling played by a most recent Academy Award nominee? Wait, come back Vikram Murthi! We\u2019ve got a treatment for a Ron Perlman/Eddie Redmayne episode you just have to read!\n\nBillions (Showtime, 10 p.m.): \u201cA tip throws the case into jeopardy.\u201d Just the tip, Joshua Alston? (We\u2019re asking a lot of questions in this installment of What\u2019s On Tonight, aren\u2019t we? See, there we go again.)\n\nRegular coverage\n\nBob\u2019s Burgers (Fox, 7:30 p.m.)\n\nOnce Upon A Time (ABC, 8 p.m.)\n\nShameless (Showtime, 9 p.m.)\n\n\n\nGirls (HBO, 10 p.m.)\n\n\n\nTogetherness (HBO, 10:30 p.m.):\n\nThe Venture Bros. (Adult Swim, 12 a.m.)\n\nTomorrow in TV Club\n\nDo svidaniya, everything else on TV: The Americans returns this week. It was our No. 3 best show of 2014 and our No. 2 best show of 2015 (plus an honorable mention for best use of pop music in 2013), and our trusted comrade Vikram Murthi has a TV Review of the first few episodes. No spoilers, but it looks like season four is making an active case to claim the top spot in 2016.\n\nWhile The Americans takes place in a world that seems on the brink of total annihilation, our latest Inventory looks at worlds on the other end of that spectrum and their inhabitants who built a better self through post-apocalyptic living.\n\nIn the world of more cheerful content, Alasdair Wilkins brings us a For Your Consideration about The Grinder and his realization that it\u2019s the second coming of Lookwell, a legendary 1991 busted pilot from Conan O\u2019Brien and Robert Smigel.\n\nWhat else is on?\n\nNCAA Basketball Championship Selection Show (CBS, 5:30 p.m): It\u2019s time to load up your brackets for another round of March Madness, as they name the 68 teams going head to head for a shot at the title and weeks of dooming your productivity at the office. Normally our own bracket is shot to hell by our stubborn insistence that this could be Wisconsin\u2019s year, but last year the Badgers made it all the way to the championship so there\u2019s no chance we put any other team ahead of them by the end.\n\nCSI: Cyber (CBS, 10 p.m.): Season two comes to a close tonight, and given the show\u2019s poor-by-CBS-standards ratings, we could be seeing the last gasp of the once-omnipresent CSI franchise. Fittingly, the team is on their biggest case yet, hunting a hacker who triggered \u201cthe largest breach of highly classified data in history.\u201d Given how much we\u2019ve made fun of this show since taking over this beat, we\u2019re going to be magnanimous and hope they\u2019re able to end on a good note.\n\nAnd no, we\u2019re not just doing that because the episode\u2019s title \u201cLegacy\u201d doesn\u2019t let us make one last bad joke about their normally silly titles. Shut up.\n\nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO, 11:00 p.m.): Do you know what special districts are? No? We didn\u2019t think so. Let John Oliver fill you in.\n\nBordertown (Fox, 7 p.m.): Tonight\u2019s episode didn\u2019t wind up airing last week, so audiences have been forced to wait and see just what sort of kerfuffle Bud and an ostrich get up to. Maybe it\u2019s the newest incarnation of Peter vs. the chicken.\n\n\n\nCooper Barrett\u2019s Guide To Surviving Life (Fox, 8:30 p.m): \u201cAn old friend from college crashes at Cooper\u2019s apartment, and everyone is glad to see him, until he overstays his welcome and the gang pulls out all stops to get him to leave.\u201d In this scenario, Fox is Cooper and Cooper Barrett\u2019s Guide is the old friend from college.\n\n\n\nQuantico (ABC, 10 p.m.): Apparently our crossover theory was the wrong theory, given that tonight\u2019s episode makes no mention of kidnapping or Maine politics. But how surprising would it be if it turned out that the terrorist mastermind is also the pock-marked man suspected of kidnapping Adam?\n\nTalking Dead (AMC, 10 p.m.): Melissa McBride and director Paul Feig are tonight\u2019s guests. It\u2019s not too late for you to cast Melissa McBride in the new Ghostbusters, Paul Feig! We don\u2019t care if filming wrapped in September, you can do anything in post-production if you work hard enough and truly believe.\n\nComic Book Men (AMC, 12 a.m.): Jim Lee, renowned comic book artist and co-publisher of DC Comics, appears on the show tonight. We defer you to Oliver Sava for all questions about what Jim Lee\u2019s credentials are, as we don\u2019t keep up on the genre.\n\nLittle Big Shots (NBC, 8 p.m.): Steve Harvey hosts NBC\u2019s latest effort to make a variety show succeed in the ratings, with child performers including \u201ca 4-year-old piano prodigy, a salsa dancing duo, a young choir conductor, a viral storyteller, and an animal hypnotist.\u201d\n\nSteve Austin\u2019s Broken Skull Challenge (CMT, 8 p.m.): Given that we haven\u2019t watched any of this and we\u2019re asking an absurd number of questions we\u2019re asking this week, here\u2019s another one: is this a contest to see whose skull is the toughest, or who breaks their skull first? If the latter we expect that there\u2019s a lot of drooling at the award ceremony.\n\nThe Real Housewives Of Atlanta (Bravo, 8 p.m.): \u201cPorsha tries to preserve her fertility.\u201d Might we recommend amber or lucite?\n\nIntervention: Codependent (A&E, 9 p.m.): The latest installment of the Intervention series, this one focusing on toxic couples made all the more toxic by drug use. Because nothing spells network success like saying that one person destroying their lives isn\u2019t enough, we need two.\n\nGuy\u2019s Grocery Games (Food Network, 8 p.m.): \u201cA weird ingredient must be incorporated into classic American burgers.\u201d Well, that opens all the floodgates. Just remember the Ron Swanson edict that turkey can never beat cow and you\u2019ve got the edge.\n\nHook (BBC America, 8 p.m.): We\u2019ve never warmed to this film, but we know it has its fans. We just think Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook should be more compelling than it winds up being.\n\nThe Internship (FX, 8 p.m): \u201cHey, remember how everyone loved Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson together in Wedding Crashers? Let\u2019s do that and make it a commercial for Google at the same time, take out the charm, and we\u2019ll make millions!\u201d\n\nIndependence Day (Cinemax, 10 p.m.): Nothing the upcoming Independence Day: Resurgence can do will ever top Will Smith\u2019s utterance of \u201cWelcome to Earth\u201d or Bill Pullman\u2019s speech that\u2019s more presidential than any word uttered by any candidate in the 2016 election. We hope it\u2019s made its peace with that.\n\nThe Chronicles Of Riddick (IFC, 10 p.m.): The chronic\u2014what?\u2014les of Riddick! We love that chronic\u2014what?\u2014les Of Riddick! Pass that chronic \u2014what?\u2014les Of Riddick!\n\n\n\nSportsball!\n\nMLS Soccer, New York City FC vs. Toronto FC (ESPN2, 5 p.m.)\n\nCollege Lacrosse, Denver at Notre Dame (ESPNU, 5:30 p.m.)\n\nMLS Soccer, San Jose vs. Portland (Fox Sports, 7 p.m.)\n\nNHL Hockey, Maple Leafs at Red Wings (NBC Sports, 7:30 p.m.)\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nThe Characters: \u201cNetflix might call it \u2018outlaw comedy,\u2019 but it runs like a well-oiled machine ... weird without trying too hard to be weird.\u201d If a personage as smart as Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya thinks this highly of a new show, why wouldn\u2019t you watch it?\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/carmichael-show-ready-have-nice-long-chat-about-bi-233303", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5743/64/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Here\u2019s what\u2019s up in the world of TV for Sunday, March 13.
