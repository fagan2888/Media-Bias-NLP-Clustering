Fox News’ “Outnumbered” is a show that — as far as I can tell — spends a lot of time talking about how sexual assault against men and boys is not that big of a deal. The general premise seems to be to invite one man on to say horrible things, and then the female hosts respond by also saying horrible things or gently chastising the man without actually taking issue with any of the horrible things he has said. This week, the man invited on to say horrible things was Fox News business contributor Charles Payne, and the women there to also say horrible things or gently chastise him were Sandra Smith, Harris Faulkner, Kirsten Powers and Jedediah Bila.

To mark the occasion of being surrounded by women, Payne wore a pair of cufflinks emblazoned with a scene of domestic violence. He thought this was pretty funny and charming, and the women of “Outnumbered” seemed to agree. There was a lot of laughter all around.

“Hey, by the way Charles, we forgot to point out something. I just caught the bling on your cufflinks! What are the cufflinks, by the way?” said Smith.

“This is a caveman dragging a woman with one club in one hand an the woman in the other hand,” Payne replied with a laugh.

“What are you trying to say, Charles?” went the response, again with a laugh.

“All I’m trying to say is I am intimidated by you guys, and I had to overcompensate,” he said.
