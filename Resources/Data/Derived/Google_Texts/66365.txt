EDITOR: Remember when spring’s splendor was marked by the flowering hopa trees? Many of us on the Mayor’s Council on Beautification miss this spectacular spring show, so last year we decided to hold a community tree sale to replace them with spring-blooming crab apple trees. We had such an overwhelming interest in the trees that we are once again offering these beauties for sale. You can purchase these trees for your own yard or for designated areas in our city. These are 6-foot, bare-root trees that cost $55 each. They include Red Splendor, Donald Wyman and Purple Prince crab apple.

If you want to order a tree for yourself or for the community, contact Sue Winch at swinch9@gmail.com or 715-213-1747. There are a limited number of trees available, so order yours now. All orders must be received by April 30 and will be available for pickup the first week in May. Trees make a wonderful living memorial to people we have loved and lost or to celebrate the birth of a new baby.

Sue Winch and Gloria Kubisiak,

members of the Mayor’s Council on Beautification
