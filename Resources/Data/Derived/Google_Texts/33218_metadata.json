People no longer owned their own capital such as plows, oxen, etc. Rather they left their farms and moved to the cities to work for capitalists who owned all the factories and equipment. Marx predicted these exploited workers would rise up and overthrow the capitalists returning all productive capital to the workers themselves.\n\nSound familiar? Bernie Sanders is echoing similar thoughts suggesting that the time is right for a metaphorical overthrow of capitalism. Other candidates often agree with him. But they are missing the point.\n\nToday there is a changing relationship between individuals and those who own capital, but not the way Marx predicted. The \"sharing\" or gig economy potentially makes everyone a capitalist. The new capitalists are those who drive for Uber or Lyft, who work for Handy, Taskrabbit, Thumbtack and who offer accommodations in their homes like Airbnb.com.\n\nThese new capitalists seem to like flexibility of part-time work. They bring in the additional income they need to raise their quality of life. In other instances, it allows people who might not be able to join the workforce because of various barriers to entry do so. The trend is growing. The Freelancers Union estimates that about one-third of the nation's workforce \u2014 53.7 million people \u2014 now do freelance work. This represents an increase of more than 700,000 from a year earlier.\n\nClearly the gig economy is not the workplace for everyone. But it meets the needs for many. It is particularly helpful for those on the lower rungs of the income ladder. According to Samuel Fraiberger and Arun Sundararjian of New York University, the sharing economy helps the poor because low-income people now have access to workplaces that they didn't enjoy before. They also have new purchasing opportunities.\n\nContributed photo / The Morning Call Michael A. MacDowell is the president of Misericordia University.

The minimum-wage waitress can work occasionally, using her off-hours performing tasks that she is qualified but for which she cannot currently find full-time employment. As importantly, these freelancers are gaining job skills and good work habits.\n\nOn the consumer side, the sharing economy also benefits lower-income individuals. People who live in inner-city areas and have an opportunity for a job in the higher-paying suburbs might not be able to afford a car that would transport them there. By using Uber, they can get to work and improve their net income and standard of living.\n\nWith raging political debates about income inequality, one would think that those seriously worried about the poor would embrace the new gig economy. Such is not the case. At a much-heralded Silicon Valley meeting in early October, President Obama said that the growth in the gig economy must be watched carefully and regulated. Hillary Clinton acknowledges that people's ability to provide gig services generates income they wouldn't have. However, she goes on to warn that if elected she would crack down on employers who circumvent traditional employee-employer relationships.\n\nBernie Sanders has spoken out forcibly against Uber and similar entrepreneurial activities, saying that gig companies should be heavily regulated. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and the president seem to ignore the impact that such regulations would have on the price of a ride for low-income riders and the loss of income for drivers. They maintain their positions despite the fact that Urber drivers average more than $19 an hour compared to $14 average hourly wages for cab drivers nationally, according to federal occupational employment statistics.\n\nThe gig economy gives lower-paid workers the chance to enter the workplace and to develop the skills they will need to compete for the increasing small number of higher-paying jobs. Urged on by unions and trade associations, many politicians continue to stymie growth in the sharing economy through greater regulation. Their efforts deny lower-paid workers a chance to improve themselves.\n\nMarx and many of his ideas are long gone. However, the attack on the newest form of capitalism seems to have been passed on to a new generation,\n\nMichael A.
