OCEANSIDE, Calif. â€“ More than 6,000 patient's medical records at Tri-City Medical Center were taken from the hospital without authorization, according to a letter sent to patients.

Oceanside resident Sarah Grimmett has plenty to worry about with her daughter, Faith, whose heart condition requires several monthly visits to the hospital.

Grimmett was shocked to receive a letter from Tri-City Medical Center revealing her daughter's medical records were possibly compromised.

"I felt violated for my 4-year-old," said Grimmett. "It's quite scary because she's so young and identity theft is such a big thing right now."

According to the letter from Tri-City, a former employee wheeled out the records on a cart and took them home on August 8.

Grimmett said she had no idea what happened until she got her letter on August 26 -- nearly three weeks after the incident.

"I feel the minute they knew the information was taken from the hospital by the employee -- we should have been contacted," said Grimmett.

The hospital reported the records contained patients' names, dates of birth and diagnoses -- but no social security numbers or financial information.

The former employee turned the records over the Department of Public Health.

Fox 5 tried to contact Tri-City officials for an update on the investigation, but our calls were not returned Thursday.
