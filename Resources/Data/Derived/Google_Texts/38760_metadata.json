He served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of the Legal Counsel of the US Department of Justice from 2001 to 2003, where he worked on constitutional and national security matters. In this post, Mr. Yoo poses 5 questions to the 2016 presidential contenders on the relationship between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nDo you believe that the Supreme Court correctly struck down state bans on gay marriage this year in Obergefell v. Hodges?\n\nObergefell has sparked such criticism among conservatives not just because of its position on gay marriage. The decision illustrates much that is wrong with the modern Supreme Court, which has arrogated to itself the power to make many of our nation\u2019s fundamental social policies through its freewheeling interpretation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This runs counter to the Constitution\u2019s basic design, which leaves most policies in the hands of the states and vests in the federal government control over discrete issues such as national defense and foreign policy, a national free market, and nationwide individual rights and political freedoms.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s text does not address gay marriage or sexual orientation, which means the Framers left the decision up to the 50 states. If the states can decide questions about life and death, as they do on euthanasia and the death penalty, they should regulate questions about marriage and family law generally.\n\nDo you agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, two years ago in Sibelius v. NFIB, and to save its tax subsidies this year in King v. Burwell?\n\nOpposing Obergefell v. Hodges (see answer 1, above) does not mean that the Supreme Court must never exercise judicial review. The main purpose of the Court is to interpret and enforce the Constitution as it was written and understood by the Framers. And perhaps the most important task before the Framers was how to balance the powers of the federal and state government. The Constitution places careful limits on the powers of the national government, which are supposed to be narrow and specialized while leaving most decisions in the hands of the government closer to the people.\n\nIt seems clear that the Constitution did not give the federal government the power to take over large segments of the national economy and to use its powers over interstate commerce to force citizens to buy its approved products. And the taxing power, which the Court eventually relied upon, does not have the limitless reach granted by Sibelius \u2014 again, the very point of the Constitution was to place careful borders on federal power. In Sibelius, the Court read the Constitution to give the federal government a virtual police power to regulate anything.\n\nWhat responses do you think are within the powers of president to oppose decisions with which you disagree?\n\nThe president, contrary to popular belief, is not bound by the opinions of the Justices as to the meaning of the Constitution. The president must carry out its judgments \u2014 which party won or lost a case \u2014 but he need not agree with the reasons of the Court as expressed in its opinions. Presidents such as Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR argued that the president was entitled to advance his own interpretation of the Constitution while carrying out his unique constitutional duties. A president could veto laws that the Court thinks constitutional, he can appoint officials who agree with him rather than the Court, and he can appoint judges who share his views rather than the Supreme Court\u2019s.\n\nWith which Supreme Court Justice do you most agree? With which Justice do you most disagree?\n\nScalia, Thomas, and Alito focus on the Constitution\u2019s text and history and retain a modest vision of the Supreme Court\u2019s role in American society. Until the Obamacare cases, a nominee also could have named Chief Justice Roberts, but not after his decision to twice save national takeover of the healthcare market. In terms of disagreement, the four liberal Justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) have voted as a monolithic bloc on most controversial questions, such as gay marriage or Obamacare, and are interchangeably mistaken on interpreting the Constitution and expanding the Court\u2019s control over society.\n\nWhom would you appoint to the Supreme Court if a vacancy arose in 2017?\n\nPresidents have made a number of choices that have gone terribly awry, starting with Justice Blackmun under President Nixon (if not Warren and Brennan under Eisenhower), followed by Justices O\u2019Connor and Kennedy under Reagan, Justice Souter under Bush I, and even Roberts under Bush II. Maybe the error has been the practice of appointing stealth candidates or lower court judges, who seem swayed by media and academic opinion once on the Supreme Court. Better to appoint officials from other branches or the states who have undergone tough political battles and so won\u2019t be fazed by academic or media criticism. Presidents once used to regularly appoint prominent politicians, such as senators, cabinet officers, and governors, to the Court \u2014 a practice to which they should return.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidents such as Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR argued that the president was entitled to advance his own interpretation of the Constitution while carrying out his unique constitutional duties.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Presidents such as Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR argued that the president was entitled to advance his own interpretation of the Constitution while carrying out his unique constitutional duties.", "title": "5 questions every presidential candidate should answer on judicial and executive powers - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5_qs_series_judicial_and_executive_powers_500x293.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/5-questions-every-presidential-candidate-should-answer-on-judicial-and-executive-powers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Yoo is a visiting scholar at AEI and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.
