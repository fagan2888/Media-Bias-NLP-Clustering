Florida Highway Patrol troopers are investigating the death of a motorcyclist in Punta Gorda.

The time of the crash was estimated to be between 10:30 p.m. on Friday and 12 p.m. on Saturday.

Troopers say David Persaud, 23, was riding a motorcycle north on Sulstone Drive approaching the intersection of Rushmore Avenue.

According to a report, the motorcycle braked, leaving approximately 20 feet of skid marks through the center portion of the northbound lanes of Sulstone Drive. The bike entered the east shoulder near the intersection. That's where it began to rotate and overturn as it continued through the grass.

The motorcycle then struck a drainage culvert, and was vaulted around 100 feet – crossing a driveway and hitting a palm tree at an elevation of six feet.

The vehicle continued past the palm tree, and broke through the top portion of a security fence. It broke into multiple pieces, and became lodged in dense shrubbery.

Persaud was separated from the vehicle during this time. His body was found by friends who had been out looking for him after it was determined he was missing. Persaud’s body was found at around 3:30 p.m. on Saturday. He was pronounced dead by EMS crews.

Troopers believe excessive speeding was a factor in the crash.

The Florida Highway Patrol requests that anybody having information about this crash contact Corporal Jeff Rongish at 239-344-1730 Ext. 38164 or call Crime Stoppers to remain anonymous.
