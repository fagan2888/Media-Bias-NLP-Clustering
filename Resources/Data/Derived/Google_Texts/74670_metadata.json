That means Tata and Infosys are getting a 36 to 41 percent savings on labor costs\u2014or saving about $40,000 to $45,000 per worker per year.\n\nH-1B employees generally are not even put on a path toward permanent residency, according to the data. Hira found that \u201cInfosys only sponsored seven H-1B workers for permanent residence, and Tata sponsored ZERO H-1B workers, while the U.S. government approved 12,432 H-1B visa petitions for these two companies alone\u201d in fiscal year 2013.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, the H-1B workers Infosys and Tata hire are being used as temporary, cheaper, disposable labor, not as a way to permanently introduce talent and innovation into the American labor market,\u201d Hira concludes.\n\nHira also found further evidence that the notion that H-1B guest workers are better qualified than Americans is specious. In fact, \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of the H-1B workers Infosys and Tata import \u201chold no more than a Bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d:\n\nIf American workers are training their foreign replacements before they get laid off, then it is quite obvious that it\u2019s the American trainers\u2014not the H-1B trainees\u2014who have the superior skills. Are H-1B workers being brought in because they have extensive formal training, like an advanced degree? The answer to that is a definitive no. The vast majority of Infosys and Tata\u2019s imported H-1B workers hold no more than a Bachelor\u2019s degree. During the FY10-12 period, 78 percent of Tata\u2019s and 85 percent of Infosys\u2019s H-1B employees held only a Bachelor\u2019s degree or less. Finally, there\u2019s also no evidence that Tata and Infosys are using the H-1B to retain foreign students who studied and earned an advanced degree in the United States: Only 1-in-206 of Infosys\u2019 H-1B workers held an advanced degree from a U.S. university, and even less of Tata\u2019s H-1B workers did, just 1-in-222.\n\nAs Breitbart News has thoroughly documented, \u201cdespite evidence to the contrary, the tech industry has spent millions trying to get massive increases in the number of H-1b guest-worker visas, claiming that they \u2018can\u2019t find\u2019 Americans to do various tech jobs\u201d even though there is a proven surplus of America high-tech workers.\n\nA Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) report, \u201cusing data from the American Community Survey (ACS) that the Census Bureau and the Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey (CPS) collect,\u201d found that there is hardly a shortage of American tech workers. In fact, \u201cthere were 5.3 million immigrant and native-born STEM workers in 2012 compared to 12.1 million STEM degree holders among immigrants and native-born Americans.\u201d In addition, \u201conly a third of native-born Americans with a STEM degree actually has a job in a STEM occupation while at least 5 million native-born Americans with STEM undergraduate degrees are working in non-STEM occupations.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that from 2007-2012, STEM employment averaged \u201caveraged only 105,000 jobs annually.\u201d And during that time, the number of U.S.-born STEM graduates grew by an average of 115,000 a year, and the \u201cU.S. admitted about 129,000 immigrants with STEM degrees,\u201d which means \u201cthe number of new immigrants with STEM degrees admitted each year [was] by itself higher than the total growth in STEM employment.\u201d Numerous studies from left-of-center, nonpartisan, and right-of-center organizations have all concluded that the data do not support claims of a high-tech labor shortage.\n\nThough Southern California Edison has claimed that H-1B workers \u201cwill lead to enhancements that deliver faster and more efficient tools and applications for services that customers rely on\u201d and that \u201cthrough outsourcing, SCE\u2019s information technology organization will adopt a proven business strategy commonly and successfully used by top U.S. companies that SCE benchmarks against,\u201d the employees ComputerWorld interviewed have said the H1-B workers \u201cdo not have the skill levels of the people they are replacing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are bringing in people with a couple of years\u2019 experience to replace us and then we have to train them,\u201d a longtime IT worker told ComputerWorld. \u201cIt\u2019s demoralizing and in a way I kind of felt betrayed by the company.\u201d The Southern California Edison employees were \u201cbeyond furious\u201d because \u201cnot one of these jobs being filled by India was a job that an Edison employee wasn\u2019t already performing.\u201d And, that, according to Hira could violate U.S. immigration and labor laws.\n\nAs ComputerWorld noted:\n\nHira pointed out that as a part of the application process to obtain H-1B approval from the Labor Department, an employer is required to attest to the following: \u201cWorking Conditions: The employer attests that H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 foreign workers in the named occupation will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed.\u201d This statement is in Form 9035CP of the LCA.Further, Hira noted that the Labor Department states, \u201cThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires that the hiring of a foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers comparably employed.\n\n\u201cThe SCE case is clearly one where the hiring of the H-1B is adversely affecting the wages and working conditions of American workers,\u201d Hira told ComputerWorld. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a clearer cut case of adverse impacts \u2013 the American worker is losing his job to an H-1B.\u201d\n\nIn an open letter to Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and Wage and Hour Administrator David Weil this week about Southern California Edison\u2019s layoffs, Ross Eisenbrey, the Vice President of the Economic Policy Institute, called for Perez to conduct a thorough investigation of Southern California Edison\u2019s H-1B practices.\n\n\u201cI hope that we will soon learn that the Department of Labor intends to investigate and remedy this harm to skilled U.S. workers who have pursued education and training in a technical field, worked hard, and played by the rules,\u201d he added. \u201cOur government should, at the very least, ensure that its programs, including its visa programs, are not used to destroy the careers and financial security of its people.\u201d\n\nEisenbrey reminded Perez that \u201cthe law (the Immigration and Nationality Act) forbids the hiring of H-1B temporary foreign guestworkers whose employment would \u2018adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers comparably employed.'\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, taking away the jobs, wages and benefits of the laid-off SCE employees does adversely affect their wages and working conditions,\u201d Eisenbrey said. \u201cYou have authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to investigate this case, but I have seen no announcement that you intend to do so or that you share my sense of outrage that the H-1B program is being abused in such an egregious way.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned that, as his colleague Hira has written, \u201cadding to the injustice, American workers losing their jobs are being forced to do \u2018knowledge transfers,\u2019 an ugly euphemism that means being forced to train your own foreign replacement.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Hira noted that \u201cInfosys and Tata have a history of getting in trouble for paying even lower wages than they are already legally allowed to pay. In 2013 Tata paid $30 million to settle a wage theft dispute involving 13,000 foreign workers, and Infosys paid a record $34 million to settle a visa fraud case after it committed \u201csystemic visa fraud and abuse of immigration processes.\u201d He concluded that, \u201cas a general principle, companies that behave like this should not be allowed to benefit from the U.S. temporary foreign worker programs, much less be the top two beneficiaries of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the investigation finds willful violations of the H-1B program, Tata and Infosys should be debarred from using the program,\u201d Hira wrote.\n\nHira, as Breitbart News has reported, previously emphasized that the IT sector has traditionally been an \u201carea of social mobility\u201d where \u201cpeople who come from working-class backgrounds\u201d move up the economic ladder after going \u201cinto these sectors.\u201d Proving Hira\u2019s point, one Southern California Edison employee who was laid off may have trouble keeping his home.\n\nLast year, Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of good-paying tech jobs in helping Americans move up the economic ladder, especially for women from, in Biden\u2019s words, \u201cfrom the \u2018hood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese were people with high school degrees coming out of the most hard-scrabbled neighborhoods, every one of them in Detroit,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEvery one had a job. The lowest starting salary $58,000. The highest, [$81.000], because in Detroit, there is an immediate need now for 1,000 programmers\u2026 Every one of those women has a job\u2026 average job $65,000 a year.\u201d\n\nEven President Barack Obama, who \u201ccould not claim legal authority to award the tech industry more H-1B visas,\u201d has said he becomes \u201cskeptical\u201d when companies claim they need more guest workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m generally skeptical when you hear employers say, \u2018oh we just can\u2019t find any Americans to do the job,\u2019\u201d Obama said at an immigration event in Nashville shortly after enacting his executive amnesty. \u201cA lot of times what they really mean is that it\u2019s a lot cheaper to potentially hire somebody who has just come here before they know better\u2026\u201d\n\nBut massive increases in H-1B workers is the crown jewel for the tech industry in any immigration bill. Groups like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.us have spent millions trying to get increases in guest-worker visas while tech titans like Bill Gates have pushed for more guest workers even while Microsoft announced it was laying off 18,000 American workers.\n\nTop GOP leaders in the Senate and House, though, have indicated they want to move forward with legislation that will massively increase H-1b visas in this Congress. As Breitbart News noted, lawmakers are hoping to use a bipartisan guest-worker bill that benefits the tech industry as a \u201cgateway\u201d to a broader and more comprehensive immigration bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Expert: Gov't Data Reveal Guest-Worker Firms 'Abusing' System to Displace U.S Workers", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Expert: Gov't Data Reveal Guest-Worker Firms 'Abusing' System to Displace U.S Workers", "title": "Expert: Gov't Data Reveal Guest-Worker Firms 'Abusing' System to Displace U.S Workers - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Southern-California-Edison.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/19/expert-govt-data-reveal-guest-worker-firms-abusing-system-to-displace-u-s-workers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Expert: Gov't Data Reveal Guest-Worker Firms 'Abusing' System to Displace U.S Workers", "title": "Expert: Gov't Data Reveal Guest-Worker Firms 'Abusing' System to Displace U.S Workers - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Southern-California-Edison.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-02-19T14:50:27-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf55c\"", "article_summary": "Are H-1B workers being brought in because they have extensive formal training, like an advanced degree?\nThe vast majority of Infosys and Tata\u2019s imported H-1B workers hold no more than a Bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\u201cThe SCE case is clearly one where the hiring of the H-1B is adversely affecting the wages and working conditions of American workers,\u201d Hira told ComputerWorld.\nHira also found further evidence that the notion that H-1B guest workers are better qualified than Americans is specious.\nGroups like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.us have spent millions trying to get increases in guest-worker visas while tech titans like Bill Gates have pushed for more guest workers even while Microsoft announced it was laying off 18,000 American workers."}
