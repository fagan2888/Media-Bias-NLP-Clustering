Despite its super-high price tag, Sovaldi is gaining widespread adoption in the US, and drugmaker Gilead\u2019s aggressive pricing strategy is paying off for the company. UnitedHealth Group care recently announced it spent $100 million on the drug during the first three months of this year. In the end, private payers (like employers) and government payers (like Medicare and Medicaid)\u2014and, eventually, all of us\u2014foot the bill for high-priced drugs in the form of higher insurance premiums or more out-of-pocket costs.\n\nI found myself in London a few weeks ago, and stopped by the offices of NICE, Britain\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, to dig deeper into why Sovaldi costs more in the US and to learn what recommendations NICE was making for Sovaldi\u2014information that might be useful for reporters stateside. NICE conducts cost effectiveness analyses of new drugs and makes recommendations to the National Health Service about which drugs offer enough therapeutic value to warrant coverage by the health service. Since 2000, NICE has appraised over 500 healthcare technologies and has approved almost 80 percent of them including those okayed for restricted use. The Institute\u2019s technology appraisals are binding on NHS doctors, hospitals, and primary care facilities, since the drugs are paid for out of the public purse. NICE\u2019s clinical guidelines, which offer guidance in a specific therapeutic area, are not binding but most doctors follow them. The public can always pay privately for a drug NICE doesn\u2019t approve for public funding. The Institute is currently considering whether Sovaldi will be approved for public funding by the National Health Service. The decision process involves input from patient groups, academics, providers, and the drug makers, and the Institute is expected to issue a draft guidance this month. (Draft guidance typically contains provisional recommendations for whether or not a technology should be funded and under which clinical conditions.) A final decision is expected by October. In the meantime, the National Health Service in England has agreed to pay 19 million pounds ($32.3 million) to treat with Sovaldi some 500 patients who have acute liver failure and who are waiting for a liver transplant. In other words, the drug is being limited to the sickest patients in Britain. That\u2019s essentially the same recommendation made this spring by the California Technology Assessment Forum, a group funded by insurers.\n\nI was particularly interested in knowing how NICE makes its decisions. How does it determine where healthcare dollars should be spent and who benefits the most? NICE uses a metric called a QALY (quality-adjusted life years measurement) that assesses a drug\u2019s effect on length of life and the quality of life it offers to the person receiving it. The metric takes into account that a treatment may help a patient live longer, but since it is adjusted for quality of life, it can also capture things such as side effects which put patients at risk for other illnesses. After NICE determines the quality of life a drug offers in terms of a person\u2019s health, it also considers cost effectiveness\u2014specifically, \u201cthe cost of using the drugs to provide a year of the best quality of life available,\u201d which is then \u201cexpressed in pounds per QALY.\u201d If a treatment costs more than 20,000- 30,000 pounds per QALY ($34,000-$51,000) it is not considered cost effective and is less likely to be approved for funding. The Institute considers whether the money is best spent healing one person with the disease or is better spent on other people getting other treatments or services (like, for example, paying for more nurses to make in-home post-partem visits to new moms). In April, NICE turned down the breast cancer drug Kadcyla made by Roche because its effectiveness did not warrant its cost of more than 90,000 pounds ($153,000) per patient. The Institute\u2019s draft guidance said it didn\u2019t work well enough to justify routine use in the National Health Service.\n\n\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t have an oversight system like NICE, and Obamacare specifically prohibits the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, a new agency created under the health reform law, from considering the cost of treatments in its work. Medicare can\u2019t consider cost either when it decides to cover a new drug or device. In Britain, drug prices are set through \u201cdiscussions\u201d between the government and drug makers which result in a pharmaceutical price regulation arrangement. Not so in the US, where compaines can generally charge what they want with no government oversight. As FiercePharma pointed out, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot payers can do [about costs] in the US without an official cost-effectiveness body to set paramenters and make tough choices.\u201d Because of drug company power, it\u2019s not likely we\u2019ll get such a body anytime soon.\n\nLast week, the Washington, DC-based National Coalition on Health Care, a group of healthcare employers, providers, and consumers, announced a \u201cCampaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing,\u201d an effort to \u201cspark a national dialogue\u201d about the high cost not only of Sovaldi but also of some 200 other expensive drugs in the pipeline. In a front page Washington Post piece Monday, Coalition president and CEO John Rother described a coming \u201ctsunami of expensive medicines\u201d that, the Post wrote, \u201ccollectively threaten to bankrupt the healthcare system.\u201d Barry Werth, a journalist who has written about the pharmaceutical industry for decades, told the Post: \u201cWe\u2019re heading for some kind of reckoning. I don\u2019t know that anybody has thought through how that\u2019s going to play out.\u201d Rother said to me, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise an issue for public discussion that could threaten the stability of the whole healthcare system. It\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not being responsible when a company prices a drug so aggressively and doesn\u2019t think of the needs of the healthcare system as a whole.\u201d In other words, is a drug worth it no matter what its price? Will those expensive medicines crowd out other healthcare services? These are threads we continue to urge reporters to follow. (Putting Sovaldi\u2019s high cost in perspective is a good start. Vox.com\u2019s Sarah Kliff, for example, recently reported that California might have to spend more buying Sovaldi for the state\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries than it spends now for K-12 and higher education. If Kaiser Permanente gave Sovaldi to all its patients with hep C, The New York Times\u2019 Elisabeth Rosenthal tweeted over the weekend, it would double the insurer\u2019s pharmacy spending.)\n\nRother told me one of the goals of his Sustainable Rx Pricing campaign is to move the country toward a more systematic appraisal of costs, benefits, and, equally important, a discussion of who pays. Right now, insurance companies make those cost-benefit judgments\u2014and, hardly in a systematic way. One company pays for a drug; another may not. Rother\u2019s not sure what the solution might be in America\u2019s private health system, and says he has no expectation that Gilead will drop the price of Sovaldi. But, at least, for the first time some pretty big stakeholders\u2014insurers, employers, and unions\u2014 are publicly questioning specific costs in the system.\n\nAs we\u2019ve been reporting, the media have a big role in fostering a public discussion of the cost of medicines and healthcare in general\u2014the great unfinished businesss of health reform. For most of the Obamacare debate, the press acted as followers. This is a chance for reporters to take the lead, to move beyond the rhetoric of rationing the pols like to exploit to explanations of how to rationalize or improve the way we pay for drugs in this country\u2014and, yes, how other counties control costs with, often, better outcomes.\n\nRelated content:\n\nCovering the $1,000 pill\n\nA drug offers better care for a disease that affects millions.
