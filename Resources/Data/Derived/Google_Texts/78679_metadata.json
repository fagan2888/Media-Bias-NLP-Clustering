Tatiana and Krista Hogan, 7, of Vernon, British Colombia, who were not expected to survive the day they were born, share a special connection: Their brains are \u201czipped together.\u201d As a result, the twins are able to hear each other\u2019s thoughts and see what the other is seeing.\n\nTatiana and Krista\u2019s mom, Felicia Hogan, was given the news that the twins\u2019 future looked bleak while she was pregnant. However, in the Channel 5 documentary titled \u201cJoined at The Head: Twin Life,\u201d Hogan emphasized abortion \u201cwas not an option.\u201d The twins have been monitored since birth, as doctors are marveled by how their shared brain works.\n\n\u201cThey have amazed me \u2014 how they are the same but how they are different, how they are dealing with an error of nature to live healthy lives,\u201d said Dr. Douglas Cochrane, a neurosurgeon who has treated the girls as they\u2019ve been growing up.\n\nThe girls were born craniopagus conjoined twins, meaning they are joined at the top, back, and side of their heads. Their shared brain structure consists of a neural bridge between their thalamus, which regulates consciousness along with sensory and motor signals. It is with this shared brain tissue structure and the interconnected neurons that one brain receives signals from the other brain and vice versa. This means one twin can \u201csee\u201d what the other twin is seeing, which makes them even more unique within craniopagus twins.\n\nThis type of conjoined twins is very rare, accounting for only two percent of conjoined twin births. Upon delivery, the twins were described as wriggly, vigorous, and very vocal, weighing 12.5 pounds, according to the B.C. Women's Hospital & Health Centre news release.\n\nThe girls can also share thoughts and communicate within their own heads. The twins\u2019 grandfather explained: \u201cThey start giggling and you know they're up to something and they haven't said a word. Pretty soon after, they will go and pull a prank and you know they are communicating, we just don't know how.\"\n\nAlthough they feel the same things, they have different personalities. \u201cOver the years Tatiana has become the prominent leader,\u201d Hogan said. In fact, in the documentary, Tatiana exclaims, \u201cI'm the red Power Ranger: Jason! The leader.\u201d Krista, on the other hand, is \u201cquieter and can be more in her own shell.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the twins will never be able to be separated or live independent lives because of the way their brains are fused together. Hogan described it as this \u201cone big zipper that can't be unzipped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tell them, \u2018You two have to spend the rest of your lives together in this world, you need to cooperate and be nice to each other.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "craniopagus conjoined twins, girls, pregnancy, pregnant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A set of 8-year-old Canadian twins conjoined at the skull share eyesight and emotions.", "title": "8-Year-Old Conjoined Twins Can See Through Each Other's Eyes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/open-mind-8-year-old-conjoined-twins-joined-skull-share-eyesight-emotions-348778", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/conjoined_twins_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A set of 8-year-old Canadian twins conjoined at the skull share eyesight and emotions.", "title": "8-Year-Old Conjoined Twins Can See Through Each Other's Eyes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/open-mind-8-year-old-conjoined-twins-joined-skull-share-eyesight-emotions-348778", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/conjoined_twins_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/conjoined_twins_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-08-20T15:22:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T15:22:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A set of 8-year-old Canadian twins conjoined at the skull share eyesight and emotions."}, "article_summary": "This type of conjoined twins is very rare, accounting for only two percent of conjoined twin births.\nThe girls were born craniopagus conjoined twins, meaning they are joined at the top, back, and side of their heads.\nA set of conjoined twins in Canada have defied the odds of survival after learning how to walk, talk, and even argue like siblings do.\nTheir shared brain structure consists of a neural bridge between their thalamus, which regulates consciousness along with sensory and motor signals.\nIt is with this shared brain tissue structure and the interconnected neurons that one brain receives signals from the other brain and vice versa."}
