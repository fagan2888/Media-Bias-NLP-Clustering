The insurance department said in a disciplinary report the decision was \u201cbased on an investigation which revealed that she had been convicted in Israel for her role in the bombings of a supermarket and the British Consulate in Jerusalem and failed to reveal the conviction on her application.\u201d\n\nAccording to an FBI background report for Odeh obtained by National Review, no past criminal offenses were cited. The Illinois Department of Insurance conducts background checks on navigators, National Review reported.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s indictment in October said that Odeh and accomplices placed multiple bombs at the two sites on Feb. 21, 1969. One of the bombs exploded at the crowded supermarket, killing two students from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and injuring 20. The British Consulate was damaged as a result of the attack.\n\nOdeh was sentenced to life in prison in 1970 but was released after 10 years as part of an Israeli prisoner exchange, after which she moved to the West Bank.\n\nAccording to the U.S. attorney, she immigrated to the U.S. in 1995 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2004.\n\nThe indictment alleged that when she filed to immigrate to the U.S., \u201cOdeh omitted her arrest, conviction, and imprisonment overseas, which were material facts for the United States government in determining whether to grant her citizenship,\u201d the U.S. attorney\u2019s statement said.\n\nIf convicted, Odeh could be stripped of her citizenship and faces a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nNational Review reported that the Department of Insurance discovered Odeh\u2019s history only after the U.S. attorney\u2019s announcement about her indictment. She has reportedly used as many as nine aliases.\n\nArab-American activists in Chicago expressed outrage at Odeh\u2019s indictment last fall and viewed it as an attack on the community.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in October that Odeh was an associate director at the Arab American Action Network in Chicago, a nonprofit that \u201cadvocates for new immigrants and tries to combat anti-Muslim and anti-Arab prejudice.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s website said Odeh had worked as a lawyer and was focused on domestic-violence groups and women\u2019s issues, the AP reported.\n\nOrganization director Hatem Abudayyeh told the AP in October, \u201cShe is a leader in the community \u2014 a stalwart, an icon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an escalation of attacks on our community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very, very angry.\u201d\n\nAt an October hearing in Detroit, Odeh pleaded not guilty as her supporters marched outside the courthouse holding signs that said, \u201cstop anti-Arab racism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "An Arab-American community activist charged with immigration fraud for hiding that she was once convicted of a terrorist bombing in Israel worked briefly as an Obamacare navigator in Illinois, according to a report from\u00a0National Review Online.
