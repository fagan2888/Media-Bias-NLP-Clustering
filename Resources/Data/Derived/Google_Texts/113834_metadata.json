Mike Lee (R-UT) with a primary challenge in 2016.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLee\u2019s offense? He didn\u2019t drink the Washington Kool-aid and see the D.C. cesspool as a jacuzzi after he ousted incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett (R-UT), who had supported the TARP bailouts, in 2010.\n\nWhen Lee prevailed over Bennett, he gave other conservatives across the country hope that they could also defeat entrenched incumbents who cared more about preserving the status quo above all else. Once Lee arrived in Washington, he didn\u2019t turn his back on the base, which angered some prominent establishment Republicans.\n\nAccording to a report in Politico, moderate GOP billionaires like Jon Huntsman Sr. and \u201csome powerful establishment Republicans in Utah are tired\u201d of Lee\u2019s conservatism and willingness to live up to his campaign promises instead of letting the D.C. establishment co-opt him.\n\nDuring his first Senate term, Lee has established himself as one of conservatism\u2019s leading voices. As Politico implies, establishment Republicans do not like him because he stood with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to defund Obamacare and has supported defunding Obama\u2019s executive amnesty with Sens. Cruz and Jeff Sessions (R-AL). Most recently, Lee has offered positive solutions via his conservative reform agenda that specifically focuses on improving the lives of working Americans with conservative policies.\n\nHuntsman, the father of President Barack Obama\u2019s former Ambassador to China and failed 2012 GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, reportedly has refused to meet with Lee because of his \u201cextremely radical\u201d positions against Obamacare and executive amnesty. Huntsman said the government shutdown cost his cancer research foundation millions in federal taxpayer dollars, and he predicted \u201ca major primary challenge\u201d against Lee, telling Politico that Lee is an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and \u201can extremist.\u201d\n\nProminent Utah bank executive Scott Anderson has reportedly met with a variety of potential challengers, including Josh Romney, Mitt Romney\u2019s son.\n\nA top Mitt Romney ally who has profited from Obamacare pushed a state law that may make it easier for a moderate Republican to prevail in a primary.\n\nMike Leavitt, the former Utah governor and Health and Human Services Secretary who was chosen to lead Romney\u2019s transition team, pushed the \u201cCount My Vote\u201d law, which, as Politico notes, \u201ccould give way to a more moderate candidate to get onto the primary ballot.\u201d The law, which is being challenged in federal court, allows a potential candidate to get on the ballot by either \u201cwinning the support by delegates at a party convention or securing 28,000 signatures.\u201d Normally, Utah nominates its candidates through a convention\u2013if no candidate receives 60% of the delegates, then the top two move on to a primary election.\n\nAs even Politico noted, though, it will be difficult for anyone to successfully primary Lee because he has a \u201cdeeply enthusiastic base of thousands of conservative activists who dominate the party\u2019s nominating convention\u201d and the backing of important conservative groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Club for Growth. Conservative talk radio host and scholar Mark Levin repeatedly praises him. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has said, \u201cwe are 100 percent committed to getting Sen. Lee reelected.\u201d\n\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the NRSC chair, told Politico that Lee\u2019s chances \u201care very, very good.\u201d\n\nConservatives have seen Sarah Palin, Cruz, and Lee stand together against the permanent political class on the most important issues facing the country in recent years. They have campaigned for conservatives across the country, opposed Obamacare and massive amnesty legislation favored by the bipartisan permanent political class, and stood with veterans against Obama when the Obama administration barricaded the World War II Memorial during the government shutdown.\n\nIf someone like Josh Romney tries to primary Lee, he may forever been seen as an enemy to the conservative base, which is a consequence anyone thinking about challenging Lee must weigh before potentially deciding to do so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: GOP Establishment Plotting to Oust Conservative Leader Sen.
