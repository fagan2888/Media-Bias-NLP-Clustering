Matt Mead (R) is renewing his push to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare in his state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLike several states with supportive Republican governors, though, Republicans in the state legislature have still resisted the call.\n\nMead pressed the legislature to re-examing the issue as it considers a budget.\n\n\u201cExpansion would help cover healthcare costs for roughly 20,000 Wyoming citizens \u2014 our friends and neighbors \u2014 many who are working,\u201d Mead said. \u201cIt would bring an estimated $268 million of our federal tax dollars back to the state and help with the enormous uncompensated care costs facing our hospitals.\u201d\n\nHe also noted his political history with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI opposed the Affordable Care Act and sued to stop it,\u201d Mead said. \u201cHowever, we lost the legal and political battles and now we must deal with that fact.\u201d\n\nA common concern from opponents, beyond general concerns about cost, is that the federal government will end up not living up to its commitment to pay 90 percent of the cost down the road.\n\nSeeking to counter that argument, Mead said he supports \u201cincluding language that protects the state should the federal government renege on their financial promise.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported that supporters will try to attach Medicaid expansion as an amendment to the budget on Friday, but opponents said the effort will fail.\n\n\u201cI think we're pretty solid in the Legislature that we're worried about it tying us down in the future to increasing costs that aren't coming from the federal government to fill the gap in our Medicaid,\u201d state Rep. David Miller (R) told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just don't see it being passed.\u201d\n\nThirty-one states have so far accepted ObamaCare\u2019s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, up to 138 percent of the poverty line, or about $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe Obama administration has been pushing the rest to expand Medicaid as well, emphasizing its willingness to compromise and allow states to put some conservative twists on the program, like making beneficiaries pay premiums.\n\nSouth Dakota is seen as one of the state\u2019s most likely to expand next. The Republican governor there, Dennis Daugaard, has been pushing for expansion.\n\nThere had also been hopes in Alabama, but Gov. Robert Bentley (R) recently cast doubt on the move.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Matt Mead is renewing his call for the legislature to accept expansion.", "description": "Matt Mead is renewing his call for the legislature to accept expansion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Matt Mead is renewing his call for the legislature to accept expansion.", "title": "Wyoming governor pushes ObamaCare Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/269991-wyoming-gov-pushes-obamacare-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacaresignup_122315getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-19T11:12:40-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-19T11:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/269991-wyoming-gov-pushes-obamacare-medicaid-expansion", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-19T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T09:00:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T11:12:40-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/269991-wyoming-gov-pushes-obamacare-medicaid-expansion", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Matt Mead is renewing his call for the legislature to accept expansion.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wyoming governor pushes ObamaCare Medicaid expansion"}, "dcterms.title": "Wyoming governor pushes ObamaCare Medicaid expansion"}, "article_summary": "Matt Mead (R) is renewing his push to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare in his state.\nADVERTISEMENTLike several states with supportive Republican governors, though, Republicans in the state legislature have still resisted the call.\n\u201cExpansion would help cover healthcare costs for roughly 20,000 Wyoming citizens \u2014 our friends and neighbors \u2014 many who are working,\u201d Mead said.\nThe Obama administration has been pushing the rest to expand Medicaid as well, emphasizing its willingness to compromise and allow states to put some conservative twists on the program, like making beneficiaries pay premiums.\nThe Republican governor there, Dennis Daugaard, has been pushing for expansion."}
