Health care plans offered under Obamacare through HealthCare.gov have deductibles of $3,000 or more in many states, making health care unaffordable for families even though they technically have coverage, the New York Times reported.

“The sticker shock is coming not on the front end, when they purchase the plans, but on the back end when they get sick: sky-high deductibles that are leaving some newly insured feeling as vulnerable as they were before they had coverage,” the article states.

David Reines of New Jersey, who has chronic knee pain, said that the high deductible of $3,000 makes it impossible to go to the doctor. “We have insurance, but can’t afford to use it,” he said.

Wendy Kaplan of Illinois pays premiums of $1,200 a month with an annual deductible of $12,700 for her family of four. “Our deductible is so high, we practically pay for all of our medical expenses out of pocket,” she said. “So our policy is really there for emergencies only, and basic wellness appointments.”

“In Miami, the median deductible, according to HealthCare.gov, is $5,000,” states the article. “In Jackson, Miss., the comparable figure is $5,500. In Chicago, the median deductible is $3,400. In Phoenix, it is $4,000; in Houston and Des Moines, $3,000.”

“High deductibles were an inevitable result of the Affordable Care Act’s flawed approach to health care,” said Freedom Partners senior policy adviser Nathan Nascimento. “The law’s overwhelming regulations and mandates are continuing to drive costs up for American families—hurting the very people the president told us it would help. What good is health care coverage if you cannot access or afford the care when you actually need it?”
