She also wrote \u201cDress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\u201d She would subsequently delete the Facebook post and issue an apology, but it wasn\u2019t enough to save her job. I do suspect this wouldn\u2019t be the case if a Democratic congressional staffer had criticized the children of a Republican President in this manner. Nevertheless, I think Lauten did a foolish thing.\n\nNow it\u2019s true that people were commenting on Sasha & Malia\u2019s body language on social media, but they were doing so in a humorous manner. A lot of people can relate to Dads who embarass their teenaged daughters and to teenaged daughters who are embarrassed by their Dad, even if their Dad is President of the United States. I know a lot of conservatives are annoyed with Obama\u2019s overexposure. But in some ways we\u2019re lucky. We don\u2019t have to live with him. So the scene itself is worthy of commentary. But it\u2019s one thing to do that, but quite another to throw a brushback pitch at the Obama girls and suggest they were dressed up to go to a bar.\n\nGiven how President Obama has acted concerning Obamacare, immigration, Israel, ISIS, Ebola and a litany of other things there is so much for which he richly deserves to be criticized. However, the same cannot be said for Sasha & Malia Obama. As demonstrated by their body language they didn\u2019t want to be there. After they didn\u2019t choose this life. If they pursue public life as adults then that\u2019s a different matter. But for now we should leave them alone. Yes, they are President Obama\u2019s children, but they are still children nevertheless.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce786\"", "article_summary": "A lot of people can relate to Dads who embarass their teenaged daughters and to teenaged daughters who are embarrassed by their Dad, even if their Dad is President of the United States.\nYes, they are President Obama\u2019s children, but they are still children nevertheless.\nGiven how President Obama has acted concerning Obamacare, immigration, Israel, ISIS, Ebola and a litany of other things there is so much for which he richly deserves to be criticized.\nI do suspect this wouldn\u2019t be the case if a Democratic congressional staffer had criticized the children of a Republican President in this manner.\nElizabeth Lauten will be resigning as Tennessee Republican Congressman Steve Fincher\u2019s communications director following a Facebook post in which she took aim President Obama\u2019s daughters, Sasha & Malia who looked less than amused when present when their father pardoned a turkey on Thanksgiving Day."}
