Once all in, 2-year-old Juno, a Labrador mix, proved a graceful paddler. He swam after chew toys. He went careening down the slide.\n\nAfter an hour at the pool, Smith had to drag Juno away.\n\nThe dogs had their day Monday at the Kiwanis Pool in Northglenn. The city hosted its first-ever dog swim day on the last day the pool was open. On Tuesday, the pool will be drained for the season.\n\nSteve Hanson, the aquatics coordinator for the city\u2019s recreation department, said the hope was to give dogs that haven\u2019t been around the water the chance to learn how to swim in a safe place.\n\nIn the morning, Hanson said, guide dogs were allowed to practice. In the afternoon, members of the public, such as Smith, could bring their dogs in for a $5 fee. About 50 dogs and owners attended.\n\nThe result was a day of soggy canine chaos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking to do something for the dogs for a while,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cWe have to close down tomorrow anyway.\u201d\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dogs have their day at Northglenn swimming pool", "title": "Dogs have their day at Northglenn swimming pool", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/02/dogs-have-their-day-at-northglenn-swimming-pool/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__cd03DOGSWIM_DSC_8557p1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__cd03DOGSWIM_DSC_8557p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-02T17:47:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:56:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb46d\"", "article_summary": "The city hosted its first-ever dog swim day on the last day the pool was open.\nThe dogs had their day Monday at the Kiwanis Pool in Northglenn.\nAfter an hour at the pool, Smith had to drag Juno away.\nIn the afternoon, members of the public, such as Smith, could bring their dogs in for a $5 fee.\n\u201cHe likes the snow, but he\u2019s never had much exposure to the water,\u201d said Juno\u2019s owner, Jeanette Smith of Thornton."}
