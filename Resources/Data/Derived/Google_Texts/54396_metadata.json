The White House referred questions to the IRS.\n\nActing IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said the IRS was prepared to administer the credits.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has a strong, effective system in place for administering the Premium Tax Credit,\u201d Werfel said. \u201cWe have a proven track record of safely and securely transmitting federal tax information, and we have a robust and secure process in place to deliver this important credit for taxpayers.\u201d\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live on Oct. 1, tech issues have plagued the website HealthCare.gov, embarrassing the Obama administration and the Health and Human Services Department.\n\nSoon, the IRS could find itself in the hot seat, too. The agency is charged with distributing the Obamacare tax credits starting in January and also with assessing penalties for not holding insurance.\n\nSo far, the agency has avoided negative attention.\n\nLower-income taxpayers who purchase insurance on the exchanges can qualify for tax breaks that help them pay for insurance premiums \u2014 refundable tax credits that can be claimed at the end of each coverage year on a taxpayer\u2019s return.\n\nAlternatively, Americans can estimate their incomes for the upcoming year and have an estimated tax credit paid in advance directly to their health insurance providers. Those are supposed to be reconciled the following year, depending on whether the person makes more or less than what he or she estimated.\n\nThe IRS\u2019s task of distributing health insurance credits has made many Republicans uneasy \u2014 particularly because other refundable tax credits administered by the IRS have high fraud rates.\n\nTop Finance Committee Republican Orrin Hatch (Utah) has been one of the most outspoken critics of IRS capabilities to administer the ACA credits, and on Tuesday he called the refundable credits a \u201cfraudster\u2019s dream come true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very nature of these credits \u2014 pay first, verify a person\u2019s income later \u2014 will lead to potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of improper payments and could put millions of Americans\u2019 personal information at risk,\u201d Hatch said.\n\nLast month, Hatch and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs ranking member Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) wrote to Werfel with concern following reports that the earned-income tax credit fraud rate was a whopping 25 percent.\n\nRefundable tax credits have long been a problem for the IRS. \u201cRefundable credits are fraught with fraud peril,\u201d Robert Kerr, senior director of government relations at the National Association of Enrolled Agents, said in an email.\n\n\u201cLots of money goes out the door, and IRS generally cannot determine in advance whether the taxpayer is truly eligible.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new internal report finds the agency is prepared on tax credits but not for fraud.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A new internal report finds the agency is prepared on tax credits but not for fraud.", "title": "Checking IRS Obamacare readiness", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/irs-obamacare-fraud-tax-credits-100624.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/16/130513_irs_building_shinkle_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Taxes (1041),IRS (356),Obamacare (1118)", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2661\"", "article_summary": "Refundable tax credits have long been a problem for the IRS.\n\u201cThe IRS has a strong, effective system in place for administering the Premium Tax Credit,\u201d Werfel said.\nThe IRS\u2019s task of distributing health insurance credits has made many Republicans uneasy \u2014 particularly because other refundable tax credits administered by the IRS have high fraud rates.\nThe agency is charged with distributing the Obamacare tax credits starting in January and also with assessing penalties for not holding insurance.\nActing IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said the IRS was prepared to administer the credits."}
