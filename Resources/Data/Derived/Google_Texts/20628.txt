A foggy morning along the Front Range should lead to mostly sunny skies and moderate temperatures Saturday.

A dense fog advisory was issued until 9 a.m. from Denver to Fort Collins, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder. Visibilities from zero to one quarter mile are likely along the Interstate 25 urban corridor. Drivers are urged to go slow and use low beam headlights while commuting through foggy areas.

The fog should begin clearing out by 9 a.m. and should be completely dissipated by noon, forecasts said.

In the afternoon, Denver is expected to have mostly sunny skies with a high near 62 degrees.

On Sunday, Denver residents should get a sunny day with a high near 55 degrees, forecasters said.

There is a slight chance of rain before 11 p.m. on Sunday night, but the beginning of the week looks dry and sunny with temperatures in the 60s.
