Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) introduced a piece of legislation that would \u201crestore Americans\u2019 privacy rights by ending the government\u2019s dragnet collection of phone records and requiring greater oversight, transparency, and accountability with respect to domestic surveillance authorities.\u201d\n\nKnown as the USA FREEDOM Act, the legislation would \u201cend the dragnet collection of Americans\u2019 phone records under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act \u2014 which allows the FBI to order any person or entity to hand over any tangible item to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities \u2014 and ensures that other authorities cannot be used to justify similar dragnet collection.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which has 16 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, would also implement safeguards to ensure that the U.S. government does not conduct warrantless surveillance.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nA Special Advocate position would also be created to ensure that Americans\u2019 privacy rights and civil liberties were protected, and detailed public reports about the type and frequency of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders would also be required.\n\nIn a joint press release on Oct. 29, Leahy said he co-authored the legislation because \u201cthe government surveillance programs conducted under the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act are far broader than the American people previously understood. It is time for serious and meaningful reforms so we can restore confidence in our intelligence community.\u201d\n\n\u201cModest transparency and oversight provisions are not enough. We need real reform, which is why I join today with Congressman Sensenbrenner, as well as a bipartisan group of 15 Senators, to introduce the USA FREEDOM Act.\u201d\n\nSensenbrenner added that although the U.S. Patriot Act was implemented after 9/11 to \u201ckeep Americans safe by ensuring information is shared among those responsible for defending our country and by enhancing the tools the intelligence community needs to identify and track terrorists \u2026 the balance between security and privacy was lost.\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s time for the judiciary committee members to come together again as they did with the Patriot Act, but this time pass a piece of legislation that protects American liberties.\n\n\u201cWashington must regain Americans\u2019 trust in their government. The USA FREEDOM Act is an essential first step,\u201d Sensenbrenner said.\n\nTransparent surveillance practices\n\nIntroduction of the Freedom Act legislation comes after Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) proposed a budget amendment bill this past July that would have defunded a portion of the NSA\u2019s budget \u2014 specifically the portion of the agency\u2019s budget that was used to surveil Americans\u2019 phone records.\n\nAmash\u2019s bill failed to pass by 12 votes; the congressman has now come out in support of the Freedom Act.\n\nAdvocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association and privacy-rights group Stop Watching Us have all pledged their support for the legislation.\n\nWhat is unique with this legislation is that Leahy and Sensenbrenner were both the primary authors of the Patriot Act, the specific piece of legislation that the Freedom Act seeks to alter.\n\nIn a joint opinion piece for Politico, Leahy and Sensenbrenner wrote that while there have been debates about the benefits of the Patriot Act since it was passed 12 years ago, collecting \u201cmillions of Americans\u2019 phone records every day \u2014 whether they have any connection at all to terrorism \u2014 goes far beyond what Congress envisioned or intended to authorize.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the revelation that the National Security Agency is collecting the details of Americans\u2019 phone calls on an unprecedented scale, it has come out that the government searches the content of huge troves of emails, collects in bulk the address books from email accounts and social networking sites, at least temporarily collected geolocation data from our cellphones, committed thousands of privacy violations and made substantial misrepresentations to courts and Congress. \u201cNot only do many of these programs raise serious legal questions, they have come at a high cost to Americans\u2019 privacy rights, business interests and standing in the international community. It is time for a new approach.\u201d\n\nThough the legislation\u2019s authors say the government\u2019s surveillance techniques will cease to exist with the passage of the Freedom Act, the intelligence community will still be allowed to gather information on Americans.\n\nBut instead of the surveillance program\u2019s activities being kept secret, the bill would create new oversight, auditing and public reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cNo longer will the government be able to employ a carte-blanche approach to records collection or enact secret laws by covertly reinterpreting congressional intent,\u201d the opinion piece says. \u201cAnd to further promote privacy interests, our legislation establishes a special advocate to provide a counterweight to the surveillance interests in the FISA Court\u2019s closed-door proceedings.\u201d\n\nThough Leahy and Sensenbrenner acknowledge the problems with the U.S. government\u2019s surveillance practices, the two said that they believe Congress has to have some surveillance practices in order to keep the country safe:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressmen involved in passage of Patriot Act introduce bill that reigns in secret surveillance of Americans., FISA, Freedom Act, Jim Sensenbrenner, nsa, oversight, Patrick Leahy, Patriot Act, Privacy, surveillance,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Congressmen involved in passage of Patriot Act introduce bill that reigns in secret surveillance of Americans., FISA, Freedom Act, Jim Sensenbrenner, nsa, oversight, Patrick Leahy, Patriot Act, Privacy, surveillance,", "title": "New \u2018Freedom Act\u2019 Would Curtail The Patriot Act", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/freedom-act-curtailing-the-patriot-act/171740/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/103113_NSA_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-07T10:32:11-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressmen involved in passage of Patriot Act introduce bill that reigns in secret surveillance of Americans., FISA, Freedom Act, Jim Sensenbrenner, nsa, oversight, Patrick Leahy, Patriot Act, Privacy, surveillance,", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/103113_NSA_4x3.jpg", "title": "New \u2018Freedom Act\u2019 Would Curtail The Patriot Act", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Don't Miss MPN Exclusives", "tag": "surveillance", "published_time": "2013-11-01T05:00:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T10:32:11-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d9f\"", "article_summary": "New \u2018Freedom Act\u2019 Would Curtail The Patriot ActCongressmen involved in passage of Patriot Act introduce bill that reigns in secret surveillance of Americans.\nAmash\u2019s bill failed to pass by 12 votes; the congressman has now come out in support of the Freedom Act.\nWhat is unique with this legislation is that Leahy and Sensenbrenner were both the primary authors of the Patriot Act, the specific piece of legislation that the Freedom Act seeks to alter.\nThe USA FREEDOM Act is an essential first step,\u201d Sensenbrenner said.\nIn a joint press release on Oct. 29, Leahy said he co-authored the legislation because \u201cthe government surveillance programs conducted under the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act are far broader than the American people previously understood."}
