He won a Cy Young Award and a World Series MVP trophy.\n\nSince retiring in 2000, the 55-year-old Hershiser has worked for ESPN and served as a special assistant to the general manager and pitching coach of the Texas Rangers. He has been a managerial candidate twice and turned down an offer to become GM of a team in the East because he wants to remain in the West. This year, Hershiser returned to Los Angeles, where he was a starting pitcher for 12 seasons.\n\nI was witness to possibly the most thought-provoking, brain-storming conversation ever held at Coors Field this past week, a discussion by visitors from an opposing organization \u2014 Hershiser and TV partners Nomar Garciaparra, the former all-star shortstop, and radio Hall of Fame baseball announcer Charlie Steiner. All I did was ask, \u201cWhat would you guys do about the Rockies?\u201d\n\nTheir solutions were inspired, imaginative and innovative.\n\nAll three agreed that the fences at the ballpark must be moved in \u2014 a fanciful scheme to most, but a relocation that should have been done years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the home runs that kill you here,\u201d Hershiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s all those runners at second and third practically every inning. The pitching staff has no chance.\u201d\n\nCoors Field, it\u2019s been said, is where curveball pitchers go to die.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about angles and release points and types of pitchers. The curveball won\u2019t break, and because it leaves the hand at three-quarters, it rises as it gets to the plate. That\u2019s the sweet spot for hitters,\u201d Hershiser said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to throw tight sliders, because they don\u2019t require as much spin. And you\u2019ve got to have pitchers who have (nerve). When there are men at second and third with one out, you have to be aggressive and willing to throw a slider down and away. I knew when they signed Mike Hampton and Denny Neagle, a couple of curveballers, years ago, that would be a complete failure.\u201d\n\nGarciaparra said the Rockies\u2019 world-famous humidor is \u201cillegal\u201d but does its job to keep down scoring. \u201cThey should put an umbrella (dome) over the stadium like in Seattle and create humidity,\u201d he said.\n\nHershiser suggested gigantic spray-misters ringing the park.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just the pitchers,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the (batting average) splits of even the good hitters. There\u2019s little spin (on the ball) here, and Tulo (Troy Tulowitzki) adjusts. Batters recognize spin and react. Then, when Tulo goes on the road, he sees the same spin and reacts, and the ball breaks a foot more.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pitch and hit one way at home and completely different on the road in order to win.\u201d\n\nSteiner said, \u201cPut the walls closer and make \u2019em higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse the space behind them for picnic areas,\u201d Hershiser said.\n\n\u201cThe gaps are too big in the outfield. Close them. Other teams with little parks win,\u201d Garciaparra said.\n\nHershiser continued to recommend concepts and initiatives \u2014 i.e., more off-day side pitching for starters on the road, and a new approach to preparing the Rockies\u2019 minor-league pitchers \u2014 and the trio finally had to stop talking Rockies only when they had to start talking on the air.\n\nSo, at last, I asked the man who holds the record for consecutive scoreless innings (59) and once was called the smartest, most competitive player in baseball: \u201cWould you be willing to take over a team?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have to be an ideal situation, and challenging,\u201d he said.\n\nPoint blank: \u201cHow about the Rockies?\u201d\n\nThe ex-great pitcher balked. He respectfully declined to answer.\n\nIt is known, though, that Hershiser definitely would consider a proposition to become the Rockies\u2019 executive vice president of baseball operations \u2014 with the same authority former superstar players John Elway and Joe Sakic have with the Broncos and the Avalanche, respectively.\n\nThe triumvirate of Dan \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d O\u2019Dowd, Bill Geivett and Dick Monfort has proven conclusively they don\u2019t know how to run the Rockies. No division titles and a losing percentage of 57 percent over the past 3\u00bd seasons and an ongoing fiasco this season is further proof.\n\nWhat to say straight-faced to the millions of distressed Rockies followers? It\u2019s time for a significant change by the Rox ownership.\n\nHershiser should be hired to bring this franchise back from the dead.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Rockies should hire Orel Hershiser to run their show", "title": "Paige: Rockies should hire Orel Hershiser to run their show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/05/paige-rockies-should-hire-orel-hershiser-to-run-their-show/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140705_083822_orel-hershiser.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140705_083822_orel-hershiser.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-05T19:52:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:22:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f33\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBulldog\u201d Orel Hershiser is the perfect choice to lead the Rox out of the Black Hole of Baseball.\nThe tall, lean, bespectacled Hershiser, who is in Denver this holiday weekend as a Los Angeles Dodgers TV analyst, won 204 games in his sterling career.\nThe triumvirate of Dan \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d O\u2019Dowd, Bill Geivett and Dick Monfort has proven conclusively they don\u2019t know how to run the Rockies.\nThis year, Hershiser returned to Los Angeles, where he was a starting pitcher for 12 seasons.\nThen, when Tulo goes on the road, he sees the same spin and reacts, and the ball breaks a foot more."}
