(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)\n\n4384750\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner has hired Jonathan Turley, a renowned liberal law professor, as his lead counsel in the House\u2019s lawsuit against the Obama administration\u2019s delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nTurley is a law professor at the George Washington University, frequent legal commentator and self-avowed liberal. He may be the perfect pick for House Republicans \u2014 Turley is not only a liberal, but is friendly toward Obamacare itself, according to his writings. But he\u2019s vociferously pushed back against President Obama\u2019s generous use of executive action in the past and has hit the administration for its implementation of the health-care law and he said he jumped at the chance to represent House Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor to represent the institution in this historic lawsuit and to work with the talented staff of the House General Counsel\u2019s Office,\u201d Turley wrote at his blog Monday. \u201cTo quote the movie Jerry Maguire, the House \u2018had me at hello\u2019 in seeking a ruling to reinforce the line of authority between the branches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question presented by this lawsuit is whether we will live in a system of shared and equal powers, as required by our Constitution, or whether we will continue to see the rise of a dominant Executive with sweeping unilateral powers,\u201d Turley continued. \u201cThat is a question worthy of review and resolution in our federal courts.\u201d\n\nTurley has spoken out against not only the administration\u2019s unilateral employer mandate delay, but also Obama\u2019s expected executive amnesty. On Friday Turley warned that Obama was usurping the legislature\u2019s power with his plan for amnesty, which Boehner originally considered including in the lawsuit over the summer.\n\n\u201cNo president can take on the power of all three branches and that\u2019s what he seems to be doing,\u201d Turley said about the planned action on Fox News Friday. \u201cHe certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority \u2026 that does become a government of one.\u201d\n\nWhile Turley may be a good fit for House Republicans, they\u2019ve had trouble retaining counsel in the past. Two Washington, D.C. law firms backed out of representing the House thus far \u2014 first attorney David Rivkin of BakerHostetler and then Bill Burck of Quinn Emanuel Urquhuart & Sullivan.\n\nJudicial Watch, a conservative watchdog, is seeking information from the White House on whether administration officials pressured the firms into dropping the case. A Boehner spokesman told Politico last month that political pressure from \u201cwealthy, Democratic-leaning clients\u201d was a factor in the firms backing out.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "House GOP 'had me at hello'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner has hired Jonathan Turley, a renowned liberal law professor, as his lead counsel in the House's lawsuit against the Obama administration's delay of Obamacare's employ", "title": "Liberal Law Professor DYING To Join Republicans' Obamacare Lawsuit", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/18/boehners-obamacare-lawsuit-boosted-by-liberal-law-professor/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-18T172404Z_1_LYNXNPEAAH0XT_RTROPTP_4_USA-KEYSTONE-e1416337654130.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House GOP 'had me at hello'", "title": "Liberal Law Professor DYING To Join Republicans' Obamacare Lawsuit Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/18/boehners-obamacare-lawsuit-boosted-by-liberal-law-professor/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-18T172404Z_1_LYNXNPEAAH0XT_RTROPTP_4_USA-KEYSTONE-e1416337654130.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-18 14:10:15", "sailthru.title": "Boehner's Obamacare Lawsuit Boosted By Liberal Law Professor", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "john-boehner,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "john boehner,jonathan turley,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner has hired Jonathan Turley, a renowned liberal law professor, as his lead counsel in the House's lawsuit against the Obama administration's delay of Obamacare's employ", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-18T172404Z_1_LYNXNPEAAH0XT_RTROPTP_4_USA-KEYSTONE-e1416337654130.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca609\"", "article_summary": "Turley is a law professor at the George Washington University, frequent legal commentator and self-avowed liberal.\n(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)4384750Speaker of the House John Boehner has hired Jonathan Turley, a renowned liberal law professor, as his lead counsel in the House\u2019s lawsuit against the Obama administration\u2019s delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.\nHe may be the perfect pick for House Republicans \u2014 Turley is not only a liberal, but is friendly toward Obamacare itself, according to his writings.\nTwo Washington, D.C. law firms backed out of representing the House thus far \u2014 first attorney David Rivkin of BakerHostetler and then Bill Burck of Quinn Emanuel Urquhuart & Sullivan.\nA Boehner spokesman told Politico last month that political pressure from \u201cwealthy, Democratic-leaning clients\u201d was a factor in the firms backing out."}
