Valentine's Day may be another week away, but that did not stop a local organization from celebrating Saturday.

Beta Sigma Phi hosted their 61st Annual Valentine's Ball. The sorority is an international service organization with several chapters in Bay County.

The event was filled with food, friends, and music, and even Newschannel 7's Neysa Wilkins wrote and performed a song remembering the sorority's year.

The sorority's Vice President talked about how the event will go back the community.

"There's several chapters here in town. Each of them do a variety of service. This particular event is for scholarships. We give local scholarships to colleges or schools of their choice," says Quinta Scarfo, Vice President of Beta Sigma Phi
