And while his aides insist Obama is as focused as ever on the here-and-now job of running the country, his decisions as President are beginning to hint at his desire to cement a legacy for himself long after he departs the White House.\n\nOn race -- a topic on which his legacy in some ways is already fixed as the first African-American president -- Obama and the first lady have become more and more candid in the waning days of the Obama administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama told a forum on poverty that he makes no apologies for speaking personally about his own experiences growing up as a black man without a father.\n\n\"I know the costs that I paid for it,\" he said. \"And I also know that I had the capacity to break that cycle, and as a consequence I think my daughters are better off. \"\n\nMichelle Obama spoke in just as plain terms on Saturday about the anxieties that came along with becoming the first black First Lady.\n\n\"Was I too loud or too angry or too emasculating?\" she wondered. \"Or was I too soft, too much of a mom and not enough of a career woman?\"\n\nLast week Obama re-launched his My Brother's Keeper initiative as a non-profit organization, with millions of dollars in commitments from private firms and a high-wattage roster of board members. He said the program's work on establishing mentorships and increasing access to good education for young minority men would remain his focus \"for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama presidential library -- the physical embodiment of his legacy -- has found a home on Chicago's South Side, with fundraising for the $500 million project set to ramp up soon.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama nominates new Joint Chiefs chairman Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama nominates new Joint Chiefs chairman 02:33\n\nEven Obama's hiring choices are beginning to hint at what the current President hopes to bestow upon his successor: his pick for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Joseph Dunford, has helped orchestrate Obama's drawdown of troops in Afghanistan, a prolonged process the President hopes can continue when the next commander-in-chief takes over.\n\nIf Dunford is confirmed by the Senate, his two-year term will extend past Obama's own departure date, meaning he'll advise whoever next occupies the Oval Office.\n\nAs Obama begins reaching the milestones of a second-term president, like when he visited his 50th state last Friday, he's become more willing to discuss the next chapter of his life, making the outlines of his post-White House existence ever clearer.\n\n\"I'll be done being President in a couple of years, and I'll still be a pretty young man,\" Obama told a crowd of students at a library in Washington last week. \"And so I'll go back to doing the kinds of work that I was doing before, just trying to find ways to help people -- help young people get educations, and help people get jobs, and try to bring businesses into neighborhoods that don't have enough businesses. That's the kind of work that I really love to do.\"\n\nWhen he appeared on Letterman's show, Obama told the retiring host he and first lady Michelle Obama \"want to continue to do the things we care about in a different capacity,\" which he said included helping military families and advocating for moves to stem climate change.\n\nIn the past, Obama has suggested he might return to teaching, and he's widely expected to write a third book after his first two titles, \"Dreams from My Father\" and \"The Audacity of Hope\" earned him millions.\n\n43 photos: Presidents of the United States 43 photos: Presidents of the United States George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He also served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and he has the distinction of being the only President unanimously elected by the Electoral College. Hide Caption 1 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States The second U.S. President, John Adams, served from 1797 to 1801. He was also the first vice president of the United States, and he was the first President to reside in the White House, moving in on November 1, 1800, while the White House was still under construction. Hide Caption 2 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Thomas Jefferson, the third President (1801-1809), was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. While President, Jefferson doubled the size of the United States by purchasing the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803. Hide Caption 3 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States James Madison, the fourth President (1809-1817), was nicknamed the \"Father of the Constitution.\" During his presidency, the first formal declaration of war was enacted -- the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Hide Caption 4 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States James Monroe (1817-1825) was the last of the Founding Fathers to be elected President. During his seventh State of the Union address, he outlined a foreign policy that warned European powers against further colonization of or meddling in the Western Hemisphere. This was later known as the Monroe Doctrine. Hide Caption 5 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States John Quincy Adams (1825-1829) was the son of second President John Adams. He was the only President to serve in the House of Representatives after serving as President. Hide Caption 6 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) was the only President to serve in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. He is also the only President to have been a former prisoner of war: Jackson was 13 when became a courier during the Revolutionary War, and he was later captured by the British. Hide Caption 7 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Martin Van Buren (1837-1841) was the first President to be born a U.S. citizen. Previous Presidents were born before the United States was a country, making them colonists and, consequently, citizens of Great Britain. Hide Caption 8 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States William Henry Harrison (1841) probably had only just finished unpacking his things at the White House when he died of pneumonia one month into his term. Harrison was the first U.S. President to die while in office, and he had the shortest tenure ever of any commander-in-chief. Hide Caption 9 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States John Tyler's term (1841-1845) saw several presidential firsts. He was the first vice president to succeed office after the President died, he was the first to lose his wife while in office, and he was the first to marry while in office. Hide Caption 10 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States James K. Polk (1845-1849) oversaw the greatest expansion of territory of any President in history. The expansion included what would become the future states of Texas and California. Polk also negotiated with Britain to establish the boundaries of the Oregon Country. Hide Caption 11 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Zachary Taylor (1849-1850), aka \"Old Rough and Ready,\" was a hero in the Mexican-American War. Mystery surrounds his actual cause of death from a stomach ailment. Did he just eat too many cherries, or was it murder? The 1991 exhumation of his body proved it wasn't arsenic poisoning at least. Hide Caption 12 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Millard Fillmore (1850-1853) was the last President who was neither a Democrat or a Republican. He helped pass the Compromise of 1850, legislation that included the Fugitive Slave Act and California's admission to the Union as a free state. Hide Caption 13 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Franklin Pierce (1853-1857) was the first President to not get his party's nomination for re-election. He signed the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the people there to decide whether to allow slavery. This worsened the tension between the North and South. Hide Caption 14 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States James Buchanan (1857-1861) was the only President who never married. He failed to prevent seven pro-slavery states from seceding during his term. Hide Caption 15 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865), purveyor of tall top hats and log cabins, preserved the Union during the Civil War and freed the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation.

Hide Caption 16 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Andrew Johnson's (1865-1869) trial by impeachment in the U.S. Senate resulted in his acquittal by a single vote. History gives him a terrible performance review: His plan for post-war Reconstruction failed, and he had little support from Congress or the public. Hide Caption 17 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Tasked with unifying the country after the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877) established the Department of Justice to protect the rights of freed slaves.

Hide Caption 19 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Just four months into his term, James Garfield (1881) was shot by a disgruntled lawyer who'd aspired to join the administration as a diplomat. The President was taken to the Jersey Shore, where doctors hoped the ocean air would help him recover. He died two weeks later. Hide Caption 20 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Chester Arthur (1881-1885) signed a bill mandating a merit-based system for hiring public workers. The idea was to curb patronage and politically motivated appointments.

Hide Caption 23 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States William McKinley (1897-1901) led the country through the Spanish-American War, a three-month conflict that began with the sinking of the USS Maine and ended with Cuban independence. During the beginning of McKinley's second term, he was fatally shot by an anarchist. Hide Caption 24 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States At 42, Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) was the youngest man to take the oath of office. A progressive reformer and environmental advocate, Roosevelt brought lawsuits against corporate trusts, taking on business giants to level the playing field for the working class. Hide Caption 25 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States William Howard Taft (1909-1913) also served as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in his post-presidency years.

Hide Caption 27 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Warren G. Harding's term (1921-1923) was cut short by his sudden death from a cerebral hemorrage.

Hide Caption 28 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929) served as vice president until the death of Warren G. Harding. His 1924 campaign slogan was \"Keep Cool with Coolidge,\" and his nickname was \"Silent Cal\" because of his reputation as a man of few words. Hide Caption 29 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Herbert Hoover (1929-1933) was inaugurated on the year of the stock market crash that sent the country into the Great Depression. Although Hoover pushed for money to be appropriated for large-scale projects, he opposed federal relief payments directly to individuals. The national economy never recovered during his term, and the shantytowns that developed were nicknamed \"Hoovervilles.\" Hide Caption 30 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) was the only President elected to the office four times. During his 12 years as President, he championed numerous social programs and measures, including the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Civilian Conservation Corps and Social Security. Roosevelt contracted polio at age 39 and never recovered the use of his legs. Hide Caption 31 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) served as vice president for 82 days before the unexpected death of Roosevelt. He authorized the use of two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hide Caption 32 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Dwight D.

Kennedy and took the oath of office on a plane after Kennedy was assassinated. In 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that banned segregation and discrimination based on race and gender. The law was a cornerstone of Johnson's vision of a \"Great Society\" that also included a \"war on poverty.\" Hide Caption 35 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Richard Nixon (1969-1974) became the first President to resign from office as he faced impeachment for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Nixon made strides in domestic policy, proposing legislation that resulted in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Abroad, he established relations with China and a d\u00e9tente in Soviet relations. Hide Caption 36 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Gerald Ford (1974-1977) had been appointed vice president by Nixon after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. He then became President when Nixon himself resigned. Remembered mainly for his pardon of Nixon and his physical clumsiness, Ford was not elected to a second term. Hide Caption 37 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) brokered the 1978 Camp David Accords, the agreement that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. At home, Carter's presidency was plagued by inflation and unemployment, and he lost his bid for a second term amid the hostage crisis in Iran. Hide Caption 38 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) was the only actor ever elected President, and his talent as a speaker earned him the moniker \"the great communicator.\" An affable Republican who wooed many Roosevelt Democrats, the staunchly anti-communist Reagan is seen as having played a large part in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Hide Caption 39 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States George H.W. Bush (1989-1993) was a former CIA director and served two terms as vice president under Ronald Reagan. His approval rating at home soared after he led an international coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait, and communism in Eastern Europe fell on his watch. But he lost his bid for re-election amid a sluggish economy and after reneging on a promise not to raise taxes. Hide Caption 40 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Bill Clinton (1993-2001) ran on the slogan, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Plagued by various scandals -- including accusations of sexual impropriety -- he was the second president to be impeached. He was acquitted in 1999. Hide Caption 41 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States George W. Bush (2001-2009) is the son of former President George H.W. Bush. His presidency was largely defined by his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2003, he ordered the invasion of Iraq on suspicion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Hide Caption 42 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States Barack Obama (2009-2017) became the first African-American to hold the office of President. He took the oath of office amid the Great Recession, the biggest economic challenge since the Great Depression. Under the Affordable Healthcare Act, millions of uninsured Americans have gotten health insurance. Hide Caption 43 of 43\n\nSpeaking to Letterman, Obama noted his oldest daughter Malia will have left for college by the time he departs office, though her younger sister Sasha will still be in high school. In the past, the Obamas have hinted they may remain in Washington until Sasha graduates from the Sidwell Friends School -- though they haven't committed to staying in D.C. past 2017.\n\nPeople close to the first family suggest a move to New York City could be in the works, rather than a move back to the red-brick Georgian home they still own in Chicago's Hyde Park. And while the White House regularly shoots down rumors that home sales from Palm Springs to Oahu are connected to the president, the Hawaii-born Obama is known to relish warm-weather getaways.\n\nWhite House officials insist\u200e that for now, the President is mainly interested in governing during the \"final quarter\" of his presidency. Decisions already made during the first six years of his tenure -- bailing out automakers, signing Obamacare, killing Osama bin Laden -- already stand out as lasting elements of his legacy.\n\nIn his second term, Obama has turned to executive action on controversial issues to advance his agenda items, including protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and enacting new regulations for power plants in a bid to address climate change.\n\nTwo major elements to his foreign policy legacy have involved engaging nations once considered hostile to the United States. His meeting with Cuba's Raul Castro in early April marked a milestone in thawing relations between Washington and Havana, and negotiators continue working with Iran toward a deal to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: Some communities have odds stacked against them Replay More Videos ...

In that regard, he's no different than his most recent predecessors.\n\nIn early 2007, supporters of President George W. Bush began raising funds for the Texan's eventual presidential library in Dallas, a center he also envisioned to include a conservative think tank.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton was similarly working to make plans -- and secure funds -- for his presidential library during in the two years before he left office.\n\nThe White House has said the Obamas won't fundraise for their presidential foundation while in office -- though they've been active participants in the planning of their post-White House days.\n\n\"Ever since Jimmy Carter, presidents have spent more time early on in their final two years preparing for what's next,\" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. \"As presidents became more ambitious -- starting foundations and incentives -- they devoted more time to planning and fundraising for whatever they wanted to do.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "When President Barack Obama\u200e sat down Monday with David Letterman, he joked the two would play dominoes together in their upcoming retirements.", "pubdate": "2015-05-05T21:58:33Z", "author": "Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "When President Barack Obama\u200e sat down Monday with David Letterman, he joked the two would play dominoes together in their upcoming retirements.", "pubdate": "2015-05-05T21:58:33Z", "title": "Obama gives clearer view of post-White House life", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/politics/obama-post-presidency-plans/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150505075528-sot-obama-final-appearance-letterman-large-169.png", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150505075528-sot-obama-final-appearance-letterman-large-169.png", "template-top": "politics,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/politics/obama-post-presidency-plans/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Obama gives clearer view of post-White House life - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-05-12T19:30:14Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd282f\"", "article_summary": "43 photos: Presidents of the United States 43 photos: Presidents of the United States George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797.\nHide Caption 9 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States John Tyler's term (1841-1845) saw several presidential firsts.\nHide Caption 1 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States The second U.S. President, John Adams, served from 1797 to 1801.\nHide Caption 39 of 43 43 photos: Presidents of the United States George H.W.\nTwo major elements to his foreign policy legacy have involved engaging nations once considered hostile to the United States."}
