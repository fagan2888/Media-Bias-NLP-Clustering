State Sen. Kris Jordan is the only Republican member of the Ohio Senate who didn’t take donations from labor unions in 2014.

Of the 22 other Republicans in the 33-seat Ohio Senate, 11 reported more than $25,000 in union campaign contributions, and five received more than $50,000 from labor unions.

Excluding donations of $100 or less, unions gave Ohio Senate Republicans $697,647 last year. Each of the four members of Republican majority leadership accepted more than $20,000 in union campaign contributions.

Several Ohio Senate Republicans even received contributions from the Ohio Education Association and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees affiliates, public-sector unions that represent Ohio teachers and public employees.

Recipients of OEA and AFSCME money included Sen. Scott Oelslager, who has pledged to support union front We Are Ohio’s campaign against making Ohio a right-to-work state. Twenty-four unions contributed $88,011 to Oelslager, making him the top Senate Republican recipient of union donations last year.

Right-to-work laws prevent unions from taking mandatory fees from nonmembers. In coordination with Republican Gov. John Kasich and the Republican-controlled Ohio House, the Ohio Senate could make Ohio a right-to-work state without a single Democrat vote.

Support for labor reform is widespread among Ohio voters, with 75 percent opposed to state law allowing taxpayer resources to be used to collect union dues. Despite union propaganda, a slim majority of Ohioans favor right-to-work.

OEA, the largest labor union in the state, staunchly supports taxpayer-funded automatic dues deduction. OEA divided a total of $47,778 in contributions among Oelslager and five other Senate Republicans in 2014.

Republicans taking OEA donations included state Sen. Frank LaRose, state Sen. Gayle Manning, Senate Majority Floor Leader Tom Patton, state Sen. Jim Hughes and state Sen. Randy Gardner. LaRose and Manning each accepted more than $75,000 from 23 different labor unions last year.

Patton received $66,950 from 33 labor union donors, while Senate President Keith Faber accepted $23,700 from 12 unions. President Pro Tempore Chris Widener took $34,850 from 16 unions, and Majority Whip Larry Obhof took $44,455 from 13 unions.

Ohio Association of Public School Employees donated to Oelslager and to Patton, while Ohio Civil Service Employees Association donated to Oelslager, Patton, Manning and Hughes. OAPSE and OCSEA are affiliates of AFSCME.
