While many pundits have been pressuring House Republicans to use their newly-bolstered majority to defund Obamacare, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume warned that such a move could be a “total blunder.”

Hume, who appeared as a guest on “Fox News Sunday,” told host Chris Wallace that regardless of whether the president’s veto pen or a congressional vote causes a government shutdown, Republicans will be the ones to bear the blame.

“It’s a total blunder to try [tying funding of the government to opposition], because if the president were to veto the bill — a bill that would keep the government going — and there was a shut down, it wouldn’t matter. It never has, what the proximate cause of the shutdown was,” Hume told Wallace.

“It’s an iron rule in Washington exemplified many times, if the government shuts down, the Republicans get the blame,” he continued. “Not some of the blame, not most of the blame, all of the blame. And one would surmise that they may have learned that by now, their leaders seem to have, but there are some within the House and Senate who still think that kind of brinksmanship might work. I doubt it.”

Hume’s remarks came in response to a question submitted to the show via Twitter.
