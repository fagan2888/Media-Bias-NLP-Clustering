Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said working class voters in Ohio will see \u201cthe big picture on jobs and the big picture on manufacturing and the big picture on trade, they\u2019re going to see a few sort of shallow words from Trump, but they\u2019re going to see a lifelong commitment to workers from Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nTAPPER: Cheating China, fighting back. Later on in the ad, it talks about tariffs, imposing tariffs on China. To be frank, that sounds a lot more like Donald Trump than it does Hillary Clinton. How are you going to be able to convince your voters, your working-class voters in Ohio, to vote for her, when they seem to agree more with you and him on the issue of trade?\n\nBROWN: Well, I wouldn\u2019t characterize my position as close to Donald Trump\u2019s. I \u2014 he is highly critical of China. He talks about big tariffs, doesn\u2019t go any deeper than that. His \u2014 his analysis or his solutions \u2014 and, again, look what he does with his own businesses and with his own outsourcing of jobs. But the real issue is, I trust Hillary Clinton on trade and manufacturing because I see her plan. She wants a trade prosecutor to enforce rules and trade laws. She wants to triple the enforcement budgets at the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. She has specific reasons about her opposition to Trans-Pacific Partnership, currency, lack of currency provisions, rules of origin, which is really important in this region of the country with autos. She has been up, and she \u2014 clearly, on manufacturing, she has a real \u2014 an in-depth plan about how to bring manufacturing to this country. Trump has words, but there\u2019s not really any depth there. And that\u2019s why I trust Hillary to do this right\n\nTAPPER: Well, Senator, in-depth plans are all fine and good, but, as I don\u2019t need to tell you, when you go out there and talk to working-class men and women in Ohio, people who think that the deck has been stacked against them by the Washington elite, Democrats or Republicans, selling their jobs down the river, whether they\u2019re going to Mexico or China, a lot of them seem to be very skeptical of Hillary Clinton, and willing to listen to Donald Trump. Are you not concerned about that?\n\nBROWN: Oh, of course I\u2019m always concerned in an election. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m just greatly concerned that Donald Trump will be the nominee of a major political party in this country. And anything can happen in an election. But I also know that \u2014 that Secretary Clinton will work on these trade enforcement issues in a way that \u2014 and will oppose these trade agreements in understanding how to do that, which Donald Trump has never really offered.\n\nI also know that, when you talk to working-class audiences in Ohio, when they start thinking about this in the next four months, Donald Trump has been against the minimum wage. Now he\u2019s kind of all over the place, but he\u2019s fundamentally against. He said wages are too high, so he clearly has been against the minimum wage. He might act like he changed his position.\n\nHe\u2019s against prevailing wage, which will be \u2014 attack right at the heart of the building trades, the people that build our roads and construct our buildings. He\u2019s for right-to-work, which is a dagger in the heart of working-class Ohioans. So, I think, when they see the big picture on jobs and the big picture on manufacturing and the big picture on trade, they\u2019re going to see a few sort of shallow words from Trump, but they\u2019re going to see a lifelong commitment to workers from Hillary Clinton. And that\u2019s why I trust her to do this right. That\u2019s why I endorsed her early. That\u2019s why I campaign hard with her, particularly in the industrial manufacturing, unionized parts of Ohio in the Northeast. And that\u2019s where she\u2019s going to run her margins up and win this state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dem Senator Sherrod Brown: Working Class Voters Will Reject Trump's 'Shallow Words'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Dem Senator Sherrod Brown: Working Class Voters Will Reject Trump's 'Shallow Words'", "title": "Dem Senator Sherrod Brown: Working Class Voters Will Reject Trump's 'Shallow Words' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/brown.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-15T10:37:23-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/05/15/dem-senator-sherrod-brown-working-class-voters-will-reject-trumps-shallow-words/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dem Senator Sherrod Brown: Working Class Voters Will Reject Trump's 'Shallow Words'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/brown.jpg", "title": "Dem Senator Sherrod Brown: Working Class Voters Will Reject Trump's 'Shallow Words' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Senator Sherrod Brown,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Sherrod Brown", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-05-15T10:37:13-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-05-15T10:37:23-07:00", "tag": "Senator Sherrod Brown", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m just greatly concerned that Donald Trump will be the nominee of a major political party in this country.\nTo be frank, that sounds a lot more like Donald Trump than it does Hillary Clinton.\nI also know that, when you talk to working-class audiences in Ohio, when they start thinking about this in the next four months, Donald Trump has been against the minimum wage.\nBut the real issue is, I trust Hillary Clinton on trade and manufacturing because I see her plan.\nThat\u2019s why I campaign hard with her, particularly in the industrial manufacturing, unionized parts of Ohio in the Northeast."}
