They\u2019re helping people who desperately need it, doing something most other people can\u2019t help them with.\u201d\n\nBarnhart said he\u2019s had employees in the past who have gone through abusive relationships and gotten out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more people than you think, who need help having that voice,\u201d he said.\n\nEach coffee shop will have a Pisgah Legal ambassador there to talk with interested customers and spread the word on Pisgah Legal\u2019s mission.\n\nLee Anne Mangone, a volunteer and board member with Pisgah Legal, said she\u2019s been surprised how many people have been willing to stop and talk each year.\n\n\u201cFor people just heading in for a quick cup of coffee, we have some great, real conversations with folks. So many people have no idea what Pisgah Legal does, or what a role it can plan in transforming people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nPisgah Legal, founded in 1978, provides low-income people with everything from protection from cases of domestic violence, fighting for tenants\u2019 rights and navigating the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt has 17 attorneys on staff, and relies heavily on the pro bono services of more than 300 volunteer attorneys and more than 50 office volunteers.\n\nJAVA FOR JUSTICE SHOPS\n\nThe following Asheville shops will donate a portion of their proceeds Thursday to Pisgah Legal Services:\n\n\u2022 City Bakery, 60 Biltmore Ave. and 88 Charlotte St.\n\n\u2022 Bruegger\u2019s Bagels, 671 Merrimon Ave. and 160 Hendersonville Road\n\n\u2022 High Five Coffee Bar at 190 Broadway St.\n\n\u2022 Izzy\u2019s Coffee Den, 74 N.
