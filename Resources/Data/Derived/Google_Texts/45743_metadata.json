The senators were chairs during 2013 and 2014.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nHowever, all eight pages were completely blacked out. That is, except for one full sentence, which makes the response even more offensive:\n\n\u201cWe hope this information has been helpful and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on this bill.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time the ACLU has received this kind of response from a government agency.\n\nIn 2013, the ACLU received a response to its Freedom of Information Act request for information from the FBI on how it interpreted the United States v. Jones case, which is a decision where the Supreme Court found law enforcement must get a warrant to put a GPS device on a suspect\u2019s car.\n\nThe FBI sent the ACLU two documents [PDF 1 & PDF 2]. Both documents were entirely blacked out. Altogether, over 110 pages of black were turned over to the ACLU.\n\nWhat makes this even more stunning is the fact the ACLU has pursued multiple FOIA lawsuits for documents. In two cases, federal appeals courts have ordered the release of records.\n\nThis has forced the government to release documents, like a 41-page July 2010 memo from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel on the legal theories behind the \u201ctargeted killing\u201d of Anwar al-Awlaki.\n\nNo longer can the government simply refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records. It has moved on to wasting time and resources by sending organizations, which seek to advance transparency, completely censored documents.\n\nSo, for those keeping track, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which has proclaimed it is the \u201cmost transparent administration ever,\u201d will engage in this kind of antic to maintain secrecy while at the same time arguing in court the judicial branch has no role in reviewing the lawfulness of drone strikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No longer can the government simply refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records., ACLU, Drones, FBI, FOIA, Justice Department, transparency,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kevin Gosztola | Shadowproof", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "No longer can the government simply refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records., ACLU, Drones, FBI, FOIA, Justice Department, transparency,", "title": "Blacked Out Pages: U.S. Government Snubs ACLU Over Targeted Killing FOIA", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/blacked-out-pages-u-s-government-snubs-aclu-over-targeted-killing-foia/210068/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/censoredtkresponsegraphic-750x507.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-05T09:14:35-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No longer can the government simply refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records., ACLU, Drones, FBI, FOIA, Justice Department, transparency,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/censoredtkresponsegraphic-750x507.png", "title": "Blacked Out Pages: U.S. Government Snubs ACLU Over Targeted Killing FOIA", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "National", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-10-03T05:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-05T09:14:35-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb831\"", "article_summary": "Blacked Out Pages: U.S. Government Snubs ACLU Over Targeted Killing FOIANo longer can the government simply refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records.\nWhat makes this even more stunning is the fact the ACLU has pursued multiple FOIA lawsuits for documents.\nThis has forced the government to release documents, like a 41-page July 2010 memo from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel on the legal theories behind the \u201ctargeted killing\u201d of Anwar al-Awlaki.\nThe senators were chairs during 2013 and 2014.official MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorHowever, all eight pages were completely blacked out.\nThe FBI sent the ACLU two documents [PDF 1 & PDF 2]."}
