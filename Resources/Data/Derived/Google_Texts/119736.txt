The suburban Chicago police department that continues to mourn the death of a lieutenant who was gunned down last week has a new interim police chief and deputy chief.

The Lake County News-Sun (http://trib.in/1hNoXf6 ) reports that the appointments follow last month's retirement of Fox Lake Police Chief Michael Behan. Behan's retirement came days after he was put on paid administrative leave during an investigation of an altercation between an officer and a man arrested last year.

The new interim chief is Lake County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Michael Keller and the interim deputy chief is Sgt. Scot Kurek of the sheriff's department.

They take over as authorities in the area continue to hunt for three suspects in last week's slaying of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz.
