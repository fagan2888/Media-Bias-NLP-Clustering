Already weakened by war, the outbreak has hit the agricultural and mining industries the hardest. There\u2019s also a scarcity of food, and medical services are limited and still poorly equipped to handle the disease\u2019s spread. Because of this, Liberia\u2019s President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said, \u201ca generation of young people risk being lost to an economic catastrophe.\u201d So, what\u2019s the right way to manage an outbreak like this?\n\nResearchers from Penn State University believe responding to disease with a flexible approach, which they call \u201cadaptive management,\u201d could be the best way to fight it. \u201cResponders often have incomplete information during a disease outbreak,\u201d said lead researcher Katriona Shea, a professor of biology at Penn State, in a press release. \u201cEveryone is trying to make rapid decisions, but we don\u2019t have reliable information to make the best decisions. Even if we have information about a previous outbreak, no two outbreaks are identical. Adaptive management involves planning to learn as you act for the most effective, efficient response.\u201d\n\nIn their paper, published in the journal PLOS Biology, the researchers focus on two types of outbreaks, of which adaptive management would have led to better outcomes. For example, during a 2010 measles outbreak in Malawi that ended in over 135,000 new cases, the government initially implemented a vaccination campaign for kids between 6 months old and 5 years. However, it was later discovered that the disease was affecting people as old as 25. Covering all these people would have cost even more money, the researchers noted.\n\nWhat they suggested was that instead of a steadfast approach like Malawi\u2019s government, authorities could had a fixed number of vaccinations per day, and waited for updates on the ages affected by the virus before moving forward with more vaccinations. So, if there were about 35,000 vaccinations a day, and they waited for confirmation of the ages affected, they\u2019d be able to reduce cases by an estimated 10,000.\n\n\u201cThere are tradeoffs to taking the wrong approach,\u201d co-author Matthew Ferrari said in the release. \u201cIf you did the fast, nimble child vaccination but the outbreak had a broader risk, you would miss a lot of people. If you did the slower, broader, more methodical response, you\u2019d protect lots of people but the response may not be fast enough.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, it seems, the U.S. government may have employed a rendition of this approach in managing Ebola before it could spread like it has in West Africa. There have only been three cases diagnosed in the U.S., but the second and third went against every effort \u2014 or lack of it, some would argue \u2014 the government had made leading up to their diagnoses. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where the first Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was treated, failed to properly protect its nurses until two days after he was isolated. Also, not only were hospitals around the country unprepared to handle Ebola-ridden waste, should they have to deal with a patient, but 85 percent of nurses also reported a lack of training in handling a patient with Ebola.\n\nIt could be argued that the government took its time to spot where it was lacking in its response, and then filled in the gaps. Right now there are 120 people in Texas and 142 in Ohio being monitored for the disease, while Nurse Nina Pham was moved from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s isolation unit in Maryland. Amber Joy Vinson, the other nurse who became infected, was moved to Emory University Hospital, where other Ebola patients had been treated, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters is situated. Along with those precautions \u2014 these health centers are far more prepared to handle such a terrible disease \u2014 the CDC also instituted new guidelines for protective gear, including requiring another person to monitor the way it\u2019s put on and taken off.\n\nThough the U.S. government\u2019s response wasn\u2019t as quick as many would have hoped, it may have worked in its favor, helping it to assess the situation, save money on over-preparing health workers, and stopping the disease\u2019s spread before it was too late.\n\nSource: Shea K, Tildesley M, Runge M, Fonnesbeck C, Ferrari M.
