Phil Bryant\u2019s appointment of Supreme Court Justice David Chandler to head the Division of Family and Children\u2019s Services could put in jeopardy a $30 million lawsuit verdict for the state.\n\nIn October, the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld by a 4-4 margin a $30 million verdict for the state against drug company Sandoz. The case was decided by Rankin County Chancellor Thomas Zebert.\n\nThe drug maker has asked the state\u2019s highest court to reconsider its decision. Final briefs from the state arguing that the case should not be overturned are due on Dec. 21.\n\nWithout Chandler on the Court, and if the justices vote the same on the request for rehearing as they did originally, the case and $30 million verdict would be overturned by a 4-3 margin.\n\nKnox Graham, a spokesman for Bryant, said the governor did not look at court cases in appointing an executive director of children\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cThe governor did not consider past or pending decisions when he appointed Justice Chandler,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe identified the best person for the position and appointed him.\u201d\n\nAt some point Byrant will name a replacement from the Northern District for Chandler. It is not clear whether the decision on the reconsideration of the Sandoz case will be made before the appointment is made. And it is not clear how the new justice would rule on the issue.\n\nMississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, who filed lawsuits against numerous companies claiming they artificially inflated the price of drugs being prescribed to Medicaid enrollees costing the state tens of millions of dollars, said he hopes the four justices who sided with the drug company will reconsider.\n\n\u201cWe have such a strong case,\u201d Hood said. \u201cIt was decided by a conservative, well-thought-of chancery judge. This was no run-away jury.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame for a state as poor as Mississippi to lose a $30 million verdict from a company that was cheating the state.\u201d\n\nHood, with the help of private attorneys working on contingency fee contracts, including former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, filed lawsuits against numerous drug companies as did the federal government and other states.\n\nOther drug companies settled with Hood for a total of $147.6 million instead of going to trial. The state netted $117 million from the settlements with $30.6 million going for fees to the private attorneys working on the case and for expenses.\n\n\u201cYou know we have a strong case or those companies would not have settled,\u201d Hood said.\n\nSandoz and drug company Watson opted not to settle. A similar verdict was rendered against drug company Watson in Rankin County Chancery Court. The company also has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. That case has not been ruled on yet by the justices.\n\nThe four justices who ruled in favor of overturning the verdict cited the drug maker\u2019s argument that the state was warned that the average wholesale price, which is what the state based its reimbursement rates on, was artificially inflated. The drug company contended that the state had the responsibility to come up with another method to pay for the drugs.\n\nThe four justices who voted to overturn the verdict were Jess Dickinson and Randy Pierce from the Southern District and Josiah Coleman and Ann Lamar from the Northern District.\n\nThe three siding with Chandler to uphold the verdict were James Kitchens and Leslie King of the Central District and Michael Randolph of the Southern District.\n\nChief Justice William Waller Jr. did not participate in the decision.\n\nEfforts to reach Chandler through the governor\u2019s office and the Supreme Court were unsuccessful.\n\nbobby.harrison@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @bobbyharrison9", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Bobby Harrison Daily Journal Jackson Bureau JACKSON \u2013 Gov.
