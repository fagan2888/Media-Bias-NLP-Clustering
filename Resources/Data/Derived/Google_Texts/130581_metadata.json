The Origination Clause says that \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d\n\nThe argument of the plaintiffs is that the Affordable Care Act and its taxes originated in the Senate, and that the tax/penalty is therefore void. (A 1990 Supreme Court case does strongly suggest that taxes originating in the Senate are void.) Thus far, those lawsuits have been unsuccessful, but they have provoked much commentary.\n\nH.R. 3590 initially was a 6-page bill addressing (1) a federal income credit and (2) acceleration of certain estimated corporate income tax payments. The bill probably would have had little revenue effect, and may even have cost money. After H.R. 3590 passed the House, the Senate gutted it entirely and inserted 2,076 pages of Obamacare. The Senate voted for H.R. 3590 in that form, and transmitted it to the House, which likewise approved it.\n\nAs readers of this site know, I have my own political views, but I do my best to conduct objective research. And I insist on reporting my results whether I personally like them or not. In January, I began an independent research project to determine if the Origination Clause lawsuits have merit. The answer turns out to be both \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThere are several key issues involved:\n\n* The Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause applies only to \u201cBills for raising Revenue.\u201d What does that phase mean?\n\n* Was the original H.R. 3590 a \u201cBill for raising Revenue?\u201d\n\n* If it was, then the Senate had power only to \u201cpropose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d What is an \u201cAmendment\u201d as the Constitution uses the word? Was the complete replacement of the text of H.R. 3590 an \u201cAmendment?\u201d\n\nThe most commonly-used sources for recovering original constitutional meaning are the records of the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, the debates in the state ratifying conventions, and orations and publications (such as The Federalist) issued in advance of ratification. I found, as some other scholars have, that this material was insufficient to explain the scope and meaning of the Origination Clause.\n\nI often have to venture well beyond the sources customarily used, and that was the case here. The origination rule came from the British Parliament, so I examined 50 years of parliamentary debates, as well as historical works on Parliament. I read 18th century treatises on the topic. I examined the legislative records of American colonies. I also examined the legislative records of the Continental, Confederation, and first Federal Congresses. Finally, I studied the origination rules in the newly-independent American states (14 of them, counting Vermont). This required perusing early state constitutions and legislative records. I disregarded materials generated too late to have influenced the founders.\n\nI embodied my conclusions in a new, and rather lengthy, article. Here they are:\n\n* The constitutional phrase \u201cBill for raising Revenue\u201d means a \u201ctax\u201d or a change in the tax code justifiable only under the Constitution\u2019s Taxation Clause. (An exaction for regulating commerce is not a \u201cBill for raising Revenue.\u201d)\n\n* H.R. 3590 in its initial form was a \u201cBill for raising Revenue\u201d as the Constitution uses that term. It does not matter that H.R. 3590 in that form was revenue-neutral or revenue-negative. All changes to the tax code are within the origination rule.\n\n* H.R. 3590 properly arose in the House of Representatives.\n\n* The Senate had power to propose \u201camendments\u201d of H.R. 3590. An amendment could take the form of a compete substitution. In fact, I found a fair number of examples of founding-era legislatures amending measures by complete substitution.\n\n* However, the constitutional word \u201cAmendment\u201d is limited to the subject matter of the original bill. The claim made by some writers that an \u201cAmendment\u201d could include an unrelated substitute turned out to be erroneous.\n\n* In other words, the power of an amending chamber over a revenue bill is less than the power of an originating chamber.\n\n* For constitutional purposes, all \u201cRevenue\u201d is the same subject matter, so it is irrelevant that the Senate\u2019s revisions completely altered the nature of the taxes in H.R. 3590. Thus, because the Supreme Court has held the penalty to be a tax, the penalty was within the power of the Senate to add. Also valid are Obamacare\u2019s other levies, such as the medical equipment tax.\n\n* On the other hand, because the underlying H.R. 3590 was limited to the subject of revenue and any \u201cAmendment\u201d must address the same subject as the underlying bill, the Senate\u2019s addition of regulations and appropriations wasnot within its power.\n\nI concluded that the Origination Clause lawsuits are attacking the wrong part of the law. The invalid portions of Obamacare under the Origination Clause are not its taxes, but its multitude of appropriations and its regulations on health care providers, employers, insurance companies, and others.\n\nOne final observation: In dismissing one of the origination suits late last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the Obamacare tax was not a \u201cBill for raising Revenue\u201d because it was passed for regulatory purposes. But the anterior constitutional test is whether the initial H.R. 3590 was a revenue bill\u2014and it certainly was, according to the constitutional definition.\n\nIf the Court of Appeals were correct that the penalty is regulatory, then the penalty would be invalid as outside the Senate\u2019s amendment power.\n\nMore importantly, however, the Supreme Court specifically held that congressional regulatory purposes were outside the scope of Congress\u2019s other enumerated powers. Only the Taxation Clause supports the penalty, and it can be preserved only as a tax.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "The invalid portions of Obamacare under the Origination Clause are not its taxes, but its multitude of appropriations and its regulations on health care", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "The invalid portions of Obamacare under the Origination Clause are not its taxes, but its multitude of appropriations and its regulations on health care providers, employers, insurance companies, and others.", "title": "Did Obamacare Violate the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause? | Tenth Amendment Center", "url": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/08/07/did-obamacare-violate-the-constitutions-origination-clause/", "image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unconstitutional.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unconstitutional.jpg", "description": "The invalid portions of Obamacare under the Origination Clause are not its taxes, but its multitude of appropriations and its regulations on health care providers, employers, insurance companies, and others.", "card": "summary", "title": "Did Obamacare Violate the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause? | Tenth Amendment Center"}, "fb": {"pages": 143173285763}, "keywords": "origination clause,aca origination,obamacare origination,constitution,health care,issues", "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/tenthamendmentcenter", "tag": "issues", "published_time": "2014-08-07T09:43:15Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T09:43:15Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In January, I began an independent research project to determine if the Origination Clause lawsuits have merit.\nI found, as some other scholars have, that this material was insufficient to explain the scope and meaning of the Origination Clause.\nI concluded that the Origination Clause lawsuits are attacking the wrong part of the law.\nThe invalid portions of Obamacare under the Origination Clause are not its taxes, but its multitude of appropriations and its regulations on health care providers, employers, insurance companies, and others.\nThe answer turns out to be both \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201dThere are several key issues involved:* The Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause applies only to \u201cBills for raising Revenue.\u201d What does that phase mean?"}
