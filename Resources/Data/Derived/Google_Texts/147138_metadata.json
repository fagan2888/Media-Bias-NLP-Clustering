Obamacare. Gun grabbing. These are just a few reasons grassroots activists on the right gave in a rally cry to all the anti-Obama supporters who want to impeach the POTUS for violating the Constitution. For weeks, at conservative sites, Teabaggers were preparing to move en masse to Washington D.C. to stand up to the oppressive regime, with more than 30 million angry, mostly white males, to Washington D.C. with nearly 1/10 of the U.S. population\u2026well, only 1/10,000,000 or 30 people showed up\u2026to quote Homer Simpson: D\u2019oh!\n\nSo what went wrong? Even with all the free advertising and mentions on the radio and T.V., as well as the right winged media pundits rehashing all the lies and stupidity, where were the people? One rumor floating around the Interweb was the Obama Administration was going to confiscate their guns if they left their home for the protest. Other rumors were, this was just a test run. My theory is that there aren\u2019t that many teabaggers out there and news organizations just blow the news like this all out of proportion.\n\nBack in April 2013, Moral Monday was formed in North Carolina as a way to end the inequality and promote equity at the State level. At the last Moral Monday March, there were more than 80,000 to 100,000 protesters at the State capital. More than 1500 Friends and fellow members from the Unitarian Universalist denomination protested at the march and six members were arrested including Rev. John Saxon, lead minister of the U.U. Fellowship of Raleigh N.C.\n\nThe protest was a success and now, there is an interest to expand Moral Monday outside of North Carolina. Currently a march against Monsanto is in the works world wide and coordinators expect hundreds of thousands or even millions to attend. A spread sheet containing more than 340 rows of cities shows where the march will be on May 24. All six inhabited continents will be marching against the genetic modification of our food and the air is charged with excitement.\n\nSo why the failure? Rush Limbaugh is on more than 600 stations nationwide, Fox News is on every cable and satellite provider while MSNBC is sometimes considered part of a premium package, why the failure? Maybe because the right was destined to fail and their only reason for their existence is to cause a distraction. Whenever the right tried to protest, they ended up as losers. Look back in history. First there was the Whiskey Rebellion, probably the first right winged anti tax libertarian protest and George Washington saved the day. Then there was the Civil War, overturning Plessy vs. Ferguson\u2026it seems that the right will never win.\n\nThen after the rally to impeach President Obama failed, the right winged sites chimed in:\n\nWashington Times: Operation American Spring falls flat: \u2018This is very disappointing,\u2019 Texan says\n\nThe Blaze: Operation American Spring\u2019 Comes to Washington, Was Only Millions Short of Projected Turnout\n\nYet the emotions of 30 million people that organizers were speculating had them excited and the well-planned event according to the conservative site Personal Liberty Digest, which included a three-phase plan by retired Army Col. Harry Rile, the brainchild of the brain-dead idea was probably dreaming of some sort of revolution.\n\nOh and here is the plan:\n\nConcept of Operations: Phase 1 \u2013 Field millions, as many as ten million, patriots who will assemble in a peaceful, non-violent, physically unarmed (Spiritually/Constitutionally armed), display of unswerving loyalty to the US Constitution and against the incumbent government leadership, in Washington, D.C., with the mission to bring down the existing leadership. Go full-bore, no looking back, steadfast in the mission. Phase 2 \u2013 One million or more of the assembled 10 million must be prepared to stay in D.C. as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office. The senior republican in the US House of Representatives will become Speaker of the House and the US House of Representatives will elect a temporary President and Vice President of the United States. The U.S. Senate will take action to elect a new majority and minority leader. As required, the U.S. Congress will execute appropriate legislation to convene new elections or U.S. States will appoint replacements for positions vacated consistent with established constitutional requirements. Phase 3 \u2013 Those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, will comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.\n\nPhase One did not even make it out of the gate, and there was probably more law enforcement than protesters, and a quick check of the various conservative sites and comments nets nothing\u2026except for conspiracy theories:\n\nWashington Times reader: 01) Yes. I agree, the Feds fired-up HAARP. However, do not let this be an end to this noble movement. Restart! Frankly, I wish the event had been staged locally, and at state capitals, in compliment to the DC event. I think what \u201cscared-off\u201d potential attendees was the logistics of a supposed-rally of 30 million\u2013that\u2019s roughly 10% of the population! Similar anti-Barry events in DC have been MUCH more successful and noteworthy. This one, thought noble, proved a terrible embarrassment, only ennobling and enabling the tyrant-in-chief and his minions. The failure here wasn\u2019t in cause, but in planning and forethought and the failure of a supportive conservative press. Restart! Washington Times reader: 02)You are a f\u2026n moron, we have a dictator in our white house along with other criminals and you call these Brave Patriots Crazies? Listen you f\u2026n coward, these men are fighting for our rights and freedoms, if you do NOT like our Country and what it stands for then get the F\u2026k OUT and go live in a communist Country.\n\nDo you understand that? Moron!!! Washington Times reader: 03)Look at the Jeff Sessions time line of all the illegal changes BO has made just to the immigrant laws. Then there is Fast and Furious, the IRS targets and audits, Benghazi, guns to terrorists. Sure looks like a dictator from here.\n\nYet none of those on the right critiqued the failure of the rally but instead deflected the failure to more Obama bashing. Still, it was interesting how we on the left can mobilize and get the people moving while the right complains about Obama and the Democratic Party. Even funnier, if the left were to push for impeaching Obama, we would attract hundreds if not thousands to the same spot. The Teabagger party, as well as the conservative right, are failing and to quote computer gamers, the rally to impeach Obama is an Epic Fail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Benghazi.
