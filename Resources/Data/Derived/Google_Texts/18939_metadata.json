It is Tuesday, January 13 \u2014 the release date of his very well-received new album, \u201cPanda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper.\u201d The euphoria I assumed he\u2019d feel has yet to sink in. Maybe relief will morph to happiness in a few weeks, Lennox mused.\n\nThis is not the first release day for Lennox. He has dropped several solo albums under the moniker Panda Bear, and nine more with the critically acclaimed experimental group Animal Collective. This latest effort suggests aspects of his personality: reserved, curious, competitive, playful and overwhelmingly thoughtful. The title evokes the concept of death, but Lennox explains that it is more about change \u2014 shedding one aspect of yourself for another. While grim material is certainly present on the album, by design it takes a few listens for the feeling to seep in. The darker messages are wrapped in sugary pop-sounds, and bright packaging.\n\nPanda Bear creates a distinctively beautiful form of electronic music. It\u2019s an amalgamation of sound, and is nearly impossible to tease out the individual components: an underlying rhythm, or a string of piano, and of course Lennox\u2019s floating Brian Wilson-like voice. (The inability to \u201ctell what\u2019s what\u201d is how Lennox describes psychedelic music.)\n\nLennox sat down with Salon to discuss the album, the method of creation, some of his favorite records, and why he thinks music festivals are weird. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nSo the album\u2019s out today!\n\nIt was a long road. It took like three years door to door. There were a lot of people working really hard for this one, so the overwhelming sensation is relief at the moment. Maybe in a couple more weeks it\u2019ll transfer to happiness.\n\nYou can exhale now. It\u2019s out and it\u2019s well-received.\n\nYeah it seems like people like it OK.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s beautiful. You said it was a three year process. What is your process, and is it different for each album?\n\nIt is a bit different for each album, but for this one every song followed pretty much the same path, in that it would start off without any singing or any vocals of any kind. There are two songs on the album that don\u2019t have any rhythm, and those started really with the samples \u2014 classical samples that I used. One\u2019s piano, I think it\u2019s Debussy [on the song \u201cLonely Wanderer\u201d], and the other [on \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d] is from \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d\n\nBut every other song started with the drums and some type of rhythm. I tried to create these little rhythm machines where it wasn\u2019t just the drums but also weird noises, and tried to set it up in this really specific, kind of rhythmic, little rhythm music box. And then just kind of refining that and spending a lot of time refining those little pieces. I made maybe like 60 of those, and the ones I liked the best I fleshed out into more fully realized songs. Refining those Lego constructions of the rhythms, the singing parts, I would kind of just start to hear little lines, and I would maybe record those in some kind of trashy way, just really quickly, to remember it. Then the melodies would get built in a similar way, just sort of adding and seeing what felt right and what didn\u2019t. The words were really the last thing.\n\nYou mention Legos \u2014 is it sort of a visual process to build it?\n\n\n\nYeah, it is a bit like Legos or painting \u2014 or cooking, especially, is my favorite analogy. Certain elements in production feel more like salt and pepper, or like stuff that always has to be there in a way, or that almost always works in some kind of form. And the way that flavors kind of work together, I find a lot of corollaries in production where certain types of production elements really seem to fit together really nicely.\n\nI like production and cooking analogies, because it\u2019s like in cooking the ingredients have been, more or less, the same forever, but people are still finding new ways to combine flavors and present things in really specific ways. To cook the stuff or not to cook it \u2014 all these different ways of combining elements and techniques that create new experiences. And I feel like production is the same way, or music production is the same way, where the frequency spectrum has always been the same. There are limits to what you can do with sound but the way that you produce it, the way that you present it, the instruments you use, the types of sounds that you use and how you mix them together, you can still hopefully craft new musical experiences.\n\nWas there a specific feeling or something happening in your life or something you were reading that influenced the trajectory of the album?\n\n\n\nMaybe not so much at the time, but thinking back on previous experiences there was definitely a\u2026kind of noticing what would happen to me. There\u2019s a couple moments in my life where I felt like it was a really dramatic shift in who I was before and after an event. Often intense break ups, or when I moved to Portugal, when I moved to Europe the first time, when my father died, stuff like this where it\u2019s like, the way I thought about myself, my identity really changed because of certain events.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I had a blueprint for that, or that I game-plan going into making the album. It really made sense when we had recorded all the songs and I was trying to figure out a sequence or a group of songs that would tell some kind of story, I hoped. And once I found the sequence that is eventually on the album, it really seemed to reflect the process that I would go through in these, or that I thought I went through in these intense periods of change. Of course, with the whole \u201cPanda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\u201d theme, it made sense. Never talking about death in any sort of literal way, but I was hoping to talk about how, when I would go through these really intense changes, there would be parts of who I was before \u2014 or this self image of who I was before \u2014 that would kind of die.\n\nWhat I thought was interesting was how, despite its name, the album itself is pretty buoyant \u2014 and even the album cover is beautiful.\n\n\n\nThe whole concept of the thing was kind of presenting something dark and abrasive and something that maybe we don\u2019t like to think about so easily and presenting it in a way that made it easier to digest. Like if you put this kind of dark, grotesque stuff in this costume that\u2019s really kind of funny and light, it\u2019s much easier to deal with that harsher stuff.\n\nA lot of the way that stand-up comedy works, where the stuff that they\u2019re making jokes about is often really kind of painful and dark, but talking about it in a humorous way makes it easier to think about. And I felt like a lot of music worked in that way, where a lot of the subject matter is kind of heavy and way below the surface, but the songs themselves, the actual sound, feels kind of playful and light.\n\nAnd there\u2019s certain parts of the production of the music \u2014 I guess I\u2019m talking about the vocals and sing-songy, really simple melodies, kind of like pop, in a way \u2014 I hope that that stuff would be kind of the costume that was making the more abrasive elements of the production sort of easier to deal with, or would make you want to listen to them to the point that you could kind of wrap your head around the elements of music that take more time to appreciate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Animal Collective's Noah Lennox discusses his latest solo album, the creative process and death", "title": "Beautiful songs about \u201cdark, grotesque stuff\u201d: The world according to Panda Bear", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Animal Collective's Noah Lennox discusses his latest solo album, the creative process and death", "title": "Beautiful songs about \u201cdark, grotesque stuff\u201d: The world according to Panda Bear", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/17/beautiful_songs_about_dark_grotesque_stuff_the_world_according_to_panda_bear/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/panda_bear.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Animal Collective's Noah Lennox discusses his latest solo album, the creative process and death", "title": "Beautiful songs about \u201cdark, grotesque stuff\u201d: The world according to Panda Bear", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/panda_bear.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, animal collective, cool culture, Entertainment, Music, Noah Lennox, Panda Bear, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: animal collective, cool culture, Entertainment, Music, Noah Lennox, Panda Bear, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, Innovation News, Entertainment NewsNoah Lennox feels relieved.\nLike if you put this kind of dark, grotesque stuff in this costume that\u2019s really kind of funny and light, it\u2019s much easier to deal with that harsher stuff.\nAnd I feel like production is the same way, or music production is the same way, where the frequency spectrum has always been the same.\nHe has dropped several solo albums under the moniker Panda Bear, and nine more with the critically acclaimed experimental group Animal Collective.\nPanda Bear creates a distinctively beautiful form of electronic music."}
