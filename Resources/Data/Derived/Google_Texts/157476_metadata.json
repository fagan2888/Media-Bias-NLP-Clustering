June runoff elections will force some candidates to reckon with the new power of neighborhood politics. Across the city, diverse neighborhoods are anxious or angry about more dense development, and that suggests a new balance between growth and stability must be struck in the Mile High City.\n\nDenver has been on a pro-growth path under the last five mayors. They pursued mega-projects to chart the city\u2019s comeback after the turbulent 1980s, when the oil crash, real estate meltdown and savings and loan crisis devastated the economy. By investing billions to build Denver International Airport, Union Station and the Central Platte Valley redevelopment, Civic Center projects, museums, libraries, sports arenas and even the Cherry Creek Shopping Center, Denver laid the foundation for the economic benefits and cultural amenities that it now enjoys.\n\nThe pro-development consensus that governed and shaped Denver for the last three decades has been shaken, possibly shattered. This consensus was developed in extensive public processes that led to repeated voter approvals of more than $10 billion in investments in projects benefiting Denver: Denver International Airport ($4.9 billion, 1988/1989); Citizens for Denver\u2019s Future ($242 million, 1989); Coors Field ($100 million-plus, 1990); neighborhood and school improvements ($403 million, 1998); Mile High Stadium ($325 million, 1998); FasTracks ($4.7 billion, 2004); Better Denver ($550 million, 2007); and Denver Public Schools ($454 million, 2008, and $466 million, 2012).\n\nThese massive public investments were supported and framed by land-use plans and regulations also adopted after thousands of hours of public participation. Blueprint Denver, the city\u2019s framework development plan, was approved in 2002, and an entirely new zoning code was adopted in 2010 after five years of community meetings.\n\nLittle development occurred in the years after the new zoning code due to the Great Recession, but the plan was in place, and today we are both the beneficiaries and victims of these plans now that development has returned with a roar. Since the end of the Great Recession, a new phase of development has come at a price to Denver\u2019s neighborhoods, with increased traffic and congestion, expensive rents and parking, and conflicts over more dense development raising neighborhood ire. The flip side of this ire is the remarkable vibrancy of our economy and our cultural, recreational and dining scenes, and the rising home values that have buoyed lucky homeowners\u2019 balance sheets.\n\nCity leaders, planners and developers need to take note of the May 5 election results and rebalance their priorities. A look back at one key project that started Denver on a revolutionary new course contains important lessons.\n\nTwenty years ago, Denver opened its rebuilt Central Library, a unique blend of old and new, that launched the city into a new era of great building. The project was a collaboration between Denver architect Brian Klipp and Princeton, N.J.-based Michael Graves, whose sometime playful use of large geometric shapes reignited public interest in design.\n\nAs a sign of how little the city recognizes this significant turning point in its history, neither the 20th anniversary of the library nor Graves\u2019 death in March after a long struggle with a debilitating spinal infection got much official notice.\n\nHowever, in a conversation about the process that led to one of Denver\u2019s great buildings, Klipp recalled the huge risk that then-Mayor Federico Pe\u00f1a and his planning director, the late Jennifer Moulton, took by including money for design into the proposed bond issue. For most of the last century, \u201cDenver had built mainly utilitarian public buildings,\u201d Klipp recalled. \u201cIt was a lingering residue of our \u2018cowtown\u2019 heritage.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of the Denver Public Library project was that it required the re-use of the classic Burnham Hoyt Central Library, a challenge to blend the old with something new. The way to get there was an extended public process. Klipp recalls that the design competition forums, held at the Denver Convention Center, attracted \u201chundreds of people\u201d and led to a process of \u201ccritique and rediscovery.\u201d\n\nThe library project, he said, \u201cwas a critical moment for Denver. We had a real sense of wanting to emerge from our cowtown-era roots.\u201d\n\nAt roughly the same time, the soaring \u201cteepees\u201d of the new Denver International Airport, designed by Denver architect Curt Fentress, were taking shape. Problems with the baggage system triggered overruns and delays caused their own political crisis. Klipp, who now heads the Denver office of GKKWorks, recalls getting phone calls from then-Mayor Wellington Webb. The message: \u201cTell me I\u2019ve got one project that\u2019s on time and under budget.\u201d\n\nAlong with public process and the pressure to keep things on track came the relentless energy of Graves, who would storm into Denver the night before a major deadline and refuse to buckle under pressure. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got 14 hours, why are you worried?\u201d Graves would tell the Klipp design team.\n\nWith the hole for the foundation dug and footings for the library addition already poured, Graves phoned Klipp after a moment of epiphany. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new design for the top of the drum,\u201d he said. And shortly after he sent over the drawings for the copper platform that\u2019s now an iconic part of the building\u2019s signature.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry was instant,\u201d Klipp recalled about meeting Graves after a Boston-based firm dropped out of the project. \u201cHe was very pleasant, very brilliant and very academic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he was a relentless designer.\u201d\n\nCitizen activism spurred the library competition and the success of the library process then shaped the design of Coors Field, whose original concept was rejected as too utilitarian. Only a subsequent design acknowledged the brick warehouses of LoDo and its architectural gems, including Union Station.\n\nThe original design for Coors Field \u201cwas dead on arrival,\u201d Klipp said. \u201cRichness, complexity and sense that we care about the place\u201d came to define Denver as it emerged in the 1990s. \u201cYou need a good process. You need public scrutiny. And process is a public event, especially for larger projects,\u201d Klipp said.\n\nMore recent experience, such as the unfortunate addition of the Denver International Airport hotel \u2014 derided as a giant butterfly wing or outsized mustache \u2014 suggest that less civic participation leads to lesser quality. \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible,\u201d offered Klipp.\n\nWith projects such as the redevelopment of the National Western Stock Show on the horizon, the city may get a second chance to rediscover citizen engagement and build a project that mixes broad community support with strong design. It might even find that recapturing the city\u2019s long-suppressed cowtown spirit could spur some excitement.\n\n\u201cThe big idea that\u2019s gotten lost is a sense of continuity,\u201d said Klipp. The current pushback over construction and congestion is a reminder of \u201chow far removed the city is from the process that led to the DPL project.\u201d\n\nTwenty years ago, with the city on the economic ropes, there was a lot more concern about getting things right because there was a lot more at stake. But the rewards of process and creativity are long-lasting. Graves, Klipp recalled, was a tough task-master. \u201cHe got upset if we weren\u2019t willing to push ourselves.\u201d\n\nWhat the voters seem to be saying is that they want our leaders to push themselves just a bit harder, too. And, based on Denver\u2019s history of citizen participation in shaping the direction of the city, the voters want a seat at the table again.\n\nHenry Dubroff is an entrepreneur who splits his time between California and Colorado.
