Tessler tells Newsmax Health.\n\n\n\nWhat does surprise Dr. Tessler, though, is how much Carter is doing in his private life, despite his ongoing treatment. At 91, the former president has not slowed his schedule, and even traveled to Memphis earlier this month \u2014 tool kit in hand \u2014 to join with Habitat for Humanity in constructing a house.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven Carter\u2019s age, this is not a group that traditionally does well, no matter what you do. So, while I don\u2019t find what he\u2019s doing is unbelievable, it\u2019s definitely impressive,\u201d says Dr. Tessler, executive director of the Long Island Brain Tumor Center in Lake Success, N.Y.\n\n\n\nThis week, Carter\u2019s doctors said his cancer, which was diagnosed in August, had stopped spreading. He is undergoing treatment for the advanced melanoma, which is a deadly form of skin cancer that had spread to his liver and was found in four spots in his brain.\n\n\n\nThe former president is being treated at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Center in Atlanta with and advanced form of radiation and a new immunologic drug called Kevtruda (pembrolizumab).\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration expedited the approval of Kevtruda last year after studies showed it extended the lives of patients with advanced melanoma. It is also approved for advanced lung cancer.\n\n\n\nImmunologic drugs differ from traditional treatment in that they are a \u201ctargeted\u201d therapy that bolsters the immune system to fight the cancer, as opposed to the conventional drug treatment for cancer, which is chemotherapy.\n\n\n\nChemotherapy kills cells that are subdividing, including non-cancerous ones as well. This is why chemotherapy patients suffer often debilitating side effects, including nausea, hair loss, and frequent infections.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, immunotherapy drugs affect only the cancer cells, and this lessens the side effects. That makes patients like Carter, more likely to be able to continue their usual activities, Dr. Tessler notes.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being treated with the newest type of immunotherapy, the former president is also undergoing the latest form of radiation \u2014 stereotactic radiosurgery, which goes by different names, including \u201cGamma Knife\u201d treatment.\n\n\n\n\u201cGamma Knife is great for melanoma. Traditional radiation doesn\u2019t work, but Gamma Knife does,\u201d says Dr. Tessler.\n\n\n\nLike conventional chemotherapy, traditional radiation does not distinguish between tumor cells and healthy cells \u2014 it kills both. But stereotactic radiosurgery focuses the beams better on the tumor, so it can kill the cancer cells more effectively while sparing the healthy ones.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the past, someone of Jimmy Carter\u2019s age probably wouldn\u2019t have been offered standard treatment because the risks would have outweighed the benefits. But now with stereotactic radiosurgery and immunologic drugs it is now becomes possible,\u201d says Dr. Tessler.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this is the new horizon for cancer treatment, absolutely. There is no question about it,\u201d he adds.\n\n\n\nStill, given Jimmy Carter\u2019s age, and the seriousness of his disease, it remains likely that the former president ultimately will succumb to cancer.\n\n\n\nBut, says Dr. Tessler, \u201che\u2019s going to live a lot longer than we would have expected in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 NewsmaxHealth.
