The same goes for email.\n\nSome workarounds are already popping up. A press release from U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Roswell, arrived this morning, assuring us that he was doing his very best to keep national parks open and veterans served. It was sent by a private firm he\u2019s apparently hired.\n\nLikewise, in a notice sent from his U.S. Senate campaign account, U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Marietta, announced that he would opt out of federal health care coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGingrey said he would shun benefits from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, amid controversy over the employer subsidies granted to members of Congress and their staffs as they are forced to enter the Obamacare exchanges.,\n\nGingrey is one of those trying to strip those subsidies. House Republicans did attach that provision to one of their failed shutdown ping-pong shots, though it\u2019s still a long-shot from becoming law.\n\nIn the meantime, Gingrey is bailing.\n\n\"I will be personally seeking alternatives for my family's health care coverage, just like the rest of Americans affected by Obamacare,\u201d Gingrey said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, I will do everything in my power to fight this terrible piece of legislation.\"\n\nHe has until Jan. 1 to find new health care coverage for himself and his wife. Among the possibilities for the 71-year-old Gingrey, a spokeswoman confirmed, is another federal government program: Medicare.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of Obamacare and irony: Above is a video clip from Lori Geary of Channel 2 Action News, on a $45 million annual hit that Grady Memorial Hospital will take under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe hospital is caught in a pinch. Federal subsidies for hospitals that handle a boatload of indigent patients was cut under the ACA, with the expectation that the expansion of Medicaid rolls by the various states would pick up the slack.\n\nBut Georgia has refused to expand its Medicaid operation, and so Grady will be required to reduce its footprint.\n\n***\n\nThough the U.S. Senate refused to appoint conferees to match the House\u2019s attempt to resolve the government shutdown through the oft-discarded negotiation between the chambers, they did appoint negotiators for the Farm Bill.\n\nAmong them is Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a former chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who will be carrying the concerns of Southern peanut farmers at a time when they feel shafted by Midwestern interests.\n\n***\n\nState Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville, whom a Fulton County grand jury indicted last week for misuse of his legislative expense account, has picked up his first primary opponent. From the Gwinnett Post:\n\nOn Tuesday, Lawrenceville Councilman P.K. Martin announced he would seek Balfour\u2019s District 9 seat, which covers much of Lawrenceville and Snellville. \u201cAfter a lot of thought, prayer and encouragement from people all over the district, I am excited to announce my campaign for state Senate,\u201d Martin said in a press release. \u201cI am running because we need an ethical, conservative leader in the Senate who will make us proud and work hard to deliver conservative reforms to improve this district and our state.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOur friend Joe McCutchen of Elijay is in full rebellion. He\u2019s already supporting Dalton Mayor David Pennington over incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal in next year\u2019s GOP primary. This morning, he sent out this note:\n\nEnjoyed seeing Sam Snider at Gilmer Republican Party meeting last night. Sam is a very fine person and an outstanding leader. Coaching the wrestling team to 11 state championships shows what a great leader he is. Sam, good luck to you, you will be a taxpayer champion when you are elected.\n\nSnider is mounting a GOP primary challenge to House Speaker David Ralston of Blue Ridge.\n\n***\n\nHere\u2019s a new twist in the old Georgia fight between trial lawyers and the medical community: An organization called the 60 Plus Association, a group that defines itself as a conservative alternative to the AARP, is asking Republican state lawmakers to foreswear campaign contributions from trial lawyers or their political action committees.\n\nFrom the group's letter:\n\n\u201c[W]e are asking you to sign the enclosed public pledge we are sending legislators by Oct. 20, 2013, affirming your opposition to the policy goals of the trial lawyers and any future contributions from their PAC. After accumulating and reviewing all petitions, 60 Plus plans on holding all Georgia legislators accountable by publicizing the results.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOn Tuesday, our AJC colleague Mark Niesse noted this twist in a search firm\u2019s hunt for a new Atlanta Public Schools superintendent:\n\nMoney for BoardWalk Consulting\u2019s contract will flow from the unidentified benefactors to Atlanta Public Schools, and the school system will then pay the firm, said Howard Grant, who handles the school board\u2019s administration as its executive director. The money has been raised, and the identity of the group or individuals giving it will be known once invoices are filed, he said.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Fort, R-Atlanta, isn\u2019t satisfied with that timetable. He\u2019s filed a demand, under the auspices of the state Open Records Act, for immediate disclosure of name of the private underwriter \u2013 and the dollar figures involved.\n\n***\n\nWe all know that a movie can be so bad that it\u2019s good. \u201cPlan 9 From Outer Space,\u201d for instance. Likewise, in writing, a metaphor can be so overwrought that it becomes a wonder in itself. Here\u2019s the lede of an editorial in the Rome News-Tribune, describing a budget fight on the Floyd County Commission:\n\nThe sheriff fired both barrels of an oratorical shotgun at the county commissioners and it appeared to go right over their heads. Such aim might have been deliberate ... and a warning shot. It is unusual to hear a sheriff being this blunt, but then Tim Burkhalter is that rare sheriff who remains highly popular both among his deputies and, more important, the citizens whom he serves. When it comes to budgetary matters, for decades now Floyd sheriffs have complained about being shortchanged by commissioners when it comes time to distribute taxes. They have all been right to some degree, but now the cumulative effect of this has reached the point where this sheriff might well lower his shotgun, replace the rhetorical rock salt with bear-hunting slugs \u2014 and he does possess such ammunition \u2014 and aim it straight at the gut of the commission.\n\nLiterature. That\u2019s what it is.
