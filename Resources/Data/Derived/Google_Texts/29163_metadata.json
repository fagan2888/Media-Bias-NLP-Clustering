The union has worked hard for years to make sure its members have good insurance and not the high-deductible coverage plans that only help if a person has a catastrophic illness.\n\n\u201cIt could affect everybody,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nStarting in 2018, a 40 percent tax will be levied on employer-sponsored health plans whose annual premiums are more than $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family plans.\n\nThe Cadillac tax, part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called \u201cObamacare,\u201d was designed to keep down health insurance costs. The thinking was that policies with richer benefits \u2014 low co-pays and deductibles \u2014 encourage Americans to use more health care than they need. Taxing those plans would encourage people to become better consumers of health care and employers to do a better job of tracking the use of health benefits.\n\nAlthough it sounds like the tax would apply to only the privileged few, critics say most employers would be affected.\n\nRoughly 48 percent of large employers expect at least one of their health plans will trigger the tax in 2018, if the employers don\u2019t make any changes, according to a National Business Group on Health survey. However, those employers say by 2020, their most popular health plans will have passed the premium thresholds. The business group surveyed 140 large employers who employ more than 7.6 million people in the United States and insure more than 10 million people.\n\nHowever, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that in 2014, on average, employers paid $6,025 in premiums for worker-only coverage and $16,834 for family coverage. Other studies have shown many employers have taken steps to avoid the impending tax, such as shifting to high-deductible plans and increasing workers\u2019 share of family coverage.\n\nSupporters of the Cadillac tax say repealing it would be a significant setback in changing the health care system to stop rewarding inefficient providers and encouraging overuse.\n\nCritics say the tax unfairly punishes average workers.\n\nSanders said so far the Cadillac tax hasn\u2019t been an issue in contract negotiations, and it\u2019s unclear whether it will become one.\n\nJeff Drozda, chief executive officer of the Louisiana Association of Health Plans, said it\u2019s also unclear how many employers and health plans will be over the tax threshold.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has yet to issue rules, interim or otherwise, on how it will determine the value of a health plan, Drozda said. Will the formula include just the medical coverage? The employee assistance program? Onsite medical clinics?\n\n\u201cThose issues have not been defined yet so that\u2019s why it\u2019s really hard to put a number on it,\u201d Drozda said.\n\nAnother complicating factor is the treatment of health reimbursement accounts, health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. Pre-tax contributions from employers and employees could be included in calculating the value of the cost of coverage.\n\nDrozda said that\u2019s a concern, because HSAs were intended to give consumers more say, and skin in the game, when it comes to health care choices.\n\nAnother is that the premiums are linked to the Consumer Price Index, Drozda said, which means most employers will eventually see their plans overtake the tax threshold.\n\nAt present, the IRS is taking comments on the proposed rules, and the agency is expected to issue final regulations around the end of the year, Drozda said. Once those are out, it should be easier to figure out how many plans and employers will be affected.\n\n\u201cRight now, you just have a bunch of economists talking to each other about it because we don\u2019t know what these definitions are,\u201d Drozda said.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the tax could be repealed or replaced with an alternative, he said.\n\nIn a repeat of an earlier \u201cObamacare\u201d battle, business groups and unions find themselves on the same side in the fight to repeal the tax. Health insurance benefits had not been taxed before, and companies and unions fought unsuccessfully to kill the Cadillac tax before \u201cObamacare\u201d passed.\n\nBut the two groups recently launched the Alliance to Fight the Forty, a lobbying effort to repeal the tax. The push has drawn some bipartisan support.\n\nDespite that, Sanders said there\u2019s some question whether Congress will be able to act in time, given lawmakers\u2019 recent inability to get anything done.\n\nThe Cadillac tax\u2019s revenue, an estimated $87 billion from 2018-2025, also makes it harder for Congress to repeal. Policymakers expect employers to shift the money that they don\u2019t spend on health benefits to workers\u2019 pay, which is taxable.\n\nSteve Littlejohn, a health care consultant and principal at Climb the Curve Communications LLC in St. Louis, said that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cRather than raising workers\u2019 wages, more employers are shifting to high-deductible plans,\u201d Littlejohn said.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic because a recent Kaiser Family Foundation report found that 35 percent of U.S. households didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to pay their health insurance deductibles: $2,500 for individual policies and $5,000 for family coverage.\n\nLittlejohn said instead of repealing the entire Cadillac tax, lawmakers should see that it\u2019s only applied to \u201chighly compensated employees. In 2015, that would be anyone earning more than $120,000.\n\nCongress could also calculate the exemption point at some percentage of the federal poverty level, Littlejohn said.\n\nAdvocate business writer Ted Griggs and St. Louis Post-Dispatch (TNS) writer Jordan Shapiro contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Ted Griggs on Twitter @tedgriggsbr.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/Business/: The next big battle in the ongoing Affordable Care Act war is underway over the \u201cCadillac tax.\u201d It\u2019s a hefty fee to be imposed on the most generous employer-sponsored health plans and one that may affect thousands of Louisianians.
