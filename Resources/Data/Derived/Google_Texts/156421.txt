The father of Dylan Redwine says he might be the one a former FBI profiler recently called a ‘person of interest’ in his son’s death but he doesn’t know because authorities have rebuffed his efforts to speak with them.

“I’ve been in communication with the La Plata County Sheriff’s Department and they have no interest in communicating with me right now,” Mark Redwine, the father of deceased 13-year-old Dylan Redwine, said Saturday morning. “I may or may not be that person of interest. Right now there are more questions than answers.”

The Redwine case jumped back into the headlines this week after former FBI profiler Pete Klismet made statements implying Read in-depth story about Redwine case

“Read story about Klismet’s statementsthat we are very encouraged that we have crossed the bridge from the unknown to the known,” Klismet was quoted as saying in the Durango Herald.

Sheriff’s investigators also revealed that they conducted other searches on Middle Mountain Road, where Dylan’s body was discovered in the vicinity of his father’s house near Vallecito Reservoir in the summer of 2013 and found “items of interest,” according to the Herald report.

“He’s not made any contact with me,” Redwine said Saturday morning, referring to Klismet. “Everything that is being said is being implied. I think people are reading a lot more into this than is warranted.”

Klismet has not identified the person of interest he is referring to and Redwine said no one has told him who it is. But Redwine said it would be fair to say that authorities have previously indicated that they were primarily focusing their investigation on him.

“Everything that has been said is being implied,” Redwine said.

When first called Saturday morning for comment, Redwine brusquely stated, “At this point I’m not talking,” and hung up the phone.
