Marco Rubio (R-FL) has missed the most Senate votes this year out of all the senators who are also running for president, a point that GOP frontrunner Donald Trump highlighted during last month\u2019s GOP primary debate.\n\nProject Vote Smart \u2013 a non-partisan, non-profit political research organization \u2013 examined the voting records for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), running against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, as well as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \u2013 all running for the GOP nomination, and found out that Trump was correct, Rubio missed the most votes.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nProject Vote Smart\u2019s Legislative Research Director Jace Sternadel spoke to Breitbart News about the results, noting:\n\nThe senate vote breakdowns are listed on senate.gov and senators are shown as not voting. Now, that can mean the senator is not physically in the room for the vote, or it can also mean the senator is in the room but choosing to symbolically not vote on the issue.\n\nAccording to Sternadel\u2019s research, Rubio missed the most votes this year while Sanders has missed the fewest:\n\nMarco Rubio = 81 missed votes\n\nTed Cruz = 61 missed votes\n\nLindsey Graham = 51 missed votes\n\nRand Paul = 8 missed votes\n\nBernie Sanders = 6 missed votes\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned over the quality of the votes missed than the quantity,\u201d President of Americans for a Limited Government Rick Manning tells Breitbart News, after hearing the results. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t show up for meaningless attendance votes, who cares? But if they continually miss votes on issues that define the nation, then that is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOne of the major issues facing the U.S. Senate this month was defunding Planned Parenthood, which was pushed by the conservative base after undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials allegedly selling aborted baby body parts went viral on the internet.\n\nHowever, Rubio missed that vote, even though he repeatedly expressed his pro-life position.\n\nAs the Des Moines Register noted:\n\nA secret-money group that supports Marco Rubio for president dropped a mailer in Iowa this week that says he \u2018will defund Planned Parenthood.\u2019\u201d But Rubio skipped two opportunities this week to weigh in on the uproar over the abortion provider, U.S. Senate records show.\n\n\u201cEven more important than simply voting is how has a Member of the Senate running for President used this unique position to fight for and further their beliefs,\u201d Manning added. \u201cWe know that Rand Paul stands for Fourth Amendment freedoms, that Ted Cruz stands for the Constitution and is willing to fight the hard battles against Obamacare, the Iran treaty and funding the dissection and selling of baby parts by Planned Parenthood, but we don\u2019t have any idea what Marco Rubio is willing to fight for.\u201d\n\nManning said that he thinks the fact that he can\u2019t identify Rubio with standing firm on a specific conservative issue is \u201cfar more problematic than the fact he has missed more votes than any other candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust what cause outside of his own desire for advancement is he willing to put his political life on the line for? After hearing him in the debate, I hope he chooses to reconsider and stay in the Senate where he can act on those principles he so clearly outlines.\u201d\n\nTrump also criticized Rubio\u2019s voting record during the second GOP primary debate in Simi Valley, California last month.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that the federal government must do \u2014 the one thing that only the federal government can do \u2014 is keep us safe,\u201d Rubio said during the second GOP debate hosted by CNN. \u201cAnd a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today,\u201d challenged Trump, referencing Rubio\u2019s absent votes. \u201cNumber one, I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I am a businessman doing business transactions.\u201d\n\nRubio has acknowledged his attendance record is less than perfect, but says it is because he is focusing on a more important goal, winning the White House.\n\nPolitifact also fact-checked Trump\u2019s statements, and found the GOP frontrunner is accurate with regards to Rubio\u2019s voting attendance. Politifact\u2019s research \u201cfound that the \u201cmost truant\u201d award goes to Rubio if we\u2019re looking at this year only. If we examine career records, Republican rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas takes the crown.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump was correct, Rubio missed the most votes.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump was correct, Rubio missed the most votes.", "title": "Exclusive - Nonpartisan Analysis Shows Donald Trump Right About Marco Rubio's 'No Show' Voting Record - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Rubio-Getty.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/02/exclusive-nonpartisan-analysis-shows-donald-trump-right-marco-rubios-no-show-voting-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump was correct, Rubio missed the most votes.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Rubio-Getty.png", "title": "Exclusive - Nonpartisan Analysis Shows Donald Trump Right About Marco Rubio's 'No Show' Voting Record - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Politifact, Project Vote Smart, Sen.
