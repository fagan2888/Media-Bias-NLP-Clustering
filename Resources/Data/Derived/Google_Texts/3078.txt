This spot, from the Koch brothers-backed group Generation Opportunity, which is focused on young conservatives, is the creepiest political ad you'll see this month:

The appearance of Sam, America's creepy uncle, at the end is kind of rapey. And the idea that rich people would spend so much money discouraging people from purchasing health insurance (and thereby becoming dependent on either their parents or taxpayers) is kind of messed up.

But I'll choose to focus on the silver lining here: If I understand the ad's message properly, Republicans are apparently now opposed to government-mandated invasive gynecological procedures. Feel the change!
