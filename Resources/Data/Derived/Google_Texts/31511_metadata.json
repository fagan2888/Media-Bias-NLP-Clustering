Hayworth onWatchonand. Geton your cable system \u2013\"He's starting to, he's peaked a little bit and I think his numbers are coming down \u2026 he'll fizzle out shortly.\"Zogby said he is not surprised that Trump supporters say if the billionaire developer ends up dropping out, they'll embrace Dr. Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon who is in second place.\"This is the period of the outsider and [there are] two completely different personas here, but Ben Carson at least for now is providing an alternative persona and a lot of red meat for conservatives in the race,\" he said.\"At this point in time, it doesn't surprise me at all that the two are leading the pack and that Carson is still seen as viable.\"Craig Shirley, president of Shirley & Banister Public Affairs, who also appeared on \"Newsmax Prime,\" noted President Barack Obama's criticism of Trump on CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\"\"Donald Trump represents probably right now the greatest indictment against President Obama's administration and his legacy right now.

Everything that he's engaged in or brokered is seen as a bad deal.\"So in a way, there's an inverse proportion ratio between the demise of Barack Obama, the ending of his presidency, and the rise of Donald Trump. I suspect it will continue to grow.\"Zogby is author ofwritten with Joan Snyder Kuhl and published by Amazon Digital Services.
