In fact, only about 10,000 to 15,000 out of almost 6 million U.S. businesses will be forced to start offering health insurance to employees.\n\nData from the U.S. Small Business Administrationshows that the vast majority of the more than 5.7 million businesses in the United States have fewer than 50 employees, and thus aren't required under the new Obamacare mandates to offer health insurance to their employees.\n\nWhile small businesses have the option to provide health insurance, the new law only requires businesses with more than 50 employees to offer insurance. That mandate starts in 2015. Those that choose not to provide insurance will face a possible Employer Shared Responsibility fine.\n\nOnly 4% of U.S. businesses are big enough to be affected by Obamacare.

The marketplace is designed to simplify the insurance-buying process and give small business owners a bit more purchasing power. Whether it that plays out that way is a matter of much debate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The vast majority of American businesses are too small to be affected by Obamacare.
