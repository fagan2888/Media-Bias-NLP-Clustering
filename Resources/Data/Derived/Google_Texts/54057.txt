"He was excited about enrolling in the health exchange, but then he showed up for his doctor's appointment last week," says reporter Nancy Amons. "Turns out his doctor in Murfreesboro doesn't accept Blue Cross E Network, either."

One local resident, Shawna Simpson, said her new plan under Blue Cross's Network E doesn't have a single family doctor in her county that accepts her insurance. Another resident, David Pearce, was interviewed last year about Obamacare by the station.

Obamacare Plans Drop Doctors, Hospitals in Tennessee

Tennesseans who purchased health insurance policies under Obamacare are discovering their doctors and health care providers often don't fall in their new networks. WSMV, Nashville's NBC affiliate, has the story (via the Free Beacon): One local resident, Shawna Simpson, said her new plan under Blue Cross's Network E doesn't have a single family doctor in her county that accepts her insurance. Another resident, David Pearce, was interviewed last year about Obamacare by the station. He was excited about enrolling in the health exchange, but then he showed up for his doctor's appointment last week, says reporter Nancy Amons. Turns out his doctor in Murfreesboro doesn't accept Blue Cross E Network, either.
