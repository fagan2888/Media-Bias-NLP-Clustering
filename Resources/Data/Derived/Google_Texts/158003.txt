We've rolled out our 2014 Oregon Voter Guide, offering the chance to study the ballot measures and compare candidates in the Nov. 4 election.

We posed questions to the candidates at all levels: local, state and federal. Have you been following the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Republican Monica Wehby? Here's a chance to learn more about where they -- and the minor-party candidates in the race -- stand on issues such as the Affordable Care Act and other topics.

In the governor's race between Gov. John Kitzhaber and Rep. Dennis Richardson, we asked the candidates whether they support or oppose legal marijuana, driver cards, GMO labeling and other issues that will be decided in statewide measures.

Our guide will also let you build a sample ballot. Enter your address to see the races and measures you'll vote on. You can also go to any race and compare candidates side by side. The guide also outlines statewide ballot measures and local initiatives, explaining what happens with a yes or no vote.

Try the interactive guide and let us know what you think.
