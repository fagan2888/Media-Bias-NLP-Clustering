Pete Sessions of Dallas called that a \u201cblatant misrepresentation.\u201d An aide to Sen. John Cornyn said the attacks are only encouraging his supporters.\n\nThe influential tea party group targeted the House Rules Committee Chairman and deputy Senate GOP leader this week along with a handful of other top Republicans. It accuses both of undermining Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in his crusade to defund the health care law.\n\n\u201cIronically, Sessions\u2019 desperation to retain power may cause him to lose it,\u201d FreedomWorks asserted, noting that tea party activist Katrina Pierson of Garland recently announced she\u2019ll challenge him in the GOP primary next spring.\n\nThe group\u2019s complaint against Cornyn \u2013aired in today\u2019s DMN story exploring tea party views of the senior senator \u2013 is that, like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., he has rejected Cruz\u2019s effort to tie Obamacare funding to the expiring federal budget. Cornyn has argued for months that threatening a government shutdown is bad tactics, while insisting he wants very badly to end Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for delay, defund, repeal, demolish, destroy, whatever the \u2018d\u2019 is, when it comes to Obamacare I\u2019m for it,\u201d Cornyn said earlier this week.\n\nSessions took strong issue with the allegations, too.\n\n\u201cFreedomWorks\u2019 claims are a blatant misrepresentation of the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cI have stood firmly on the side of the people of the 32nd Congressional District who want to see Obamacare thrown in the dustbin. House Republicans have consistently stood united in our efforts to defund, dismantle, repeal, and delay Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOnly last week, Sessions voted to defund Obamacare, the 42d time House Republicans have cast such votes.\n\nMatt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks \u2014 founded by Dick Armey, the former U.S. House Majority Leader from suburban Dallas \u2014 stood by the critique.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of symbolic votes to repeal Obamacare. The only votes that actually matter are the ones where the Democrats have to act,\u201d he said. \u201cTargeting the CR [the stopgap budget] or targeting the debt ceiling may not be the most elegant strategy. It just happens to be the only strategy that brings Harry Reid and Barack Obama to the table. So all of these symbolic votes, particularly in the House, don\u2019t amount to much, unless they\u2019re willing to stand firm when it comes to these types of negotiations.\u201d\n\nA Cornyn aide pointed out that FreedomWorks gives Cornyn a 92 percent rating on its most recent scorecard. In fact, only four senators (including Cruz) have higher ratings in 2013.\n\nThe aide also said Cornyn has received more from small donors ($250 or less) this week than in any other week but one of the campaign, after an email appeal based on pressuring five \u201cred state\u201d Democrats to help defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cFreedomWorks isn\u2019t working,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThey may think they are discouraging our donors and votes, but they are actually encouraging them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wOS9mcmVlZG9td29ya3MtdGFyZ2V0cy1yZXAtcGV0ZS1zZXNzaW9ucy1hbmQtc2VuLWpvaG4tY29ybnluLW92ZXItb2JhbWFjYXJlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
