Karl Rove thinks Kentuckians will vote for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) only if they are terrified into it by fear-mongering about access to affordable health insurance.\n\nJoe Sonka tweeted a heads up to the Oscare coming in the mail soon from Crossroads:\n\nKarl Rove mailer going out in Kentucky (via @jsbuis) #kysen #ACA #unKynected pic.twitter.com/1RJ1EnWLKH \u2014 Joe Sonka (@joesonka) October 19, 2014\n\nSonka referenced a tweet from Republican Jeff Buis \u201cChristian.Husband.Conservative.Old Guard Reagan Republican\u201d, who proudly tweeted a Karl Rove flyer that\u2019s totally going to change the race in Kentucky, because guess what is killing you all? Access to affordable healthcare!\n\nThis it totally not coordinated with Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign, even though Open Secrets reports that Steven Law is the President of Karl Rove\u2019s Super PAC American Crossroads and 501(c)(4) GPS . Law is the \u201cformer general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and chief of staff to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is president of both groups.\u201d\n\nTotes legit. Nothing to see here. It\u2019s just too bad McConnell\u2019s Chief of Staff and President of Crossroads couldn\u2019t think of anything nice to say about McConnell. If anyone would have access to McConnell\u2019s alleged accomplishments, it would be Steven Law. But nope.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s tough to find something good to go on for McConnell, especially when it comes to healthcare. Mitch McConnell has pledged to get rid of Kynect\u2019s services, like Medicaid expansion and access to affordable health insurance plans. He\u2019s just going to keep the site up, for looks. Kynect will be an empty site, and you\u2019ll have to go back to being uninsured. That\u2019s not \u201cthreatening\u201d at all.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how \u201cthreatening\u201d Obamacare is for Kentucky, a state in which 15% of its citizens were uninsured prior to Obamacare:\n\nKentucky has more than 640,000 uninsured citizens, which is about 15 percent of the state\u2019s population. Approximately 308,000 will qualify for Medicaid. The remaining 332,000 can choose among state-approved insurance plans, and can compare monthly premiums and other costs like co-pays. Thanks to new requirements through the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied coverage for any reason, even pre-existing conditions.\n\nGovernor Beshear doesn\u2019t agree with Karl Rove\u2019s dark money, but then, Karl Rove\u2019s dark money has an agenda to protect the too big to fail corporations whose agenda he serves.\n\nBeshear says not only will Medicaid expansion help out but yes, jobs:\n\nThe expansion \u2013 made in accordance with the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 will help hundreds of thousands of Kentucky families, dramatically improve the state\u2019s health, create nearly 17,000 new jobs and have a $15.6 billion positive economic impact on the state between its beginning in Fiscal Year 2014 and full implementation in Fiscal Year 2021\n\nSince it is not 2021 yet, we can\u2019t definitively say yes or no to this claim, though it\u2019s been debunked many times and it\u2019s disingenuous for sure. The CBO report does not actually say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs, and actually the private sector job growth has continued its record streak under Obama \u2013 even after the implementation of Obamacare. The CBO report does suggest that people will choose to work a few less hours because they will be able to afford to work less. This is not exactly a scary proposition.\n\nThe voters will have to go on whether or not they want access to affordable health care insurance and whether they like the fact that Obamacare makes insurance companies pay for certain well care visits and preventive measures, as well as forcing insurance companies to up their game and live by the promises people pay them for. No more selling crap insurance and then ducking out when someone gets sick. Oh, so \u201cthreatening\u201d.\n\nWhat we can say for sure for Kentuckians, per an analysis done by Joe Sonka at Leo Weekly, is that Obamacare premiums for private coverage were slashed by 74% with federal subsidies for the 74% who qualified, and \u201ctens of thousands of Kentuckians who purchased private health care coverage on Kynect, the new state health benefits exchange, are saving more than $200 each month on their insurance premiums through federal tax subsidies made possible by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nMuch terror as families are getting good plans for $65 a month (SHUDDER), \u201cUnder the \u201csilver\u201d plan \u2014 the most popular among Kynect consumers \u2014 the average premium was reduced 79 percent to just over $65 per month.\u201d\n\nOh, saving money is scary. Very \u201cthreatening\u201d.\n\nYes, Kentuckians, that Kynect that you love so much so long as it\u2019s not called Obamacare is indeed what Mitch McConnell\u2019s buddy Karl Rove is trying to scare you with. You are supposed to be scared that you have health insurance.\n\nInstead of being afraid, many Kentuckians who are living life based on the self-interest promoted by Republicans will wonder why Mitch McConnell wants to take away their Kynect. They might not like Obama, but they love their wallets and access to affordable healthcare MORE than they hate the fictional boogeyman sold to them by Republicans. This is just human nature. We put our own lives ahead of petty politics.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Karl Rove knows how to do, it\u2019s score one for the other side (see 2012). Well done, Steven Law and Karl Rove and Mitch McConnell. The lesson on how to waste millions of dollars while failing is almost complete.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaScare is coming to Kentucky thanks to Karl Rove's dark money.
