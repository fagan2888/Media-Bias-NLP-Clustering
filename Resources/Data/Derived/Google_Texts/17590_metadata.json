Under that law, buyers must tell the truth when they are buying guns for someone else. In a separate ruling, the court looked at an Ohio law that bars the making of false statements about candidates in a political campaign. The court unanimously ruled that a legal challenge to the law can go forward.\n\nHere to tell us more, as always, is Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal.\u201d\n\nMarcia, let\u2019s start with the gun case first.\n\nMARCIA COYLE, The National Law Journal: OK.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: This involved the purchase of a gun by a man for his uncle.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right, exactly.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: But what happened?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, Bruce Abramski was a former Virginia police officer, offered to buy the gun for his uncle who lived in Pennsylvania, because he thought he could get a discount on the price, given his law enforcement background. The uncle gave him the money. He wanted to buy a Glock.\n\nAbramski went forward, bought the gun and later transferred it to his uncle in Pennsylvania. But the problem for Abramski is that when he bought the gun, he checked a box on the form that asked if he was the actual buyer. And the form made clear that, if you are buying the gun on behalf of someone else, you are not the actual buyer. You are what is known as a straw purchaser.\n\nHe was later arrested and convicted of making a material false statement under the federal Gun Control Act.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And in this case, we should say, they were both legal\u2026\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Very important, yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: \u2026 gun owners, right?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: They were both \u2014 they were both legally eligible to buy a gun.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Right. All right, so the lower court upheld the conviction, and Justice Kagan today, writing for the majority, agreed.\n\nShe said, \u201cAllowing this argument by the plaintiff to stand would virtually repeal the gun law\u2019s core provision on background checks.\u201d\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Not only background checks, but documentation, record-keeping by gun dealers that is essential for a gun dealer to know who is \u2014 or to know who the buyer is in order to determine whether the sale is legal, and also critical to law enforcement that claim they need this information in order to trace guns that are committed in crimes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Kagan also wrote that only a numskull \u2014 I have to ask you this \u2014 a technical legal term, she\u2019s using, right?\n\n\u201cOnly a numskull would provide a paper trail for violating the law.\u201d\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes. Justice Kagan does write colorfully at times. She\u2019s a match for the main dissenter in this case, Justice Scalia, who wrote for the chief justice and Justices Thomas and Alito.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: He said, you look at criminal laws and interpret them by their ordinary meaning. If he gave his son $10 to buy milk and eggs at a store, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 the store wouldn\u2019t claim that the actual buyer was Justice Scalia; it was his son.\n\nAnd he said Congress never intended to make criminals out of people who were legally entitled to purchase guns.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: So he is just saying this is a misinterpretation of\u2026\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes. He said it may have been a compromise that Congress came to. It was dealing with a controversial area. But he still didn\u2019t believe that the law as written would cover these two men in this particular purchase.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: It is a rare case. I was looking at the reaction to it from various sides. It is a rare case where the gun industry and gun rights advocates are actually on the losing side.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: That\u2019s right.\n\nIn fact, I think something like 26 states came in on the side of Mr. Abramski, supporting him in this. So, it\u2019s \u2014 as you can tell from the 5-4 decision, it wasn\u2019t the easiest case for the justices to resolve.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And it was Justice Kennedy, we often talk about as the swing vote, who went\u2026\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Exactly. The decision divided them ideologically. Justice Kennedy at this point went over to the side of the more liberal justices.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right, case number two is an Ohio law that says you cannot make a false statement about political candidates, a law that probably a lot of people don\u2019t know exists, right?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARCIA COYLE: That\u2019s true. And believe it or not, something like 13 states have similar laws on the books.\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony List is an anti-abortion political action committee. They made it clear in 2010 that they were going it to run ads, some on a billboard, attacking then Congressman Steve Driehaus for his vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act, although they were going to say on their billboards, \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus. He voted for taxpayer-funded abortions.\u201d\n\nHe filed a complaint with the Ohio commission that enforces this law. They found probable cause that the Susan B. Anthony List was violating this law.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: He said he is opposed to abortion himself.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right, exactly.\n\nAnd he later \u2014 they both agreed to put it aside until after the election. He lost the election, withdrew his complaint. But the Susan B. Anthony List had filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the law. And so the issue before the court today was really whether that lawsuit could go forward. The lower court said, hey, this is over. The complaint was withdrawn.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Right. There\u2019s no case anymore, right?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right. Exactly. And the Supreme Court today unanimously disagreed.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nSo the lower court is basically saying there\u2019s no case anymore.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: That\u2019s right. The complaint had been withdrawn. The Susan B. Anthony List brought the appeal to the Supreme Court. And, today, Justice Thomas, writing for the entire court, the unanimous court, said that there is something to go forward here. He found that there is a credible threat of prosecution, that the Susan B. Anthony List planned to do these ads in the future, attacking other candidates, and other organizations also wanted to do similar ads.\n\nThe Ohio commission that enforces the law does continue to handle these complaints, say, 25 to 40 per year. And it\u2019s very possible that the Susan B. Anthony List would be found again to have cause to violate the law.\n\nAnd so right now, it means that the case is going to go back to the lower court and the Susan B. Anthony List gets a chance, an opportunity to prove that the law is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right, and maybe it will come back to the Supreme Court on that basis, right?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: It might very welcome back, yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right, Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal,\u201d thanks, as always.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Jeff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court ruled that if an individual intends to buy a gun for someone else, he or she must say so.
