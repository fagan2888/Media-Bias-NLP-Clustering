× Obamacare enrollment extended again for some in Illinois

If you haven’t enrolled but need to enroll, you may still be able to apply for healthcare coverage through the Illinois marketplace as part of the Affordable Care Act.

The Illinois marketplace is offering a special enrollment period from March 15 to April 30, 2015, according to The Project of the Quad Cities, a local organization dedicated to fighting HIV and AIDS.

“This year, you also may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) for tax season if you or your family did not have health coverage in 2014 and paid a penalty (also known as a shared responsibility payment) when you filed your taxes,” according to GetCoveredIllinois, the state’s health insurance marketplace website. The Project of the Quad Cities says you might qualify if you were unaware of the penalty, or did not understand the penalty and its implications.

The Project of the Quad Cities has Illinois-licensed navigators to proved free in-person enrollment assistance to Illinois residents. For information, call 309-762-5433 or visit them at 2316 5th Avenue in Moline.

Certain life events may also qualify you for enrollment outside of the usual schedule. For more information from the Illinois marketplace, click here.
