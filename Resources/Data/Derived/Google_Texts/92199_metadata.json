She lives with her daughter, Elsa, who cares for her and manages her medical problems.\n\nELSA MALIWAT: My mom sees like four different doctors, like her primary physician, who manages her diabetes, and then a cardiologist, because my mom had two strokes already. She also sees a nephrologist now because she\u2019s been a longtime diabetic, as well as a podiatrist.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: After her husband died, Cornell exhausted her financial resources. Her low income allows her to receive Medicaid. California calls it Medi-Cal. And she gets Medicare too.\n\nShe\u2019s one of more than a million Californians and nine million Americans who qualify for both. It\u2019s an especially vulnerable group, says attorney and longtime consumer advocate Greg Knoll, CEO of the Legal Aid Society in San Diego.\n\nGREGORY KNOLL, Legal Aid Society of San Diego: The population is our oldest. It\u2019s our most infirm, our poorest group of folks. These are folks that are qualified by income for Medicaid. They also, because of their age or disability, are qualified for Medicare.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Health care costs for this group are sky-high, far more than those on Medicare alone. Plus, the two programs, federally run Medicare and state-run Medicaid, operate separately, with different benefits and rules.\n\nEllen Schmeding directs aging and independence services for the county of San Diego.\n\nELLEN SCHMEDING, Aging & Independence Services, San Diego County: If you can imagine a disjointed system where everything that happens on the health side is in one silo, and the social services are in another, the two never to meet and talk, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to address.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: California is one of 18 states trying pilot projects to fix that disconnect, all part of a provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state launched a one-stop plan called Cal MediConnect beginning this spring.\n\nToby Douglas, director for the state Department of Health Care Services, overviews it.\n\nTOBY DOUGLAS, Director, California Department of Health Care Services: What we\u2019re doing under Cal MediConnect is combining all of these different programs under one umbrella, on one coordinated system, where individuals don\u2019t have to do it and navigate multiple systems on their own. They will have one card, one system that coordinates their care.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: San Diego is one of eight California counties taking part in a three-year test of the new program. And here, most participants will be automatically enrolled in one of four managed care plans.\n\nWOMAN: Good morning. My name is Meghan. I\u2019m calling with Molina Healthcare.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: At Molina Health, care coordinators handle both medical and social needs by phone and in person, often in a variety of languages for this diverse community.\n\nThey work with a team of doctors, nurses and social workers. Molina\u2019s medical director in San Diego ,Dr. Nora Faine, says one aim is to keep members out of the hospital and out of nursing homes.\n\nDR. NORA FAINE, Medical Director, Molina Health of San Diego: It is going to help them to have a higher quality of life, because they are now going to know what the services are that are available to them, to be connected to them. Sometimes, there are transportation issues that are very significant, and people can\u2019t get to both their physicians, their primary care physicians, their appointments, their specialists.\n\nAnd so having transportation available to them, so that they\u2019re not missing any of their appointments, making sure that if they have modifications that are needed in their home, grab bars, a ramp to go into their home if they use a walker or wheelchair, all of these services are part of coordinating their care. We\u2019re really trying to make sure that people are able to stay into the community as long as possible.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Another way to stave off costly nursing care is to make it easier for individuals to attend day health care programs.\n\nDR. NORA FAINE: Someone can come and take advantage of the meals. There\u2019s transport available to them. There\u2019s therapy that meets their needs to keep them limber and more functional.\n\nELLEN SCHMEDING: If the care coordinator takes a look with the individual and together they say the day program would be a wonderful opportunity, then that\u2019s something that the health plans can authorize. So, previously, that coordination might never have occurred.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: But integrating the two health systems hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nLIZ LANDRAM, Poway Adult Day Health Care Center: It\u2019s a great idea on paper, but the reality of it is that it\u2019s not quite there yet, in I experience.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Social worker Liz Landram at the Poway Adult Day Health Care Center spends hours each day helping those who are confused and worried about the changes.\n\nLIZ LANDRAM: Many people are getting turned away from their doctors, saying that your insurance has changed, we can no longer see you, and this may be a patient who has seen this doctor for 30 years.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: That was Patricia DelVecchio\u2019s experience. The former nurse waited eight months to line up knee surgery, only to discover her doctor won\u2019t take the new managed care plan.\n\nPATRICIA DELVECCHIO: I thought that I was going to get my surgery. He was getting verification. And I called up and I says, well, what\u2019s happening? Why am I not getting surgery? And they says, oh, we\u2019re sorry. We don\u2019t take HMO. So I\u2019m very disappointed and very frustrated.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The program isn\u2019t mandatory. DelVecchio decided to opt out and keep her doctors who take traditional Medicare. And that\u2019s a decision many other San Diegans are making.\n\nGreg Knoll runs a call center that fields question about the fledgling program.\n\nGREGORY KNOLL: In San Diego, we are told that our opt-out rate is in the 40 percent range. But you couldn\u2019t prove that by me. When our advocates talk to people that are calling who are confused, even though we go through all the virtues of having their care coordinated, we have had virtually 99 percent immediately say, stop talking. I\u2019m ready to opt out.\n\nMost consumers are going to say, I\u2019m going to stay with the devil I know, even if I got problems, than go to the devil I don\u2019t.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Elsa Maliwat, though, is betting the state will succeed with Cal MediConnect, and her mother is now enrolled.\n\nELSA MALIWAT: Even their insurance card \u2014 so, instead of like going to the doctor and showing, here\u2019s her Medicare, here\u2019s her Medi-Cal, here\u2019s the supplement card, so now like she only carries one card for both Medicare and Medi-Cal. So, yes, it\u2019s a lot simpler. That\u2019s what\u2019s I have been going through, yes.\n\nKATHLEEN MCCLEERY: California officials acknowledge the new program is an ambitious one. They are hoping to enroll 450,000 people statewide by the end of 2015.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And you can test your knowledge of this online.
