In many cases, the treatments were never rendered.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nThe blatant rip-off of the federal health care program for seniors in New Orleans would be startling if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that it has become almost commonplace throughout the country. In 2014, federal authorities recovered roughly $5.7 billion in healthcare fraud cases, or $1.9 billion more than recovered the prior year. Of that amount, $2.3 billion was linked to healthcare fraud against the federal government, according to a recent review by the firm of Bass, Berry & Sims PLC in Nashville.\n\n\"This marks the fifth consecutive year in which healthcare-related recoveries exceeded $2 billion \u2013 and that doesn't include state recoveries for Medicaid fraud. We don't expect this enforcement trend to slow down any time soon. In fact, all signs point to increased enforcement in the year to come,\" Brian D. Roark, head of the firm's Healthcare Fraud Task Force, said in a statement.\n\nAs it draws to a close, 2015 is likely to be another banner year for Medicare and other health care fraud, according to the Justice Department. There has been a host of major fraud news this year involving dozens of individuals amounting to millions in abuse, often related to Medicare fraud.\n\nEarlier this year, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced a nationwide sweep led by a \u201cMedicare Fraud Strike Force,\u201d The federal crackdown in 17 regions resulted in charges against 243 doctors, nurses and other health professional for allegedly taking part in Medicare fraud schemes involving $712 million in false billings.\n\nRelated: Medicare Drug Program Still Plagued by Fraud\n\n\u201cThose are extraordinary figures, and they reflect our administration-wide commitment to safeguard precious public resources, to rid our health-care systems of fraud and abuse, and to sustain the integrity of programs that are essential to the public welfare,\u201d Lynch said at a June 18 press conference. \u201cIn the days ahead, we will continue our focus on preventing wrongdoing and prosecuting those whose criminal activity drives up medical costs and jeopardizes a system that our citizens trust with their lives.\u201d\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the strike force had taken 1,387 criminal actions producing 1,977 indictments and involving $1.8 billion of fraudulent activity, according to the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General\u2019s Offices.\n\nThe crimes ranged from the owner and operator of a Detroit-area home health care agency directing a $7 million health care fraud operation to two New York medical clinics conspiring to cheat Medicare out of $55 million to a $3.4 million scam perpetrated by the owner of a Houston durable medical equipment business. Lynch said that there has also been widespread fraud in claims filed under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program.\n\nBut the feds are not only moving on the criminal front to ferret out Medicare fraud and abuse. The cancer-treatment company 21st Century Oncology Holding Inc. has agreed to pay $19.7 million to settle a Justice Department civil complaint charging that its doctors performed a bladder-cancer test on seniors \u201cmore often than medically necessary,\u201d according to a report on Thursday by the Wall Street Journal. However, the company is neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing, according to the report.\n\nRelated: White House Takes Aim at Billions in Medicare and Medicaid Fraud\n\nAs the government\u2019s health care and prescription drug costs rise sharply, the Obama administration and members of Congress have grown increasingly troubled by the epidemic of fraud and improper payments that is draining the government\u2019s health care resources.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget earlier this year announced stepped up efforts to root out fraud by beneficiaries and health care service providers, but that won\u2019t be easy. The Government Accountability Office recently confirmed that Medicare and Medicaid fraud and overpayments continue to spin out of control.\n\nIn fiscal 2014 alone, 22 agencies approved improper Medicare, Medicaid and Earned Income Tax Credit payments that totaled $124.7 billion\u2014an increase of $18.9 billion or 15 percent from the previous year, according to the new report. Those overpayments accounted for over 75 percent of the estimated government-wide overpayments or improper payments.\n\nRelated: The Government\u2019s $125 Billion Slap in the Face to Taxpayers\n\nFederal spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the two major federal programs to provide health care to seniors and the poor, is projected to rise in the coming years, making it critical that the White House and Congress find a way to thwart corrupt practices within the health care system. According to HHS, Medicare spending grew 5.5 percent to $618.7 billion in 2014, or 20 percent of total national health expenditures. Meanwhile, Medicaid spending grew 11 percent to $495.8 billion in 2014, or 16 percent of total national health expenditures.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the latest government blow against rampant Medicare fraud, two doctors and a regist", "title": "Billions in Medicare Fraud Still Rampant Despite Federal Crackdown", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Billions-Medicare-Fraud-Still-Rampant-Despite-Federal-Crackdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Medicare_SSN_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Billions-Medicare-Fraud-Still-Rampant-Despite-Federal-Crackdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Medicare_SSN_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In the latest government blow against rampant Medicare fraud, two doctors and a regist", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3746\"", "article_summary": "There has been a host of major fraud news this year involving dozens of individuals amounting to millions in abuse, often related to Medicare fraud.\nBut the feds are not only moving on the criminal front to ferret out Medicare fraud and abuse.\nAs it draws to a close, 2015 is likely to be another banner year for Medicare and other health care fraud, according to the Justice Department.\nThe Government Accountability Office recently confirmed that Medicare and Medicaid fraud and overpayments continue to spin out of control.\n\"This marks the fifth consecutive year in which healthcare-related recoveries exceeded $2 billion \u2013 and that doesn't include state recoveries for Medicaid fraud."}
