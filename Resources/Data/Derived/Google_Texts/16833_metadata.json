So what\u2019s on the agenda? Well they have until the end of the week to figure out how to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and they have no plan yet, so that\u2019s going to be a whole thing.\n\nThey like operating on deadline. Or should we put it: it\u2019s the only way they can operate. Deadlines \u201cfocus the mind,\u201d as all politicians (and journalists) know. Just when there doesn\u2019t seem like an idea, one suddenly pops up when your back is against the wall. The nation awaits this next eureka moment. (Not really. Most people have no idea that appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security will lapse at the end of the week.)\n\nThe House-passed DHS appropriations bill, eliminating the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 and 2014 deportation deferral programs, has been filibustered by Senate Democrats \u2014 and one Republican, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller \u2014 three times. It hasn\u2019t even come close to getting 60 votes, as even the more conservative Democrats who allege to have problems with the executive actions have held the line with minority leader Harry Reid. Three times up, three times filibustered. That means there\u2019s only one thing Mitch McConnell can do, and that\u2019s\u2026 bring it up for a fourth vote today? That Mitch McConnell, he\u2019s such a genius master of arcane parliamentary tactics, like spending three or four weeks bringing up the same failed bill to fail over and over again. Yes, it gives him the \u201cDemocrats voted to block funding for DHS four times!\u201d talking point, but the man who promised that there would be no shutdowns under his watch is going to need more than that.\n\nThe usual treasonous RINO sellouts in the Senate, like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, are urging the party to take the \u201cescape hatch\u201d afforded them last week by a judge in Texas, who placed an injunction on the implementation of Obama\u2019s most recent deportation executive action. In other words: pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, sans immigration riders, and let the courts to perform the dirty work of dismembering King Obama\u2019s edict. The problem, though, is that where the likes of McCain, Graham, and other less tactically aggressive Republican senators see an \u201cescape hatch,\u201d conservative hard-liners see further proof that they need to use the appropriations process to finish off these programs once and for all.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why this latest suggestion, floated by Senate Republican aides to The Hill, may not be the panacea the GOP\u2019s hoping materializes, but will at least reapportion blame from the Senate back to the House hotheads:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The best option for Mitch McConnell may be to throw John Boehner to the wolves.
