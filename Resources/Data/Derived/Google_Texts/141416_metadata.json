On board is a doctor, a medical assistant who is an Arabic-speaking Iraqi refugee \u2014 and someone who can handle all the paperwork. Also on board the bus is Praves Wagley, an ethnically Nepali, Bhutanese refugee who serves as a translator for many of the people who come for care. Of all the refugee communities in the area, at an estimated 4,000, the Bhutanese are the largest.\n\nTrying to access health care without English language skills can often leave refugees in Pittsburgh lost in translation.\n\nPeople with all kinds of ailments and all kinds of problems stop by the Mobile Unit. On a recent afternoon, there was Meunka Tamang, a 21-year-old Medicaid recipient who had been in the ER earlier in the week with abdominal pain and was supposed to follow up with a primary care provider.\n\nShe came holding a bag full of prescription pills asking someone to translate what the labels said, confused about the time of day to take them and what their effects should be. She had questions about post-treatment symptoms, and she needed a letter from a doctor excusing her from her housekeeping job for the week.\n\nMany of the patients that knocked on the Mobile Unit's door had similar concerns. While some were there for doctor\u2019s appointments, others came clutching letters from hospitals, the state, insurance companies \u2014 or even utility companies \u2014 and they were searching for a translation.\n\nIn some ways, the folks in the unit are breaking new ground. It's been a long time since physicians in Pittsburgh have had to deal with large populations of non-English speaking patients. And the mobile unit and its brick and mortar counterpart in Squirrel Hill are one of the few places in this \"meds and eds\" city where when they access health care, they can be ensured of interpreter services, even though by law they must have interpreters.\n\nPittsburgh was once an immigrant foothold. European and Middle Eastern immigrants and black migrants from the Jim Crow American South built the city into what it is. But when industry began to shutter in the '70s, people started moving away in droves. And for a long time, people didn\u2019t move in.\n\nIt's only been in the last few years that census numbers have ticked upward. Some of that is young people moving to Pittsburgh from other cities, but it's also refugees. Several thousand have been resettled here in the last few years by four resettlement agencies, and others move here after being resettled elsewhere.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s a perfect fit: There is ample employment and affordable housing stock. But in some critical ways, it\u2019s not a good fit at all.\n\n\"Pittsburgh is about 20 years behind the rest of the country when it comes to immigrants,\" said Barbara Murock, the Immigrants and International Initiative Manager for Allegheny County\u2019s Department of Human Services, a relatively new initiative. \"We\u2019re still learning and we\u2019re at a tipping point in terms of having enough immigrants that we need to start developing systems and programs and pathways for people to obtain services that they need.\"\n\nThose services include everything from having interpreters in a slew of languages in the courts and schools and drug and alcohol treatment centers.\n\nHowever, making services available is more than just language. For refugees, a lot of what they don\u2019t understand is cultural.\n\nWhen Jean Elomba was resettled here, he spoke KinyaMulenge and struggled with everything from navigating public transportation to grocery store aisles.\n\n\"Coming here from the Congo is like you pretty much go to a different planet,\" he said.\n\nAnd those were just basic needs. The barriers are magnified when it comes to accessing health care, particularly mental health care.\n\nIn some languages and cultures, there aren\u2019t words that are the equivalent of depression or trauma, bipolar or autism. When mental health is understood, it often comes with a stigma attached.\n\nMarco Gemignani teaches psychology at Duquesne University. As a younger man, he worked in refugee camps in Bosnia. Now, his students work with newly arrived refugees at Catholic Charities in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe said seeking out mental health care may be frowned upon in many cultures.\n\n\"Patients who come from more collective societies, seeking out individual therapy is seen as an act of selfishness because they are taking care of themselves more than they are taking care of their larger family or the community they come from,\" he said.\n\nThose who work in the field say refugees don\u2019t usually come in to clinics searching for mental health care. Instead, they come in with physical symptoms that are indicators of other problems, symptoms like headaches or stomachaches or trouble sleeping.\n\nSuch was the case for Adu Sit, a Burmese refugee who had come into the Squirrel Hill Health Center because he was having trouble sleeping and was referred down the hall to therapist Julanne Bibro-Ruch. Doctors at the center will often see patients and send them to her. They say it's less stigmatizing to send a patient to someone else in the same center than to send them to another clinic altogether.\n\nThe center is one of the few places that offers interpreter services. In a small office, the two faced each other, over a telephone that was set to speaker. On the line was a Burmese translator from Pacific Interpreters, a company on the West Coast. As the patient and therapist spoke in their native language, they watched each other closely and carefully \u2014 looking into each other\u2019s eyes, watching each others hands and body movements.\n\nSit, 38, had been in Pittsburgh for two years and was experiencing some situational depression. He was going through a breakup with his wife. He doesn\u2019t speak English and Bibro-Ruch doesn\u2019t speak Burmese. But they\u2019ve previously met, and Sit said he now trusts her as if she is family.\n\n\"Last time I feel more depressed and really sad, but this time I can open more I can really talk about my family conditions,\" he said about the therapy experience.\n\nThose services are expensive and not always easily accessible. The cost of an interpreter, even on the phone, can be high. The translation services the center uses averages $5,000 a month. They also use in-person interpreters, staff who speak a variety of languages.\n\nAnd while using translators such as Praves Wagley on the mobile unit is helpful, there are also concerns of privacy and information spread in insular communities. There may be thousands of Congolese in a community, but the group that speaks KinyaMulenge is different than the one that speaks Swahili and the one that speaks Lingala and those who speak French. And they are small and interconnected.\n\nBy law, health care providers that receive federal monies such as UPMC have to provide interpreter services, and they do in more than 200 languages. That number is only expected to grow as the number of refugees in the community grows and changes.\n\nThis project results from the Reporting On Health Collaborative, which involves 90.5 WESA, Mundo Hisp\u00e1nico in Atlanta, New America Media in California and New York, Radio Biling\u00fce in Oakland, Univision Los Angeles (KMEX 34); Univision Arizona (KTVW 33), and ReportingonHealth.org.
