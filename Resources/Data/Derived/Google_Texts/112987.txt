The college football match between Michigan State University and Alabama in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl New Year’s Eve at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, caps a year that was dominated by sports and, in many ways, the MSU Spartans.

The winner of the New Year’s Eve game advances to the college football championship game in January against the winner of the Clemson vs Oklahoma semifinal.

The 12-1 Spartans pulled off a couple of stunners to make it to the semifinals.

In October, they shocked Michigan with a 27-23 win on the final play of the game. In November, the Spartans rallied to a 17-14 win over Ohio State on a field goal as time expired.

But 2015 wasn’t all about MSU football. In April, Tom Izzo coached the Spartan basketball team to the Final Four, where they fell to Duke, 81-61.

MSU accomplishments overshadowed the appointment early in the year of Jim Harbaugh, Michigan’s former college quarterback and NFL coach, as the Wolverines’ new head football coach.

Harbaugh wasn’t the only personnel shuffle of the year:

• The Detroit Lions fired team President Tom Lewand and General Manager Martin Mayhew in early November after a 1-7 start to the National Football League schedule.

• In baseball, the Detroit Tigers cut ties with General Manager Dave Dombrowski.

• In hockey, the Detroit Red Wings in June named Jeff Blashill as the replacement for Coach Mike Babcock after Babcock and the Wings were unable to agree to terms of a contract extension.

• More locally, 19-year-old Dylan Larkin, from Waterford Township, also joined the Red Wings roster in October.

Crime

The year saw its share of tragedy.

In August, Michigan State Police Trooper Chad Wolf, 38, a motorcycle trooper, was killed when he was struck and dragged for miles by a Waterford Township driver on Dixie Highway near I-75 in Springfield Township.

In January, 76-year-old Clifford Van Haywald was killed in Waterford after a 38-year-old Walled Lake woman allegedly stole his truck and then ran over him when he tried to chase after her.

In July, Jeffrey Maurer, 53, from Rochester Hills, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the beating deaths of his elderly parents.

In September, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned a Wayne County court ruling that would have resentenced former Oakland County resident Richard (White Boy Rick) Wershe to time served in prison. Wershe, a former teen drug dealer and federal informant, has been in prison for 28 years following his arrest for cocaine possession when he was 17.

Other News

Signs of an improving economy were visible throughout the year.

A look at mass layoff filings with the state in March showed the number of filings had dropped as the economy improved. And in October, median real estate prices across southeast Michigan hit a 10-year high. The downside of the improving economy, however, was that higher property values, and costs, were driving up rental rates.

Some other notable stories in 2015:

• In March, Waterford Township trustees voted to retire police Chief Dan McCaw.

•Last May, voters in Oakland County and across the state rejected tax increases to fix the state’s crumbling roads. Undeterred, state lawmakers passed a road funding package this fall, although road agencies say it could be a couple years before the money trickles down to local roads.

• In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Michigan’s ban of same-sex marriage, but there was no immediate rush to the courthouse by same-sex couples seeking to tie the knot.

• Also in June, the nation’s highest court ruled that tax subsidies to help people pay for health insurance are allowed under Obamacare, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act.

• In October, plans were announced to demolish the Silverdome in Pontiac, the former home of the Detroit Lions, and redevelop the site with a variety of uses.

• In October and November, two major county road projects were completed. In Southfield, Evergreen Road was reopened after a $12 million overhaul. In Auburn Hills, motorists now have its first diamond interchange at I-75 and University Drive.

• In November, Gov. Rick Snyder took some heat when he said Syrian refugees weren’t welcome in Michigan. But agencies who help with relocation said it was business as usual for them.

• Also in November, Keego Harbor voters approved a ballot proposal decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Local law enforcement stressed that marijuana remains illegal under state and federal law.

• Earlier this month, three groups announced they plan to take over Doctors Hospital in Pontiac as it goes through bankruptcy proceedings.
