She was the author of a book that, in some ways, read like the story of my life. I fell in love with my priest and later married him \u2014 the same torrid forbidden love story that fuels McCullough\u2019s classic novel. But in other ways, my story was nothing like that romance. It was more like a nightmare.\n\nI was in the middle of a breakup from an abusive, drug-addicted boyfriend when I first went to Father W \u2014 for counseling. He was the most caring, compassionate man in the world. He was so tender, so concerned, and our intimate nightly telephone talks quickly became the highlight of my day. I was in the process of joining the church through the adult conversion program, and in my weekly class, I saw how beloved he was by the community. How powerful. I prayed daily my thanksgiving for such a wonderful priest.\n\nIn our evening calls, he revealed to me that he cared for me more than I could ever know. After the abuse and horror of my recent relationship, such kindness was irresistible. We went for dinner one night and ended up in the rectory, passionately making out. We continued to speak or see each other often, pushing boundaries further, until the very night I was welcomed into the church at Easter. After giving me my First Communion, he took me into his private rooms in the rectory and we made love.\n\nThen the full-fledged affair began. He came over every night, staying later each time, until he was creeping away at dawn. When I wondered about the future of the relationship, and how guilty I felt, he made me promise to love only him, and to recite the wedding vows with him one night to bind us. He told me afterward that we were both technically excommunicated by that private act \u2013 but that our love was bigger than the church or any rules of mankind. It was something God had given us. It was, as if by McCullough\u2019s own pen, our own \u201cThorn Birds\u201d story.\n\nOf course, we were discovered. The bishop heard rumors, confronted Father W \u2014. He was moved from my parish to another church in another town but continued to drive back to my apartment to stay all night anyway. He eventually took a leave of absence and looked for a job in the private sector. As soon as he found it, he left the priesthood.\n\nThe bishop thundered. My priest\u2019s mother freaked out. The diocese and the brotherhood of priests burned with gossip. My parents remained philosophical \u2014 because even a fallen priest was better than a drug-addled bully. We married almost immediately, with a secret wedding license so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the newspaper. And we went to a different church \u2014 still Catholic, but we sat at the back, hoping not to be recognized.\n\nMy new mother-in-law didn\u2019t make eye contact with me for well over a year. I had ruined her chances at the honor and glory that the mother of a priest enjoys. She was shamed by our selfishness. And she did not hesitate to shake her finger in my face, hissing, \u201cI knew it was a woman!\u201d Priest friends came to visit our little apartment and told us how hard our lives would be. And, not for the first time, they called our love \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d All the drama was bearable because our love was the greatest story ever told.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I thought our story was as epic as the Colleen McCullough romance.
