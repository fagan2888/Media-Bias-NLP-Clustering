Magennis had texted his wife Friday afternoon to say he skied into an out-of-bounds area near Lift 8 and planned to continue skiing east to an area known as Needles.\n\nOfficials said he was cold and exhausted when found but didn\u2019t report any injuries.\n\nThey said it was the second time in the past decade that Magennis had skied out of bounds in the same vicinity.\n\nThe search for Magennis this weekend involved more than two dozen people from six organizations and 350 man hours, said Butch Knowlton, director of the Colorado Office of Emergency Management.\n\nRather than heading east toward Needles, as he told his wife he would do, Magennis was tracked to the south and to the west into Elbert Creek and Big Lick Creek, officials said. Searchers followed his tracks throughout the night as heavy snow fell, spotting two of his rest stops.\n\nAt about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, one of the teams made contact with Magennis about seven miles north of the Hermosa Creek Campground.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Magennis skied out of bounds in the same general area and made it to Needles with another person, officials said.\n\nAndy Vuong : 303-954-1209, avuong@denverpost.com or twitter.com/andyvuong", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Out of bounds skier in Durango found after two-day search", "title": "Out of bounds skier in Durango found after two-day search", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/01/out-of-bounds-skier-in-durango-found-after-two-day-search/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301__IMG_4787p1.jpg", "height": 492}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301__IMG_4787p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T18:43:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:49:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b24\"", "article_summary": "About 10 years ago, Magennis skied out of bounds in the same general area and made it to Needles with another person, officials said.\nMembers of the La Plata County Search and Rescue discovered Alex Magennis, a former Durango resident who lives in Cincinnati, during a snowstorm.\nA 42-year-old man who skied out of bounds Friday at Durango Mountain Resort at Purgatory was found Saturday in a remote part of Hermosa Creek drainage.\nThey said it was the second time in the past decade that Magennis had skied out of bounds in the same vicinity.\nAt about 11:30 a.m. Saturday, one of the teams made contact with Magennis about seven miles north of the Hermosa Creek Campground."}
