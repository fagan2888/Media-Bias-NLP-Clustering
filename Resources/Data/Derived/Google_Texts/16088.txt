Today is Wednesday, March 25, the 84th day of 2015 and the fifth year since Republicans, angry about passage of the Affordable Care Act, swore a blood-oath to repeal the law if they ever got their hands on Congress. They did – the GOP took control of the House in the 2010 midterms and seized the Senate last fall – but, some 50 kill-Obamacare votes so far (and counting), haven’t overturned the law. Part of the problem: it’s been 50 months since Republicans promised a detailed Obamacare alternative. Sen. Ted Cruz, the newest official GOP presidential candidate, unveiled his own alternative plan a week or so ago, but he crushed whatever credibility it might have had when, after losing coverage he’d had under his wife’s plan, he signed up for Obamacare.

Tough Act to Follow: Accepting an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani will deliver a joint address to Congress Wednesday morning. He’s likely to thoughtfully praise the U.S. for its military and financial support, and give props to Obama for leaving a few troops in Afghanistan past 2015. Coming after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bombastic, macho speech two weeks ago – and the head-banging, rock-star reception Republicans showered on him – inviting Ghani to take the mic feels like asking James Taylor to follow AC/DC at a biker rally.

That Was Then: Sen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican and leader of the “Monsters of Hawk” who signed an open letter to Iran, analysts and the White House decried a clear breach of diplomatic protocol. Now, Cotton himself is chiding Obama for harshing on Netanyahu, his BFF, just as he’s setting up a coalition government in Israel: “While Prime Minister Netanyahu won a decisive victory, he still has just started assembling a governing majority coalition.” Pot meets kettle, again.
