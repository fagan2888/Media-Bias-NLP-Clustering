David Brooks: There's "An Imbalance In The Power Relationship Between Capital And Labor"

DAVID BROOKS: Well, we do talk about the job numbers every week.



I do think we pay attention to labor force participation. I sort of do agree somewhat with Mark that there does seem to be an imbalance in the power relationship between capital and labor.



MARK SHIELDS: Thatâ€™s â€” yes.



DAVID BROOKS: And I donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to go back to unions, the way they were understood before. I donâ€™t know what the next form is, employee-owned companies.



But I do think you â€” there probably should be something done to rebalance that relationship. Nonetheless, when I look at the jobs numbers â€” and I think theyâ€™re disappointing. Somebody pointed out, if we were in a normal recovery, we would have six million more jobs than we have now.



And so I look at whatâ€™s causing all the sludge in the economy, whether weâ€™re not innovating enough. And thereâ€™s some evidence of that, some stagnation in that. A lot of people have just dropped out of the labor force. And that long decline â€” Doug Elmendorf, the head of the CBO, was asked.



One of the things that is moderating growth, itâ€™s the aging of the population, shrinking of the labor force. And if you donâ€™t have a lot of people working, paying taxes, making stuff, youâ€™re just going to have a sludgier economy. And so thereâ€™s a whole bunch of reasons. Some have to do with the complexity of the government, which imposes costs, the complexity of the tax code.



It just feels like we have been a middle-age or late-age economy, and we need some rejuvenation of some sort.
