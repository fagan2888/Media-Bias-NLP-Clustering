Floyd Bledsoe is out of prison in Kansas after serving 15 years for a killing his brother admitted to in a suicide note last month. But Bledsoe isn't getting any monetary apology from the state's taxpayers.

Unlike more than half of U.S. states, Kansas has no law setting forth the monetary value of lost time for the wrongly convicted.

That leaves 39-year-old Bledsoe with the options of suing the state or filing a claim with the state Legislature.

Payouts to the exonerated vary considerably from state to state. Some offer automatic, set amounts regardless of how much time was served.

A representative of the Midwest Innocence Project said Bledsoe will consider the options available to him for compensation.
