Fred Deutsch, a Republican from Florence who introduced a bill last week that would ban transgender students from using school facilities opposite from their biological sex.\n\nFederal bureaucrats, without the force of federal law, are threatening to withhold federal funding from schools that do not allow transgender students full, unrestricted access to facilities of the opposite biological sex. I don\u2019t want that to happen in South Dakota. And I especially don\u2019t want our children to be required by the federal government to shower, change or use restrooms with other young people of the opposite biological sex.\n\nThe bill, HB 1008, passed the House last week by a vote of 58 to 10. The measure is expected to be taken up by the Senate this week.\n\nLeft-leaning groups like the Human Rights Campaign said the bill is \u201cnothing more than a vile attack on students who are already vulnerable to high rates of discrimination and harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe South Dakota House of Representatives\u2019 vote in favor of discrimination against transgender students is alarming and appalling,\u201d said JoDee Winterhof, HRC senior vice president for Policy and Political Affairs at the Human Rights Council, in a press release. \u201cFair-minded South Dakotans absolutely must stand up now and demand their lawmakers in the Senate stop this hateful legislation from moving any further.\u201d\n\nThe legislation requires that a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d be made for students asserting their gender is different from their biological sex, and described a reasonable accommodation as \u201cone that does not impose an undue hardship on a school district,\u201d \u201ca single-occupancy restroom,\u201d \u201ca unisex restroom,\u201d or the \u201ccontrolled use of a restroom, locker room or shower room that is designated for use by faculty.\u201d\n\nDeutch views his legislation as a necessary response to what he considers \u201caggressive\u201d actions on behalf of the Obama administration to ensure schools comply with guidance they issued in April 2014.\n\nThat guidance states that Title IX protects transgender students from sex discrimination.\n\nTitle IX is the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program that receives federal funding. Prior to the 2014 issued guidance, it was unclear whether or not the law applied to students using sex-segregated facilities.\n\nIf schools do not comply with Title IX laws, they could be at risk of losing their federal funding.\n\nLast year, a school in Palatine, Ill., experienced that first-hand, when the Department of Education threatened to strip them of millions of dollars in federal funding for refusing to grant a transgender student who was born male but identifies as female full, unrestrained access to the girls locker rooms.\n\n>>> Read More: Why These High School Girls Don\u2019t Want a Transgender Student In Their Locker Room\n\nIn its investigation, the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights ruled that Township High School District 211 had discriminated against the student \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d\n\nHowever, that ruling conflicts with two decisions handed down in Pennsylvania and Virginia, where courts ruled that Title IX does not apply to the issue of transgender students using sex-segregated facilities.\n\nA similar case in Fairfax, Va., could elevate the legal debate. There, a teen who was born female but identifies as male is taking the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, where its decision could have a national impact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Dakota could become the first state in the nation to pass legislation that would ban students from using school bathrooms opposite from their biological sex.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "South Dakota could become the first state in the nation to pass legislation that would ban students from using school bathrooms opposite from their biological sex.", "title": "South Dakota Tries to Stop Transgender Bathroom Policies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cecreative040320_SD_2016.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T11:24:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QaAXkB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "South Dakota could become the first state in the nation to pass legislation that would ban students from using school bathrooms opposite from their biological sex.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cecreative040320_SD_2016.jpg"}, "title": "South Dakota Tries to Stop Transgender Bathroom Policies", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "transgender", "published_time": "2016-02-02T17:50:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T11:24:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bathroom bill, transgender bill, south dakota bathroom bill, lgbt, transgender, religious liberty, fred deutsch, hrc"}, "article_summary": "Prior to the 2014 issued guidance, it was unclear whether or not the law applied to students using sex-segregated facilities.\nThat guidance states that Title IX protects transgender students from sex discrimination.\nFederal bureaucrats, without the force of federal law, are threatening to withhold federal funding from schools that do not allow transgender students full, unrestricted access to facilities of the opposite biological sex.\nAnd I especially don\u2019t want our children to be required by the federal government to shower, change or use restrooms with other young people of the opposite biological sex.\nSouth Dakota could soon become the first state in the nation to pass legislation that would ban students from using public school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers that are opposite from their biological sex."}
