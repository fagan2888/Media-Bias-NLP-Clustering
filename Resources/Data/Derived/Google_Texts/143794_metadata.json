Its like he had a rebirth.\"\n\n\"I heard a question, but I really didn't hear a voice. It said, 'Do you want to live?' And I said, 'Yes,' Jim said.\n\n\"I was not going to eat like I used to eat. I was not going to going to smoke. I'm going to take care of my health,\" he said.\n\nTwo years later, he began running 5K races.\n\nIn 2007, four years after his heart attack, Jim bought a bike, and his love for triathlons grew.\n\nHe said, \"It still surprises me. Believe me it surprises me even.\"\n\nThree years ago he was rescued from the water during the Ironman Florida in Panama City Beach, and he never finished the race.\n\nThis year, he came back to try again.\n\nJim made it to mile 70 on the bike course before he had a leg injury and had to stop.\n\nHis determination and perseverance motivated someone else to cross that finish line. His wife, Deb.\n\n\"Last year I completed in my first triathlon at 60. That was pretty earth shattering for me. It's not all about finishing. It's about the training and about just getting to the starting line. That's the whole thing. If you make it to the starting line you've already won,\" she said.\n\nJim won the American Heart Association Lifestyle Change Award in Michigan twice.\n\nHe is part of an organization called Mended Little Hearts, for children born with heart defects.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Oldfield from Michigan has run in dozens of triathlons after a terrifying moment years ago forced him to reevaluate his life.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Ironman-Triathlete-Returns-After-Heart-Attack--230432341.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/619EF9B918224841B3F917A37AF092E4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Jim Oldfield from Michigan has run in dozens of triathlons after a terrifying moment years ago forced him to reevaluate his life.", "title": "Ironman Triathlete Returns After Heart Attack"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim Oldfield from Michigan has run in dozens of triathlons after a terrifying moment years ago forced him to reevaluate his life.", "title": "Ironman Triathlete Returns After Heart Attack", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Ironman-Triathlete-Returns-After-Heart-Attack--230432341.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/619EF9B918224841B3F917A37AF092E4.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Ironman Triathlete Returns After Heart Attack", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ironman Triathlete Returns After Heart"}, "article_summary": "In 2003, Jim Oldfield suffered a heart attack while smoking a cigarette and had a triple bypass surgery.\nJim won the American Heart Association Lifestyle Change Award in Michigan twice.\nIn 2007, four years after his heart attack, Jim bought a bike, and his love for triathlons grew.\nJim Oldfield from Michigan has run in dozens of triathlons after a terrifying moment years ago forced him to reevaluate his life.\nIt's about the training and about just getting to the starting line."}
