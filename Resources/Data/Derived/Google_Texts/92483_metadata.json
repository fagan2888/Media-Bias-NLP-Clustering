But if they do, there\u2019s no reason not to have confidence in their running backs, or at least in Knowshon Moreno and rookie Montee Ball. San Diego\u2019s run defense was mediocre all season, which gives the Broncos an added boost. Edge: Broncos\n\nWhen the Chargers run\n\nThey were effective last weekend. The Chargers, who ranked 13th in rushing in the regular season with an average of 122.8 yards per game, ran for 196 yards and two touchdowns at Cincinnati. They averaged 4.9 yards per carry. Had they sustained that mark over the regular season, it would have tied Minnesota for second in the NFL. Still, the Chargers didn\u2019t run to control the clock; the Bengals won the time-of-possession battle. Edge: Chargers\n\nWhen the Broncos pass\n\nIt would be shocking if Sunday\u2019s game isn\u2019t a complete air attack by the Broncos, who will have all four of their prime receiving weapons on the field together for the first time since they were briefly united Dec. 8. (It was only for a half. Wes Welker then suffered a concussion.) San Diego\u2019s pass defense isn\u2019t exactly a force, either, so have at it, Peyton Manning. Edge: Broncos\n\nWhen the Chargers pass\n\nPhilip Rivers\u2019 arm was kept in check in San Diego\u2019s playoff opener in weather conditions only slightly worse than what Denver will present Sunday. The same thing held the last time the Chargers and Broncos met in Denver, when despite winning, Rivers threw for only 166 yards and was sacked twice. The Broncos\u2019 pass defense should be better than it was that night too, with the addition of Champ Bailey in the nickel package. Edge: Broncos\n\nSpecial teams\n\nAsk Broncos fans, and they\u2019ll say their special-teams unit resembles something of a dumpster fire. It hasn\u2019t been that bad, though, and the Broncos\u2019 unit still ranks among the best in the NFL, though it\u2019s nowhere near as explosive as it was at the beginning of the season. Comparatively, though, San Diego doesn\u2019t have the weapons the Broncos do on special teams, and as much as the city of Denver might have a collective heart attack when he touches the ball, Trindon Holliday still is a threat.
