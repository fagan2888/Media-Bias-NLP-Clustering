Fresh off his Academy Award, Matthew McConaughey looks as though he’ll be able to enjoy the so-called McConnaissance a while longer; his new collaboration with the “Inception” director, “Interstellar,” is due out in November, and has just seen its first trailer released.

The film seems to depict a post-apocalyptic future in which the world has expended its resources — and must seek a new home in another solar system. There are dazzling visuals of both a burned-out, dusty Earth and an entirely new conception of a spaceship — and cameos by Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain.

With global environmental catastrophe the topic of the hour, “Interstellar,” with its vision of fleeing Earth, looks to be the movie we’ve been waiting for. But it’s early yet! See you in November!
