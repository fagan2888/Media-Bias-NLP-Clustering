(AP) â€” The Transportation Security Administration is apologizing for long security lines on Sunday at Chicago's Midway Airport.

A statement released this week says the agency hopes to prevent similar situations in the future through a review of what caused the unusually long wait times at the end of Thanksgiving weekend.

TSA says problems were caused by inadequate staffing and a closed security checkpoint.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports many passengers had to wait much longer than 20 minutes on the busiest travel day of the year.

Emma Cronin, who was traveling to Massachusetts on Monday morning, says the security line stretched all the way through the airport to the entrance of the CTA Orange Line.

The Chicago Aviation Department says the wait peaked between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. Sunday.
