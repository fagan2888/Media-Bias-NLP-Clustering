Garner said letters are expected to sent sometime between Monday and Thursday, formally notifying the petitioning property owners of the board's property-value determinations.\n\nThose letters also will tell property owners that if they disagree with the Board of Equalization's decisions, they'll still have options for further appeals \u2014 either to the State Board of Assessment Appeals, or to Boulder County District Court, or a binding arbitration procedure. But they'll have to file those further appeals within 30 days after being mailed the Board of Equalization decision.\n\nGarner told county commissioners that of the 2,107 appeal petitions filed with the Board of Equalization, 26 were withdrawn.\n\nIn 323 cases, property owners or their agents waived being heard by the county board officers. They decided instead to bypass the Board of Equalization and to advance directly to the state assessment appeals panel, district court or arbitration.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29049540/boulder-county-ends-consideration-latest-round-property-value", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Letters will be sent in the coming week to the owners of 2,107 properties about the status of their challenges of  the values the Boulder County Assessor's Office assigned to those properties.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29049540:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-01T11:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29049540/boulder-county-ends-consideration-latest-round-property-value", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Letters will be sent in the coming week to the owners of 2,107 properties about the status of their challenges of  the values the Boulder County Assessor's Office assigned to those properties.", "title": "Boulder County reduces property values by $96.4M following homeowner appeals"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Letters will be sent in the coming week to the owners of 2,107 properties about the status of their challenges of  the values the Boulder County Assessor's Office assigned to those properties.", "title": "Boulder County reduces property values by $96.4M following homeowner appeals", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29049540/boulder-county-ends-consideration-latest-round-property-value", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-01T11:00:00-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County reduces property values by $96.4M following homeowner appeals", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarStaff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-11-01T09:38:34-0700", "endDate": "2025-10-30T18:40:57-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-10-30T18:50:23-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "In 323 cases, property owners or their agents waived being heard by the county board officers.\nInformation was not available Friday about exactly how many property owners or their agents got property values at least partly reduced during the Board of Equalization process.\nGarner said letters are expected to sent sometime between Monday and Thursday, formally notifying the petitioning property owners of the board's property-value determinations.\nAdvertisementOn Thursday, county commissioners approved the 2015 Board of Equalization staff's final appeals reports.\nBoulder County commissioners are technically also the Board of Equalization, although hearings on challenges to the county assessor's property-value decisions are conducted by independent officers appointed by the board."}
