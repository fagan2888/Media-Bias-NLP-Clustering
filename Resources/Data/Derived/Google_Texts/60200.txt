Long Beach’s fast-growing managed care provider Molina Healthcare Inc. plans to add to its Medicaid contract holdings, announcing plans Friday to acquire the Medicaid contract businesses of HealthPlus of Michigan Inc. and its subsidiary, HealthPlus Partners Inc. through Molina’s Michigan subsidiary.

Molina Healthcare of Michigan, Inc. expects to gain 90,000 Medicaid patients currently served by HealthPlus Partners and 6,000 children served by HealthPlus of Michigan through that state’s MIChild insurance program.

Molina would not disclose the financial terms of the deal but said it will pay in cash and expects to close the deal during the third quarter, pending regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of closing conditions. The deal also includes certain provider agreements, Molina executives said.

Medicaid has generated significant growth for HealthPlus of Michigan, the company said, and the deal will enable Molina to expand its health plan in Michigan.

The Long Beach provider, which focuses on patients receiving government assistance, reported a 38 percent jump in membership for quarter ending March 31 and a 15 percent hike in premium revenue generated by individual members each month. In December, it also acquired another provider’s large Medicaid contract.

Shares closed the trading day up a fraction of a percent at $69.25. The Michigan deal was announced after markets closed.
