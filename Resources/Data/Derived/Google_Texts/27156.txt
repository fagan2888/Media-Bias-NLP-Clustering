Attorneys in the Las Vegas office of the law firm Wolf Rifkin Shapiro Schulman & Rabkin are betting they can extract some dough from the owner of Outback Steakhouse through a series of class-action suits.

The firm says Bloomin’ Brands, corporate parent of Outback, has policies that force “tens of thousands of minimum-wage employees” to perform certain work-related functions without being paid. Further, the suit alleges the company violates the Fair Labor Standards Act in an array of ways with policies that, among other things, don’t let workers take breaks and don’t “provide the required time and opportunity for nursing mothers to express milk.”
