Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer expressed his disbelief that the Obama administration is “wontedly changing the law” when it comes to Obamacare.

The White House announced on Monday that it plans to delay for another year the Obamacare mandate requiring employers with fewer than 100 workers to provide health insurance to their staff or face a fine.

“Generally speaking, you get past the next election by changing your policies, by announcing new initiatives, but not by wontedly changing the law lawlessly,” Krauthammer said. “This is stuff that you do in a banana republic.”

He went on to say that the Obama administration’s habit of acting unilaterally is so routine that no one even “notices or complains.”

“These are not adjustments or transitions,” he added. “These are political decisions to minimize the impact leading up to an election. And it is changing a law in way that you are not allowed to do.”
