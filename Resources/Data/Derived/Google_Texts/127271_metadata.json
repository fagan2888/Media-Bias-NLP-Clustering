The office, at 2529 West Emory Road, is celebrating 10 years of service to the area.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary, Dr. Kennedy recently treated his staff on a cruise to Nassau, Bahamas. Dr Kennedy\u2019s wife, Sara, is expecting in September, and unfortunately they cannot accompany the staff due to travel restrictions.\n\n\u201cI hire my staff for their personality and trustworthiness and they take very good care of our patients. Some have been with me since we started with one doctor and one employee. They deserved the trip,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor R. Patrick Kennedy hails from Kingsport, TN and came to Knoxville with his late wife, Kelly Ballard, who was from Powell. Dr. Kennedy has a bachelor\u2019s of science degree from UT, Knoxville and a doctorate in Dental Surgery from UT Memphis. Unfortunately, in 2010, his wife had a heart attack at 38 and passed away. Dr. Kennedy had established roots in Knoxville and liked the area so much that he decided to stay.\n\n\u201cI love the area, especially north Knox County, the people are so friendly,\u201d he told The Focus. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed to be in this area.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I had set roots here, I decided to remain. I have a beautiful daughter, Taylor, and a new wife, Sara, who inspire me.\u201d\n\nKennedy Dentistry is known for its excellent customer service and affordable care. Dr. Kennedy is proud of the professional care and upscale equipment.\n\n\u201cWe do everything from veneers to extractions. We team with area specialists for complicated cases and I don\u2019t know of many procedures that we can\u2019t do with their help,\u201d he said. \u201cOur practice spans from simple care to extreme dental makeovers.\u201d\n\nThe office keeps up with the latest technologies that include soft tissue lasers, digital x-rays, laser cavity detectors, intra-oral cameras, and \u201cCerec\u201d same-day crowns.\n\n\u201cWe also offer \u20196 months smiles\u2019 which is an accelerated short-term orthodontic procedure that can straighten teeth in as little as six months,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Trent Stansbury, who has recently joined Kennedy Dentistry, is excited to implement new dental technologies at the practice. Kennedy Dentistry now has 3D scanners that take a 3D image of a tooth and digital x-rays, which use up to 90% less radiation than a traditional film x-ray and help improve patient care as well as patient comfort.\n\n\u201cOur fees are reasonable and we provide the professional service you\u2019d expect in West Knoxville or in a big city,\u201d Dr. Kennedy said.\n\nThe Kennedy staff have many \u201clong-term employees that are like family,\u201d of which, include Teresa Stooksbury. She is a Financial Coordinator and has been with the office since the first day. In order to maintain customer service and see patients in a timely manner, Kennedy Dentistry has also added some new staff members, including new associate, Dr. Stansbury. Dr. Stansbury said he was looking for over two years for a great, professional office to join and luckily found Kennedy Dentistry.\n\n\u201cI love my staff because they don\u2019t just act like they care about patients, they really do care,\u201d said Dr. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy Dentistry is currently open Monday through Fridays 8-5.
