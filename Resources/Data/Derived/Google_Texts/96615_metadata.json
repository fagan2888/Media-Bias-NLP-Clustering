Get Rid of \u2018Stars and Stripes\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s new facility also gets it into the drug manufacturing business, according to a Los Angeles Times report. Once complete, the facility will produce flu vaccines and other drugs meant to counteract bioweapons.\n\nThe Pentagon is building the facility under the authority of former counterterrorism chief John Brennan, who approved it in 2010, saying DOD should \u201cestablish agile and flexible advanced development and manufacturing capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, however, the White House recommended that plans for the facility be shelved. A study commissioned by former President George W. Bush found that \u201ccontract manufacturing is less costly and timelier than constructing and operating a dedicated facility.\u201d\n\nDOD is also moving ahead with the facility despite the fact that HHS has been stockpiling these drugs for years as part of a bioterror preparedness program. The department has long been working with private industry to guarantee that these drugs would be available in the event of an attack.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Defense Andrew C. Weber championed construction of the facility. It\u2019s being paid for with money budgeted to purchase boots, masks and early-warning chemical and biological weapons sensors. James Petro, an aide to Weber, defended the facility to The L.A. Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that our men and women in uniform have the protection that they need against these threats,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DOD has just broke ground on a $200 million facility that the White House said was unnecessary.
