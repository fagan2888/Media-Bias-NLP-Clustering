There are no restrictions based on income or insurance.\n\nMore than 200 people were waiting in line when the clinic opened at 6 a.m. Friday, Russell said.\n\n\u201cWhen I got here this morning \u2013 I got here around 5 \u2013 there was a line about three-quarters of the way around the MAC,\u201d said Cary Jackson, dentist from Broadway Family & Cosmetic Dentistry. \u201cEvery chair that had a dentist was full pretty much the whole morning.\u201d\n\nThe number of patients dropped off by mid-afternoon.\n\nJackson thought the patient numbers were similar to last year.\n\n\u201cI think Saturday is usually busier,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients came from as far away as Wisconsin, according to Brian Mykleby, an endodontist from Davenport volunteering at the event for the fourth year.\n\nPatients came in need of a wide range of dental care, Jackson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had anything and everything. There were people that only needed a cleaning, and then we had people with bone loss around the teeth that just needed to come out,\u201d as well as some patients with infected teeth that had to be pulled.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of people with teeth that have been neglected for a lack of care,\u201d said Mykleby, who performs root canals. \u201cWe can save most teeth, but not all. Our main objective is to get people comfortable, out of pain, and save some teeth. A common misconception is that we create pain, but we actually alleviate a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nPamela Fixmer of Fremont, Nebraska, just came for a cleaning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three years since I\u2019ve been to the dentist, so I thought I needed to come,\u201d she said.\n\nFixmer is still covered under her parents\u2019 insurance but is a full-time nursing student at Midlands University and also works, so it\u2019s hard for her to make it to the dentist during office hours, she said. She didn\u2019t mind the two-hour wait to be seen.\n\n\u201cWaiting is worth it,\u201d she said.\n\nPatients go through a medical triage to make sure they can be treated and a dental triage to determine their most urgent needs, then are sent to the appropriate section of the arena for care \u2013 from hygiene for cleanings to oral surgery for tooth extractions. There are pediatric dentists for children.\n\nIMOM keeps records that can be sent to a patient\u2019s regular dentist on request, Russell said.\n\n\u201cIf they have an issue, they can call us and we can hook them up with a dentist in their area who has agreed to do the work.\u201d\n\nThe phone number is included in a packet of information patients are given as they exit the arena, she said.\n\nPatients should go to the south entrance at the MAC and are advised to allow plenty of time. Some areas may reach capacity well before the 5 p.m. closing time.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "The large-scale dental clinic continues from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. today at the Mid-America Center, 1 Arena Way.
