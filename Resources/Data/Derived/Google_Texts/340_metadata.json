But which parts of the U.S. are more likely to have higher rates of STDs?\n\nAccording to a \u201cHeat Map\u201d based on data from 2010 and 2012 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention studies, it\u2019s the Southeast . The rates in states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama are much higher than in the rest of the country when it comes to chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis \u2014 although AIDS in particular is more prevalent in the Northeast.\n\nChlamydia is one of the most frequently recorded STDs in the U.S.; over one million cases have been reported, with the majority occurring in southeastern states. The CDC also found that one in 15 sexually active girls \u2014 between the young ages of 14 and 19 \u2014 have chlamydia. According to the CDC, up to 20 million new STD infections occur every year \u2014 these include hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV, and chlamydia. Half of these new infections are among young people between the ages of 15 and 24. So the prevalence among young people is quite high in these \u201chotspots.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTIs take a big health and economic toll on men and women in the United States, especially our youth,\u201d CDC epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Lindsey Satterwhite told NBC News.\n\nGonorrhea is most prevalent in the South, followed by the Midwest, Northeast, and West. The state with the highest gonorrhea rate per 100,000 people is Mississippi (209.9 people per 100,000), followed by Louisiana, South Carolina, and Alabama.\n\nAIDS, though it remains high in the southeast as well, is even higher in the Northeast, with Maryland and New York having the highest rates per 100,000 people \u2014 at 22.1 and 20.6, respectively. Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana also have the most obese populations. \u201cThe Bible Belt is trending in an unholy way,\u201d EDU in Review writes. \u201c[T]he STD numbers in the [southeastern] states are high enough to be classified as epidemic.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that lack of contraception use in these states is one of the factors behind the STD rates \u2014 the South is known for its religious tendencies and believing that using condoms is unholy. Proper medical care may be more difficult to reach in rural areas. The South is also filled with colleges \u2014 and sex-driven, impulsive, and careless college students, the young people who make up a pretty solid number of the new infections every year.\n\nWhat makes STDs so tricky is the fact that their symptoms are often subtle or nonexistent, so people \u2014 and especially young people \u2014 may go weeks or months without knowing they have been infected. If diagnosed and treated early, trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis can be cured, but if they are left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences, the CDC says. Undiagnosed and untreated chlamydia or gonorrhea may cause chronic pelvic pain in women, as well as ectopic pregnancy. It may also increase the chances of infertility among women. So before travelling to the South \u2014 or anywhere, really \u2014 keep in mind that condom use is one of the most effective ways to prevent STDs, and be sure that you and your partner are both tested before taking part in sexual activity.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stds, stis, southeastern u.s., sexually-transmitted diseases, hiv/aids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you\u2019re in the Southeast, you may be in one of the STD \"hotspots\" in the U.S., where prevalence of infection is much higher than the rest of the nation.", "title": "These Are The \u2018STD Hotspots\u2019 Of America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/std-hotspots-america-which-states-are-most-affected-chlamydia-gonorrhea-and-aids-270761", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/american-std-hotspots_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019re in the Southeast, you may be in one of the STD \"hotspots\" in the U.S., where prevalence of infection is much higher than the rest of the nation.", "title": "These Are The \u2018STD Hotspots\u2019 Of America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/std-hotspots-america-which-states-are-most-affected-chlamydia-gonorrhea-and-aids-270761", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/american-std-hotspots_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/american-std-hotspots_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-07T16:48:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-07T16:48:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you\u2019re in the Southeast, you may be in one of the STD \"hotspots\" in the U.S., where prevalence of infection is much higher than the rest of the nation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc511\"", "article_summary": "The rates in states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama are much higher than in the rest of the country when it comes to chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis \u2014 although AIDS in particular is more prevalent in the Northeast.\nAccording to the CDC, up to 20 million new STD infections occur every year \u2014 these include hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV, and chlamydia.\nUndiagnosed and untreated chlamydia or gonorrhea may cause chronic pelvic pain in women, as well as ectopic pregnancy.\nIf diagnosed and treated early, trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis can be cured, but if they are left untreated, they can lead to serious health consequences, the CDC says.\nThe CDC also found that one in 15 sexually active girls \u2014 between the young ages of 14 and 19 \u2014 have chlamydia."}
