In the healthcare industry, cloud computing as a technology is offered in four forms computation, storage, memory, and networking. Cloud computing is increasingly being adopted in the healthcare industry owing to the increasing pressure to curtail healthcare costs while maintaining the quality of care provided to patients.\n\nThe global healthcare cloud computing market is segmented on the basis of application, deployment model, service model, pricing model, component, end user, and region. By application, the market is categorized into clinical information systems (CIS) and nonclinical information systems (NCIS). In 2015, CIS is expected to hold the largest share of the market. This segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period (2015 to 2020).\n\nKey factors expected to spur the growth of this market are reforms in various countries benefiting healthcare IT, proliferation of new payment models and the cost-efficiency of cloud technology, and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Moreover, teleCloud and the formation of accountable care organizations (ACOs) are creating growth opportunities for the market. However, the security of patient data on the cloud is a crucial issue likely to restrain the growth of this market.\n\nOn the basis of regions, this market is classified into North America, Europe, Asia, and the Rest of the World (RoW).\n\nCompanies Profiled:\n\nAthenahealth, Inc.\n\nCarecloud Corporation\n\nCarestream Health, Inc.\n\nCleardata Networks, Inc.\n\nDell Inc.\n\nGlobal Net Access (GNAX)\n\nIBM Corporation\n\nIron Mountain, Inc.\n\nMerge Healthcare, Inc.\n\nVMWare, Inc.\n\nReport Structure:\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Research Methodology\n\n3 Executive Summary\n\n4 Premium Insights\n\n5 Market Overview\n\n6 Case Studies\n\n7 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Application\n\n8 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Deployment Model\n\n9 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Component\n\n10 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Pricing Model\n\n11 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Service Model\n\n12 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By End User\n\n13 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Region\n\n14 Competitive Landscape\n\n15 Company Profiles\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rrwtms/healthcare_cloud", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research and Markets has announced the addition of the &quot;Healthcare Cloud Computing Market - Analysis and Global Forecasts to 2020&quot; report to", "og": {"image": {"width": 465, "identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 225}}, "twitter": {"description": "Research and Markets has announced the addition of the &quot;Healthcare Cloud Computing Market - Analysis and Global Forecasts to 2020&quot; report to", "title": "Global Healthcare Cloud Computing Market Worth $9.48 Billion by 2020 - Reforms in Various Countries Benefiting Healthcare IT - Research and Markets", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20160512006195/en/371054/21/ResearchAndMarkets_800px.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-12", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Merge Healthcare, Inc.VMWare, Inc.Report Structure:1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights5 Market Overview6 Case Studies7 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Application8 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Deployment Model9 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Component10 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Pricing Model11 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Service Model12 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By End User13 Healthcare Cloud Computing Market, By Region14 Competitive Landscape15 Company ProfilesFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rrwtms/healthcare_cloud\nDUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Healthcare Cloud Computing Market - Analysis and Global Forecasts to 2020\" report to their offering.\nThe global healthcare cloud computing market is segmented on the basis of application, deployment model, service model, pricing model, component, end user, and region.\nCloud computing helps store, manage, and process data from disparate locations, and delivers hosted services over the internet.\nIn the healthcare industry, cloud computing as a technology is offered in four forms computation, storage, memory, and networking."}
