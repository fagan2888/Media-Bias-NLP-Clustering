Bush, was responsible for \u201cfalsehoods that had greater and deadlier consequences.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama (Charles Dharapak/Associated Press)\n\nCapehart cites, in particular, Bush\u2019s State of the Union address on Jan. 28, 2003, when he declared \u201cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d This, Capehart claims, was a lie that \u201cled the nation into war with Iraq on March 19, 2003.\u201d\n\nThere are a few problems with that:\n\n1. As our mutual boss, Fred Hiatt, has pointed out, Bush did not \u201clie\u201d about Iraq\u2019s WMD. Citing a report by Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), then-chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Hiatt takes on what he calls \u201cthe phony \u2018Bush lied\u2019 story line\u201d:\n\n[D]ive into Rockefeller\u2019s report, in search of where exactly President Bush lied about what his intelligence agencies were telling him about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and you may be surprised by what you find. On Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons program? The president\u2019s statements \u201cwere generally substantiated by intelligence community estimates.\u201d On biological weapons, production capability and those infamous mobile laboratories? The president\u2019s statements \u201cwere substantiated by intelligence information.\u201d On chemical weapons, then? \u201cSubstantiated by intelligence information.\u201d On weapons of mass destruction overall (a separate section of the intelligence committee report)? \u201cGenerally substantiated by intelligence information.\u201d Delivery vehicles such as ballistic missiles? \u201cGenerally substantiated by available intelligence.\u201d Unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to deliver WMDs? \u201cGenerally substantiated by intelligence information.\u201d As you read through the report, you begin to think maybe you\u2019ve mistakenly picked up the minority dissent. But, no, this is the Rockefeller indictment. So, you think, the smoking gun must appear in the section on Bush\u2019s claims about Saddam Hussein\u2019s alleged ties to terrorism. But statements regarding Iraq\u2019s support for terrorist groups other than al-Qaeda \u201cwere substantiated by intelligence information.\u201d Statements that Iraq provided safe haven for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and other terrorists with ties to al-Qaeda \u201cwere substantiated by the intelligence assessments,\u201d and statements regarding Iraq\u2019s contacts with al-Qaeda \u201cwere substantiated by intelligence information.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence Bush was given on WMDs was wrong. But Bush did not \u201clie.\u201d By contrast, as I point out in my column this week, Obama\u2019s own advisers told the Wall Street Journal that they knew Obama\u2019s promise that Americans would be able to keep their health plans \u201cno matter what\u201d was untrue. But he said it anyway. Dozens of times. As recently as this past September. Obama did not misspeak. He lied.\n\n2. Bush\u2019s line about Niger uranium was not central to his case for military action in Iraq. Does Capehart really think if Bush had omitted that one data point from the 2003 State of the Union address, the war in Iraq would have been averted? Of course not. By contrast, Obama\u2019s promise that Americans could keep their health plans \u201cno matter what\u201d was central to his case for Obamacare. Without that pledge, the law might never have been passed.\n\n3. After Bush delivered those 16 words in the 2003 State of the Union address, the White House set up a strict fact-checking operation that scrubbed every subsequent presidential utterance to ensure it was both accurate and defensible. In my five years at the White House, I never once saw an instance where the fact-checkers or policy experts told us that a proposed line in a speech was untrue and that guidance was ignored. By contrast, the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend that when the \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d language was making its way through the staffing process in the Obama White House, \u201csome White House policy advisers objected to the breadth of Mr. Obama\u2019s \u2018keep your plan\u2019 promise. They were overruled by political aides.\u201d\n\nLater, as Obama kept repeating the lie, they considered clarifying that his pledge would not apply to everyone but decided not to do so, because \u201cofficials worried . . . that delving into details such as the small number of people who might lose insurance could be confusing and would clutter the president\u2019s message.\u201d\n\nBush was also wrong when he declared on the deck of the U.S.S. Lincoln that major combat operations were over in Iraq. But he did not lie.\n\nIn other words, on Iraq Bush was mistaken when it came to WMD and the difficulty of the challenge that the insurgency would pose. But when Obama told Americans they could keep their health plans no matter what, he lied.\n\nBig difference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bush was mistaken.
