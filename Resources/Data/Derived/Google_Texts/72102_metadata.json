We end a historic week by talking to the lone Jewish Republican to win a seat in the new Congress, and we round up some of the best concession speech lines. But we start by anticipating the day\u2019s biggest story: President Obama having lunch with congressional leaders even as the post-election truce appears to have already broken down.\n\nMr. Obama has invited congressional leaders to a long lunch at the White House on Friday, but not the relaxing kind of meal that people typically sneak out of the office for.\n\nFresh off their midterm triumph, Republican leaders from the Senate and the House are to join their defeated Democratic counterparts, the president and top White House aides for an hour or so of free-flowing discussion, followed by briefings by Pentagon and other administration officials on a variety of issues in advance of the lame-duck session.\n\nIt promises to be a little tense. Both parties seem to be having trouble getting out of campaign mode and have taken serious swipes at each other since the election three days ago.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner pointedly warned Mr. Obama on Thursday that he would be killing any chance for an immigration overhaul if he acted on his own. Democrats hit Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the prospective majority leader, for persisting in their drive to repeal the new health care law despite promises of trying to work with Democrats.\n\nHouse Democrats used a news release to blister 16 new House Republicans for their records and past comments. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told CNN he didn\u2019t believe a word the president said.\n\nIt felt more like a few days before the election than a few days after.\n\nThe White House luncheon \u2014 and the post-election congressional session \u2014 will be the first test of whether the two parties and leaders, who have spent two years bludgeoning one another, can bridge deep distrust and outright animosity to agree on legislation after a vote that exposed a deep public frustration with Washington.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nJewish Republicans have long been a rarity in Congress. But they grew really rare \u2013 as in, nonexistent \u2014 in August, when Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, retired after a blistering primary defeat, leaving the House and Senate without a single Jewish Republican for the first time in more than a half-century.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s election has saved the Jewish people \u2013 and Washington \u2013 from a Capitol devoid of Republican members of the tribe.\n\nIn a race that drew the attention of Jewish donors alarmed at the paucity of Republican Jews, State Senator Lee M. Zeldin of New York, a 34-year-old father of twin girls and former Army prosecutor who served in Iraq, handily defeated the Democratic incumbent, Timothy H. Bishop. Mr. Zeldin, of Long Island, was one of several Jewish Republicans seeking House seats this year, but the only one who won.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, the congressman-elect pledged to be a strong defender of Israel and said he hoped to become a bridge between Jews of both parties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the experience where I would go into a temple, and I may know the secret handshake, I may have been bar mitzvahed down the street,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there would be people who didn\u2019t care about a single word coming out of my mouth because I was a registered Republican.\u201d\n\nBut while Mr. Zeldin lamented a \u201cpartisan divide at the voting booth\u201d among Jews, there is evidence that is changing. A preliminary analysis released this week by the Pew Center found that Republicans drew 33 percent of the Jewish vote on Tuesday, up from 12 percent in 2006.\n\n\u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg\n\nPresident Obama is holding a morning cabinet meeting before a lunch with congressional leaders at 12:40 p.m. in the Old Family Dining Room at the White House.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting.\n\nRobert A. McDonald, the Veterans Affairs secretary, will discuss his efforts to rehabilitate the agency in a 1 p.m. speech at the National Press Club.\n\nMitt Romney is sharing his thoughts on the midterm elections at the Israeli-American Council conference at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Labor Department releases the October non-farm payrolls report at 8:30 a.m.\n\nConcession speeches can be tricky. They can be magnanimous, bitter, resigned, delusional. Here are five approaches from this year\u2019s Senate candidates that caught our eye:\n\nThank the Dead: In his parting message, Larry Pressler, the idiosyncratic independent in South Dakota, singled out an \u201cemotionally significant\u201d message of support. It was \u201cthe deathbed endorsement of my lifetime friend the late Gerald One Feather of Pine Ridge, which was announced by his widow, Ingrid One Feather, who invited me to speak at his funeral.\u201d\n\nStick to the Script: \u201cI feel lucky to live in this great state and call it home,\u201d Scott P. Brown said after losing to the Democratic incumbent, Senator Jeanne Shaheen. He\u2019s been using this line since moving to New Hampshire last year. Trouble is, he was saying the same things two years ago just across the state line in Massachusetts after losing to Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nPull Out the Rose-Colored Glasses: \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you this is not a bad day for Bruce Braley,\u201d said Representative Bruce Braley, the Iowa Democrat. \u201cA bad day is when you\u2019re 23 years old and you lose your father.\u201d\n\nIgnore the Winner: Not only did Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat in Kentucky, neglect to congratulate Senator Mitch McConnell, she didn\u2019t mention him at all. That was in stark contrast to Mr. McConnell\u2019s victory speech, in which he said Ms. Grimes had \u201ca lot of guts\u201d for taking on the race and had earned his respect.\n\nTalk About Dad: \u201cYou may remember, some of you, that he lost an election and he said, \u2018The voters have spoken, the blankety-blanks,\u2019 \u201d said Senator Mark Udall. Mr. Udall\u2019s father, Morris, was actually a bit more graphic. And he was quoting Dick Tuck, who famously said when he lost a primary race for California State Senate in 1966: \u201cThe people have spoken\u2026 the bastards!\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post reported Bruce Braley as saying \u201cA bad day is when you\u2019re 23 years old and lose your phone.\u201d He said \u201cfather,\u201d not phone.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport and Elena Schneider\n\nJonathan Alter asks, Is President Obama the \u201clamest duck ever?\u201d\n\nThe Republicans will have trouble in 2016 if Speaker John A.
