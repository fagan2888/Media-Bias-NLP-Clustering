The sense of mystery, that dangling unknown, opens your heart and mind to twisted possibilities, even the desire to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you do understand this world. There\u2019s nothing new here.\n\nThat promise of a doubt leaves you suspended between reality and unreality, a space described by saying: \u201cWell, maybe?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the sweet spot of consciousness. In art and literature it\u2019s called suspense. As you chase down solutions, trying to figure out the mystery, your mind embraces new thoughts. You examine the problem from a different perspective, challenge yourself to think outside the proverbial box. As one graffiti artist said:\n\n\u201cThink outside the box, collapse the box,\n\nand take a fucking sharp knife to it.\u201d \u00ad\n\n\u2014 Banksy\n\nAnd slashing it up drives you onward. British neuroscientist Daniel Bor, author of \u201cThe Ravenous Brain,\u201c says that, \u201cHuman brains have an extreme form of consciousness: they\u2019re ravenous for new innovative solutions to problems in the world, ravenous for optimizing our lives, for building pyramids of knowledge.\u201d\n\nPaint-on Electronics: The Twisted Noodle Mystery\n\nDr. Jinsang Kim of the University of Michigan imagined high-performance micro-electronics that he could paint onto whatever he wanted. Working with a full research team and rigid, rodlike polymers, he hit a snag. Dr. Kim needed the polymers to follow the direction of his strokes like paint follows a paintbrush. But his polymers weren\u2019t cooperating.\n\n\u201cI imagined aligning logs on a river \u2014 along the flow direction of [that] river,\u201d said Dr. Kim. But he hit a major problem. \u201cOnce logs are bundled together into a raft they cannot be aligned along the flow direction because a raft does not have a large enough aspect ratio.\u201d\n\nHis team tried giving the polymers a little twist. It was an elegant, logical solution but that only made the polymers behave like sticky, curvy noodles. Instead of painted-on high-performance circuitry, they created a a clumpy mess. But the \u201cfailure\u201d drove the team on.\n\n\u201cResearch is always challenging,\u201d Dr. Kim said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any research effort give perfect results right away. We learn from failures and come up with better ideas \u2026 As usual we had partial success. We analyzed the results and came up with alternative designs. Once we built modified designs we became very curious to know the results from the new ideas. Unceasing curiosity is our driving force to achieve interesting novel material systems.\u201d\n\nDr. Kim\u2019s team came up with three systems that helped the superconducting polymers to align with brush strokes, including one that gave his logs little arms to help them self-assemble along the proper flow lines.\n\n\u201cFrom this imagination and analysis,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe design polymers in such a way that they can attract each other to be self-assembled but not attract each other too much.\u201d\n\nAfter much experimentation, the polymers aligned along the brushstroke and Dr. Kim\u2019s team painted their first transistor this spring. After imagining a goal, then pushing through several design problems, grasping for solutions where none seemed to exist, the team made paint-on electronics a reality and shared their results with scientists all over the world. Their breakthrough could redesign our whole relationship with electronics.\n\nEveryday Extreme Consciousness: The Challenge and a Brown Idea\n\nWe all have the ability to enter the aforementioned sweet spot of consciousness, we just need a mystery or challenge to throw ourselves into suspense. The human brain doesn\u2019t enter that state until faced with a need to solve a problem, to make sense of that one little fact contradicting the others or figure out why that singular object is out of place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For esteemed scientists and high school students alike, the search for answers is a powerful motivator.
