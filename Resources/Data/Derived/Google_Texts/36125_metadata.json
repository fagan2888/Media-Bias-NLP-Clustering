You threatened to leave America if Donald Trump was elected President\u2014and, true to your word, here you are. We\u2019re so happy to have you!\n\nWe\u2019d like to extend an extra-special welcome to the ethnic, religious, and other groups that President Trump has deported from the United States: Muslims, Mexicans, black people, people who look like Muslims, \u201cJews, who are just Muslims with smaller hats,\u201d Prius drivers, \u201cthat one Asian guy,\u201d tweens, \u201cJessica Alba, because maybe she\u2019s a Muslim. Who knows?,\u201d all women, and books.\n\nMake yourselves at home. You\u2019re going to be here a while\u2014traversing that wall that President Trump built between America and Canada seems extremely treacherous. Although I\u2019m no wall expert, just a simple Canuck immigration minister from Toronto, Ontario. Maybe Canadians really are, as President Trump has called us, \u201cmurderers and upstairs Mexicans.\u201d Sorry!\n\nWe have so many amenities to offer. Please enjoy our free health care! Though we\u2019ll admit that President Trump\u2019s sweeping Obamacare revisions do sound awesome\u2014for just ten thousand dollars, you can pay a drone to come shoot your tumor? Amazing! We can\u2019t do that, but we can offer you all the usual vaccines. (President Trump, of course, has outlawed all vaccines, with the exception of \u201chot-beef injections.\u201d)\n\nI promise we won\u2019t bother you. Canadians are very quiet. You might not even know we\u2019re there, unless you shine a bright flashlight on us. And don\u2019t be nervous if you see cops on horses; they\u2019re just for decoration. Not like in America, where President Trump, we hear, has passed a law allowing American police to arrest women for \u201cletting themselves go.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like a good law, does it? Sorry if it does!\n\nIn Canada, we don\u2019t allow murder. I forget, is it legal in Trump\u2019s America, or just smiled upon? Trump\u2019s Secretary of State is a gun with googly eyes, so I think it\u2019s probably legal? Either way, please, no murders here. Unless you really want to. We don\u2019t want to be bad hosts!\n\nFeel free to tease your new Canadian brothers. We can laugh at ourselves! President Trump once called our maple leaf a \u201cgay oak leaf.\u201d He called French \u201cgay English.\u201d He called Canada \u201cgay France, which is saying something, because France itself is very gay.\u201d Also, President Trump once used American tax dollars to send five thousand pizzas to our Parliament Hill. In fact, eight per cent of your American taxes are now allotted for \u201cinternational pranks on huge haters.\u201d What a goof that guy is! Sorry for cursing just now.\n\nOnce you get settled in your new country, I think you\u2019ll find that Canada isn\u2019t the backwoods place you Americans sometimes make it out to be. We have many modern conveniences, like paint, and milk! We\u2019re so friendly, we barely need locks on our doors. The locks are mainly to prevent our neighbors from coming over and doing chores for us in the night. One time I left my door unlocked and a family of Ottawans redecorated my entire dining room in stylish mid-century-modern d\u00e9cor.\n\nI think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s an easy transition, since we mostly speak the same language as you. Our slang is slightly different, though. In Canada, we call losers \u201chosers.\u201d So, translated into Canadian, the new American sixty-nine-dollar bill would feature the motto \u201cNo Fat Chicks or Hosers Allowed.\u201d\n\nWe use the metric system, so there are a few conversions you should memorize, such as one pound equals 0.45 kilograms. Yup, we\u2019re into math here, which President Trump calls \u201cgay reading.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, we have a beautiful national anthem. I\u2019m not saying President Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslims Suck (Mexicans Blow)\u201d isn\u2019t catchy. I\u2019m just saying ours has fewer \u201cf\u201d words and racial slurs in it. No offense to the composer\u2014I\u2019ve been a huge fan of Toby Keith for some time now!
