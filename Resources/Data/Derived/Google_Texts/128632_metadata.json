John Kasich is dusting off the playbook of failed 2012 presidential contender Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor who tried to secure the GOP nomination by badmouthing his own party\u2019s voters. Like Huntsman, Kasich is setting himself up to win the media and lose the primary.\n\nLiberal commentator Ed Kilgore recently argued that, despite a gigantic GOP field with more than a dozen credible candidates, the contenders are all essentially trying to get to the right of one another. \u201cYou\u2019d have to say that the shadow of Huntsman \u201812 is pretty big; nobody wants to go there at all, even if the minority of self-identified GOP moderates\u2014and there are even some who self-identify as liberals\u2014is a tempting target for someone trying to get into the mid-single-digits in polls.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAccording to Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative commentator whose \u201cFour Faces of the Republican Party\u201d is required reading for anyone covering the 2016 contest, roughly 25 percent to 30 percent of GOP primary voters fall into the moderate or liberal category, and they like candidates who are only moderately fiscally conservative and eschew Bible-thumping. New Hampshire, the first primary state, is filled with such voters. It was Huntsman\u2019s main target, and it appears to be Kasich\u2019s as well.\n\nThat\u2019s one similarity. Another is former Huntsman aides John Weaver and Fred Davis, who are now on Team Kasich. Weaver, in particular, is an infamously moderate Republican operative. During one 2011 debate, Politico editor-in-chief John Harris confronted Huntsman about comments from Weaver, who had described the Republican Party as \u201ca bunch of cranks\u201d and Huntsman\u2019s fellow GOP presidential contenders as producing \u201ca buffet of crazy and inane comments.\u201d Weaver is so far from the GOP mainstream that he consulted for a time with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nThat connects to yet another Kasich-Huntsman commonality: Conservative apostasy. Huntsman criticized Republicans for refusing to accept scientific consensus on climate change and being too far to the right on other issues. He tweeted: \"To be clear, I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy.\" Kasich did not actually work for President Barack Obama, unlike former Ambassador to China Huntsman, but he will be painted as a supporter of Obama\u2019s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKasich entered office as perhaps the most conservative person elected governor of Ohio in a half century, but it\u2019s doubtful his supporters or his critics (at least on the right) would argue that he\u2019s governed that way. Kasich\u2019s boldest policy proposals have been to raise and broaden the Ohio sales tax and raise taxes on fracking. After a rocky gubernatorial start in 2011, where his party\u2019s bid to roll back collective-bargaining rights for public employees was soundly rejected by voters, Kasich seemed to take on the persona of former four-term Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes, a Republican who emphasized \u201cjobs and progress,\u201d and whose \u201caversion to public conflict [became] legendary,\u201d according to Ohio Colossus, a recent biography of Rhodes by veteran Ohio political reporters Tom Diemer, Lee Leonard and the late Richard Zimmerman. Though Kasich has adopted much of Rhodes\u2019 governing style, avoiding conflict and controversy has been a challenge for him at times, thanks in part to his off-the-cuff, sometimes rambling style. It can get him in trouble, like when he called a police officer an \u201c idiot\u201d during a 2011 speech.\n\nWhatever Kasich is doing, it\u2019s working back home: He destroyed a lousy 2014 Democratic party opponent by 30 points and his approval ratings are high. Given his popularity, it\u2019s no surprise that early horse race polling shows Kasich doing significantly better than other Republicans in Ohio against Hillary Clinton. Partially due to that strength in a key swing state, there is a case to be made that Kasich is the GOP\u2019s strongest general election candidate.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that such early polling is not predictive and that winning Ohio, historically, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a Republican presidential victory. And Kasich will need to win the primary first, a difficult task that his embrace of Obamacare makes even harder.\n\nIn 2013, Kasich went around the state Legislature and used the state\u2019s Controlling Board\u2014a powerful, Republican-controlled body made up of the state budget director and members of the state House and Senate\u2014to expand Medicaid, an option made available to the state through the Affordable Care Act .\n\nKasich hasn\u2019t just defended this decision: He\u2019s stridently called out his critics, which might be committing the error that Jon Huntsman made in the 2012 cycle: provoking his base instead of playing to it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "John Kasich is the Jon Huntsman of 2016.", "title": "How Not to Win the GOP Nomination", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/2016-john-kasich-119774.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/06/150706_kondik_kasich.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2016,2016 Elections,John Kasich,John Huntsman,2012 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "John Kasich is the Jon Huntsman of 2016.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Like Huntsman, Kasich is setting himself up to win the media and lose the primary.\nJohn Kasich is dusting off the playbook of failed 2012 presidential contender Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor who tried to secure the GOP nomination by badmouthing his own party\u2019s voters.\nAnd Kasich will need to win the primary first, a difficult task that his embrace of Obamacare makes even harder.\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that such early polling is not predictive and that winning Ohio, historically, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a Republican presidential victory.\nAnother is former Huntsman aides John Weaver and Fred Davis, who are now on Team Kasich."}
