Whether someone is donating blood for a friend, family member, or even themselves, many donors still fear the dreaded needle. This common fear is often exasperated by the experience of having a nurse make an IV mistake by missing the vein. A new piece of technology could put an end to missed veins once and for all.\n\nVein visualization technology uses non-invasive infra-red technology to project an image of the donor\u2019s veins onto the skin\u2019s surface. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service is conducting a study on 900 donors, including 300 first-time donors, at the Chatswood and Elizabeth Street Donor Centres in Sydney. Preliminary findings have revealed that the technology is not only safe, but it also reduces anxiety among donors and improves donation comfort.\n\n\"Donor Centre staff have found the technology particularly useful in cases where the vein is not visible to the naked eye,\u201d Dr. Dan Waller, one of the senior investigators on the trial, said in a statement. \u201cWe are keen to retain our young donors, and it is important to test if this technology may help us do that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Red Cross, someone in the United States needs blood every two seconds. While 15.7 million blood donations are collected every year in the U.S., over 41,000 blood donations are needed every day. Quelling the fears of would-be blood donors when it comes to needle insertion is important to increasing the number of annual blood donations.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new, vein, finder, device, allows, nurses, see, exactly, where, they, can, draw, blood", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New vein visualization technology aims to reduce fears among new blood donors by limiting missed vein needle insertions.", "title": "New Vein Finder Could Mean No More Missed Blood Draws [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/new-vein-finder-device-allows-nurses-see-exactly-where-they-can-draw-blood-313426", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/08/vein-visualization-technology.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New vein visualization technology aims to reduce fears among new blood donors by limiting missed vein needle insertions.", "title": "New Vein Finder Could Mean No More Missed Blood Draws [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/new-vein-finder-device-allows-nurses-see-exactly-where-they-can-draw-blood-313426", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/08/vein-visualization-technology.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/vein-visualization-technology.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-12-08T13:37:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T13:37:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New vein visualization technology aims to reduce fears among new blood donors by limiting missed vein needle insertions."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0eb6\"", "article_summary": "While 15.7 million blood donations are collected every year in the U.S., over 41,000 blood donations are needed every day.\nQuelling the fears of would-be blood donors when it comes to needle insertion is important to increasing the number of annual blood donations.\nVein visualization technology uses non-invasive infra-red technology to project an image of the donor\u2019s veins onto the skin\u2019s surface.\nSince there is no artificial substitute for human blood, donating blood is an all too important aspect of our health care system.\nWhether someone is donating blood for a friend, family member, or even themselves, many donors still fear the dreaded needle."}
