He predicted: \u201cIt is very likely that it will be less than perfect.\u201d\n\nFew groups have tracked the Affordable Care Act as closely as the Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank (not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente). Integral to those efforts has been Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the foundation.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly been the case. He continued:\n\n\u201cThere also will undoubtedly be technical glitches in the eligibility and enrollment systems that are being created from scratch on a tight schedule. Some people will see their premiums increase, and anecdotes about those cases will undoubtedly be highlighted in the media. The fact that others will see their costs decrease or will have insurance that offers better benefits and more secure coverage may be overlooked. Although personal out-of-pocket costs for health care should decrease for most people, some may nonetheless perceive their deductibles and co-pays as unaffordable.\u201d\n\nWith the impending Dec. 23 deadline to sign up for Obamacare coverage that begins on Jan. 1, I checked in with Levitt to see if his thoughts had changed. The email interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. As we approach the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline, how do you feel?\n\nA. I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much where I anticipated we\u2019d be with implementation \u2013 two months ago. I always expected, as did many others, that things wouldn\u2019t be perfect at the start. In fact, I wrote about that back in February in JAMA. My expectation was that there would be some glitches in the systems, things wouldn\u2019t necessarily work smoothly for people with more complex family and financial circumstances, there would some mix-ups on the back end transmitting enrollment information to plans (as in the Medicare Part D program at first), and things would be working better in some states than others. That\u2019s essentially where we are now. That\u2019s not ideal, but there is still time to get things back on track. Jan. 1 is important, but March 31 \u2013 the end of open enrollment \u2013 is even more important.\n\nQ. It looks like there\u2019s going to be a last-minute crush of applications (online and on paper). Are they going to be processed on time?\n\nA. Well, my crystal ball is a bit blurry today, so there\u2019s no way to say for sure whether all the last-minute applications will be processed on time. The good news is that data from the states, which have generally been reporting enrollment information faster than the federal marketplace, are showing a December surge. That suggests people have not necessarily been discouraged by the early problems.\n\nI\u2019d say the highest priority is avoiding coverage gaps for people who were buying their own insurance before. That\u2019s folks who had their policies cancelled because they didn\u2019t meet the new requirements of the ACA, as well as some people with serious health conditions in high-risk pools. There are also still a lot of people in the system who have been determined eligible but have not yet picked a plan. I know the federal marketplace has been reaching out to those people, and hopefully they can be converted into actual enrollees.\n\nQ. There have been a number of reports about well-known hospitals not being included in many health plans. Are you concerned that consumers will discover this after it\u2019s too late?\n\nA. There will undoubtedly be people who discover, once they start using their plans, that there are health providers that they might want to see but aren\u2019t in their plan\u2019s network. That would be true even if everyone were perfectly informed, which I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not. People will have unanticipated health needs, so there\u2019s no way they could know in advance all the services they will need. Before I tore my ACL playing basketball, I had no idea who my plan\u2019s orthopedic surgeons were. But I got well acquainted with them once I needed to.\n\nThis is a private marketplace, and it\u2019s the nature of insurance. The old days of open-ended, conventional insurance plans ended well before the ACA passed.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to distinguish between limited networks and inadequate networks. Just because a particular hospital, even a very prominent one, isn\u2019t in a plan\u2019s network doesn\u2019t mean that the plan is necessarily providing inadequate access or low-quality care. We should probably be focusing more on the question of how to determine and ensure the adequacy of networks, and I suspect the current debate will precipitate that.\n\nQ. What\u2019s your best guess in terms of what percentage of enrollees will actually pay their first month\u2019s premium?\n\nA. I think we have only very sketchy information so far about how many of those who have picked a plan have actually paid their premium and become true enrollees. So, it\u2019s hard to even guess at a number. No doubt there will be some drop-off. That\u2019s to be expected in any e-commerce situation where people have to go through multiple steps and don\u2019t provide their payment information at the point they decide to make a purchase. It is important to remember, after all, that this was set up as a market-based system. Also, as I said before, Jan. 1 is significant, but more important is how many people sign up and pay their premiums by the end of March. People who have picked a plan but haven\u2019t paid their premiums won\u2019t turn into pumpkins on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nQ. Do you think that the deadline will be extended?\n\nA. I suspect that if enrollment proceeds relatively smoothly from here on out, the March 31 deadline will not be extended. There are some logistical challenges involved in extending the open enrollment period, since planning for 2015 will then be starting. And, the insurance industry is concerned about the precedent of backing away from defined open enrollment periods. The idea of a limited open enrollment period is to discourage people from waiting to sign up until they know they need services, and it\u2019s a key part of keeping the insurance market stable. That being said, a short extension wouldn\u2019t be hugely problematic, and it could even help if it provides more time to reach out to young and healthy people who may have waited until the last minute to enroll.\n\nQ. Some early reports out of the state exchanges seem to indicate that more older people are signing up than younger people. Are you worried about the composition of the risk pool and what that means a year from now in terms of premiums?\n\nA. Getting the right mix of enrollees \u2013 young and healthy, in addition to the older and sicker folks who we\u2019re pretty sure will sign up because they know they need insurance \u2013 is definitely more important than how many people enroll. But, I think the concerns over this question have been a bit overblown.\n\nTake the issue of the age distribution, for example. First, it\u2019s important not to judge things too quickly. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that early enrollees will be older, and that younger adults will come in later. So, I wouldn\u2019t make too much of the initial numbers, especially given all the early technical problems. Plus, the outreach to young people is really just now beginning in earnest. Second, one needs to remember that premiums still vary significantly by age \u2013 people in their 60s pay three times the premium of people in their 20s. So, the system is mostly self-correcting. The variation in premiums doesn\u2019t quite match the variation in costs by age, which is more like a factor of five-to-one rather than three-to-one. But, it comes close enough that the effect on premiums will be pretty small even if younger adults are less likely to enroll than older people.\n\nHealth status is more important than age, since premiums cannot vary by health. But even here, there are shock absorbers built into the system. The risk corridors, where the federal government cushions the effect if claims end up being higher than expected, help a lot. And, the federal government just proposed lowering the threshold at which reinsurance payments kick in for high-cost patients \u2013 from $60,000 in claims per person to $45,000 \u2013 which will also help.\n\nIn general, fears about a premium \u201cdeath spiral\u201d are way overstated.\n\nQ. What are the first few days of January going to look like? A smooth start or something more chaotic?\n\nA. I expect a mixture of stories at the beginning of January. There will likely be reports of some remaining errors in the back-end transmissions to insurers, with some people thinking they\u2019re enrolled when they\u2019re not. And, as I said, some people will be surprised by which providers are or are not in their plans. Some people may also start to discover that they have enrolled in plans with modest premiums but high deductibles, which may not cover their more routine medical expenses. At the same time, we\u2019ll start hearing many more stories than we have to date about people who have signed up and getting help that wasn\u2019t available before. That will include people with pre-existing conditions who have been locked out of insurance before, or low- and middle-income people who are getting tax credits that make coverage much more affordable. What we\u2019ll start to see in January are the real effects of the law, rather than the more hypothetical ones we\u2019ve been talking about up until now.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
