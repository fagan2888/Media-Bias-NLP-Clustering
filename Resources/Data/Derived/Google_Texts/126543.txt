For a couple of days this week, Toronto misplaced a clinically insane man who had been locked up for beheading his mother. The police found him not far from the facility he escaped from, but sheesh, how do you let a guy like that escape? Well, incidentally, they simply opened the door for him.

Remember that Willie Horton attack ad against Michael Dukakis? "Weekend prison passes: Dukakis on crime." A day pass is reportedly how Thomas Brailsford, 54, escaped from the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto on Monday. Police described him as dangerous and plastered his face all over the local media. On Wednesday they found him "not far" from the mental health center, according to Sun News.

In 2010, Brailsford murdered his 78-year-old mother. A year later, a court decided he was insane and therefore not legally responsible for his actions. Let's hope Brailsford is seriously on thin ice now regarding his day pass privileges.
