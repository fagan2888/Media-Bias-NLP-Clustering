Another 222 current county workers and 1,241 retirees are enrolled in either the county\u2019s EPO plan or PPO plan.\n\nAn EPO plan generally does not cover care outside a network of providers, while a PPO plan will typically cover care both inside and outside the network. Treatment from non-Kaiser doctors under a PPO plan would usually cost patients more.\n\n\u201cIt gives our employees different choices,\u201d said Cheryl Thibault, employee benefits analyst for the county.\n\nThe changes were approved by Sonoma County supervisors Tuesday.\n\nFor the county health plans, the current annual PPO deductible of $8,650 will be reduced to $3,400 for a single individual plan and from $17,600 to $6,600 for family plans. The EPO out-of-pocket maximums will go from $11,850 to $6,600 for the individual plan and from $24,200 to $13,200 for families.\n\nThibault said that before this year, drug prescription copays did not count toward out-of-pocket maximums. But she said under the Affordable Care Act, medication copays are counted toward the maximum as of this year.\n\nMarcia Chadbourne, the county\u2019s risk manager, called the monthly premium reductions in the Kaiser plans a \u201ctrade-off\u201d in which employees will have to evaluate their specific health circumstances and medical needs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person that doesn\u2019t go to the doctor very often, you may choose to go with one of the high-deductible health plans and save on monthly premiums,\u201d Chadbourne said.\n\n\u201cCounty employees are very enthusiastic about having these additional options, and the county has been very pleased with Kaiser\u2019s willingness to extend additional plans,\u201d she said.\n\nThe changes were among several health plan options presented to the county Joint Labor Management Benefits Committee, which recommended the two plans approved by the supervisors earlier this week.\n\nThe county said the \u201cbenefit enhancement\u201d will increase the PPO premium by 0.07 percent and the EPO premium by 0.25 percent. The increase will be paid by the employee or retiree, since the county\u2019s contribution is capped at $500 for medical plan costs.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Martin Espinoza at 521-5213 or martin.espinoza@pressdemocrat.com.
