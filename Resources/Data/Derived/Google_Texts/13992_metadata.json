Now, he wants children fighting as he did as a child to know they can do what he\u2019s doing today.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get everyday opportunities to use a platform like I have to raise awareness and just show people, to show kids that you can live a normal life, having been through what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said.\n\nThe avenue for that message will be a helmet. Fletcher partnered with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in Utah, and the organization helped select two children to design the helmet Fletcher plans to wear as he competes in the second phase of the World Cup season and in the Olympics.\n\nFletcher said he was inspired by a drawing he saw from another child who depicted himself as a knight in shining armor fighting his cancer, depicted as a dragon.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty simple image. He was a stick-figure knight, and the dragon was detailed but not overly detailed,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIt sent a powerful message, and it was so cool.\u201d\n\nHe asked the child patients \u2014 a boy named Rhett and a girl named Charlotte \u2014 to put on paper how they envisioned their own fight against cancer.\n\nThey got help from staff and their parents, and the end result was exactly what Fletcher had in mind.\n\nRhett drew himself as Spider-Man, facing off against cancer in the form of an evil villain. Charlotte drew a fearless lion and a champion, a person standing with a first-place trophy.\n\nThey were painted onto Fletcher\u2019s helmet, along with words that had been central to the children\u2019s fight, such as \u201ccourage,\u201d \u201crelentless\u201d and \u201cfearless.\u201d\n\nThe helmet is actually one of two, so he hopes to be able to donate one to the organization after the season, to either display or auction, and hang on to the other.\n\n\u201cUsually people have sponsors on their helmet, but in the Olympics, you can\u2019t have sponsors there, so people have them designed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first opportunity I\u2019ve had to design my own helmet, and it was something I felt really strong about. It will give me a little motivation on the course.\u201d\n\nTo reach Joel Reichenberger, call 970-871-4253, email jreichenberger@SteamboatToday.com or follow him on Twitter @JReich9", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bryan Fletcher hopes to use his trip to the Olympics to inspire children battling cancer, as in the Games, he will wear a jumping helmet designed by survivors.", "og": {"site_name": "steamboatpilot.com", "description": "Bryan Fletcher hopes to use his trip to the Olympics to inspire children battling cancer, as in the Games, he will wear a jumping helmet designed by survivors.", "title": "Gone to his head: Bryan Fletcher hopes to use helmet to spread message", "url": "http://www2.steamboatpilot.com/news/2014/jan/04/gone-his-head-fletcher-hopes-use-helmet-spread-mes/", "image": "http://worldwest.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/01/04/010514_FletcherA_crop_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bryan Fletcher hopes to use his trip to the Olympics to inspire children battling cancer, as in the Games, he will wear a jumping helmet designed by survivors.", "title": "Gone to his head: Bryan Fletcher hopes to use helmet to spread message", "image": "http://worldwest.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/01/04/010514_FletcherA_crop_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "creator": "@steamboatpilot", "site": "@steamboatpilot", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 days", "slurp": "noydir", "tout": {"article": {"id": 162553}}, "article": {"author": "Joel Reichenberger"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "googlebot": "all"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fe2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the first opportunity I\u2019ve had to design my own helmet, and it was something I felt really strong about.\n\u201cUsually people have sponsors on their helmet, but in the Olympics, you can\u2019t have sponsors there, so people have them designed,\u201d he said.\nFletcher was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was 3 years old and survived a seven-year battle.\nThey got help from staff and their parents, and the end result was exactly what Fletcher had in mind.\nNow, he wants children fighting as he did as a child to know they can do what he\u2019s doing today."}
