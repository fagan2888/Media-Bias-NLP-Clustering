Set pieces rise and fall. Dancers fly. The music pulses non-stop.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to take in, but certainly in keeping with the flavor of Carroll\u2019s wild and loopy story, and the work is, from start to finish, a clever piece of theater.\n\nIn the hands of Colorado Ballet it is also vehicle well-suited to the talents of dancer Sharon Wehner who is celebrating her 20th year with the company. Can she still play little Alice? No doubt, and with grace, charm and some impressive spins on her left toe.\n\nShe kept the story centered at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House Friday night, and it needed her. Choreographer Septime Webre loads the ballet to maximum capacity, mixing traditional steps, points and leaps with the affects of gymnastics, Broadway, jazz and hip hop. It is built from a big bag of tricks and only rarely runs out of steam.\n\nWhen it does, the sets, lighting and costumes (by James Kronzer, Clifton Taylor and Cirque du Soleil vet Liz Vandal) keep the audience amazed. Supporting Webre\u2019s sexy, slithering caterpillars and birds that both prance and peck, are beautiful washes of blues, purples and greens and backdrops of neon flowers and giant, pink flamingos.\n\nThe music drives this crazy train. Matthew Pierce\u2019s score pumps up the energy and the volume (so does amplification, not a routine assist for musicians at the Ellie). Pierce yanks all sorts of noises from an unusual ensemble consisting of just 13 string players and two percussionists. The odd combination has its sonic limits and the composer takes them right to the edge over a two-hour program, but conductor Adam Flatt drove his players with rigor Friday eve.\n\nAs with a lot of Colorado Ballet\u2019s productions, the soloists carried the night, including some fresh faces new to the evolving company. Yosvani Ramos was a shiny, dazzling Dodo Bird (sorry that\u2019s Carroll\u2019s invention) and Melissa Zoebisch moved with magic as the Caterpillar. Local favorite Dana Benton (who alternates the lead role with Wehner through the run) brought star power to her feather-clad Eaglet.\n\nThere were a lot of high points to this production, kid performers who were cute and not at all cloying; impeccably dressed playing cards; cats, rabbits and mice who moved with the nuance of their species. It\u2019s an ambitious choice for Colorado Ballet and not what we\u2019ve come to expect from this company \u2014 there\u2019s no romance, and as category of dance it falls somewhere between a contemporary romp and a story-based pageant. But it\u2019s an enjoyable and rare event in Denver and that makes it a wonder indeed.\n\nColorado Ballet\u2019s \u201cAlice (in Wonderland)\u201d continues through Feb. 28 at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in the Denver Performing Arts Complex. Tickets are $30 to $155 and available at 303-837-8888 ext. 2 or coloradoballet.org.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or @rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Ballet\u2019s \u201cAlice\u201d a colorful, acid trip of a ballet", "title": "Colorado Ballet\u2019s \u201cAlice\u201d a colorful, acid trip of a ballet", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/colorado-ballets-alice-a-colorful-acid-trip-of-a-ballet/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220_011840_alice-ballet-1.jpg", "height": 624}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220_011840_alice-ballet-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T13:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:55:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Colorado Ballet\u2019s \u201cAlice (in Wonderland)\u201d continues through Feb. 28 at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in the Denver Performing Arts Complex.\n\u201cAlice (in Wonderland)\u201d is a big, colorful acid trip of a ballet, a welcome update of Lewis Carroll\u2019s classic tale that aims to meet the action-packed expectations of contemporary audiences.\nIn the hands of Colorado Ballet it is also vehicle well-suited to the talents of dancer Sharon Wehner who is celebrating her 20th year with the company.\nAs with a lot of Colorado Ballet\u2019s productions, the soloists carried the night, including some fresh faces new to the evolving company.\nThe production, which premiered just three years ago at the Washington Ballet, zooms along at a relentless pace."}
