Ever the elitist, he dismisses Trump supporters as \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cless educated than average Republicans.\u201d\n\nRead Also: The 17 in \u201916: Reviewing the Republican presidential candidates\n\nTrump is exploiting a profound weakness among the GOP\u2019s well-schooled: an inability to recognize when one has been conned.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s less educated groundlings, on the other hand, recognize the political battles between Republicans and Democrats are as phony as weekend Civil War re-enactments.\n\nOpposing forces meet on a field of battle, exchange musket and artillery fire, making lots of noise and smoke. But the fake dead eventually rise, brush the dust off their replica uniforms and head for the parking lot and home.\n\nThe Trump surge represents Everyman thumbing his nose at Washington\u2019s bipartisan rulers, a collective raspberry blown in the direction of the phony, costumed warriors.\n\nAnd Donald Trump channels the public\u2019s contempt by serving as a walking, talking insult machine:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she finds \u201cnothing funny about the hate he [Trump] is spewing at immigrants and their families\u201d or \u201cthe insults he\u2019s directed at a genuine war hero, Sen. John McCain. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, \u201cthe people don\u2019t trust you and the people don\u2019t trust the media\u2026 I find that 60 to 70 percent of the political media is really, really dishonest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Jeb Bush. Because Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core, and he\u2019s weak on immigration. Those are two bad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about Obamacare is a lie,\u201d Trump told the Iowa Freedom Summit. \u201cYour deductibles are going through the roof. People that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, they are not going to have those plans anymore. It\u2019s a real disaster. So someone has got to repeal Obamacare and do it fast.\u201d\n\nAsked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt if he would shut down the government if it meant defunding Planned Parenthood over its contemptible fetal harvesting schemes, Trump said, \u201cI would.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s RINO dinosaurs, Common Core, U.S. immigration policy or Obamacare, Trump has a much deserved insult for each and every one of them. What troubles political and media elitists is Trump\u2019s lack of respect.\n\nBut respect, like contempt, must be earned. And in the end, Trump\u2019s rising stature has everything to do with his facility to rob our so-called betters of their delusions of adequacy.\n\nLive Chat: 2016 Presidential Republican Debate on Fox News\n\nThursday\u2019s GOP presidential debate on Fox should be fascinating. My hope is that some media scribbler tallies every delightful Trump insult.\n\nIf nothing else, the event provides Americans another drinking game. Guzzle a frosty mug of liquid gold every time The Donald zings a tired GOP stiff.
