Jerry Brown\u2019s public affairs office and returned to tell us all how absolutely awesome he is and how all Democrats should learn from his lessons and California\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d recovery.\n\nIf the subject sounds familiar, it is. Dickinson\u2019s piece is awfully similar to David Dayen\u2019s New Republic piece back in January. I hit Dayen hard at the time for assuming the Golden State\u2019s recovery based on its own projections of future revenue, not on reality.\n\nSo how did reality turn out? Here\u2019s how Dickinson describes Brown\u2019s management of the state\u2019s economic crisis:\n\nJust two years ago, the idea that California could be a global model for anything was laughable. When Brown took office, the state was staggered by double-digit unemployment, a $26 billion deficit and an accumulated \"wall of debt\" topping $35 billion. California was a punch line for Republican politicos \u2013 a cautionary tale, they said, of the fate that awaits the nation should it embrace Left Coast-style economic, social and environmental liberalism. On the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney joked that \"America is going to become like Greece, or like Spain, or Italy, or like . . . California.\" But in astonishingly short order, America's shrewdest elder statesmen blazed a best-worst way out of California's economic morass. With a stiff cocktail of budget cuts and hard-won new taxes, Brown has not only zeroed out the deficit, he's also begun paying down the debt. \"Jerry Brown's leadership is a rebuttal to the failed policies of Republicans in Washington,\" says Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress. \"California is proving you can have sane tax systems, raise revenues, eliminate structural deficits and have economic growth.\" Fed up with the state's own obstructionist Republicans, California voters have even given Brown a Democratic supermajority in the state legislature. As a result, the Golden State is now reasserting itself as a proving ground for the kind of bold ideas that Republicans have roadblocked in Washington \u2013 including a cap-and-trade carbon market, high-speed rail and education-funding reform.\n\nSome of the highest taxes in the country apparently counts as \u201csane taxes\u201d -- and yes, at one point the story blames Proposition 13 on California\u2019s problems, as required by every progressively-leaning piece on the state\u2019s finances.\n\nWe\u2019ll give Dickinson (and Brown, of course) credit for waiting until there are actual numbers to support the claims of California\u2019s improvement. But note that I\u2019m using the words \u201cimprovement\u201d not \u201crecovery.\u201d When you\u2019re living on the street, a move into a homeless shelter is an improvement. It\u2019s not a recovery.\n\nThe governor\u2019s tactics have brought some short-term fiscal stability to California. As the governor himself has pointed out, the state will need to maintain discipline to pay down that massive debt. Dickinson notes an unexpected boost in state revenue in the spring from capital gains taxes. But it\u2019s a mistake to look at that small set of numbers and declare a trend. The latest numbers from the state controller\u2019s office (pdf) show the state bringing in $270 million dollars less income tax than they projected and budgeted for in July, largely because of folks accelerating their capital gains last year to avoid those tax increases that are supposed to save the state.\n\nDickinson completely glosses over the serious troubles with the rail program, vaguely referring to the court battle but not even bothering to analyze the claims that the program voters approved is not the project Brown and the California High-Speed Rail Authority are putting forward. Presumably Dickinson wrote the piece before the recent judge\u2019s ruling casting doubt on the project\u2019s future, but he spares little more than a glance at the train\u2019s very serious problems.\n\nSimilarly, Dickinson fails to provide any sort of critical analysis when praising Brown for embracing the Affordable Care Act:\n\nCalifornia also made headlines this spring when it unveiled sample rates for individuals in its new insurance exchange, which will serve up to another 5 million residents. Many had predicted sticker shock as premiums adjusted to cover Obamacare's expanded benefits. Instead, the increases were modest and plans affordable. Even before federal subsidies, 25-year-olds can get coverage for $141 a month; 40-year-olds for $219. The system is working, health advocates say, because California used its bargaining power to force insurers to offer uniform products and compete on price. \"We held insurers' feet to the fire,\" bragged Peter Lee, the governor's executive director for California's insurance exchange.\n\nGreat! Wait, how much does it cost now for those insurance plans? Ah, see, there\u2019s the rub. These are, indeed, price increases, as was noted back in May by those who don\u2019t simply accept what they\u2019re told.\n\nThere\u2019s more to criticize in Dickinson\u2019s piece, but I\u2019ll settle for noting one glaring omission \u2013 the same sin committed by the New Republic and many progressives declaring California has recovered: absolutely no mention of California\u2019s pension debts and obligations This money, billions of it, is separate from the \u201cwall of debt\u201d Brown is referring to. Government employee pensions threaten to consume the tax increase supporters all claim is going to be used for schools. The word \u201cpension\u201d is not uttered in Dickinson\u2019s report at all. No comprehensive state fiscal analysis \u2013 not just California, but any state \u2013 should be treated seriously if it doesn\u2019t at least touch on the state\u2019s pension obligations. Doing so might poke a great big hole not only in any claims of California\u2019s recovery, but also in the entire progressive defense of the state, as it involves taking aim at the state\u2019s powerful, entrenched union interests and massive, uncontrolled, unaccountable bureaucracy \u2013 beyond just the police and prison unions.\n\nBack in April, Steven Greenhut explained how big government and more taxes most assuredly have not \u201csaved\u201d California.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "California's recovery is a miracle.
