This was a roomful of potential donors, a roomful of prospective volunteers, a roomful of regular voters, and with just a few weeks before the Sept. 9 gubernatorial primary, Berwick felt the urgency. He knew he needed their support.\n\nThe Democrat from Newton launched into his stump speech, highlighting the ways he says he is unique in the 2014 race for governor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate for governor committed to single payer health care, Medicare for all,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate opposing casinos and for the casino repeal. My focus on poverty, if you haven\u2019t heard it yet, it is very strong. I think this is a commonwealth that can end hunger. Chronic homelessness \u2014 zero.\u201d\n\nBerwick\u2019s positions are built on a foundation of what he calls progressive values: a commitment to social justice, equality and compassion. You\u2019ll hear these words in every Berwick speech. They are rooted, he said, in his childhood.\n\n\u2018We Need Not Be Embarrassed To Say We Help\u2019\n\nBerwick grew up in rural Moodus, Connecticut, the oldest son of the local doctor and a civic-minded mother.\n\n\u201cIt was a very small town, everyone was in it together. You literally knew everybody,\u201d Berwick said in an interview. \u201cSo the sense in the town of being connected to each other and responsible for each other was extremely deeply woven into my experience as a kid.\u201d\n\nBerwick left Moodus for Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he attended Harvard University as an undergraduate and then as a medical student. Berwick and his wife Ann, who chairs the state\u2019s Department of Public Utilities, raised four children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very close family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spend as much time together as we possibly can,\u201d much of it outdoors, he added.\n\nWeekends were often spent hiking in New Hampshire and eventually in parks all over the world. Berwick made it a point to travel with each of his children.\n\nHe remembers his first time on an airplane, when he looked down at mile after mile of homes, highways and farms, and realized how many people he did not know. But he still felt a small-town connection to all those unseen faces.\n\nIt\u2019s a connection that is central to his run for governor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become na\u00efve or unpopular to talk about a compassionate government, but that\u2019s what I want,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cWe need not be embarrassed to say, you know, we help. That\u2019s what we do, as a nation, as a state, and we use government to do that.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sir\u2019 Berwick Hits D.C. Backlash\n\nBerwick trained as a pediatrician and took care of children for about 20 years before shifting to the executive side of medicine. In 1991, he founded a nonprofit, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), in Cambridge. Now with more than 140 employees, IHI has a presence in every state in the U.S. and more than a dozen countries. Berwick and his organization gained a reputation for tackling complex problems through the 100,000 lives campaign, which documented reductions in medical errors that were killing patients.\n\nHe\u2019s widely respected, if not revered, by many health leaders for the results he\u2019s achieved, but also for his leadership style. Former employees say he urges them to take chances and calls failure as an opportunity to learn. He does not want to hear, \u201cthat problem\u2019s too big,\u201d or \u201cthat can\u2019t be done,\u201d said Joe McCannon, who\u2019s worked with Berwick since 2001.\n\n\u201cDon absolutely will not settle for that,\u201d McCannon added. \u201cHe\u2019s just relentless in his optimism and his belief that change is possible. And that\u2019s totally infectious.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Queen Elizabeth II knighted Berwick for his work to improve the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service. In 2010, President Obama tapped Berwick to run the agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. He was in charge of an $820 billion budget and some key aspects of Obamacare. Berwick\u2019s supporters cheered, but the backlash hit hard and fast.\n\nOn his Fox News show in 2010, host Glenn Beck called Berwick \u201cthe second most dangerous man in America\u201d because, Beck said: \u201cNot only does he want to blow up the best health care system in the world \u2014 not perfect, but the best in the world \u2014 his idea of a fix is to make our system just like Great Britain\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nBeck and many Republicans were particularly concerned about Berwick\u2019s support for \u201credistributing health care.\u201d Berwick believes if the U.S. succeeds in making health care a legal right, the change will be redistributional, because poor Americans will then have access to something that more prosperous Americans already enjoy.\n\nBut opposition to Berwick grew, with 42 Republican senators eventually telling Obama they would not vote to confirm him. Berwick\u2019s recess appointment lasted only 17 months.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Mother Teresa could have been confirmed in that environment,\u201d said Tom Scully, a Republican who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George W. Bush.\n\nBerwick was held in high regard inside the federal health agency, but became the target of conservatives\u2019 frustration about Obamacare, Scully said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of an academic,\u201d Scully added. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was particularly astute at the politics, but he was thrown out as the nominee in the most intensely partisan, heated time in health care in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nBerwick said he\u2019s proud of the drug and prevention benefits for elders that took effect during his tenure and a program to reduce hospital readmissions. Some colleagues thought the experience would sour his interest in politics, but instead it inspired his run for governor.\n\nTaking His Message On The Campaign Trail\n\nStanding in socks, his head covered with a scarf, Berwick addressed about 200 men in turbans and women wearing delicate embroidered head shawls at the New England Sikh Study Circle in Milford. It was his second stop on a Sunday packed with appearances.\n\n\u201cI think Massachusetts can be a beacon \u2026 an example of the direction the country ought to go,\u201d said Berwick, drawing a contrast between the blue Bay State and Capitol Hill.\n\nHis stump speech was well received there.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have spoken better to Sikhs than you did if you had been coached,\u201d said study circle member Sarbpreet Singh. \u201cIt was wonderful to hear the words social justice, equality \u2014 those are absolutely fundamental to the Sikh faith.\u201d\n\nBerwick asked Singh to send him some literature, so that he can learn more about the faith.\n\nAt the August Moon Festival in Quincy, the reception was more muted. Berwick weaved through the crowd, as he passed out flyers and pointed to his picture on them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Don Berwick, that\u2019s me,\u201d he said repeatedly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m running for governor in Massachusetts. So please, I\u2019d love your help, thank you very much.\u201d\n\nBerwick received a lot of friendly but blank stares, even when politics and health care overlapped. At a booth run by the Joslin Diabetes Center, Berwick paused to ask three women about their work and the rate of diabetes among Asian-Americans.\n\nThe women hadn\u2019t heard of Berwick, but Chihiro Hernandez said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to have someone in the race who understands the issues.\u201d\n\nBack in the West Roxbury living room, later that day, some supporters challenged Berwick.\n\nA woman who said she plans to vote for Berwick was worried that she won\u2019t be able to persuade others to do the same. How, she asked, does Berwick plan to pay for all the things he\u2019d just mentioned: prison reform, pre-kindergarten classes across the state and more funding for state colleges and universities?\n\nFirst, Berwick said, he\u2019d cut money that is being wasted now. For example, he said it costs a lot more to keep drug offenders in prison than it would to fund the services they need to beat the addiction.\n\nSecond, Berwick said the state would save billions by moving to single payer health care.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m successful,\u201d he said, \u201cthe insurance companies will come out of the woodwork fighting this, because this threatens the insurance company business.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d get rid of the insurance companies?\u201d came a woman\u2019s question.\n\nBerwick nodded.\n\nBut they\u2019re huge employers, the woman added. What do you do about people who are displaced?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a transition problem that\u2019s serious, I totally agree with you,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cThis has to be a transition plan, not a violent plan. But we\u2019re talking about the biggest job creating strategy we could have in the commonwealth \u2026 because of what it does to businesses.\u201d\n\nBerwick pointed to Vermont where a study projects substantial savings as that state moves to single payer health care. As with Medicare, Berwick said people would keep their doctors; the change would be in how physicians are paid.\n\nGetting back to revenue, Berwick said he\u2019d end most tax loopholes. And he\u2019d raise taxes, but only on higher income earners.\n\n\u201cI cannot see burdening, a $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 wage earner, who\u2019s having trouble making ends meet for her family, with higher taxes,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cBut I certainly can see going to people who are at the higher end of the wealth spectrum, they owe more. And I\u2019m going to have that battle. If I\u2019m governor, we\u2019re going to go for fair taxation.\u201d\n\nAs the admittedly select West Roxbury event ended, I couldn\u2019t find anyone who doesn\u2019t support Berwick. But even if he can build on this momentum, he has very little time left.\n\nBerwick does not appear daunted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the strongest message, we\u2019ve got a very strong field operation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in very good shape for this last intense couple of weeks before the election.\u201d\n\nThe primary is on Berwick\u2019s 68th birthday. At a time when some people are slowing down, Berwick said he expects another 30 years of vigorous, vital work, which he hopes will include the corner office on Beacon Hill.\n\nCorrection: Due to a typo, an earlier version of this story said the CMS budget Berwick oversaw was $820 million. It was $820 billion.\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic gubernatorial candidate's positions are built on a foundation of what he calls progressive values.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "The Democratic gubernatorial candidate's positions are built on a foundation of what he calls progressive values.", "title": "Health Leader Berwick, Now A Candidate, Seeks \u2018Compassionate Government\u2019", "url": "http://www.wbur.org/2014/08/29/berwick-profile-governor-race", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2014/08/0109_donald-berwick-620x412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wbur.org/2014/08/29/berwick-profile-governor-race", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2014/08/0109_donald-berwick-620x412.jpg", "site": "@wbur", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Leader Berwick, Now A Candidate, Seeks 'Compassionate Government'"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-29", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee6c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate for governor committed to single payer health care, Medicare for all,\u201d Berwick said.\nSo please, I\u2019d love your help, thank you very much.\u201dBerwick received a lot of friendly but blank stares, even when politics and health care overlapped.\nSecond, Berwick said the state would save billions by moving to single payer health care.\nBerwick does not appear daunted.\n\u201cI\u2019m Don Berwick, that\u2019s me,\u201d he said repeatedly."}
