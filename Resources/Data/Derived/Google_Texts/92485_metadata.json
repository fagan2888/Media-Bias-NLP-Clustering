In April 2015, unemployment remained at \u201c4.2 percent, the lowest since July 2007. In fact, if not for Texas' record job growth, the nation as a whole would have experienced a net job loss since 2007.\u201d\n\nAs Texas Attorney General, and now, as governor, Abbott has built a national reputation for aggressive push back against federal over-regulation, \u201cwhether it's Obamacare, Dodd-Frank or the EPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusinesses only expand where the workforce is ready,\u201d the Governor added. \u201cWith the third youngest median age in the country, Gallup shows that employees here are among the most engaged in the nation. Attracted by a relatively low cost of living, no state personal income tax and job growth across all wage quartiles, Americans are relocating to Texas more than to any other state.\u201d\n\nAbbot says he will not be complacent as Governor. Some of his major programs and strategies include:\n\nCutting the burdensome business franchise tax and property taxes by nearly $4 billion. This will release businesses and homeowners to invest more in new jobs, higher wages and stimulating the Texas economy.\n\nReining in regulatory regimes that create a patchwork of compliance complexities. Texas is investing in infrastructure, adding nearly $4 billion more per year for roads without raising tolls, fees, taxes or debt.\n\nTexas continues to lead the country in exports, and will continue to focus on attracting more foreign direct investments to make Texas a hub for global commerce.\n\n\u201cBecause technologies not yet invented will drive continuing innovation, we are committing $450 million to elevate our university research programs and to attract even more nationally recognized researchers and Nobel Laureates to our higher-education institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are making college more affordable and ensuring the path to career and technical training is cleared of obstacles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile already experiencing the second-highest high school graduation rate in the nation and the highest for black and Hispanic students, we are aiming to be the No. 1 education system in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom is the intangible but very real promise of Texas that encourages businesses to grow in the Lone Star State,\u201d Abbott observed. \u201cIt's no surprise Texas is again ranked the best state for business\u2014for the 11th year in a row\u2014according to Chief Executive's survey of the nation's top CEOs.\u201d\n\nTexas leads the nation again with \u201cthe most new or expanded corporate facility projects of $1 million or more. Showing the geographic breadth of these job-creating capital investments, Odessa, Houston and Dallas were also named among the top metros for business facilities growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, half of Forbes' top 10 cities for future job growth are in Texas, including Austin, McAllen, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cBy unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators\u2014and securing the freedom to aspire\u2014Texas will long remain the best state for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen businesses succeed, Texans succeed,\u201d Abbott stated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Greg Abbott hushed liberal critics who say that the reason Texas is number one in the nation for economic success is because of their energy leadership", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/why-texas-continues-to-be-the-best-state-the-nation-for-economic-development", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ad/3b/ad3b13d8531fcf8b89bff5920da3ee76.jpg?itok=Y1hQb8f_", "type": "article", "title": "Why Texas continues to be the best state in the nation for economic development"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor Greg Abbott hushed liberal critics who say that the reason Texas is number one in the nation for economic success is because of their energy leadership.", "creator": "@Texasjackson", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ad/3b/ad3b13d8531fcf8b89bff5920da3ee76.jpg?itok=Y1hQb8f_", "title": "Why Texas continues to be the best state in the nation for economic development", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-06-24T21:29:09-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, Texas economy, Greg Abbott, Republican, Democrat, Politics", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-24T21:29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf58f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBy unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators\u2014and securing the freedom to aspire\u2014Texas will long remain the best state for business.\u201d\u201cWhen businesses succeed, Texans succeed,\u201d Abbott stated.\n1 education system in America.\u201d\u201cFreedom is the intangible but very real promise of Texas that encourages businesses to grow in the Lone Star State,\u201d Abbott observed.\nGovernor Greg Abbott hushed liberal critics who say that the reason Texas is number one in the nation for economic success is because of their energy leadership.\n\u201cBusinesses succeed in Texas because we've built a framework that allows free enterprise to flourish,\u201d Abbott wrote in an open letter to all Americans Wednesday.\n\u201cOver the past year, Texas added jobs in all 11 major industries.\u201dAbbott revealed that the unemployment rate in the Lone Star State has been below the United States rate for 100 consecutive months."}
