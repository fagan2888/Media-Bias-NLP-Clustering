But the Institute for Justice and other civil liberties advocates say the IRS has used the rule to target the bank accounts of law-abiding citizens with no other evidence of a crime.\n\n\u201cThe IRS\u2019s forfeiture activity exposes the rotten core of federal civil forfeiture law,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Scott Bullock said in a statement. \u201cAllowing law enforcement to take property from people without convicting them of a crime and then profit from the seizure will inevitably lead to abuse.\u201d\n\nIn October, the New York Times highlighted the case of Carol Hinders, an Iowa woman runs a small, cash-only Mexican restaurant.\n\nTwo IRS agents showed up at Hinder\u2019s door last year and informed her that the agency was seizing $33,000 from her bank account for structuring violations, a law she wasn\u2019t even aware of. She was never accused of a crime.\n\nFacing backlash after the front-page New York Times story, federal prosecutors quietly dropped their case against Hinders in December.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Justice, at least a third of the IRS\u2019 asset forfeiture cases between 2005 and 2012 were, like Hinders\u2019, based solely a series of cash transactions under $10,000, with no other criminal activity alleged.\n\nFour out of five of those cases were civil, not criminal, meaning the IRS had to meet a lower standard of evidence to secure a seizure.\n\nEven then, nearly half of the money seized was not ultimately forfeited. But it took a year of legal wrangling on average for owners to win their money back. Taken altogether, property owners face a system heavily weighted against them at every step.\n\nThe IRS did not immediately return a request for comment. However, in a statement to the Washington Post, the agency said it will no longer indiscriminately target bank accounts.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that small businesses and other taxpayers often make deposits under $10,000 without any intent to avoid the reporting requirements,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAfter conducting a review of structuring cases, the IRS concluded that it will focus its limited resources on cases where evidence indicates that the structured funds are derived from illegal sources.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department and IRS have both announced they would curb their asset forfeiture practices following a year of critical news reports on cases that swept up regular citizens.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder announced earlier in January that the Department of Justice would curb its equitable sharing program that funnels proceeds from forfeitures to state and local police departments across the country.\n\nMeanwhile in Congress, Sen. Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) and Rep. Tim Walberg (R., Mich.) reintroduced the FAIR Act in the Senate and House. The bill would strengthen protections for property seized under asset forfeiture programs.\n\nThe issue also cropped up last week in a congressional hearing for Loretta Lynch, President Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general. Lynch, a federal prosecutor, testified that asset forfeiture was a \u201cwonderful tool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "IRS practiced a \u2018seize first, ask questions later\u2019 strategy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service seized hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of bank accounts over the past decade, often without proof of any criminal wrongdoing, according to a report released", "title": "Report: IRS Seized Thousands of Bank Accounts Without Filing Criminal Charges", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/report-irs-seized-thousands-of-bank-accounts-without-filing-criminal-charges/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rand-Paul-introduces-the-FAIR-Act-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Internal Revenue Service seized hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of bank accounts", "creator": "@cjciaramella", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rand-Paul-introduces-the-FAIR-Act-150x150.jpg", "title": "Report: IRS Seized Thousands of Bank Accounts Without Filing Criminal Charges", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe IRS\u2019s forfeiture activity exposes the rotten core of federal civil forfeiture law,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Scott Bullock said in a statement.\nAll of those seizures were for \u201cstructuring\u201d violations, an obscure rule intended to keep money launderers, terrorists, and other criminals from making small deposits to evade federal bank reporting laws.\nHowever, in a statement to the Washington Post, the agency said it will no longer indiscriminately target bank accounts.\nBut the Institute for Justice and other civil liberties advocates say the IRS has used the rule to target the bank accounts of law-abiding citizens with no other evidence of a crime.\nBY: Follow @cjciaramellaThe Internal Revenue Service seized hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of bank accounts over the past decade, often without proof of any criminal wrongdoing, according to a report released by the Institute for Justice this week."}
