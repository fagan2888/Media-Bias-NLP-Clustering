Marlin Stutzman makes a \"major announcement\" on May 9, 2015.\n\nROANOKE, Ind. (WANE) United States Congressman Marlin Stutzman, serving in Indiana\u2019s third district, has officially announced his run for U.S. Senate following a \u201cmajor campaign announcement.\u201d\n\nStutzman supporters filled Main Street in downtown Roanoke for the announcement Saturday afternoon, holding signs bearing the \u201cMarlin for Senate\u201d logo before he even made the announcement. Stutzman said he chose the location for good reason.\n\n\u201cWhen we started to talk about where we were going to do our announcement, we wanted to do it in a place that reminded all of us about how great America is because of Main Streets like this all across the country that make America great,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\nBefore Saturday, there was speculation that Stutzman would make the bid for Dan Coats\u2019 seat in the U.S. Senate. Coats announced earlier this year he would not seek re-election in 2016.\n\nAn event created on Facebook for the announcement asked people to join Stutzman \u201cif [they] believe that we need bold, decisive leadership, committed to securing our future and ensuring a strong America\u2026\u201d\n\nNewsChannel 15\u2019s Sara Wagner was at Stutzman\u2019s announcement and was tweeting some of his campaign speech:\n\n\"I will never apologize for being a God-fearing, gun-packing conservative.\"- @RepStutzman says lawmakers must stand up for beliefs. @wane15 \u2014 Sara Wagner (@SaraWagnerWANE) May 9, 2015\n\nIn 2010, Stutzman ran against Coats for the Senate seat and was defeated by more than 51,000 votes. Five years later, he said he\u2019s ready and more prepared than ever to make another run.\n\n\u201cYou can see today we\u2019ve got a lot of support already around the state. Our campaign in 2010 was something that we can build off of. We\u2019ve got a lot of good relationships around the state, and people are excited about the opportunity again and we\u2019re not going to take anything for granted. We\u2019re just going to keep working hard and doing the things that it takes to win,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\nStutzman spent eight years in the statehouse before heading to Washington as a Congressman.\n\n\u201cWe knew that at the end of the day the root of the problems were in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Stutzman said. \u201cI think people are going to be looking for proven leadership in a conservative that\u2019s already stood up that said he\u2019s going to stick to his values and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nNow in his third-term, he said he\u2019s ready for a new challenge.\n\n\u201cRight now, in this moment, we need tested, proven, conservative leadership with a vision for the future and a record of getting the job done. It\u2019s time to give hardworking tax payers the strong, secure America that we deserve,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\nStutzman said his previous experience in Washington and conservative voting record make him the right candidate.\n\n\u201cI work to unify. I want to bring people together because we agree on more things that what we disagree upon, and we shouldn\u2019t be focused entirely on those small differences. We\u2019re going to continue to talk about the fiscal irresponsibility in Washington, about Obamacare and what it\u2019s done to our healthcare system, and we\u2019re going to talk about the security of our country and the fact that we as Americans, we will unify together behind leaders that will protect this country,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\nThe entire Stutzman family took part in Saturday\u2019s announcement. His sons, Peyton and Preston, led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. His wife, Christy, also thanked the crowd for coming.\n\nNow that Stutzman has announced to run for Senate, that leaves his congressional spot open. Allen County Republican County Chair Steve Shine said he knew of two Indiana Senators who would run for the third district, Jim Banks and Liz Brown.\n\nBrown confirmed Saturday she\u2019s very interested in the position.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t count my chickens so I wasn\u2019t really sure if Marlin was going to make the run, and that\u2019s pretty impressive that he is. So, yes, I\u2019m very much interested in running for the third congressional district seat. It\u2019s inspiring, and I would love to continue the conservative values and votes and issues that he\u2019s led in the House side. It\u2019d be great to partner with him as Indiana\u2019s next senator on the other side. I think we could get a lot done together.\u201d Brown said. \u201cLike Marlin said, we\u2019ve done great things in Indiana and if we can take those ideas and issues and show Washington, D.C. how government should really work, and I would love to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nBanks said he\u2019ll announce his plans for the future soon.\n\n\u201cEveryone is here today to support a true conservative to send him as our next U.S. Senator back to Washington to fight the good fight. So, today is definitely about Marlin Stutzman. We\u2019ll talk about our plans in the future, but today we\u2019re here to show our support for him,\u201d Banks said.\n\nBack in March, after Coats announced he would not be running for re-election, former Indiana Republican Party Chairman Eric Holcomb announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate spot. Other possible candidates include state Senator Mike Delph and former Congressman and former Senate candidate Baron Hill. Both have yet to announce, but said they are seriously considering a run for the seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stutzman made his announcement Saturday afternoon in Roanoke surrounded by hundreds of supporters holding \u2018Marlin for Senate\u2019 signs.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "Stutzman made his announcement Saturday afternoon in Roanoke surrounded by hundreds of supporters holding \u2018Marlin for Senate\u2019 signs.", "title": "Marlin Stutzman officially vies for U.S. Senate seat", "url": "http://wane.com/2015/05/09/rep-marlin-stutzman-to-make-major-announcement/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/celczxoweaatnmr.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stutzman made his announcement Saturday afternoon in Roanoke surrounded by hundreds of supporters holding \u2018Marlin for Senate\u2019 signs.", "title": "Marlin Stutzman officially vies for U.S. Senate seat", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/celczxoweaatnmr.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wane15", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16", "application-name": "WANE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2015-05-09T16:53:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T15:45:58+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e4e\"", "article_summary": "just minutes before Rep.
