Manning was a unanimous selection; all 50 media voters chose him. It\u2019s the seventh time Manning has been named to the all-pro first team, tying him with Otto Graham for most by a quarterback in history.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all very deserving,\u201d said coach John Fox. \u201cI think any time you have team success, you get some individual accolades and vice versa. To have team success, you have to have some individuals play well and all those guys are very deserving.\u201d\n\nVasquez made the all-pro team for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a humbling deal,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cI have a great support cast with the rest of the O-line, our offense and our team in general. Having great players around me helps everyone else look that good. A guy like Peyton just makes me want to elevate my game.\u201d\n\nPrater is the Broncos\u2019 first all-pro kicker since Jason Elam was a first-team selection in 2001.\n\nInjury report. Defensive lineman Derek Wolfe, who\u2019s getting the week off to rest, and safety Rahim Moore were the only players missing from Denver\u2019s practice Friday. Moore is eligible to return to practice but has yet to do so.\n\nGase update. First-year offensive coordinator Adam Gase has become a hot commodity for some of the head coaching jobs available in the NFL. He was contacted by the Vikings and the Browns, and told both to hold off until after the Broncos\u2019 season ends.\n\n\u201cI told both teams that were interested in me that I appreciated it and I was going to wait until after our season had concluded,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThey were great about it. They said they appreciated me being up front and honest about it, and I thought that was the best decision for what we are trying to accomplish with our team.\u201d\n\nGase is only 35 years old \u2014 he\u2019s two years younger than Manning \u2014 and is in his third role with the Broncos. He was their wide receivers coach from 2009-10 and their quarterbacks coach from 2011-12.\n\n\u201cIf it comes down to it \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t interview (for a head coaching job) if I didn\u2019t think I was ready for that role,\u201d Gase said. \u201cBut right now I have to focus on what we\u2019re doing for the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-game elimination tournament and I have to make sure my role is prepared for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning among four Denver Broncos on AP all-pro team", "title": "Peyton Manning among four Denver Broncos on AP all-pro team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/03/peyton-manning-among-four-denver-broncos-on-ap-all-pro-team/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131231__peyton-manningp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131231__peyton-manningp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-03T22:30:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:11:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To have team success, you have to have some individuals play well and all those guys are very deserving.\u201dVasquez made the all-pro team for the first time.\nThe Associated Press all-pro team was announced Friday and four Denver players made the cut: quarterback Peyton Manning, guard Louis Vasquez, place-kicker Matt Prater and wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.\nManning and Vasquez were named to the first team, Prater and Thomas to the second team.\n\u201cIf it comes down to it \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t interview (for a head coaching job) if I didn\u2019t think I was ready for that role,\u201d Gase said.\nIt\u2019s the seventh time Manning has been named to the all-pro first team, tying him with Otto Graham for most by a quarterback in history."}
