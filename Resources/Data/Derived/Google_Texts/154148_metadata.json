That has also been the case after hospitals absorb doctors\u2019 offices and other medical services, as has happened on a large scale in the Harrisburg area.\n\n\u201cInterestingly enough, it rarely works \u2026 Usually the outcome is not as favorable as anticipated,\u201d says David Sarcone, a Dickinson College professor and former health care administrator.\n\n\n\nSarcone\u2019s view is shared by many experts. It's based on studies that followed a surge of hospital mergers around the country in the 1990s.\n\nBut the hospital industry and others argue this wave of consolidation will be different. It\u2019s being driven by new forces, including Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s a major push for better coordination of medical care, and for paying for quality and value. Hospitals that don\u2019t deliver will be penalized.\n\nDr. Harold Paz, the CEO of Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, points out that health care has been highly fragmented compared to other industries. This has led to mistakes, duplication and inefficiencies. He believes integration and size can overcome those.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see this as a reflection of what has been happening in the rest of the economy for decades finally catching up to health care,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are going to see more and more opportunities to partner with other organizations and I really believe that will have an impact on lowering the cost of health care.\u201d\n\nFor now, only these are certain: The central Pennsylvania healthcare landscape is undergoing a seismic shift toward big. It\u2019s not over. And, good or bad, it will affect just about everyone.\n\nIt began several years ago, when all of the area\u2019s hospitals began positioning themselves to provide the full range of medical services \u2014 from the intensive care unit to the family doctor to the cancer center to the blood lab.\n\nIn 2013, it took on new magnitude. Each of the Harrisburg region\u2019s five health systems took steps that could make them far bigger.\n\nIn June, Good Samaritan Health System in Lebanon announced it\u2019s too small to stand alone in the new health care landscape and must find a larger partner.\n\nSimilarly, Holy Spirit Health System in September announced it has entered formal talks with giant Geisinger Health System, based in Montour County about 70 miles to the north.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Florida-based chain that owns Carlisle Regional Medical Center is being bought by a Tennessee-based chain in a transaction that will make Carlisle Regional part of the nation\u2019s largest hospital chain.\n\nFinally, the area\u2019s two giants, PinnacleHealth System and Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, announced they are looking at collaborating more closely.\n\n\n\nSome outside observers say that, given all the consolidation occurring around the country, it\u2019s possible the two might become one. However, they also cite other logical possibilities for collaboration in which the two would remain separate.\n\nPenn State Hershey\u2019s Paz in a recent interview said no one knows the likely outcome. An independent consultant, he said, will spend several months studying both organizations and then make a recommendation. The outcome is expected to be known by June 30.\n\nThe hospital merger wave is happening all over the country. In 2012, there were 105 mergers, up from 50 in 2009. Experts expect the trend to accelerate.\n\nIt\u2019s driven by a confluence of new and old forces.\n\nOne is Obamacare, which encourages better coordination of medical care and emphasizes prevention and keeping patients healthier.\n\nThere\u2019s also a shift toward paying hospital systems to care for populations of patients rather than sick individuals. This is in contrast to the traditional method of paying for volume of things such as hospital admissions, doctor visits and MRIs.\n\nThe old, volume-based payment system provided little incentive for keeping patients out of the hospital. In fact, hospitals earned more when patients had to come back, even if it was the hospital's fault.\n\nNow, Medicaid is penalizing hospitals for patients who are readmitted unnecessarily. Medicaid will eventually penalize hospitals for additional things, such as infections that strike hospitalized patients.\n\n\n\nAll the while, businesses have been shifting more health insurance costs to employees, causing them to cut back on things like elective surgeries and medical tests.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s been a long-running push to keep people out of the hospital and care for them in less expensive settings. New technology makes this increasingly possible.\n\nAll of those things have caused hospital admissions, and profits, to decline.\n\nMeanwhile, Obamacare is expected to enable millions more people to access the health care system. With the high level of government debt, and the lackluster economic outlook, the financial pressures on hospitals are expected to continue and probably intensify.\n\n\u201cThe health systems realize the dollar is tight and they are going to have to operate differently,\u201d says Mike Fiaschetti, president for health markets for health insurer Highmark Inc.\n\nBecoming bigger can enable hospitals to better spread the new financial risks, impose quality controls, invest in technological improvements and gain economies of scale that can lower costs.\n\n\u201cIf we have a fragmented system, the model doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says Penn State Hershey\u2019s Paz, referring to the new payment model.\n\nIt sounds good in theory. But consolidation doesn\u2019t have a good track record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssorted studies have looked at the wave of mergers during the 1990s, which saw nearly 200 mergers in 1997.\n\nA widely cited study by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation concluded costs typically rose by 20 percent or more after hospitals merged.\n\nEven now, larger hospitals typically receive higher payments from health insurers, because of bargaining power and the fact that insurers can\u2019t afford to exclude them from networks.\n\nStephen Foreman, an associate professor of health care administration at Robert Morris University, contends the new wave of mergers is driven mostly by the desire of hospitals to increase negotiating clout and gain larger reimbursements from insurers.\n\nHe also argues that size itself can become a negative for a health system.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing I worry about most is something called dis-economies of scale. You get so large you become inefficient. These merged entities become very difficult to manage,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, PinnacleHealth says it has proof that merger produces lower costs. A spokeswoman pointed to the 1995 merger of Harrisburg Hospital and the former Polyclinic Hospital. She said an independent economist concluded it produced $212 million in savings during the first five years. That was well in excess of the $70 million in savings needed to satisfy an agreement with a the Pennsylvania Attorney General, which approved the transaction.\n\nShe also said, \u201cAs to the question of decreased competition and increased bargaining power with insurers, we suggest that that question be directed to the insurance companies and ask them to compare rates paid in Harrisburg vs. other similar cities in Pennsylvania over the past 10 years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right. Executives of health insurers including Highmark acknowledge the Harrisburg region market has long been more competitive than many other markets, including York and Lancaster, and costs have been lower.\n\nOn the other hand, Highmark also has publicly pointed at Geisinger, saying prices have risen after Geisinger acquired smaller hospitals in northcentral Pennsylvania.\n\nGeisinger has hasn\u2019t disputed this. But it has countered that it cares for the sickest patients, conducts research, trains doctors, and improves quality at acquired hospitals, which were struggling financially. As a result, Geisinger must negotiate \u201cmore reasonable payer contract rates, so reasonable operating costs and needed margin for reinvestment is achieved,\u201d a Geisinger executive said.\n\nThe executive further said health insurers focus on lower per-unit costs, creating an incentive for hospitals to perform more procedures. He said Geisinger believes it's better to focus on removing excess care and costs that add no value, which he said account for 35 percent of present costs.\n\nBut Harrisburg area health insurance executives such as Fiaschetti say there\u2019s great promise the new forces, and resulting consolidation, will bend the cost curve downward.\n\nTheir main fear is that the area will be become dominated by one player, and the lack of competition will have negative consequences.\n\nStill, there\u2019s general agreement that with Geisinger now in the picture, and the other Harrisburg-area systems all taking steps to gain size and integration-related efficiencies, the Harrisburg area might remain unusually competitive.\n\nPaula Bussard, a senior vice president with the Hospital & Health System Association of Pennsylvania, doesn\u2019t dismiss the studies that associate consolidation with higher costs.\n\nBut she argues the new forces give plenty of reason to expect that bigger will lead to better, more affordable medical care.\n\n\u201cIs the past always the prologue to the future? A lot of things are different now,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@newsletter','@topstories','health care','supersizing-health-care'", "title": "Hospitals go big; but unlike most industries, it's no guarantee of savings", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hospitals go big; but unlike most industries, it\\u0027s no guarantee of savings\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/pinnacle_hershey_penn_state_ho.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/13945927-standard.jpeg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11816402\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-16T10:45:24Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@newsletter\",\"@topstories\",\"health care\",\"supersizing-health-care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/13945927-thumb_square_large.jpeg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "The central Pennsylvania healthcare landscape is undergoing a seismic shift toward big."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, December 16, 2013,  6:46 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/hospitals-800x500jpeg-b2f8466dc7980a57.jpeg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The central Pennsylvania healthcare landscape is undergoing a seismic shift toward big.", "title": "Hospitals go big; but unlike most industries, it's no guarantee of savings", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/pinnacle_hershey_penn_state_ho.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, December 16, 2013,  5:45 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "The central Pennsylvania healthcare landscape is undergoing a seismic shift toward big."}, "article_summary": "Similarly, Holy Spirit Health System in September announced it has entered formal talks with giant Geisinger Health System, based in Montour County about 70 miles to the north.\nThat would seem to bode well for health care costs in the Harrisburg area, which is in the midst of a seismic shift toward big.\nThere\u2019s a major push for better coordination of medical care, and for paying for quality and value.\nMeanwhile, Obamacare is expected to enable millions more people to access the health care system.\nBut she argues the new forces give plenty of reason to expect that bigger will lead to better, more affordable medical care."}
