Patrick Michels

Two fulcrums of tension so far at the 2016 Republican Party of Texas convention: how much the far-right GOP loathes the “establishment” GOP, and how much the entire GOP loathes Democrats. A, er, joke on the convention big-screen earlier: “Q. Why should Democrats be buried 100 feet deep? A. Because deep down they’re really good people.” Death! It’s hilarious.

Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick were the big names on stage during the general session this morning. You can think of the general session hall as a sort of twangy disco-casino, too dark and filled with flashing colored lights to really know where you are or what time it is, how much money you’ve spent, or how to identify the closest exit.

The general vibe: Ted Cruz is great, and there’s a national presidential race happening between Hillary Clinton, who is awful, and … another person.
