Even as his patient load expanded, his take-home pay contracted, and he feared not having enough time to spend with his patients.\n\nSo a little over a year ago, he invited them to a big meeting at the Tustin Ranch Country Club, where he explained a new feature of his practice. Patients who agreed to pay a yearly fee of $1,600, beyond their insurance premiums, would enjoy better access to him. That included same-day appointments, real-time telephone availability, quick answers to emailed questions, and an exhaustive two-hour annual physical exam with detailed, personalized follow-up. People who were unwilling or unable to pay the fee could still see him on the same basis as before.\n\n\u201cI knew that if I didn't make a change in my practice, I was not going to be able to do it any more. I was going to have to join a giant group like Kaiser,\u201d Hwang recalls. \u201cSo part of it was survival. Part of it, too, was to be able to practice in a way I was comfortable with. I didn't want my practice to be a mill.\u201d\n\nHwang had decided to join a small but growing movement known as \u201cconcierge\u201d medicine, first introduced to his practice about four years earlier by one of his professional partners, Dr. Mario Ficarola.\n\n\u201cThe concierge practice has been able to give me some breathing room,\u201d Hwang says. \u201cI have one and a half to two hours a day set aside where I can do things at a more humane pace.\u201d\n\nIn concierge medicine, patients pay a fee for a number of extra services \u2013 mostly related to access, prevention and peace of mind \u2013 that are not covered by their insurance. The practice started to gain attention over a decade ago, and is growing, though it still represents only a fraction of the primary care given across the United States today.\n\nCritics of the practice say it creates inequity between patients who have the disposable income to pay for it and those who do not. Some also argue that, because most doctors with concierge practices have only a fraction of the patient volume that more ordinary practices do, its growth could exacerbate a looming shortage of primary care physicians.\n\nThat would only amplify one widely expected impact of Obamacare, the federal health reform law, which many experts believe will aggravate the doctor shortage. The new law is expected to bring an estimated 7 million newly insured Americans into the U.S. health system next year alone \u2013 and nearly 30 million over 10 years \u2013 putting additional pressure on already-stretched primary care providers.\n\nMORE STRESS, LESS PAY\n\nProponents and practitioners of concierge medicine note that primary care physicians are already leaving the field in large numbers because of declining pay and the high stress and frustration of large patient loads. If anything, they say, concierge medicine is keeping doctors in practice because of the better financial and professional satisfaction it offers.\n\n\u201cMany of our physicians would have left practice. This is helping physicians extend their careers,\u201d says Andrea Klemes, medical director of Boca Raton, Fla.-based MDVIP, a national concierge medicine network with about 660 doctors and 200,000 patients nationwide that is owned by Procter & Gamble.\n\nFrank Rose, an internist and cardiologist in Dana Point, joined MDVIP in 2008 after two decades in a more regular, high-volume practice.\n\n\u201cI love medicine and I want to continue to practice it as long as I can, and this is allowing me to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is more traditional medicine like Marcus Welby, where you can sit with the patient, they can tell you their issues and concerns. If they have family issues, you can listen to that. You just don't have time in seven to 15 minutes to address those issues.\u201d\n\nThe concept is also appealing to many patients \u2013 at least those who can afford the fees, which average about $1,500 to $2,000 a year but can go as high as $8,000 or even more in rare cases where doctors care for only a tiny number of individuals or families.\n\n\u201cI know if I've got an issue and I call in, I'm going to see him the same day,\u201d says Edward Barry, 75, who pays $1,600 a year for Dr. Hwang's concierge service. \u201cI'm sure if you talk to somebody with less income, they'll have a different opinion, but I don't view it as a high price for the value I'm getting.\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE'S IMPACT\n\nSome health care analysts note that it is precisely the people with less income who will be disproportionately represented among the millions of people expected to get insurance under Obamacare. They will be individuals whose employers don't provide health coverage, or with incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal insurance for the poor. Once they are insured, they, too, will be looking for doctors, which could be difficult \u2013 and add to the frustration of others who are already facing long wait times.\n\nBecause of the additional strain on physicians' time, \u201cthere could be an increase in demand for concierge medicine,\u201d says Dana B. Mukamel, a professor of health economics at the UC Irvine medical school. \u201cIf it does have an impact on concierge medicine and some doctors take themselves out of the regular market, it could exacerbate the impact of the shortage for those who are not able or willing to pay a premium for concierge medicine services.\u201d\n\nHowever, some say that demographic realities should ensure a small overlap between doctors serving concierge patients and those caring for Obamacare's newly insured.\n\n\u201cConcierge programs tend to be in middle and upper middle income areas, and those areas will not have as high a density of people who will fit into the (Obamacare) programs,\u201d says Wayne Lipton, managing partner and founder of Concierge Choice Physicians, which provides administration, marketing and billing services for 250 practices in 23 states, including the Tustin practice of Hwang and Ficarola.\n\nThere are only about 10,000 concierge doctors nationwide, compared to 300,000 physicians in regular practices, estimates Pamela Brar, a La Jolla internist who sits on the board of the American Academy of Private Physicians, which represents concierge doctors. And her numbers suggest that only around 1 percent of Americans are enrolled in concierge plans. A significant impediment to greater growth is that doctors are not allowed to take any fees directly from HMO patients.\n\nThough hard data are difficult to get, Brar says it is a \u201cgood bet\u201d that the average concierge-only practice has 300 to 400 patients. That compares to anywhere from 1,000 to more than 4,000 in a non-concierge primary care practice.\n\n\u2018HYBRID' PRACTICES\n\nBut there are many forms of concierge practice, and not all of them restrict the patient load to such a dramatic extent.\n\nDoctors affiliated with Concierge Choice have what Lipton calls \u201chybrid\u201d practices. That means concierge patients comprise between 3 and 15 percent of their total, and they continue seeing their other patients. Hwang, the Tustin internist, says that less than 10 percent of his patients pay the concierge fee. Lipton says that in hybrid concierge practices, \u201cthere is no disenfranchisement of patients\u201d and the extra revenue helps doctors \u201ccontinue in an environment that might not be economically stable.\u201d\n\nAt Caduceus Medical Group, a physician-owned practice with offices in Yorba Linda, Laguna Beach and Irvine, patients get many concierge-like services without having to pay a fee, says the group's CEO and co-owner, Gregg DeNicola. Same-day appointments are guaranteed, for any reason, though patients might see a nurse practitioner rather than a doctor. Emails from patients are answered within 12 hours, and the group's \u201cmedical life\u201d center in Yorba Linda provides free massage and other amenities.\n\nDeNicola says the group does it by reinvesting profits. The group takes all insurance, has an \u201caggressive\u201d program to encourage cash payments and even accepts bitcoin, an alternative digital currency.\n\n\u201cIf we can do it, others can do it,\u201d DeNicola says. He says doctors should provide good service without charging a \u201cludicrous\u201d fee.\n\nConcierge patients, however, are clearly not bothered by the fee.\n\n\u201cIt's not that I'm rolling in cash and $1,600 is nothing to me, says Peter Gelker, 67, of Santa Ana, a psychiatrist who is a patient in Hwang's Tustin practice. \u201cBut you're going to pay one way or another if you want to see somebody good in medicine. You can pay in time and in waiting. That's the way it's becoming.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-2440 or bwolfson@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: The doctor will see you now | concierge, practice, patients, says, doctors, pay, medicine, physicians, hwang, fee", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "BERNARD J.
