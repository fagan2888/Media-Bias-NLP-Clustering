So no, I would not engage in the Constitutional amendment process as a party going into 2016. Accept the Court\u2019s ruling. Fight for the religious liberties of every American.\u201d\n\nIn other words, that whole part of the Republican party platform is an electoral death wish now, so Graham wants the base to pivot to fears that their religious liberty is being infringed upon when gay people get married. This the party can work with.\n\nThis is how you turn a losing platform to rob others of their liberty that you sold to the cult for years as an easy get out the vote tactic into \u201cliberty for all\u201d, which is Republican for \u201cThe Republican Party will defend you from those meanies who are getting the same liberties as you.\u201d\n\nThis has not been a good month for Graham, who started off peacocking about how while some see the Confederate flag as a \u201cracist symbol\u201d, it is just \u201cwho we are\u201d, only to admit after much backlash that this \u201cheritage\u201d needed to come down.\n\nIt\u2019s white flag month for Lindsey Graham and the Republican party platform. Wrong on the Confederate flag, wrong on equal marriage, wrong on Obamacare subsidies. Defeat, defeat, defeat.\n\nInstead of talking about those things, Graham and Bush are signaling desperately that it\u2019s time to pivot to \u201creligious liberty\u201d, a made up issue for the majority religion in this country, but let us not forget, this was the last win the Republican party had with Hobby Lobby fighting to take liberty away women and gay people. Also known as \u201cheritage\u201d.\n\nIt might not seem like it, but grading on a scale, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush are the sane adults in the Republican Party. They are desperately trying to get the party to move quickly off of the issue they\u2019ve been fear-mongering about for years, because they can see it\u2019s a loser that will cost the party elections. In starker terms, this is also known as defeat and surrender.\n\nThere is a flag that is most accurately a large part of \u201cwho they are\u201d and won\u2019t offend anyone but their base:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lindsey Graham (R-SC) waved the white flag of defeat on \"Meet the Press\" today, when he told Chuck Todd that he doesn't believe there is any chance of a Constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between one man and one woman.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Lindsey Graham (R-SC) waved the white flag of defeat on \"Meet the Press\" today, when he told Chuck Todd that he doesn't believe there is any chance of a Constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between one man and one woman.", "title": "A Defeated Lindsey Graham Admits Republicans Will Never Win With Current Platform", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/28/defeated-lindsey-graham-admits-republicans-win-current-platform.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-28-at-1.03.47-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-28T13:38:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman,defeat,Linsdey Graham,republican party gives up on gay marriage part of their platform,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-06-28T13:33:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T13:38:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman, defeat, Linsdey Graham, republican party gives up on gay marriage part of their platform"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccff5\"", "article_summary": "Defeat, defeat, defeat.\nWrong on the Confederate flag, wrong on equal marriage, wrong on Obamacare subsidies.\nIt\u2019s white flag month for Lindsey Graham and the Republican party platform.\nIt might not seem like it, but grading on a scale, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush are the sane adults in the Republican Party.\nWatch here:\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is any chance of Constitutional amendment,\u201d a defeated looking Graham said."}
