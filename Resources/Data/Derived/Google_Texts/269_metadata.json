He later ran for his third term as mayor as an independent.\n\nThe billionaire media mogul has toyed with a presidential race before. In 2008 he was rumored for an independent bid. And he's already generated a good amount of buzz for the upcoming 2016 race as well, though this is what he said when asked last fall.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is I'm very happy doing two things, running my company and working with the United Nations and U.S. government on climate change.\"\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Bloomberg may be testing the waters on a possible 2016 presidential run.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Michael Bloomberg may be testing the waters on a possible 2016 presidential run.", "title": "Michael Bloomberg Could Toss His Name Into A Clinton-Trump Race", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/michael-bloomberg-could-toss-his-name-into-a-clinton-trump-race/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1452468163.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Bloomberg may be testing the waters on a possible 2016 presidential run.", "title": "Michael Bloomberg Could Toss His Name Into A Clinton-Trump Race", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/michael-bloomberg-could-toss-his-name-into-a-clinton-trump-race/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1452468163.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=U2MjI0MDE66JtfKuMJomk7at79I8hlze&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://55808", "iphone": "newsy://55808", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://55808", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "michael bloomberg mayor,michael bloomberg president,michael bloomberg media,michael bloomberg new york city,michael bloomberg independent,michael bloomberg politics,2016 presidential run,race for white house,presidential election 2016,michael bloomberg entering race,michael bloomberg nyc,michael bloomberg presidential interest", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1452468163.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "As if the race for the White House isn't crowded enough, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might add his name to the mix.\nMichael Bloomberg may be testing the waters on a possible 2016 presidential run.\nAnd he's already generated a good amount of buzz for the upcoming 2016 race as well, though this is what he said when asked last fall.\nThe billionaire media mogul has toyed with a presidential race before.\nBloomberg was a longtime Democrat who switched to the Republican Party just in time to run for mayor in 2001."}
