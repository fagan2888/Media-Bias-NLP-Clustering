She babysat my twins just last week while I took my son on a college tour. She went shopping with me a few weeks ago and I was getting tired, so she offered to carry my bags. She watches CNN like an addict and I sometimes have to call her just to see what\u2019s going on in the world. She\u2019s like my very own newscaster.\n\nWhile quietly flipping through an old photo album, I asked her about her oldest memories. She said she didn\u2019t know that the 1930s were desperate times because she was too little. My aunt once said she remembers they didn\u2019t have much of anything, but it didn\u2019t matter because nobody else did either. They were lucky to get a tea set, mittens and a peppermint candy for Christmas. That was pretty much it and they felt extremely lucky just to have that.\n\nHer memories begin in the 1940s with radio programs like \u201cThe Hermit\u2019s Cave,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Pretend,\u201d \u201cLux Presents Hollywood\u201d and \u201cFibber McGee and Molly.\u201d She remembers victory gardens, the death of President Franklin Roosevelt and that she could go to the movies for free if she brought in a bag full of tin cans, an old tire or whatever they might be collecting for the war effort. They also shared ration coupons, had air-raid drills with blackouts and she remembers early morning visits by the milkman.\n\nAt the end of the war, on VE Day, they drove their big old Buick to downtown Lansing and a huge bonfire celebration where people were laughing, crying, dancing and hugging each other.\n\nIn 1950, their family got its first television set. They lined up chairs in front of it and watched Kate Smith, Milton Berle, Dinah Shore and \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d She said that these were quiet times \u2014 the times she misses the most.\n\nShe said the difference between now and then is mostly the noise. The world now seems so loud. Houses only had one car, there were no motor lawnmowers or leaf blowers, and the music was soothing with crooners like Bing Crosby and Perry Como, or women like Rosemary Clooney and Patti Page.\n\nIt was a peaceful time. You sat on your front porch all the time to relax and talk. Maybe you took a walk around the block. There wasn\u2019t much violence, at least not like today.\n\nShe sighs a deep sigh and says she does miss those times, but she misses the people who were in it the most. Her parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors, siblings \u2014 all gone now. My mother is the lone survivor in her family.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have much to say about the 1960s because, as she put it, \u201cIt was all a blur.\u201d She had four small children and used to look forward to taking the garbage out so she could get two quick breaths of fresh air before she had to go back into the house.\n\nShe said she had no idea what was going on in the world, but remembers she was washing a baby when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, feeding one when Martin Luther King was, and rocking one when Sen. Robert Kennedy was.\n\nThe 1970s are when my memories just begin \u2014 of her, my grandparents and life in a small town. The \u201980\u2019s and \u201990s flew by with a blink of an eye, and now she finds herself thinking of the old times often. She shows me pictures of when she was little and the progress through the years.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard on her because it hurts the heart if you look back for too long. She said she won\u2019t be around forever, but I can\u2019t imagine life without her.\n\nWhen asked what wisdom she has to pass on, she said, \u201cJust that you have to cherish the people around you when you have them. Hug them. Say you love them. Because someday, either they won\u2019t be here anymore or you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe says strong faith is what pulled her through her darkest hours.\n\nTake a moment at the end of this article, close your eyes and remember all the people you loved and lost, and then open them and remember that life does indeed go on.\n\nHappy Birthday, Mom, and I say to everyone turning 80, shoot for the Smuckers jar.\n\n\u2014 Amy Dehn is an Appleton resident.
