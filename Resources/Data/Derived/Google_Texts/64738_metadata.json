The accepted scores will be determined by December.\n\nIn the months of discussions, which officials on Friday called \u201ccomplex and at times contentious,\u201d reaching an agreement in part depended on a compromise to allow colleges to set different scores when a student wants to major in the content.\n\nFor instance, a student wishing to get college credit for an Advanced Placement English class may need one score to get that credit to apply for general education. But if that student wants to major in English, a higher score could be required.\n\nThe scores needed to apply credit to a major will be set by March 2016.\n\nCommissioners on Friday supported the policy but discussed concerns about colleges differentiating cut scores for majors. They asked that their reasons be justified with data.\n\nKathleen Pickering, vice provost for undergraduate affairs at Colorado State University, said looking at data will help make sure students who are allowed to skip a college class by getting credit for previous experiences still will be successful in their other college courses.\n\n\u201cWe all share this interest, certainly, in creating efficiency, access and affordability,\u201d Pickering said.\n\nBesides test scores, schools also will look at how to apply or accept credit from certain work-training experiences, approved military credit and portfolio assessments.\n\nAnother concern raised Friday was about access to prior-learning experiences and ensuring the policy doesn\u2019t make inequalities wider.\n\nEpper pointed out that high-achieving high school students aren\u2019t the only ones who can benefit. An estimated 700,000 Colorado adults who have some college credit but no degree also could benefit.\n\n\u201cIf we want to reach these students,\u201d Epper said, \u201cwe need a policy that helps to bring them in and to recognize the learning they already have to help accelerate their progress to get a degree.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado colleges will create common ways to accept prior learning", "title": "Colorado colleges will create common ways to accept prior learning", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/08/colorado-colleges-will-create-common-ways-to-accept-prior-learning/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-08T18:18:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T18:18:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "higher education, K-12 education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb25\"", "article_summary": "Students who get college credit not earned in a college classroom will have an easier time transferring those credits starting next spring.\nAn estimated 700,000 Colorado adults who have some college credit but no degree also could benefit.\nOn Friday, a new policy that will standardize how colleges accept \u201ccredit for prior learning\u201d was approved by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, making Colorado one of 12 states to standardize the process.\nThe plan approved Friday commits the state\u2019s colleges to set one score per class, or to test to determine if college credit is granted.\nCommissioners on Friday supported the policy but discussed concerns about colleges differentiating cut scores for majors."}
