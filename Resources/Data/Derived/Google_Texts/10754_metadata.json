Chris Corley, R-Graniteville, shows his frustration by waving a white flag of surrender during debate over a the bill that removed the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds on July 8. Corley has since said that the vote will come at a political cost for many Republicans.\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 A freshman Midlands lawmaker is predicting up to 30 Republican incumbents could face challenges in next year\u2019s primaries because of the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the pole in front of the Statehouse.\n\n\u201cThis was way too big of an issue and it was not handled properly in the way it was fast-tracked,\u201d said Chris Corley, R-Graniteville. \u201cWe were sold out by the governor, by (state GOP Party Chairman) Matt Moore and by the speaker.\u201d\n\nDemands to take the flag down permanently grew after nine churchgoers, including pastor and state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, were gunned down last month at Charleston\u2019s historic black Emanuel AME Church by a white gunman who authorities have said posted online photos of himself holding a handgun and a Confederate flag.\n\nDuring the marathon flag debate in the House, Corley was among those who sought to block passage of a Senate bill that called for taking down the banner that had flown as part of the Confederate Soldier Monument since 2000 and displaying it at the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum.\n\nThe bill easily won the necessary two-thirds approval and was signed by Gov. Nikki Haley, but not before opponents engaged in what Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia, referred to as \u201cfilibuster by amendment.\u201d\n\nFrustrated by vote after vote defeating amendments, Corley took to the floor to propose replacing the rebel banner with a white flag representing his view that the Republicans had surrendered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a picture, but it would look like this,\u201d Corley told the chamber, waving a small white flag from the House podium.\n\nThat and his subsequent accusation to the Aiken Standard that House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Hartsville, was \u201cspineless,\u201d were \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and \u201cunbecoming of a state legislator,\u201d said Moore, the state GOP chief. He added that the white flag \u201cinfuriated\u201d him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just embarrassing,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt makes the state look bad. There were good people on both sides of this debate. Almost all of them respectfully debated the very sensitive issue.\u201d\n\nIf there is going to be a price to be paid politically for voting to take down the Confederate flag, Moore said he is unaware of it so far, and he would stand behind incumbents challenged solely for their flag vote.\n\n\u201cI would say it would be disgraceful to run in a primary against an incumbent on the issue of the Confederate flag,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIncumbents who are concerned about it, they aren\u2019t alone. They have allies on this.\u201d\n\nRep. Rick Quinn, R-Cayce, said he fully anticipates an opponent; the vote, politically, was a lose-lose situation because most districts were evenly split in their views on taking down the flag, he said.\n\nQuinn agreed that some \u201chard feelings\u201d developed among members during the flag debate. But the veteran lawmaker \u2014 Quinn was majority leader in 2000 when the General Assembly passed the bill that moved the flag from the top of the Capitol\u2019s dome to the front lawn of the Statehouse \u2014 said wounds heal with time.\n\n\u201cI think where some of the relationships that have been harmed are with the people who felt deceived,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be friends to serve together.\u201d\n\nLucas said he understood the frustrations of some of the members because the flag debate was a \u201cvery sensitive issue,\u201d but he didn\u2019t directly address Corley\u2019s comments. Lucas said he approached the issue the same way he handled others during his first term as speaker of the House.\n\nUnder previous speakers, House members felt like the chamber\u2019s leadership wasn\u2019t open and transparent enough. And the chamber\u2019s leadership has worked hard during the past year to ensure everyone is involved, Lucas said.\n\n\u201cWhat we tried to do with this issue was no different than what we tried to do with every issue,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe tried to be open and transparent with regards to every issue that we handle.\u201d\n\nBut Corley insisted that the process involved a lot of deception and \u201cback-room dealing\u201d that went against the will of the people. And a lot of Republicans are \u201cfed up\u201d with how they sold out on the issue, he claimed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said back there,\u201d Corley said. \u201cThis is a speaker who has been supposedly all about transparency. There was absolutely nothing transparent about what was done.\u201d\n\nReach Cynthia Roldan at 708-5891.
