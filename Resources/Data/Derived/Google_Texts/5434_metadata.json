Residents, meanwhile, tried to make sense of the dramatic turn after six months of turmoil.\n\nAround Bangkok there was little sign of any change, and most soldiers that had occupied key intersections in the capital a day earlier had withdrawn. People went about their work normally, students went to school, and the traffic was snarled as it would be any other weekday in this bustling city.\n\nMartial law for now appeared to be playing out primarily behind closed doors, as army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha \u201cinvited\u201d the key powerbrokers in the country\u2019s latest political crisis to meet for the first time since it escalated six months ago.\n\nThe army interrupted regular programming on national television to announce the Wednesday afternoon meeting at Bangkok\u2019s Army Club, which it said was being called \u201cto solve the political conflict smoothly.\u201d\n\nSeven of the country\u2019s highest profile political figures were summoned. They included the acting prime minister, anti-government protest leader Suthep Thausuban and his rival from the pro-government Red Shirt group, Jatuporn Prompan. Also summoned were leaders of the ruling Pheu Thai Party and the opposition Democrat Party, as well as the five-member Election Commission and representatives from the Senate.\n\nThe meeting of bitter political enemies was unlikely to yield any immediate resolution, but the event itself was a stunning development.\n\nPrayuth invoked the military\u2019s expanded powers Tuesday and issued more than a dozen edicts that included broad powers of censorship over the media, the Internet and vaguely defined threats to prosecute opponents.\n\nThe military insisted it was not seizing power, but said it was acting to prevent violence and restore stability in the deeply divided country. Prayuth told a news conference Tuesday that without martial law imposed, the political opponents would never come together to broker peace.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why martial law was needed, or else who would listen?\u201d said Prayuth. \u201cIf I call them in, they have to come.\u201d\n\nPrayuth has provided little clarity on a path forward, amid speculation both at home and abroad that the declaration of martial law was a prelude to a military coup.\n\nKnown to be gruff with the media, the army chief deflected questions about the likelihood of a coup with flippant answers that added to the confusion. Asked if a coup was taking shape, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a question that no one is going to answer.\u201d\n\nAsked if the army was keeping in contact with the government, he answered: \u201cWhere is the government right now? Where are they now? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe army banned demonstrators from marching outside their existing protest sites and banned any broadcast or publication that could \u201cincite unrest.\u201d Fourteen politically affiliated satellite and cable TV stations \u2014 on both sides of the political divide \u2014 were asked to stop broadcasting.\n\nBut for most people, there was no tangible change in their everyday life.\n\n\u201cAfter 24 hours of martial law, I have not spotted a single soldier,\u201d said Buntham Lertpatraporn, a 50-year-old vendor of Thai-style doughnuts in the capital\u2019s central business district along Silom Road. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen soldiers on TV.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "author": "Thanyarat Doksone and Jocelyn Gecker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "title": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/21/thai_army_chief_assumes_role_as_crisis_mediator/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/thailand-politics.jpeg63-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/thailand-politics.jpeg63-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Thai army chief assumes role as crisis mediator", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8021\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thailand\u2019s army chief assumed the role of mediator Wednesday by summoning the country\u2019s key political rivals for face-to-face talks one day after imposing martial law.\nKnown to be gruff with the media, the army chief deflected questions about the likelihood of a coup with flippant answers that added to the confusion.\nPrayuth told a news conference Tuesday that without martial law imposed, the political opponents would never come together to broker peace.\n\u201cAfter 24 hours of martial law, I have not spotted a single soldier,\u201d said Buntham Lertpatraporn, a 50-year-old vendor of Thai-style doughnuts in the capital\u2019s central business district along Silom Road.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why martial law was needed, or else who would listen?\u201d said Prayuth."}
