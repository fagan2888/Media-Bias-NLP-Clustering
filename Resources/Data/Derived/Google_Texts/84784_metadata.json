The meetup, which is taking place in downtown Philadelphia, has drawn more than 90 employees, all hoping to come up with the next innovation for the company, whether it\u2019s a virtual reality application or interactive video. Bell, the company\u2019s newly named vp of growth and analytics, moves from one table to the next with the demeanor of a den mother, dispensing hugs, high-fives and thank-yous.\n\n\u201cI love this,\u201d Bell effused. \u201cThis is the most fun job you could possibly have. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re a kid and you have a big Lego set.\u201d\n\nBell, 36, is a journalist turned technologist, an unusual breed in news organizations today. It\u2019s a combination that\u2019s increasingly valued in digital publishing, though, where content is inextricably linked to its form and dissemination. The two come from different viewpoints, though. Tech and editorial have different cultures and priorities, and work on different time frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding a house of cards\n\nBell came to appreciate what technology could do for journalists while at The Washington Post, where she moved from blogger into the role of platforms director. Her colleague Ezra Klein, the blogger behind Wonkblog, met her in the process of trying to redesign his site.\n\nBell, he said, has an \u201cunusual number of extreme talents,\u201d including an ability to see how the editorial product can be enriched by technology, and bring the two sides together. \u201cNo one would be willing to have a meeting without Melissa,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seemed to be central to any discussion of how this worked. She\u2019s a rare manager who can identify the needs and approaches of editorial and designing product.\u201d\n\nThe best example of this is Vox.com\u2019s card stacks. Klein and Bell left the Post to co-found Vox.com, Vox Media\u2019s news vertical, as part of a new flowering of explanatory journalism that included Nate Silver\u2019s ESPN-backed FiveThirtyEight and The New York Times\u2019 Upshot. Bell had both editorial and product responsibilities. While much of the initial coverage of Vox.com focused on Klein, it was Bell who led the creation of the card stacks, Vox.com\u2019s core editorial feature, Klein said.\n\n\u201cI had this somewhat hazy notion that there was some way to read an article about Obamacare and scroll through a deep explanation about all the parts about Obamacare,\u201d Klein recalled. \u201cBut my vision couldn\u2019t have been cruder. It was really her, working with [product people], understanding what I needed and making it into cards. That was her having a really deep understanding of what we were trying to do editorially, but also having a deep facility for user experience, user design.\u201d\n\nOriginally designed to give background to an article, the cards evolved into Vox.com\u2019s main point of differentiation, an attraction for readers looking to get caught up on a subject. The cards will not only help grow the Vox.com audience (it recently made them embeddable so they can be distributed by other news organizations) but serve as a template for Vox Media\u2019s six other verticals to use, as Eater did with these map stacks.\n\nSince launching in April 2014, Vox.com has topped 12 million multiplatform unique visitors, according to comScore.\n\n\u201cEzra, Matt [Yglesias, Vox.com\u2019s executive editor] and Melissa came in with this idea of how to explain the news,\u201d said Trei Brundrett, chief product officer for Vox Media and Bell\u2019s boss. \u201cIt was very clear, this was going to be the model for how we do this.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Bell was \u2014 and still is \u2014 working closely on the editorial side of Vox.com, where she oversees the news app, graphics, video, analytics, short-form and engagement teams. Staying close to the editorial product, she believes, will better inform what she does on the product side. \u201cShe\u2019s edited hundreds of pieces of content,\u201d Klein said. \u201cI have no idea how we would run Vox without Melissa.\u201d\n\nVox Media has evolved into a very different company from what it was just a couple of years ago. Fueled by nearly $100 million in funding, its head Jim Bankoff bought the Curbed group of sites (Curbed, Eater and Racked) to complement Vox\u2019s high-profile sites SB Nation and The Verge, and launched Vox.com. Earlier this year, he acquired Recode. Until recently, product development had been done on a vertical-specific basis. But to accelerate its growth, the company needs to look for best practices and develop products that can work for multiple verticals.\n\nThat job falls to Bell, who will now be working on all seven sites in the company\u2019s portfolio. \u201cWhat Melissa\u2019s role symbolizes is, we\u2019re not letting 1,000 flowers bloom, but let seven flowers bloom,\u201d Brundrett said.\n\n\u2018A pass to be curious\u2019\n\nBell\u2019s path to journalism was somewhat accidental. She comes from a long line of lawyers, and after attending Georgetown, she planned to go to law school. She moved to New York, where she worked as a legal assistant at a law firm.\n\nThen, 9/11 struck. Bell was overwhelmed by the tragedy and feeling powerless to help. Bell\u2019s eyes water at the memory. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really dealt with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt so unuseful; it was so futile.\u201d She quit her job a year later and left New York for a string of odd jobs. She waitressed at a racetrack, tended bar in Vail, backpacked around Eastern Europe.\n\nBell\u2019s parents weren\u2019t thrilled, and eventually, at her mother\u2019s suggestion, Bell applied and went to journalism school at Northwestern. She realized she wanted to do something that connected with people on a personal level, and telling stories offered a way to do that. At Northwestern, she threw herself into the program. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a pass to be curious.\u201d\n\nBell ended up in India through the school\u2019s global journalism program. There she was hired by Raju Narisetti, then a Wall Street Journal vet and now svp of strategy at News Corp, to work on Mint, a new financial newspaper based in Delhi. She later followed him to the Washington Post. Daily life in Delhi \u2014 dealing with landlords, the daily commute \u2014 is a hassle, and Narisetti said it took its toll on Bell, as it did for the rest of the staff. \u201cIt was a pretty grueling work-life balance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were moments my Kleenex box would come in handy.\u201d\n\nBut Bell had a \u201csunny California disposition\u201d and enthusiasm for trying new things, so Narisetti sent her to Milan to help test out a new CMS for Mint called M\u00e9thode. \u201cHaving seen her embrace a new CMS back in 2006 and not lose her cool or all her usual skepticism of a traditional journalist, it doesn\u2019t surprise me she\u2019s at the center of a technology role at Vox,\u201d he said. Bell has more than toughened up; the Post was a stressful environment, having just come through the recession and now trying to integrate its print and digital sides. She discovered punching a boxing bag was a great way to deal with the stress, and it\u2019s still her preferred form of exercise today.\n\nFinding her voice\n\nWith Bell having moved into a back-end role at the Post, much of the spotlight during the launch of Vox.com shone on its high-profile blogger, Klein. Around then, the media critic Emily Bell included Vox.com in a Guardian post criticizing the surge in digital journalism for being \u201cled by white men.\u201d\n\nAlthough Bell claims she prefers to be \u201cin the shadows,\u201d she said the incident nonetheless caused her to reflect on sexism in media. Bell said she thought back to instances where she felt ignored in meetings. Was it because of her gender or just that her idea was no good? (That she\u2019s \u201cincredibly nervous\u201d talking to large groups could be a factor.) \u201cSexism can be very subtle,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s something we need to pay attention to.\u201d She has also begun speaking up more about diversity. Today, she talks about making Vox Media a place where differences are welcomed, not just in gender but things like race, age and ideology. \u201cI realize I do have a responsibility to women I work with, women I don\u2019t work with,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s also concentrating on fostering connections that can grow the company overall. Traditional media companies grew by creating sprawling portfolios that long operated in silos. That might have served them in the past, but today\u2019s digital publishing economy requires companies to collaborate if they\u2019re going to scale audiences. Vox Media may have the benefit of starting with a clean slate, but its challenge isn\u2019t dissimilar.\n\nBell believes that the technology behind the editorial product is key to Vox Media\u2019s growth in a world where media brands increasingly live on others\u2019 platforms. In her new corporate role as vp of growth and analytics, she\u2019s continuing to embed product developer teams with the company\u2019s newsrooms. She plans to do the same with growth employees, the company\u2019s term for what might be called audience development elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where from an audience, staffing, revenue standpoint, we\u2019ve grown so much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe biggest danger is that we\u2019re not working toward the same goals. \u2026 If [we\u2019re] not working on a similar path, we\u2019re leaving readers and money on the table.\u201d\n\nFor now, at least, back at the hack week, things look like they\u2019re on the right path. Over at a whiteboard, there\u2019s Eric Simon, a baseball blogger for SB Nation who now splits his time between editorial and product. At the hack week, he was working on coming up with a new way to present data. Bell\u2019s hope is that Vox Media holds on to the fluid culture that lets people like Simon cross over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that always attracted me about Vox Media,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pick sides.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Melissa Bell is the woman Vox Media is turning to to scale its editorial content.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Digiday", "description": "Melissa Bell is the woman Vox Media is turning to to scale its editorial content.", "title": "The rapid rise of Vox Media's Melissa Bell: An explainer - Digiday", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MelissaBell-alt-782x436.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-06T10:31:10+00:00", "url": "http://digiday.com/publishers/unusual-talents-vox-medias-melissa-bell/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Digiday", "description": "Melissa Bell is the woman Vox Media is turning to to scale its editorial content.", "creator": "@lmoses", "image": {"src": "http://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MelissaBell-banner2.jpg"}, "title": "The rapid rise of Vox Media's Melissa Bell: An explainer - Digiday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "pocket-site-verification": "932353a3a368a0b64dfdf51752d547", "fb": {"admins": 1131300165, "pages": 74268994896}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digiday", "section": "Publishers", "published_time": "2015-07-06T00:05:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T10:31:10+00:00", "author": "www.facebook.com/lucia.moses.7"}, "google-site-verification": "3mtok71LLf0AszOd2xNLE9pjOn4recMdVehRka2qcDs", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Bell\u2019s hope is that Vox Media holds on to the fluid culture that lets people like Simon cross over.\nIt\u2019s hack week at Vox Media, and Melissa Bell is in her element.\nVox Media may have the benefit of starting with a clean slate, but its challenge isn\u2019t dissimilar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that always attracted me about Vox Media,\u201d she said.\nStaying close to the editorial product, she believes, will better inform what she does on the product side."}
