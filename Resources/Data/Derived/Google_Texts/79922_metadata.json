Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), who sponsored the amendment, said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d with the vote, accusing Republicans of putting \u201cpolitics ahead of national security.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Information Technology Modernization Fund would have gone toward upgrading the government\u2019s woefully outdated networks, which hackers have repeatedly infiltrated over the last year, pilfering millions of government workers\u2019 personal data, even President Obama\u2019s private schedule.\n\nLieu said that fixing these systems, \u201cwhich are both hard to secure and expensive to maintain, should be an approach both sides of the aisle can agree on.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, Republicans on the Budget Committee rejected my amendment,\u201d he added.\n\nThe modernization fund was just one component of the White House\u2019s major cyber push in its annual budget request. The administration called for more than $5 billion in new funding across the government to strengthen cyber defenses.\n\nThe boost would put federal cyber spending at more than $19 billion, a 35 percent increase over last year\u2019s allotment.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stand idly by and let our national security be endangered by inaction and underfunding,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lieu amendment was one of 29 Democratic edits offered during the nine-hour markup. All were rejected.\n\nWhile the panel easily approved its budget, the trillion-dollar proposal could fall short on the House floor if the 40-member House Freedom Caucus doesn't support the measure.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
