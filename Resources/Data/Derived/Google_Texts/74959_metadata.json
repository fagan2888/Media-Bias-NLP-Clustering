National Democratic leaders endorsing this anti-Christian discrimination show that America\u2019s founding freedom is in grave danger, as they move a bill to abolish RFRA\u2019s protections.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) requires employers to cover \u201cpreventive care.\u201d Reportedly against the advice of even pro-abortion Catholics like former White House Chief of Staff William Daley, President Barack Obama authorized a federal regulation interpreting \u201cpreventive care\u201d to include types of contraceptives that induce abortion.\n\nOn June 30 in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Breitbart News reported in detail how the Supreme Court held 5-to-4 that at least some types of corporations can assert religious-liberty rights, which is hardly surprising since most churches are corporations.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote for the Court that the contraceptive mandate violates RFRA for those who object to abortion, since that regulation is not the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling public interest.\n\nHobby Lobby was about abortion, not birth control. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t about access to abortion; it was about whether a Christian employer who objects to abortion has a right not to pay for the abortion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unsurprising the Left has been apoplectic over the decision, the viciousness and vitriol of liberals\u2019 reactions are sobering.\n\nA prime example of this hostility is seen in a Salon magazine article lambasting the decision, which reads:\n\nThe hyper religious conservatives on the bench of the nation\u2019s highest court, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, see the federal government as being controlled by \u201csecular humanists\u201d who wish to make war against the purity of the Christian belief system. Like the 89 million Americans who count themselves as evangelicals, they seek total cultural and political domination.\n\nTo any reasonable person (which evidently excludes the wild-eyed anti-Christian zealots at Salon), there is not a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, religious or otherwise. Chief Justice John Roberts is a moderate conservative at best, as seen in more than a dozen cases over the past nine years, most notably his creating a massive and unprecedented federal taxing power to save Obamacare in NFIB v. Sebelius.\n\nMeanwhile Justice Anthony Kennedy is a strict moderate whose opinions are sometimes in blatant contradiction to the Catholic faith. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he was the fifth and deciding vote to reaffirm the holding from Roe v. Wade that the Constitution includes an invisible right to abortion. His rulings advancing the LGBT social agenda\u2013most recently striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the 2013 case U.S. v. Windsor\u2013necessarily reject Catholic teaching on the nature, purpose, and public-policy justifications of marriage, all of which were presented to the Court in various legal briefs.\n\nBeyond that, Kennedy has been consistently moderate throughout his tenure on the Supreme Court. Among many examples that could be given, he was the fifth vote: (1) to embrace liberal global warming arguments in Massachusetts v. EPA, (2) to reject the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause\u2019s limits on federal drug laws in Gonzales v. Raich, (3) to abolish not just the death penalty but even life imprisonment for even heinous and depraved murders if the criminal was seventeen years old (and thus not an adult) in Miller v. Alabama, and (4) conferring full habeas corpus rights on enemy military combatants captured on foreign battlefields at war against the United States in Boumediene v. Bush.\n\nKennedy reaffirmed his non-conservative bona fides again just days before Hobby Lobby was handed down. On June 26, he was the fifth vote with the liberals in NLRB v. Noel Canning, which narrowly held Obama\u2019s recess appointments were unconstitutional because the president has no such power during Senate adjournments of less than ten days. Kennedy refused to join the four more conservative justices\u2019 concurring opinion\u2013which would have made it the majority opinion with full force of law\u2013that the Constitution only allows presidents to make recess appointments during the short period of the annual year-end recess, and even then only for vacancies that arise during that short recess.\n\nSo there is no right-wing cabal on the Supreme Court, Christian or otherwise. Conservatives of all faiths\u2013including not just observant Christians but also Jews, Muslims, and others\u2013are painfully reminded several times each year on a variety of issues that the current Supreme Court is moderate, not conservative.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t fit the media\u2019s narrative. Other media outlets also betray their strong anti-Christian bias, albeit without the hateful rhetoric exhibited by Salon.\n\nAt The Huffington Post, Ronald Lindsay follows a chilling line of inquiry in response to Hobby Lobby, writing, \u201cthe question needs to be asked: Is it appropriate to have six Catholic justices on the Supreme Court?\u201d HuffPo laments \u201chow closely the majority adheres to Catholic teaching.\u201d\n\nAgain, if that were true, then Roe v. Wade would have been overruled in 1992, so abortion would again be a state issue instead of a constitutional right. Moreover, every provision of DOMA would still be on the books, and traditional marriage would not currently be in danger in the courts.\n\nHuffPo\u2019s ignorance regarding the relevant theology is seen in conflating Catholic doctrine with the Evangelical and Mennonite beliefs of the actual plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby and its companion case, Conestoga\u2013none of whom were Catholic. HuffPo claims Alito was using \u201cCatholic teaching about \u2018complicity'\u201d to say that forcing an employer to pay for abortion violates their religious faith.\n\nInstead, it is the Protestant theology of the Green family that owns Hobby Lobby and the Hahn family that owns Conestoga Wood Specialties that led those owners to object to financing abortion. And the belief that facilitating an immoral act makes you complicit in the act is found in many faiths, not just Christian.\n\nEven more alarming than the media\u2019s subordinating religious liberty (which is in the Constitution) to abortion (which is not in the Constitution) is that leading Democrats\u2013one of whom may become America\u2019s next president\u2013are pursuing this same radical agenda that allows no place for people of faith to peacefully live out their faith in their daily business life.\n\nThe top Democrat in the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), responded to Hobby Lobby with a statement including, \u201cthe Supreme Court took an outrageous step against the rights of America\u2019s women, setting a dangerous precedent\u2026\u201d\n\nRFRA was passed unanimously\u2013without a single dissenting vote\u2013in the U.S. House, passed the Senate 97-3, and then was signed into law by a pro-abortion Democrat, President Bill Clinton. Nonetheless, the Senate\u2019s current ruler, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), vowed, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something about the Hobby Lobby legislation we need to correct.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s happening. Democrats are advancing S. 1696, entitled \u201cThe Women\u2019s Health Protection Act,\u201d to feed the White House\u2019s narrative of a war on women. The bill was filed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) last November, and now it\u2019s being moved in committee in an effort to create federal law that would supersede anyone\u2019s rights of religious conscience not to participate in abortion.\n\nEven if this bill does not become law during Obama\u2019s presidency, the threat will evidently continue. The frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that Americans have a religious-liberty right not to participate in abortion. \u201cThis is a really bad, slippery slope,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThis anti-Christian extremism would grind into the dirt no fewer than four provisions in the U.S. Constitution, as well as a federal statute. The First Amendment includes a fundamental right to the free exercise of religion, which government cannot abridge. If RFRA were abolished, observant Christians could still raise a defense under the Free Exercise Clause against the Obamacare mandate.\n\nSecond, the First Amendment includes the Establishment Clause right that the government cannot coerce any person to participate in a government-created religion. Third, the Free Speech Clause secures a fundamental right to speak and express religious beliefs. And fourth\u2013relevant to the criticism of having six Catholics on the Supreme Court\u2013the Religious Test Clause requires that the federal government can never deny any person any public office\u2013such as being a federal judge\u2013because of that person\u2019s religious beliefs.\n\nIronically, although there are 90 million self-professed Evangelical Christians in America, not a single Evangelical has sat on the Supreme Court in multiple decades. Don\u2019t expect those on the Left making anti-Catholic statements to call for the president to fill the next vacancy on the Court with a devout Evangelical in the name of diversity.\n\nDemocrats believe they can use Hobby Lobby to make birth control an issue in 2014. Instead, conservative Republicans need to make sure that religious liberty and the future of the Supreme Court are central issues in 2016.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal analyst for Breitbart News.
