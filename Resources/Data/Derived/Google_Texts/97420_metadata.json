Richard Burr, R-N.C., Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich.\n\nThe first bicameral proposal of the 114th Congress calls for the outright repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, and with that, the individual mandate to buy insurance or pay a fine.\n\nIt provides for targeted tax credits to individuals and families up to 300 percent above the poverty line to encourage people to buy plans in the market place.\n\nIt also allows insurers to sell plans across state lines and caps the amount of monetary damages that can be awarded in medical malpractice litigation.\n\nLike the Affordable Care Act, dependents are able to stay on their parents\u2019 healthcare plans until they\u2019re 26, and no one can be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions -- although this plan calls for a specific \u2018continuous coverage\u2019 protection where individuals moving from one plan to another cannot be denied.\n\nGone, however, are age-rating ratios banning insurance companies from charging older Americans more than three times what they charge younger individuals. The new federal baseline would be five-to-one, essentially lowering costs for younger, lower risk consumers.\n\nTo pay for it, Burr, Hatch and Upton propose taxing the value of health insurance plans above $30,000 a year as regular income.\n\nIf these proposals sound familiar it\u2019s because most of them are. Many are based on an outline pitched last year by Burr, Hatch, and former Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.\n\nAn aide familiar with the plan said one of the reasons there are no massive changes is they thought they had a decent product last year based on feedback they\u2019ve gotten.\n\nEven if it\u2019s viable don\u2019t expect a vote -- in either chamber -- anytime soon. Aides are very quick to point out that this should not be hailed as the \u201cGOP Plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just one plan, as one adviser put it, and more input from governors and legislators will be needed before anything moves forward. Even hearings haven\u2019t yet been discussed.\n\nSame old song and dance we've been seeing for years, critics say.\n\nStill, pressure for viable alternatives is increasing.\n\nThere currently is a case about to come before the Supreme Court challenging ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies for private insurance for people who don\u2019t have access to it through their jobs. If that provision is struck down, millions of consumers could drop coverage.\n\nA larger bill, still, will almost certainly wait until there is a new occupant in the White House.\n\nOne aide said, as the president is not repealing his bill, Republicans are putting together a credible plan \u2013 and preparing for 2017.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.
