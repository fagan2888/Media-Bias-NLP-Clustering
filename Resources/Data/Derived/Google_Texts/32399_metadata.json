But shaping the discourse\u2014so that no whichever party wins, so that whichever candidate prevails, the discussion defaults to a narrow set of \u201coptions\u201d\u2014matters more.\n\nThe management of the debate by powerful interests explains why a Congress that cannot seem to do anything useful will this week vote for the forty-first time to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Why \u201centitlement reforms\u201d that the American people do not want remain \u201con the table.\u201d Why Washington insiders keep proposing the same tax breaks for the rich, free trade deals and austerity schemes. Why state legislators talk about restricting the right to choose rather than expanding public education.\n\nFreedom Partners is the latest of the many Koch creations that shape the discourse and the politics of the United States\u2014not always with success, but with a consistency that assures long-term influence. Koch Industries is quick to point out that \u201cFreedom Partners is a non-profit, non-partisan business league\u201d that \u201coperates independently of Koch Industries.\u201d Yes, but three of the group\u2019s five directors list Koch connections in their biographies and a fourth is one of Charles Koch\u2019s close friends. In addition to the Kochs, the major donors to Freedom Partners, which raised $256 million during the 2012 election cycle, are reportedly the wealthy attendees at the secretive policy summits that have become command-performance events for prominent Republicans such as House Budget Committee chairman Ryan and House majority leader Eric Cantor.\n\n\u201cOur members are proud to be part of [Freedom Partners],\u201d the group\u2019s president, Marc Short, told Politico. Ad Policy\n\nNo, they\u2019re not.\n\nIn the same conversation where he spoke about the \u201cproud\u201d Freedom Partners \u201cmembers,\u201d Short refused to reveal their identities. And he refused to say how much money the various billionaires and millionaires are chipping in to buy a piece of the American dream\u2014except to note that the top donor gave around $25 million, so it\u2019s not all Koch money. Which begs a question: Who else is buying?\n\nAnd another question: How do groups like this get away with so much secrecy?\n\nOrganized under section 501(c)6 of the Tax Code, Freedom Partners operates as a trade association or \u201cbusiness league\u201d\u2014as in the National Football League.\n\nTrade associations that utilize this section of the Tax Code must reveal the recipients of their \u201cgrants.\u201d But they do not generally have to reveal the sources of those grants because the lists of donors they file with the IRS are not considered public documents.\n\nWhich brings us back to Edward Ryan.\n\nThe populist judge closed his great rant of 1873 by saying: \u201cThe question will arise and arise in your day, though perhaps not fully in mine: Which shall rule, wealth or man? Which shall lead, money or intellect. Who shall fill public stations, educated and patriotic freemen or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much question that wealth rules the day. While banks and Wall Street insiders get bailouts, great American cities are driven into bankruptcy.\n\nThere\u2019s not much question that money trumps intellect. What else could explain the focus of official Washington on billionaire-backed schemes that would \u201cfix the debt\u201d by lowering tax rates for billionaires while at the same time imposing \u201cchained-CPI\u201d cuts on retirees with fixed incomes?\n\nThere are still a few educated and patriotic freemen, like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (who warns that the Koch brothers are shaping a \u201cplutocracy\u201d that is \u201cof the rich, by the rich and for the rich\u201d), and there are educated and patriotic freewomen, like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan provide daily confirmation that the feudal serfs of corporate capital have occupied public stations. And that occupation is not merely a Republican project; in Washington and across the country there are Democrats who preach privatizations, austerity cuts and policies that will only result in a redistribution of the wealth upward.\n\nSo we have answered most of Edward Ryan\u2019s questions.\n\nBut they only point to new questions:\n\nWho is paying to create a \u201cmoney power\u201d politics where wealth rules, money trumps intellect and feudal serfs of corporate capital occupy public stations?\n\nWhy are they allowed to operate in secret?\n\nAnd what are we the people going to do about it?\n\nJohn Nichols and Bob McChesney are the authors of Dollarocracy: How the Money and Media Election Complex is Destroying America (Nation Books).
