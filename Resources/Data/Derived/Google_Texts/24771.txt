SAN DIEGO (AP) — Jamie Lee Curtis took her first slice out of Comic-Con.

The veteran actress made her inaugural appearance at the pop-culture convention Sunday during a panel for FX’s “American Horror Story” and Fox’s “Scream Queens,” the upcoming horror whodunit starring Curtis as the cutthroat dean of a college where a serial killer is on the loose.

Why hasn’t the star of the “Halloween” series ever attended Comic-Con? “I’ve been selling yogurt that makes you (expletive),” joked the Activia spokeswoman.

“American Horror Story” and “Scream Queens” mastermind Ryan Murphy told the 6,500 fans gathered inside the San Diego Convention Center that he didn’t want to make “Scream Queens” if Curtis didn’t agree to play Cathy Munsch, a college administrator who takes aim at a posh and exclusive sorority on campus in the show’s first episode.
