Sioux Fall, SD

It's been a busy week for the Storm Center.

Rain, snow - perhaps you even heard some thunder this week. Yes, KELOLAND saw it all. That whole system has moved on but how much precipitation did we get?



Rain totals varied across the region. Some areas receive little-to-no measurable amounts.

Other areas in KELOLAND saw over half an inch of rain. The Worthington area had measurements over 1 inch.

The rain is gone and it looks like we're headed for a sunny weekend. So if you can, get out and enjoy the pleasant spring weather before the next round of showers next week.
