And at his side the whole time was Bob Zmuda, Kaufman\u2019s best friend, writer and partner in crime. The pair\u2019s misadventures were showcased in Milos Forman\u2019s 1999 biopic, \u201cMan on the Moon,\u201d which starred Jim Carrey as Kaufman, supposedly the final word on Kaufman\u2019s life and death, but then again, nothing related to Andy Kaufman is ever that easy to figure out.\n\nMaybe that is why 30 years after his death in Los Angeles of cancer, Mr. Zmuda and Kaufman\u2019s longtime girlfriend, Lynne Margulies, have written \u201cAndy Kaufman: The Truth Finally,\u201d a book that promises to pull back the curtain on the real life of the bizarro comedy genius.\n\nQuestion: When did you and Kaufman first meet?\n\nSEE ALSO: Jolie\u2019s directing shines in \u2018Unbroken\u2019\n\nAnswer:Andy and I first met in 1974 in New York City at Budd Friedman\u2019s Improv. At the time it was the only comedy club in America. The club was packed with future comedy legends: Richard Lewis, Richard Belzer, Jay Leno, Larry David. Comedy was just beginning to take off. Also there in the room was Andy Kaufman.\n\nQ: What do you remember about the first time you met him.\n\nA: Andy showed up in the club about an hour and half before the show and hung around the bar outside the main room. Nobody knew who he was or that he going on stage. He was playing the \u201cForeign Man\u201d character, carrying a suitcase, pretending he had just stepped off a Greyhound bus at 42nd Street. He was asking Budd Friedman, the owner, if he could go onstage in that broken foreign accent \u2014 just loud enough that people in the bar could overhear what was happening. Budd said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry we have auditions on the 3rd of every month. Come back then.\u201d Kaufman would beg, \u201cPlease, this is my dream to be performer in New York City.\u201d Budd said, \u201cI can\u2019t. Sorry.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019 will continue TV traditions\n\nThen the crowd would move in from the bar to the main room and see the show. Budd Friedman comes out and says, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we usually end the show at this point, but I don\u2019t know if you saw the man who came in earlier asking to be onstage. We normally don\u2019t do this, but I\u2019m gonna let him up tonight. I don\u2019t know what he does. His name is Mr. Andy Kaufman.\u201d\n\nAndy comes up onstage, and everybody in the place believes that this guy is from God knows what country and just arrived in New York. He starts doing these impressions in that foreign voice. \u201cI\u2019d like to do the Archie Bunker. \u2018Meathead.\u2019\u201d Just terrible. \u201cI\u2019d like to do the Ronald Reagan. \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Ronald Reagan.\u2019\u201d The audience starts laughing because it\u2019s so bad. Andy just lights up, and each impression gets worse and worse. But the audience is howling because this guy is such an idiot.\n\nThen he realizes that you are not laughing with him but at him. It turns real serious. He starts crying. We felt so bad. It\u2019s quite the psycho drama.\n\nFinally, Andy says, \u201cI would like to do the one last impression. The Elvis Presley.\u201d He turns his back to the audience. Suddenly the music from \u201c2001\u201d plays. The lights start changing. All this production. Andy changes into a costume and combs his hair like Elvis, turns around to the audience, and he looks like Elvis.\n\nInstead of that terrible foreign voice, he does a drop-dead, spot-on Elvis impression. The place goes nuts. Standing ovation. The audience in the palm of his hand. I was awestruck.\n\nI waited around after the show. About a half-hour later I see him coming out dragging all these props \u2014 conga drums, a film projector and lights. I wonder is this an act or just some foreign guy who does a solid Elvis. I see he\u2019s loading a car. So much for the just-off-the-bus story. He sees me and calls out as the Foreign Man: \u201cExcuse me, can you help me? I have a very bad back.\u201d I started loading all this heavy stuff into his car. He closes the trunk and says, \u201cDank you very much\u201d as Foreign Man, then \u201cSucker!\u201d in his regular voice. Then, he drives away.\n\nThat was my first meeting with Andy Kaufman.\n\nQ: How did you go from that to becoming Andy\u2019s writer and co-conspirator?\n\nA: I worked as the bartender at the Improv at night. During the day I start working for the screenwriter Norman Wexler, who wrote \u201cSerpico\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Fever.\u201d\n\nWexler was completely nuts. He would strap tape recorders on me. Then he and I would hit the streets of Manhattan with a suitcase full of cash \u2014 around 30,000 bucks. He would then start confrontations with real-life New Yorkers \u2014 everyone from cab drivers to gangsters. He would get into arguments with people to the point where they wanted to kill him. And I would be recording all this stuff. These people would get so upset they would attack Wexler. My job was to jump in and pay them off before they actually killed us. Wexler turned the recordings into scripted dialogue in his movies.\n\nAndy wanted to hear Wexler stories. We started talking and became buddies. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d started I wrote some of his pieces for SNL. One thing led to another, and his career took off. He said, \u201cI\u2019d like to make you my permanent writer.\u201d He moved me to Hollywood.\n\nQ: Most comics live for the audiences love and approval, but Andy wasn\u2019t wired that way?\n\nA: That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like to call him a comedian. The only reason he was called a comedian was because he worked in comedy clubs. That label meant he was supposed to get laughs all of the time. Andy did get laughs a lot of the time, but many other times he got the audience to get angry, to throw things at him, to walk out. To him it was all the same. He just wanted a real reaction. Nowadays a lot of people like to call him the first performance artist. I like to call him a behavioral scientist. He was really into exploring human behavior and the dynamic between the audience and the performer. He was the first \u201cpunk comedian.\u201d\n\nQ: This is your second book on Kaufman. Why write another book? And why now?\n\nA: Lynne Margulies, my co-writer on the book, called me up and said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s 30 years [since his death], and Andy\u2019s parents are now gone.\u201d We promised not to talk about things like Andy\u2019s sexuality. Andy was bisexual. He didn\u2019t want the info out there until both of his parents had died. Lynne said, \u201cNow we can talk about the things we were not allowed to.\u201d There has also been much controversy over the years as to whether Andy faked his death or not. Andy told Lynne he was gonna fake his death, and she asked, \u201cHow long are you gonna be gone for? A year? Two?\u201d Andy said to Lynne, \u201cIf I was a little boy about it, it would be a year or two. If I was a man, it would be 30 years.\u201d That is what he said. Of all the hoaxes he ever pulled off, this was the only one he gave a timetable to.\n\nFinally, 30 years later, it is time to be totally truthful about Andy.\n\nQ: Do you really believe he faked his death?\n\nA: I know he faked his death! I worked with him on it for three years! Working for Andy was like working for Houdini. You guarded these illusions of the mind with your life. I couldn\u2019t tell my wife, couldn\u2019t tell my mother. When you went to see Andy Kaufman, you would leave his shows wondering if what you saw was real or not. That was the benchmark that we strived for.\n\nQ: If he came back, how would you know it was really him?\n\nA: I would know. You had a good friend for that many years. You know. He\u2019s gonna look different. Probably bald. Put on some weight. But if I talked to him about personal things I would know within a minute if it was Kaufman.\n\nQ: What if he doesn\u2019t show up before the end of 2014?\n\nA: He said 30 years, but it could be 30 years and six months or 31 years. I have put certain carrots in the book enticing him on why he should come back. Huka, one of the biggest concert promoters in the country, has put up $2 million and all Andy Kaufman has to do is appear onstage for 90 seconds. He doesn\u2019t have to perform. Just come out, take a bow, wave to the audience and that\u2019s it. Two million dollars in his pocket.\n\nQ: Does there come a point where if he doesn\u2019t show up you will stop believing he is alive?\n\nA: Not me, because I worked on the hoax of him faking his death with him.\n\nQ: If he doesn\u2019t appear, how do we ever find out the truth?\n\nA: There is a simple way to figure that out: Get a court order and get a backhoe out to Bethel Cemetery in Great Neck, New York. It would take about 20 minutes to dig up the casket, pop it open, and take some hair and bones samples. Within two week the world will know if that is Andy Kaufman in the grave or not.\n\nQ: Has your life\u2019s work been preserving Andy Kaufman\u2019s memory and building his legacy?\n\nA: It is my legacy too. I was his writer and stayed behind the scenes. Because part of the illusion we were creating was that he was mad as a hatter. So how could a total madman have a writer? These were intricate hoaxes that were perpetuated on the American public. We pulled them off together. He was Picasso. I happened to help him mix some paint.\n\nQ: You also started the Comic Relief charity. What is that organization up to?\n\nA: We just had a big shakeup with the death of Robin Williams. We are still reeling from that. Before that we were in negotiations with ABC to do another prime-time \u201cComic Relief\u201d special. Those plans went away. I don\u2019t think you can ask any comedian to go onstage between Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal to try and fill a void that can never be filled.\n\nQ: Ultimately, what is Kaufman\u2019s legacy?\n\nA: Andy\u2019s legacy is certainly one of the true artist who had the ultimate freedom to do whatever he wanted in art. He taught us to be true to your vision, no matter what.
