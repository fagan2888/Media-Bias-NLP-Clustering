Now the head of Marvel, Spidey\u2019s publisher, has his own radioactive, problem: Donald Trump.\n\nMarvel Entertainment CEO Isaac \u201cIke\u201d Perlmutter is under fire for donating $1 million to the veterans\u2019 fundraiser the Republican presidential frontrunner held last Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa, as part of his boycott of the Fox News GOP debate.\n\nRelated: The Trump-Cruz Food Fight We\u2019ve All Been Waiting for Is On\n\nPerlmutter is \"one of the great, great men of our country in terms of business and talent,\" Trump said during the event. The former reality TV star said the rally raised $6 million for the country\u2019s veterans; the money will go directly to his foundation and he will then cut checks for various veteran causes.\n\n\"The Perlmutters are thrilled to support their friend Donald Trump in his efforts to help veterans,\" a Perlmutter spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe donation sparked a major outcry on Twitter. Liberal-leaning news site Salon called on fans to boycott Marvel books and movies because of Trump\u2019s past statements about women and his controversial anti-immigrant stances, including his calls for ban all Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nFans are condemning Perlmutter, who is estimated to be worth around $1.5 billion, as a supervillain akin to the Red Skull, a Nazi agent and the nemesis of Captain America, at a time when the comic book publisher, now owned by Disney, is trying to become more diverse through characters like Ms. Marvel, a Muslim teenage girl.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes a Knee As Clock Winds Down in Iowa\n\nPerlmutter and his wife previously gave $2 million to Sen. Marco Rubio (FL), another 2016 GOP presidential hopeful.\n\nBut while that donation raised few, if any, eyebrows, the controversy surrounding Perlmutter\u2019s decision to chip in for Trump\u2019s fundraiser seems to have legs, with the Taiwanese News Service sending up the act of charity in one of its trademark videos.\n\nThe clip features Cap and Iron Man rounding up immigrants and kicking them into the Negative Zone, an antimatter universe depicted regularly in the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe video asks if people are \u201cwondering what they\u2019ll do about that Mexican Spider-Man,\u201d showing Miles Morales, an African-American Spider-Man from an alternate dimension, dressed in a sombrero.\n\nThe spoof likens Perlmutter to Thanos, who will be the \u201cBig Bad\u201d in the next two Avengers movies, and concludes with Trump wearing Uncle Sam regalia and the Infinity Gauntlet, the cosmic item that has been a common thread throughout Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "High-school student Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and became your frien", "title": "The Stranger Than Fiction Trump Controversy You Didn\u2019t Know About", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/01/Stranger-Fiction-Trump-Controversy-You-Didn-t-Know-About", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_thanos.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/01/Stranger-Fiction-Trump-Controversy-You-Didn-t-Know-About", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_thanos.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "High-school student Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and became your frien", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Now the head of Marvel, Spidey\u2019s publisher, has his own radioactive, problem: Donald Trump.\n\"The Perlmutters are thrilled to support their friend Donald Trump in his efforts to help veterans,\" a Perlmutter spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter.\nHigh-school student Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and became your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\nRelated: Trump Takes a Knee As Clock Winds Down in IowaPerlmutter and his wife previously gave $2 million to Sen.
