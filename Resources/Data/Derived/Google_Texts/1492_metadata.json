(AP) - It was a truly senior prom for residents of Hilltop House\u2019s assisted living facility.\n\nThe dance, organized by two students from Sherando High School, brought smiles to the faces of many residents and took them back to their school days.\n\n\u201cWe picked a \u201850s theme so they could relate to when they were teenagers,\u201d said Lacey Johnson, 17, co-organizer of the event. \u201cA lot of people stereotype nursing homes as a not-fun place to be. That\u2019s one reason I wanted to do this.\u201d\n\nShe and Olivia Scott, 18, members of the school\u2019s Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), planned the dance for a project that will be judged at a FCCLA conference in Virginia Beach in April.\n\nLacey said she was inspired to organize an event that benefited members of Hilltop House after she went there for an event with the National Honor Society (NHS).\n\n\u201cI came here with the NHS a few months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the best thing that I\u2019ve ever done. I just got really attached to them.\u201d\n\nOlivia joined Lacey to help make her idea happen.\n\n\u201cShe needed a partner, so I just jumped in,\u201d Olivia said.\n\nAshley Robinson, teacher-adviser for Sherando\u2019s FCCLA, said she was impressed with the work Lacey and Olivia have done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cLacey and Olivia have been so into this. They\u2019ve been planning this for weeks.\u201d\n\nWearing poodle skirts, bow ties and other fashions that fit with the decorations, FCCLA and NHS members danced with residents to music like Chubby Checker\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Twist Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reminds us of the good old days,\u201d said Nancy Thomas, 86.\n\n\u201cI love this, and I don\u2019t even dance,\u201d said Gerry Green, 94. \u201cJust the whole outfit. The whole place is a good thing.\u201d\n\nGreen was on her feet and dancing with the high-schoolers for more than a few songs.\n\nAnd she wasn\u2019t the only one enjoying the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cI look at (the other residents) right now, and they look brighter than they do all the time,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey need something like that. I need something like that.\u201d\n\nEmma Jane Holliea, 89, agreed that everyone was benefiting from the excitement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really gets everyone moving. Even if we\u2019re in a chair, we\u2019re still moving,\u201d she added, tapping her feet to the music.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Winchester Star, http://www.winchesterstar.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was a truly senior prom for residents of Hilltop House's assisted living facility.", "Author": "STEPHEN NIELSEN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It was a truly senior prom for residents of Hilltop House\u2019s assisted living facility.", "title": "\u2018Senior\u2019 prom has residents rockin\u2019 to the oldies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/4/senior-prom-has-residents-rockin-to-the-oldies/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/04/5fa05029a9e8760e720f6a706700ca39.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/04/5fa05029a9e8760e720f6a706700ca39.jpg", "title": "\u2018Senior\u2019 prom has residents rockin\u2019 to the oldies", "description": "It was a truly senior prom for residents of Hilltop House's assisted living facility.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "WINCHESTER, Va.
