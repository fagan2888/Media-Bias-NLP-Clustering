Consider that national party chairman Reince Priebus was launching a Hispanic Advisory Council in Virginia on the same day that House Republicans passed bills to speed up deportations of unaccompanied Central American children and young people brought without papers to the United States years ago. Consider as well that as Priebus was reaching out to black Americans at the National Urban League and the National Association of Black Journalists last week, House Republicans voted to sue the country\u2019s first black president for alleged abuse of executive authority. Some in the GOP hope \u2014 and others fear \u2014 that the lawsuit is a prelude to impeachment. The autopsy Priebus commissioned after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama was unsparing in its message: The party desperately needed to build relations with minorities and back comprehensive immigration reform that offers \u201cpositive solutions\u201d (PDF) responsive to the concerns of Latino, Asian and black communities. Priebus is trying to follow that script. But as last week\u2019s behavior demonstrates, the House is determined to thwart him \u2014 and the party\u2019s future \u2014 by moving in the opposite direction.\n\nDownward trajectory\n\nGiven demographic realities, the choice for the GOP is (or should be) clear: Follow the post-Romney blueprint or lose elections indefinitely into the future. The cost of ignoring minorities and their concerns will be measurable not just in terms of presidential elections. There are also close House, Senate and gubernatorial races as soon as this fall in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and elsewhere that could hinge on Latino and black voter registration and turnout. The GOP\u2019s trajectory over the past decade, as traced in exit polls, should be cautionary. George W. Bush, with his \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d pitch and support for comprehensive immigration reform, won about 4 in 10 Hispanic votes in 2004 \u2014 a record for the party. Another strong backer of reform, 2008 nominee John McCain, won 35 percent. Romney, hostile to reform, dropped to 27 percent. All the while, Latinos were steadily growing as a share of the electorate \u2014 from 8 percent in 2004 to 9 percent in 2008 and 10 percent in 2012. Throughout all these phases, there has been substantial support among Republican legislators and governors for the young people known as Dreamers \u2014 children who were brought to the United States without papers, grew up here, graduated from high school and then, because of harsh immigration laws, found themselves unable to pursue a future in the only country they knew. More than half a million of these youths have applied for and received temporary renewable legal status under Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that defers deportation for children who arrived by 2007. House Republicans voted last week to kill that program \u2014 the price leaders paid to win conservative votes for a separate measure to bolster border security and change a 2008 law that entitles the unaccompanied Central American children who have recently flooded the border to an asylum hearing before they are sent home. The changes make it easier to deport them. There are at least three ways in which these so-called accomplishments are counterproductive. First of all, Republicans have moved the spotlight off Obama\u2019s problems \u2014 including his belated response to a border crisis that his administration was first warned about years ago and the risky executive steps he may take on his own, given congressional inaction on a larger immigration overhaul.\n\nThe House\u2019s most recent moves will excite the GOP base this year in elections the party would have won anyway, but alienate minority voters in the 2016 Senate and presidential races.\n\nSecond, they have showcased the GOP\u2019s inconsistencies, internal conflicts and empathy gap. Many in the party are blaming the influx of young Central Americans on DACA, but that\u2019s a dubious proposition, given that the surge was well underway before DACA began in June 2012. Some Republicans seem to be suggesting that DACA should be ended not on its merits but because it is being misrepresented by bad actors in other countries \u2014 in this case, coyotes, or human smugglers, drumming up business by deceitfully telling Central Americans that children will receive amnesty like those in the DACA program. Third, by broadcasting such unforgiving views on immigration, Republicans have mobilized a potentially huge opposition force. No one has more at stake than the young people in school and the military who, under GOP policies, would be unable to renew their residency permits and would have to return to the shadows. Beyond that, the GOP risks energizing the 62 percent (PDF) of Latinos who have an undocumented friend, relative or co-worker in the country. The issue is personal to them, and they follow it closely on Spanish-language media, where it is covered, as former Obama strategist David Plouffe put it Monday at a Politico Playbook event, \u201cas intensively as the Super Bowl is on ESPN.\u201d\n\nAlienating their own", "article_metadata": {"description": "Party chairman courts blacks and Latinos as House Republicans find new ways to alienate them", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/8/gop-immigration-racepoliticslatinos.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2014/8/gop-immigration-racepoliticslatinos/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.house_gop_a.1407340613192.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Party chairman courts blacks and Latinos as House Republicans find new ways to alienate them", "title": "OPINION: The GOP's mixed message to minorities"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2014/8/gop-immigration-racepoliticslatinos/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.house_gop_a.1407340613192.jpg", "title": "OPINION: The GOP's mixed message to minorities", "description": "Party chairman courts blacks and Latinos as House Republicans find new ways to alienate them", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Politics, Republican Party, Immigration, Election 2014, Race & Ethnicity, Election 2016, U.S., Latino", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3075\"", "article_summary": "Third, by broadcasting such unforgiving views on immigration, Republicans have mobilized a potentially huge opposition force.\nThe cost of ignoring minorities and their concerns will be measurable not just in terms of presidential elections.\nGeorge W.
