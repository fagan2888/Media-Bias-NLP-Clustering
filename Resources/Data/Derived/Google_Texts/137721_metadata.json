(AP) - The start of Florida State\u2019s game Saturday was delayed because the basket at one end was too low.\n\nThen the Seminoles made it look too small.\n\nDwayne Bacon scored 23 points and Florida State overcame a slow start shooting at a defective hoop Saturday to rally past Florida Atlantic 64-59 in the Orange Bowl Classic.\n\nThe game started 40 minutes late because of a problem with the basket\u2019s height. Less than four minutes into the game, an attempted dunk by Florida State\u2019s Montay Brandon left the rim too low and at an angle, which caused a 15-minute delay.\n\nFlorida State shot 26 percent aiming at the troublesome hoop, and 50 percent at the other end in the second half.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame the rim,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cI just kept telling the shooter that we have on our team to keep shooting, one is going to fall. You just have to keep shooting.\u201d\n\nThe Seminoles (8-2) won their season-best fourth in a row. Florida Atlantic (2-9) has lost four consecutive games, all on the road.\n\n\u201cWe are here to change this program around,\u201d Owls second-year coach Michael Curry said. \u201cPlaying close is not going to be what FAU is about. But it also shows a lot of progress that we come out and play teams, especially on a neutral court. We are pleased with our guys\u2019 effort.\u201d\n\nBacon went 9 for 15 and was chosen the game\u2019s most valuable player. He had four of the Seminoles\u2019 10 steals, and their defensive pressure made the difference down the stretch.\n\nThe score was tied at 56 before Florida State took advantage of back-to-back steals to score twice in nine seconds. Malik Beasley hit a dunk on a breakaway, and Bacon made a steal on the inbound play and scored.\n\n\u201cWe got stops, big-time stops,\u201d Bacon said.\n\nTwo baskets by Xavier Rathan-Mayes helped seal the victory for the Seminoles, who sank their final five shots.\n\n\u201cWe made some adjustments at halftime, mentally and emotionally,\u201d coach Leonard Hamilton said.\n\nEven so, the Seminoles\u2019 point total was a season low and 22 below their season average. They shot a season-worst 2 for 14 from 3-point range.\n\nBeasley had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Rathan-Mayes had 12 points, four assists and three steals.\n\nMarquan Botley led the Owls with 13 points, and C.J. Turman had 10 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nThe game was played at the Florida Panthers\u2019 arena, where hockey is the primary sport and the baskets are seldom used. The Seminoles missed 11 of their first 12 attempts at the troublesome basket, with the only score coming because of goaltending.\n\nFlorida Atlanta shot 54 percent in the first half and 32 percent at the hoop that caused the two delays.\n\nFlorida State scored 11 consecutive points to tie the game at 44 on a 3-pointer by Rathan-Mayes. Beasley\u2019s three-point play gave the Seminoles their first lead at 47-45.\n\n___\n\nTIP-INS\n\nFlorida Atlantic: The Owls fell to 0-5 against Florida State. The teams last met in 1997.\n\nFlorida State: Junior Jarquez Smith took a blow to the head midway through the second half and sat out the rest of the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida State plays host to Charleston Southern on Monday.\n\nFlorida Atlantic plays at Hofstra on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The start of Florida State's game Saturday was delayed because the basket at one end was too low.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The start of Florida State\u2019s game Saturday was delayed because the basket at one end was too low.", "title": "Florida State rallies past Florida Atlantic 64-59", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/19/florida-state-rallies-past-florida-atlantic-64-59/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/19/florida_atlantic_florida_st_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/19/florida_atlantic_florida_st_basketball.jpeg", "description": "The start of Florida State's game Saturday was delayed because the basket at one end was too low.", "card": "summary", "title": "Florida State rallies past Florida Atlantic 64-59"}, "Author": "STEVEN WINE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Dwayne Bacon scored 23 points and Florida State overcame a slow start shooting at a defective hoop Saturday to rally past Florida Atlantic 64-59 in the Orange Bowl Classic.\nFlorida State shot 26 percent aiming at the troublesome hoop, and 50 percent at the other end in the second half.\nThe score was tied at 56 before Florida State took advantage of back-to-back steals to score twice in nine seconds.\nFlorida Atlantic (2-9) has lost four consecutive games, all on the road.\nFlorida Atlantic plays at Hofstra on Tuesday."}
