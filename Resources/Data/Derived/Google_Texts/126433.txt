KARL: We can acknowledge that that's not going to happen while Barack Obama is president, right?



CRUZ: Yes, I'll give you one scenario where it could. If there's one things that unifies politicians of both parties, you know, their top priority is preserving their own hide. And if enough Congressional Democrats realize they either stand with ObamaCare and lose, or they listen to the American people and have a chance at staying in office, that's the one scenario we could do it in 2015. If not, we'll do it in 2017.



KARL: So you honestly think there's a chance that you can get ObamaCare repealed, every word, as you say?



CRUZ: Every single word.



KARL: With Obama in the White House?



CRUZ: You know, what's funny, Jon, is the media treats that as a bizarre proposition.



KARL: Well, it is.



CRUZ: Because...



(CROSSTALK)



CRUZ: It is...



KARL: It is a bizarre proposition.



CRUZ: It is the most unpopular law in the country. Millions of people have lost their jobs, have lost their health care, have been forced into part-time work, have their premiums skyrocketing. And right now, Washington isn't listening to those people. That's how we win elections and that's also how we repeal ObamaCare.
