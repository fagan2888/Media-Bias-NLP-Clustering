Jan Brewer\u2019s veto of her state\u2019s anti-LGBTQ measure, the \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d\n\nThe conversation between Perkins and host Megyn Kelly was pretty canned, which is precisely what you get when you lob softball questions about discrimination at a homophobe. No surprise there.\n\nBut something interesting did happen during their exchange, and it\u2019s a point that has come up in a number of other interviews with supporters of the bill. Perkins told Kelly, flat out, that anti-LGBTQ discrimination and broad \u201cconscience clauses\u201d for business owners are already the law of the land in Arizona.\n\nHe\u2019s right. There are only three cities in the entire state with LGBTQ anti-discrimination statutes on the books. Discrimination based on \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs is fair game everywhere else.\n\nIn response to a question from Kelly about legal discrimination, Perkins replied that business owners in Arizona \u201ccan do that now \u2026 There is no prohibition [against such discrimination] in most places [in the state]. In Arizona, you can do that now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tony Perkins is a bigot, but he's right about one thing: Discrimination is already the law of the land in Arizona  VIDEO", "title": "Fox News gets something right about anti-LGBTQ discrimination: \u201cIn Arizona, you can do that now\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tony Perkins is a bigot, but he's right about one thing: Discrimination is already the law of the land in Arizona  VIDEO", "title": "Fox News gets something right about anti-LGBTQ discrimination: \u201cIn Arizona, you can do that now\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/27/fox_news_gets_something_right_about_anti_lgbtq_discrimination_in_arizona_you_can_do_that_now/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-27-at-9.25.58-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tony Perkins is a bigot, but he's right about one thing: Discrimination is already the law of the land in Arizona  VIDEO", "title": "Fox News gets something right about anti-LGBTQ discrimination: \u201cIn Arizona, you can do that now\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-27-at-9.25.58-AM.png", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arizona, Fox News, Gay Rights, Jan Brewer, lgbtq rights, Tony Perkins, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf72\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Arizona, Fox News, Gay Rights, Jan Brewer, lgbtq rights, Tony Perkins, Video, Life News, News, Politics NewsFox News on Thursday invited Tony Perkins, president of noted hate group the Family Research Council, to discuss Arizona Gov.\nPerkins told Kelly, flat out, that anti-LGBTQ discrimination and broad \u201cconscience clauses\u201d for business owners are already the law of the land in Arizona.\nIn response to a question from Kelly about legal discrimination, Perkins replied that business owners in Arizona \u201ccan do that now \u2026 There is no prohibition [against such discrimination] in most places [in the state].\nThere are only three cities in the entire state with LGBTQ anti-discrimination statutes on the books.\nDiscrimination based on \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs is fair game everywhere else."}
