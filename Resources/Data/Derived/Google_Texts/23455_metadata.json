It would seem what I\u2019d thought was an Onion news item was in fact real news. The Indiana state legislature passed a bill \u2013 the re-imagining of the \u201cReligious Freedom and Restoration Act\u201d \u2013 and upon reading what it allows\u2026 well, it sounds like the plot of a Garth Ennis yarn.\n\nAnd yes, I know that ComicMix is a site for us to post about comics, pop culture, and the other related minutiae of geekery. This law represents nothing related to popular culture outside the fact that the Indianapolis Star reported GenCon threatened to move their large convention to a state that doesn\u2019t allow businesses to discriminate under the pretense of religious freedom. And while I\u2019d hope that Indiana Governor Pence takes the threat under advisement, let\u2019s be honest. He\u2019s far more interested in thwarting legions of Storm Troopers\u2019 ability to purchase goods and services\u2026 because they enjoy sodomy and Satan worship, don\u2019t you know.\n\nUnlucky for us pinko-commie-liberals (those who support Obama, and/or think war is dumb), this law isn\u2019t anything new. Indiana is now amongst 19 states that all passed similar legislation. This was to combat the atrocity of Obamacare forcing businesses to pay for healthcare that allowed for the proliferation of birth control, as well as combat all those laws allowing \u201cthe Gays\u2122\u201d to marry.\n\nIf I recall my US history lessons, I remember that the United States of America was founded in part because crazy folks began to realize that a government need not control, nor be controlled by a central religion. They dreamed of a land where people would have the right to free speech. To gather as they see fit, and worship whomever they chose to. And after a little genocide, they got a huge chuck of land with which to do it. After some wars, death, taxes, and whatnot, the US even adopted the crazy idea that all men are created equal, and gave equal rights to people of all colors, ethnicities, and (eventually) genders. Insane, I know. And after even more death, wars, taxes, the rise and fall of MTV, and a little bit of space travel (if you believe it was real), this same country even started to realize that all people are created equal, and started allowing identify as gay have those very same rights that straight people had.\n\nWell, obviously this is all too much to handle. Thank Rao for red states. I don\u2019t mean to be partisan about the issue, but it\u2019s rare I hear from someone left of center decrying the wasteland of debochery we obviously live in. I\u2019ve seen nary a single soul with an Obama sticker adorned on their VW Jetta lambasting the heathens who shop openly at Whole Foods. But I digress.\n\nThe simple truth is that this law (both in Indiana and in all states who adopted similar laws) is unconstitutional. While I agree that a business can put up a \u201cNo shirt, no shoes, no service\u201d sign, and stick to it, putting one up that declares \u201cno gays\u201d infringes on the rights of personal freedom. Not wearing a shirt or shoes could be argued for via sanitary needs. Being gay, a Satanist, or a Cherokee doesn\u2019t introduce potentially harmful bacteria to available merchandise. And if a store is to be open to the public, then the public \u2013 with all their beliefs in tact \u2013 should have the right to shop in said store. Of course I\u2019d rather know up front if a store I planned to support did not support gay rights, so I could be quick to never shop there again.\n\nThis is the world we live in, kiddos. Our federal government can\u2019t find a reason to not allow people of the same sex to marry, so the individual states choose to do it instead. I\u2019d say we\u2019re on the verge of a Civil War, but frankly I know we\u2019re not. We\u2019re amidst a time where the old guard clings to their outdated views, and the next generation removes the idiocy in due time. In this case? I just wish I could fast forward to the time where the bigots and ignorant decide to secede from the Union, and hold shop somewhere I\u2019m not. Because the \u201cReligious Freedom and Restoration Act\u201d is something even Doctor Doom would identify as futile.\n\nDoom / Sanity 2016, folks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As I trolled my Facebook feed this morning, I was caught off guard by some Indiana-dwelling friends.
