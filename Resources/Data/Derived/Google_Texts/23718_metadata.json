Key trouble spots are southern Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Southern California, but the risk could extend farther north.\n\nThe virus inflicts horrific brain damage on unborn children as well as neurological disorders in adults. The Obama administration\u2019s bungled response heightens the danger.\n\nAmericans are being told to \u201cdrain, dress and deet\u201d \u2014 drain water lingering in their yards, wear long pants and sleeves and use bug repellent. In short, avoid mosquito bites. Imagine the health of your unborn child depending on that.\n\nThat makes as much sense as \u201cduck and cover\u201d did in the 1950s in the event of a nuclear attack.\n\nToday a pregnant woman\u2019s safety hinges on how well her local government controls mosquitoes. The differences are alarming: Fort Myers, Fla., has a $24 million budget and 27 planes for mosquito control. Cash-strapped San Antonio has only two spraying trucks.\n\nMost health departments lack equipment to detect Zika and combat mosquito invasions. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Houston\u2019s Baylor Medical College, fears the epidemic\u2019s extent won\u2019t be known \u201cuntil babies start showing up in delivery suites with microcephaly.\u201d\n\nAlso in Houston, Legacy Community Health is caring for a pregnant Zika patient, who recently arrived from El Salvador.

Obama\u2019s request earmarks over half a billion dollars for Zika programs in other nations, while shortchanging deteriorating public health facilities here at home.\n\nObama is gung-ho to pay for mosquito control in South America, but not here. Just like his Ebola boondoggle, which allocated more for public health infrastructure in Africa than for US hospitals.\n\nDefending his overseas largesse, Obama says Zika is not something \u201cyou can build a wall to prevent\u201d and \u201cmosquitoes can\u2019t go through customs.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled.\n\nMosquitoes fly about 400 yards, max, not all the way from Brazil. Mosquitoes that can carry Zika already live in at least 26 states, ready to reappear with warm weather.\n\nIf the president is serious about fighting Zika instead of Republicans, he can dip into ObamaCare\u2019s $2 billion-a-year public health slush fund. Right now a lot of that money pays for nanny-state follies like videos showing how to exercise at your desk and (ineffective) healthy eating programs.\n\nTragically, Obama\u2019s Food and Drug Administration is delaying the release of genetically modified mosquitoes to kill Zika-carrying bugs. Pandering to eco-radicals.
