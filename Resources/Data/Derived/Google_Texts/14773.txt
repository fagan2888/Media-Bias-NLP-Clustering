A homeowner near 143rd St. E. and Harry St. is wanting to know where his six foot tall, 120 pound statue is at.

Herman Scharping says he walked outside on Wednesday to find his statue stolen.

"It was just gone. We just couldn't figure it out, we were really surprised," Scharping said. He added that the statue was heavy and not easy to move around.

The statue is of an eagle in flight, with one wing pointed down, the other pointed up and with its face looking left. It was made out of wood, custom carved by a chainsaw artist out of an old log.

"We just liked it. Everybody that came by here always thought, 'man that is pretty neat carving'," Scharping added.

He filed a police report and is asking for whoever stole the statue to return it. Scharping has been unable to find any photos of his statue to share with KAKE News.

It is a one-of-a-kind piece of artwork that should be easy to spot if it shows up in a pawn shop or in an online ad.
