He also moonlights as a musician. But all things being equal, he\u2019d rather be fishing.\n\nFortunately for us, Milloff\u2019s work, spanning 35 years, captures his passion for the ocean and its boundless and often dark stories. According to Milloff, it all began in his youth. \"I grew up fishing\u2014south Florida,\" he said. \"It\u2019s all I did. Fish. And when I got to high school and read Moby Dick, it was like the best fishing story ever.\"\n\nThat realization has led to an ever-growing, three-decade collection of action and adventure scenes from Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece, which Milloff wills onto huge sheets of paper in raw and deeply expressive pastel arrangements.\n\nCurrently on exhibition at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London through January 5, Milloff\u2019s Melville showcases those signature large-scale pieces as part of a collection of ocean art that is vivid, visceral, and like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen. It runs in compliment to another sea-related exhibition, Greasy Luck: The Whaling World of the Charles W. Morgan.\n\nAn American Literature major, Milloff went on to do graduate work in art while also writing music and performing. As a result, he\u2019s always been interested in exploring the intersection of creative forms, including literary work, cinematic storytelling, music, and several visual forms such as pastels, paint, and plaster. He believes his work communicates through a combination of texture, image, and musicality.\n\nAnd those pastels? They are enormous\u2014like a series of giant movie screens that capture compelling moments from the world\u2019s greatest sea epic ever, Moby Dick. Milloff describes his multi-paneled drawings as \u201cfreeze frames,\u201d an idea that was originally inspired by the cinematic style of Steven Spielberg, and a fascination with B-movies that Milloff insists he likes because \u201cthey are so bad, they\u2019re good!\u201d\n\nTitles from Milloff\u2019s collection include: The Hidden Lake (2012); The Chase\u2014The Third Day (1985); Fata Morgana (2004-2006); The Dying Whale (1986); and Epilogue, or \u201cQueequeg\u2019s Long Last Dive\u201d (2004-2006).\n\nMilloff admitted his art doesn\u2019t fit a popular mode, or fall into a predictable category, yet he\u2019s pleased that his work \"tends to speak to people who might not know much about visual art, but they like watching a movie.\"\n\nIf you plan to attend:\n\nMilloff's Melville runs through January 5, 2014 at the Lyman Allyn Museum, 625 Williams Street, New London, Connecticut. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, and Sundays 1:00 to 5:00 pm. It's closed on Mondays and major holidays.
