They needed to fire Donald Trump.\n\nThe building\u2019s residents and condo owners had invested in the namesake, a 70-story waterfront tower along Panama Bay, on the strength of Trump\u2019s reputation. But during the four years that Trump Panama Condominium Management LLC had managed the property, Central America\u2019s largest building, a team installed by the Trump family was accused of running up more than $2 million in unauthorized debts, paying its executives undisclosed bonuses and withholding basic financial information from owners, according to an Associated Press examination.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nThe Trumps had done all of this through fine-print chicanery, the board said. A clause in many residents\u2019 purchase agreements prevented them from voting against the Trump company\u2019s wishes. That allowed the Trumps to install their top employee as chairman and the residents\u2019 representative on the board \u2013 even though the Trumps\u2019 actual stake in the building\u2019s residential area was merely a storage closet on the 15th floor.\n\nThe Trump Organization sent its response days later. \u201cYour letter is a complete sham,\u201d wrote the Trumps\u2019 top lawyer, Alan Garten. He accused the board of ingratitude and criminal trespassing. After refusing to accept being fired, Garten declared that Trump\u2019s company was quitting \u2013 and demanded a $5 million termination fee.\n\nWhether wheeling and dealing with Wall Street bankers, debating political rivals or running a condo association, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has advanced his interests by leveraging his outsized reputation, canniness and aggression. The Trump Organization\u2019s adventures in Panama provide a window into how these traits have filtered into his business empire \u2013 and the style of management that could be expected in a Trump White House. Transparency and close attention to expenses are not strengths. Squeezing the most from contractual language is.\n\nThough Donald Trump lists himself as managing member in the Panama business in campaign financial disclosure documents, the company in practice is part of the Trumps\u2019 family business. In an interview, Trump\u2019s son Eric called the squabbling at Trump Ocean Club a minor aside in the story of how the family\u2019s affiliation with the building created \u201can amazing icon and, frankly, a great testament to America.\u201d\n\nThe power struggle at the tower shows the powerful allure of Trump\u2019s name \u2013 and the disenchantment and separation that sometimes follow. Even that is indicative of Trump\u2019s style: As the Ocean Club\u2019s board was trying to settle into the administrative offices, Trump\u2019s people cut off the office\u2019s Internet and phone service and repossessed the office copy machine. The Trump Organization acknowledged this to the AP, saying that disconnecting services was necessary for security and privacy concerns.\n\nWithout Donald Trump, the development would not exist. But the grand ambition behind it belongs to Roger Khafif, a businessman with a prime waterfront parcel in Panama City and an aspiration to build a condominium, hotel, marina, casino and commercial center in the arcing shape of a wind-filled sail.\n\nWhat Khafif lacked was the long track record as a developer needed to lure international banks and construction firms for such an expensive project.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were saying it was never going to be built,\u201d said Duncan McGowan, a real estate agent and property manager who has sold units in the Trump Ocean Club since before construction began.\n\nBringing Trump aboard bolstered the project\u2019s credibility with potential buyers, too.\n\n\u201cI am proud to develop this extraordinary high rise,\u201d Trump said in a brochure, promising that the building would be a \u201clandmark in Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nIn interviews and later legal filings, condo owners said Trump\u2019s record as a builder persuaded them to pay deposits on their units. But despite being listed as the Trump Ocean Club\u2019s developer in marketing materials, Trump wasn\u2019t. His formal role was limited to branding and promoting the project with his name, though Eric Trump said the Trump Organization regularly monitored construction to make sure it met quality standards.\n\nEven licensing Trump\u2019s name carried a huge cost. A 2007 bond prospectus pegged Trump\u2019s expected licensing fees alone at $75.4 million \u2013 more than a third of the $220 million total raised.\n\nDespite a promising start to construction, cost overruns and the global financial crisis took a heavy toll. Four months after Trump joined Panama\u2019s then-president, Ricardo Martinelli, for the building\u2019s ribbon-cutting in July 2011, Khafif\u2019s company defaulted on its debt. Though the bankruptcy also affected Trump\u2019s licensing fees, court files indicate that Trump\u2019s total payout remained between $32 million and $55 million.\n\nThose profits make Trump the only party to the original deal to come out ahead. After emerging from bankruptcy just last year, Khafif is no longer in charge and his former company is again failing to make debt payments. Current bond prices suggest that creditors are expecting to suffer significant losses on their bonds. And despite the building\u2019s iconic silhouette and amenities \u2013 visitors can sip drinks next to a 65th floor edgeless pool that appears to float above the ocean \u2013 most of the hotel condo units that remain under Trump\u2019s direct management still have not been sold.\n\nKhafif is no longer in charge of the development company that built the Trump Ocean Club, and did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment. But neither the developer\u2019s current management nor the project\u2019s bondholders begrudge the Trumps\u2019 success, said Rosella Viola, a commercial sales manager for the developer.\n\n\u201cBuyers buy because of the brand,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of Trump\u2019s windfall in Panama came from licensing, but separate deals gave Trump a role after the project was up and running. One Trump company would run the project\u2019s 369 hotel rooms. Another held a much smaller contract to serve as the building\u2019s overall administrator. It was supposed to act under the guidance of the owners of the condos, office space, shops and other property in the Trump Ocean Club.\n\nTrump was essentially a condo manager but not in the usual sense. His organization negotiated unusually broad authority, including power of attorney to represent all unsold hotel condo units and most absentee residential condo owners at building association meetings. Because many purchasers lived abroad, the proxy votes controlled by Trump\u2019s team gave his company a decisive say over condo affairs.\n\nBuyers learned they were granting their voting rights to Trump only when signing a lengthy final sales agreement, said Al Monstavicius, a retired Nevada doctor who bought a penthouse unit.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have signed that,\u201d Monstavicius said. \u201cBut there was nothing I could do because my money was committed. Trump\u2019s got smart attorneys, and he pays them well, and he takes advantage of that.\u201d\n\nOne final move solidified the Trumps\u2019 clout. Their company took possession of a storage closet on the 15th floor. That physical presence in the building qualified the Trump\u2019s chief executive, Mark Stevenson, to serve as president of the owners\u2019 board.\n\nTrump\u2019s company was now in full control, though few residents saw that as a problem.\n\n\u201cMost people were initially quite happy,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cThe idea was, a prestigious building should have a prestigious management team.\u201d\n\nBut a conflict of interest loomed.\n\nTrump\u2019s management company was owned by the same people who ran the hotel, by far the most expensive part of the building to operate. Shuffling hotel expenses to the rest of the building would make the hotel look more profitable.\n\nDocuments obtained by the AP show the Trump team charged to the common payroll hotel-specific expenses like bellhops\u2019 salaries and hotel room safe repair. Condo owners couldn\u2019t tell whether they were being shortchanged, because the Trumps didn\u2019t keep separate tallies. Although Trump\u2019s management team was contractually required to \u201cestablish and maintain segregated bank accounts\u201d for each of the building\u2019s components, the team never did.\n\nManaging separate bank accounts would have added costs, the chief financial officer of the Trump Hotel Collection, Michael Straube, wrote in a 2012 letter rebuffing an owner who asked for them.\n\nSuch bookkeeping transparency took on increasing urgency given the Trumps\u2019 failure to stay within the boundaries of its owner-approved budget. The building burned through its reserve funds two years after it began operation, incurring unapproved debts of more than $1.1 million in 2013 and again in 2014.\n\nEric Trump said the overspending was the result of extraordinary expenses like a broken water main and rising local labor costs.\n\n\u201cWe made the budget, other than extraordinary things we can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had an unbelievable team, and we managed to an internationally renowned set of standards.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Oscar, who bought a unit with the hope of retiring there, said: \u201cThere was always some type of explanation that was supposed to make things more palatable.\u201d\n\nTrump executives also appeared to award themselves mysterious bonuses. The building\u2019s unit owners still don\u2019t know the size of those incentives and the Trump Organization has refused to disclose them, according to members of the board.\n\nEric Trump told the AP the awards were appropriately authorized \u2013 but did not provide specifics of how or when such authorization took place.\n\nConcerns about overspending and transparency boiled over at the owners\u2019 meeting in December, after the Trump administrators announced its second million-dollar deficit. Managers at the meeting also said they would shift a greater portion of future costs to the building\u2019s residential units.\n\n\u201cIt was like peeling back layers of an onion \u2013 every layer you remove makes you cry,\u201d said McGowan, the real estate agent and property manager on the building\u2019s board. \u201cThat owners\u2019 meeting turned into a screaming match. Civility was lost.\u201d\n\nA rebellion brewed among the condo owners, sparked by the proposed $2.2 million special assessment that would hit them in the spring. The dissidents, helped by McGowan, contacted condo owners scattered around the world. If enough of the building\u2019s disparate owners designated someone other than the Trumps as their legal representative, the dissidents could overcome the Trumps\u2019 control over the owners\u2019 association.\n\nWhen the vote came in May, all but two of the owners representing themselves opposed the Trump team\u2019s special assessment. The building\u2019s developer and the casino operator lined up against it, too. Against nearly unanimous opposition, Trump\u2019s remaining proxy votes weren\u2019t enough.\n\nThe day after residents delivered their rebuke, Stevenson resigned as both administrator and chairman of the building\u2019s board. Another Trump employee with a board seat followed a few weeks later.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s top man in Panama now gone, Eric Trump and higher-ranking Trump Organization executives in New York stepped in. After negotiations to lower costs stalled, the building\u2019s newly restive board fired Trump\u2019s management company and the senior building administration staff who reported to it. The new administration estimates those cuts alone will save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nFollowing a period of heated correspondence between the Trump Organization and the Trump Ocean Club\u2019s board, a tense cooperation has set in. The new administration has shifted scores of employees to the Trump hotel payroll, allowing the Trumps to manage the hotel as they see fit.\n\n\u201cThe hotel is something near and dear to our heart, something that does require real expertise,\u201d Eric Trump said, noting that the hotel management contract runs for 40 years.\n\nDespite the Trumps\u2019 $5 million termination fee claim, Eric Trump said the family does not intend to sue the building\u2019s owners collectively over what it still contends was an illegal firing. Likewise, board members such as Duncan McGowan say there is little interest in pursuing any claims against the Trumps or prolonging any feuds. The majority of the hotel condo units that went on the market in 2011 are still for sale, and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to get along.\n\n\u201cThe hotel management is still Trump, and the flag is still Trump \u2013 we have no problem with Trump,\u201d said Viola. \u201cWe can\u2019t have international buyers thinking there are problems in the building.\u201d\n\nEven condo owners who expressed distaste for the Trumps\u2019 contractual power plays agreed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a predatory businessman,\u201d said Monstavicius. But the Trump name stills holds allure.\n\n\u201cIt attracted me,\u201d he said, \u201cand attracted a lot of other people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "During the four years that Trump Panama Condominium Management LLC had managed the property, Central America's largest building, a team installed by the Trump family was accused of running up more than $2 million in unauthorized debts.", "pubdate": 20151011, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "During the four years that Trump Panama Condominium Management LLC had managed the property, Central America's largest building, a team installed by the Trump family was accused of running up more than $2 million in unauthorized debts.", "title": "Panama building saga offers insight into Trump practices", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-482394298.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/panama-development-saga-offers-insight-trump-business-practices/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "During the four years that Trump Panama Condominium Management LLC had managed the property, Central America's largest building, a team installed by the Trump family was accused of running up more than $2 million in unauthorized debts.", "title": "Panama building saga offers insight into Trump practices", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-482394298.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "real estate"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Business practices, Donald Trump, Eric Trump, NewsHour Weekend, panama, panama city, real estate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2df7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe hotel management is still Trump, and the flag is still Trump \u2013 we have no problem with Trump,\u201d said Viola.\nAfter refusing to accept being fired, Garten declared that Trump\u2019s company was quitting \u2013 and demanded a $5 million termination fee.\nWith Trump\u2019s top man in Panama now gone, Eric Trump and higher-ranking Trump Organization executives in New York stepped in.\nThe new administration has shifted scores of employees to the Trump hotel payroll, allowing the Trumps to manage the hotel as they see fit.\nThe day after residents delivered their rebuke, Stevenson resigned as both administrator and chairman of the building\u2019s board."}
