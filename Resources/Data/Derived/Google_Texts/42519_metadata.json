Because playing center field at (Coors Field) and leading off and getting (614) at-bats in a season is a load.\n\n\u201cI might look for opportunities to lighten Charlie\u2019s load. He\u2019s turned into a pretty elite base stealer, also, so that\u2019s a pounding that he\u2019s taking for seven months.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How did Colorado Rockies\u2019 players spend their offseasons?\n\nBlackmon also could get a full day off from time to time, and could also start games in left field.\n\n\u201cI do know that Parra can play all three (outfield positions) and play them well,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nParra signed a three-year, $27.5 million deal to join the Rockies during the offseason.\n\nReyes watch\n\nThe Rockies continue to say they don\u2019t know anything about a possible suspension for shortstop Jose Reyes under Major League Baseball\u2019s new domestic violence policy.\n\nHowever, a possible resolution appears to be getting closer.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred told reporters Friday in Florida that he expects to have a decision within a few days on two of the first three cases covered by the sport\u2019s new policy. MLB has been investigating cases involving New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig, as well as Reyes. Manfred did not specify which cases he hopes to decide soon.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\nReyes \u2014 part of the trade last July that sent Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto \u2014 is alleged to have assaulted his wife on Halloween in a Hawaii hotel. He is scheduled to go on trial April 4, the day of the Rockies\u2019 regular-season opener. The fact that Reyes still faces a criminal trial could play a part in Manfred\u2019s decision. Reyes, slated to earn $22 million this season, is the Rockies\u2019 highest-paid player.\n\nHowever, the new policy states that the commissioner can hand out discipline for \u201cjust cause,\u201d so Reyes\u2019 appearance in criminal court is not necessarily the deciding factor. In addition, Reyes could appeal any suspension to baseball\u2019s arbitrator.\n\n\u201cThe standards of proof in a labor arbitration and a criminal case are very different,\u201d Manfred told reporters during his first spring-training media availability. \u201cMy strong preference would have been to have them decided by this point in the calendar.\n\n\u201cMore important than the calendar, however, is making sure that we know all the facts before I make a decision. The worst thing that can happen from our perspective is to make a decision and then find out that we decided without knowing everything that happened.\u201d\n\nMost of Colorado\u2019s position players have already reported to spring training, although the first full-squad workout isn\u2019t scheduled until Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gerardo Parra to play some center, give Charlie Blackmon a break", "title": "Gerardo Parra to play some center, give Charlie Blackmon a break", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/gerardo-parra-to-play-some-center-give-charlie-blackmon-a-break/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160119_043520_gerardo-parra.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160119_043520_gerardo-parra.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T12:26:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:52:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Because playing center field at (Coors Field) and leading off and getting (614) at-bats in a season is a load.\n\u201cParra is going to play some center,\u201d Weiss said Saturday.\nHe played in 147 games in center field (138 as a starter), stole a career-high 43 bases, smashed 31 doubles and legged out nine triples.\n\u201cCharlie has been in center field for a couple of years now, and he\u2019s done a nice job, but there are opportunities to lighten the load for Charlie.\nRockies manager Walt Weiss would like to reduce some of that wear and tear, so he\u2019s planning to use new outfielder Gerardo Parra in center field in 2016."}
