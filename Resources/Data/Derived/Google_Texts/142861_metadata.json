That year, Delaware saw 17 confirmed human cases and two fatalities, plus six equine cases, officials said.\n\nThe states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania have each reported two human West Nile virus cases this year. Maryland reported its first human case last week.\n\nResidents are urged to take commonsense precautions against mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors in mosquito prone areas, applying insect repellent containing between 10 and 30 percent DEET, and avoiding mosquito-infested areas during dusk and dawn.\n\nResidents are also reminded to reduce mosquito breeding by draining or removing items that collect water, such as discarded buckets or swimming pools, uncovered trash cans and stagnant birdbaths.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of mosquito-borne disease transmissions won\u2019t subside until cooler autumn temperatures set in, usually in mid-October and sometimes even later,\u201d Meredith said.\n\nContact Alex Wigglesworth at 215-854-2305 or awigglesworth@philly.com.
