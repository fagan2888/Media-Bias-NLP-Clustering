He said the team watched video today because there are a lot of things that must get better.\n\nSame Wild forward lineup tonight and defenseman Jonas Brodin will return after a bout with the stomach bug that has affected several players. Yeo said everybody is fine and he hopes it has run its course, but there are definitely some guys still a bit under the weather.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t taken a sip out of a water bottle in three days,\u201d said defenseman Nate Prosser, laughing but not kidding, I don\u2019t think.\n\nJared Spurgeon played less than 17 minutes the other night in Boston and only a bit over four minutes in the third period, and one of the Wild goaltenders is battling through it right now (not Devan Dubnyk, tonight\u2019s starter).\n\nThe Preds didn\u2019t skate this morning after playing last night in Columbus, so no word with Pekka Rinne will start or if Carter Hutton will play his third game.\n\nZach Parise skated with the team for the first time this morning since getting hurt against Nashville on Nov. 5. He will see the docs later to see if he can get medically cleared for full contact in practice Monday. We didn\u2019t chat with Parise today, but he did look rusty with his skating and stick-handling.\n\nYeo called it a good first step, but he did not want to guess if Parise could play as early as Wednesday against Vancouver. He said let\u2019s first see what the docs say. Yeo also said Marco Scandella continues to be out with a lower-body injury and he\u2019d be surprised if Scandella could come off injured reserve and play Wednesday, but he didn\u2019t want to rule it out.\n\nJason Zucker is fine. He said his leg went completely numb the other night after the Matt Beleskey slash, which Zucker said wasn\u2019t that vicious. He said Beleskey just got him in the perfect spot with his leg extended.\n\nMikko Koivu will skate in his 700th game tonight, 43 from tying his bosom buddy Nick Schultz\u2019s team record. I have a funny story about the two of them I\u2019ll toss in tomorrow\u2019s game notebook.\n\nToday at 4 p.m. at Tom Reid\u2019s Hockey City Pub, Jim Souhan and I will be taping our podcast (malepatternpodcasts.com). Come on by and take part!!!\n\nLastly, Minnesota Wild fans can help those in need at the team's upcoming annual food drive in partnership with Twin Cities Toyota dealers.\n\nAt the Wild game on Saturday, Nov. 21, Second Harvest Heartland volunteers will be collecting non-perishable food items and monetary donations at Gates 1-4 from 5:30 p.m. until the start of the first period. The Wild takes on the Nashville Predators that night at 7 p.m. at Xcel Energy Center.\n\nFor every $5 donated in the Minnesota Wild Toyota Food Drive, Second Harvest can provide 19 meals to the most vulnerable members of our community. Fans can also donate online at Second Harvest Heartland's website. Thanks to a group of generous private donors, gifts will be matched dollar for dollar up to a total match of $25,000 through Nov. 26.\n\nTalk after the game.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The Wild, 7-1 at home, plays host to the Nashville Predators, 4-3-1 on the road, tonight in the first of a four-game homestand after a 1-2-1 road trip.", "title": "Parise skates with the Wild, a \"good first step\" as the Wild prepares to play Nashville", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/parise-skates-with-the-wild-a-good-first-step-as-the-wild-prepares-to-play-nashville/352661921/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144678206746213.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144678206746213.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The Wild, 7-1 at home, plays host to the Nashville Predators, 4-3-1 on the road, tonight in the first of a four-game homestand after a 1-2-1 road trip.", "title": "Parise skates with the Wild, a \"good first step\" as the Wild prepares to play Nashville", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/parise-skates-with-the-wild-a-good-first-step-as-the-wild-prepares-to-play-nashville/352661921/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144678206746213.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144678206746213.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Wild, 7-1 at home, plays host to the Nashville Predators, 4-3-1 on the road, tonight in the first of a four-game homestand after a 1-2-1 road trip."}, "article_summary": "Mikko Koivu will skate in his 700th game tonight, 43 from tying his bosom buddy Nick Schultz\u2019s team record.\nZach Parise skated with the team for the first time this morning since getting hurt against Nashville on Nov. 5.\nThe Wild takes on the Nashville Predators that night at 7 p.m. at Xcel Energy Center.\nSame Wild forward lineup tonight and defenseman Jonas Brodin will return after a bout with the stomach bug that has affected several players.\nAt the Wild game on Saturday, Nov. 21, Second Harvest Heartland volunteers will be collecting non-perishable food items and monetary donations at Gates 1-4 from 5:30 p.m. until the start of the first period."}
