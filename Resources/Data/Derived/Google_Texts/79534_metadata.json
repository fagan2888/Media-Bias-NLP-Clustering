Obama scoffed and filibustered. Stephanopoulos responded by citing the dictionary definition of a tax.\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d Obama responded, \u201cthe fact that you looked up \u2026 the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you\u2019re stretching a little bit right now.

By the way, if the Supreme Court had agreed with Obama, the law would be unconstitutional.\n\nPresident Obama lied \u2014 relentlessly \u2014 during that so-called \u201cdebate.\u201d\n\nMost famously, he repeatedly said, \u201cYou can keep your doctor\u201d (and your insurance) if you want. He often ended such lies by saying, \u201cPeriod. End of story,\u201d as if his emphatic assertion were irrefutable fact.\n\nEither he knew he was lying, or the law is so un-transparent that even the man who signed it into law couldn\u2019t understand its most basic functions.\n\nStill, the biggest lie is the one Obama left unsaid in Brisbane. He implied that he won the debate. He didn\u2019t.\n\nHe won the fight in Congress \u2014 by brute partisan force. But the majority of the American people watching this farcical debate were never convinced by Obama\u2019s claims.\n\nThere was a time when such things mattered.
