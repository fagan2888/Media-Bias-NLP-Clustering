(REUTERS/Joe Skipper)\n\n4130527\n\nColorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange, which is facing \u201cdramatic\u201d cuts to come in on budget if fees aren\u2019t raised on customers, pays its director more than most state department heads, according to a report in the Denver Post.\n\nExecutive director Patty Fontneau, who was criticized last year for requesting a raise and a bonus even as the health care exchange failed to meet its goals, is also paid more than exchange directors in three other states examined by the Post.\n\nThe paper reported that a fifth of the exchange\u2019s employees make more than $100,000 per year, and that almost half make more than $80,000.\n\nFontneau is paid $190,549 per year for leading a staff of 36 employees. The Post noted the salary is $35,000-$40,000 more than what almost everyone in Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s cabinet is paid. And it\u2019s more than exchange directors in Nevada, Minnesota and Washington make per year, states the Post chose for comparison because the cost of living in their metropolitan areas is similar to Denver\u2019s.\n\nEarlier this month, Fontneau asked the Connect for Health Colorado board to consider raising the per-customer fee on those who buy health insurance through the site, citing lower than projected numbers of people signing up by early 2015. Without the fee, she warned that budget cuts would be necessary to keep the exchange operating on its $26 million annual budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the board understands how dramatic our expense cuts are going to be to hit $26 million [in annual operating costs],\u201d Health News Colorado quoted Fontneau as saying.\n\nThose fees are meant to keep the exchange self-sufficient and they\u2019re also used to pay salaries.\n\nFontneau and others defended her salary to the Post, saying that since the exchange is set up to operate as a private entity, it needed to compete for employees with high salaries.\n\nFontneau\u2019s \u201cphilosophy is to pay a little more but hire really good people at a higher level of experience to do the management,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Beth McCann told the paper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the way the exchange is operating,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Republican Rep. Kevin Lundberg said he thought the exchange staff was \u201ctop heavy.\u201d He told the Post, however, that the while the legislature has some power over who is appointed to the exchange\u2019s board, it has none when it comes to staff salaries.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
