According to the 31-year-old former reality star and author of the book For the Right Reasons, making your partner happy is a \u201cdeadly sentiment.\u201d He feels that a couple should show their love to God instead of trying to make their partner happy. Confused yet?\n\nHis \u201choliness not happiness\u201d blog post may seem unreasonable to those whose lives do not revolve around faith. According to WetPaint, Sean seems to be saying that his own marriage to Catherine is more about God than the couple\u2019s romantic relationship. None of this should come as a surprise to anyone who knows how faith-centered the former Bachelor is.\n\n\u201cMarriage should draw both the man and woman closer to God through their actions towards one another. Also, when you love your wife during the toughest of times, you are showing your love to God. Far too often people rest on the emotion of happiness and love, and when that begins to waver over time, so does their marriage.\u201d\n\nLowe\u2019s preaching about God and marriage isn\u2019t new. Known to reality show fans as the \u201cVirgin Bachelor,\u201d Sean is a devout Christian who is part of the I Am Second movement that was created to \u201cinspire people of all kinds to live for God and for others.\u201d\n\nTime reports that Lowe\u2019s religious convictions prompted his decision to stay celibate after the age of 24 \u2014 making him a born again virgin of sorts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex in college\u2026 after graduating college, I moved back to Dallas. I was dating other girls and I started having sex, and I would feel extremely guilty afterwards\u2026 At the age of 24 I finally became a man. I said, \u2018Okay, Jesus, let\u2019s do it again.'\u201d\n\nHis January, 2013 marriage to Catherine Giudici was televised on ABC, with cameras focusing not only on the bride and groom, but on the honeymoon suite \u2014 the place Lowe lost his virginity (again). Since then, Lowe has written about his faith on the Patheos blog, and in the For the Right Reasons book he published in January 2015.\n\nDo you agree with Sean Lowe that marriage isn\u2019t about making your partner happy, or do you think that\u2019s a far-fetched idea?\n\n[Image: ABC]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Bachelor star Sean Lowe made a bold statement about marriage on his Patheos blog this week, stating that he agrees with his pastor who told him,", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Former Bachelor star Sean Lowe made a bold statement about marriage on his Patheos blog this week, stating that he agrees with his pastor who told him, \u201cmarriage isn\u2019t about happiness, ...", "title": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Sean Lowe Preaches That Marriage Is About Holiness, Not Happiness", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2043562/bachelor-sean-lowe-preaches-that-marriage-is-about-holiness-not-happiness/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sean-lowe-catherine-giudici-wedding-670409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T03:49:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-26T07:33:42+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sean-lowe-catherine-giudici-wedding-670409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-04-26T03:49:08+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "sean lowe,the bachelor,famous relationships", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sean-lowe-catherine-giudici-wedding-670409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Former Bachelor star Sean Lowe made a bold statement about marriage on his Patheos blog this week, stating that he agrees with his pastor who told him, \u201cmarriage isn\u2019t about happiness, ..."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94f8\"", "article_summary": "Do you agree with Sean Lowe that marriage isn\u2019t about making your partner happy, or do you think that\u2019s a far-fetched idea?\nFormer Bachelor star Sean Lowe made a bold statement about marriage on his Patheos blog this week, stating that he agrees with his pastor who told him, \u201cmarriage isn\u2019t about happiness, it\u2019s about holiness.\u201d Lowe got married on national television 15 months ago, after proposing to his now-wife, Catherine Giudici, on the popular ABC reality show The Bachelor.\nDoes Lowe mean that God should come before romance and happiness for a married couple?\nHis \u201choliness not happiness\u201d blog post may seem unreasonable to those whose lives do not revolve around faith.\nAccording to WetPaint, Sean seems to be saying that his own marriage to Catherine is more about God than the couple\u2019s romantic relationship."}
