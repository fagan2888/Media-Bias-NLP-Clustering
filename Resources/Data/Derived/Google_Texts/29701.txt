If you are going to the H&8th Night Market this Friday night in midtown Oklahoma City, you will also get the chance to pet some unusual critters.

Giant insects will be on display in the Conservancy's Nature in Art Series auction featuring art by Bob Sober. And, live bugs will make appearances from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. at OSU's insect petting zoo this Friday at the H&8th Night Market.

"Having lived 60 years under the perception the insects were pests best found on the bottom of my shoe, the discoveries were nothing less than shocking," said Bob Sober. "The beauty of these tiny creatures is, to say the least, unexpected."

Sober's artwork are available for auction online now until 7 p.m. Friday. The auction will then continue in-person at H&8th Night Market.

Thirty percent of proceeds will go right back to nature by benefiting The Nature Conservancy of Oklahoma.
