In 2007, as a candidate for president, he announced a plan to restore trust in government. \u201cThe American people want to trust in our government again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need a government that will trust in us.\u201d Throughout his presidency, Obama has repeatedly made a big deal out of restoring trust in government. And in June 2014, he declared, \u201cGovernment is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s all that Hope \u2018n\u2019 Change\u2122 working out? Obama oversaw a government that lied about its care of veterans while awarding its top bureaucrats with bonuses. It targeted nonprofit conservative organizations though IRS investigations. Obama himself strong-armed wildly unpopular deals through Congress, such as ObamaCare and the treaty-that\u2019s-not-a-treaty condoning Iran\u2019s use of nuclear power. If these instances are not scandals, they are at least scandalous.\n\nAnd then on Saturday, Gallup released a poll that found Americans' distrust in government has grown. When Obama was first in office, 66% of Americans said there is widespread corruption in the halls of government. That number has climbed to 75% today. Nice work, Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If people cannot trust their government, all else is lost.\"", "csrf-token": "GAvX2LKoJp5skby/ywodcjYyt9/B1Jx6bhZmkkoW60Y=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "\u201cIf people cannot trust their government, all else is lost.\u201d", "title": "The Most Distrusted Administration in History", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/posts/37829", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-09-24-cb662304.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc525\"", "article_summary": "Nice work, Obama.\nObama himself strong-armed wildly unpopular deals through Congress, such as ObamaCare and the treaty-that\u2019s-not-a-treaty condoning Iran\u2019s use of nuclear power.\nWhen Obama was first in office, 66% of Americans said there is widespread corruption in the halls of government.\nObama oversaw a government that lied about its care of veterans while awarding its top bureaucrats with bonuses.\nIn 2007, as a candidate for president, he announced a plan to restore trust in government."}
