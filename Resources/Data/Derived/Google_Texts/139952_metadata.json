Obeida said they captured the Israeli soldier during the battle in Shejaia where 13 Israeli soldiers also lost their lives. The war ravaged neighborhood east of the city of Gaza was also the site of many Palestinian casualties on Sunday.\n\nThe Israeli military was checking the validity of their soldier\u2019s capture, which Hamas announced on a television broadcast, reports Reuters. Israeli television stations, meanwhile, reportedly paid no attention to Hamas\u2019 claim of a captured Israeli soldier, despite Hamas\u2019 insistent announcements:\n\n\u201cQassam Brigades captured a Zionist soldier,\u201d said Abu Ubaida, shrouded in his Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades mask. Abu Obeida identified the captured soldier as Shaul Aron and read what he said was the captured Israeli soldier\u2019s identity tag number. \u201cHe is a prisoner, and if Zionists lie about the dead and wounded, then the fate of this soldier is their responsibility.\u201d\n\nOther evidence that an Israeli soldier was captured by the Islamist militants was not forthcoming from the masked spokesman. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter to Hamas supporters who reportedly celebrated news of the captured Israeli soldier with cheers and gunfire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer, immediately, because it\u2019s going to change what the Israelis are doing on the ground in that sector,\u201d said CNN military analyst Lieutenant Colonel Rick Francona. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be looking for him\u2026 Overall, the Israeli strategy is not going to change. They\u2019re committed to this mission.\u201d Though Francona did acknowledge that the Israelis are \u201cgoing to have to make some sort of accommodation to get this guy back.\u201d\n\nFrancona was referring to the fact that the last Israeli soldier captured in Gaza in 2006, Gilad Shalit, was held for 5 years before being released in exchange for about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAlong with the captured soldier, the Israeli military hadn\u2019t experienced such a large death toll since its 2006 war with Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. The Palestinian side also suffered its most killed since the conflict started on July 8.\n\nAccording to Israeli Army officials, of the thirteen Israeli soldiers killed, seven were in an armored personnel carrier struck by anti-tank fire. The six others were killed while establishing positions inside houses during the fierce fighting.\n\nIt is not known if the captured Israeli soldier is alive or dead, or where he might be being held.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Israeli Soldier was captured Sunday, according to a Hamas spokesman, as the deadliest day of fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas continued to explode", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "An Israeli Soldier was captured Sunday, according to a Hamas spokesman, as the deadliest day of fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas continued to explode", "title": "Israeli Soldier Captured: Hamas Claim Incites Celebration After Deadly Fighting Sunday", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1364136/israeli-soldier-captured-hamas-claim-incites-celebration-after-deadly-fighting-sunday/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Israeli-Ground-Forces.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-20T21:43:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T14:11:12+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Israeli-Ground-Forces.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-07-20T21:43:48+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "2006,abu obeida,al-qassam brigades,bloody,captured israeli soldier,casualties,dead,fighting,gaza,gilad shalit,hamas,israel,palestinian,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Israeli-Ground-Forces.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An Israeli Soldier was captured Sunday, according to a Hamas spokesman, as the deadliest day of fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas continued to explode"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "It is not known if the captured Israeli soldier is alive or dead, or where he might be being held.\nIsraeli television stations, meanwhile, reportedly paid no attention to Hamas\u2019 claim of a captured Israeli soldier, despite Hamas\u2019 insistent announcements:\u201cQassam Brigades captured a Zionist soldier,\u201d said Abu Ubaida, shrouded in his Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades mask.\nObeida said they captured the Israeli soldier during the battle in Shejaia where 13 Israeli soldiers also lost their lives.\nBut that didn\u2019t seem to matter to Hamas supporters who reportedly celebrated news of the captured Israeli soldier with cheers and gunfire.\nAbu Obeida identified the captured soldier as Shaul Aron and read what he said was the captured Israeli soldier\u2019s identity tag number."}
