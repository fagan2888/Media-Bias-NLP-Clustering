As health care costs grow, the St. Johns County School District has had to direct the cash flow toward its insurance plan.\n\nWhile self-funded plans usually mean lower rates and costs for members, the organization takes all the risk. For firms using outside agencies, they essentially pay for a product, and the risk lies with that outside company.\n\nThe district has used a self-funded plan since the mid-1980s. There are between 6,500 and 6,700 members on the district\u2019s plan with $30 million coming in and going out each year.\n\nTim Forson, deputy superintendent of operations, said any year with more in expenses than revenue can quickly throw the plan off balance.\n\nIn the 2010-11 school year there was a nearly $5 million spike in costs.\n\nHe said expenses went back down slightly the next year, but the district still has to correct the flow of revenue. The goal is for the health plan to sustain itself.\n\nInto uncertainty\n\nOver the last two years, employees have paid their premium contributions while the school board has paid its share plus $4.8 million and $2.9 million.\n\n\u201cAll of this is part of our general operating revenue,\u201d Forson said. \u201cIf you displace money into that health insurance plan you\u2019re hurting all extensions of the organization.\u201d\n\nHe said increasing expenses can impact salaries, resources for the classroom and the ability to hire additional staff.\n\n\u201cIt is a money-in and money-out kind of thing, but the money going out is not what it was based on 10 or even five years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nMedical advances and new treatments and medicines all come at a cost. The district\u2019s insurance premiums increased 12 percent starting July 2014.\n\n\u201cFor most of our organization, we control what we spend,\u201d Forson said. \u201c ... You can control what comes in, but you can\u2019t control what goes out because you don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be sick.\u201d\n\nEmployees have not seen an increase in their premium payments since 2006. But school board contributions have gone up while absorbing numerous expense increases.\n\nForson said between 2008 and 2012, the district was limited in what it could do in terms of salary increases. As a result of the economic downturn, it held back on increasing premiums.\n\n\u201cWe had a period of time where there wasn\u2019t a lot of movement in the premiums that probably set the stage for some of our difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was the right thing to do for the employees at the time.\u201d\n\nTable manners\n\nThe higher rates coincide with shortcomings in salary increases under Florida\u2019s Pay for Performance schedule. Negotiations between the district and the St. Johns Education Association are ongoing.\n\nMichelle Dillon, association president, said premium hikes are not what teachers wanted to see in addition to Pay for Performance changes.\n\nForson said what they\u2019re dealing with at the bargaining table is how to distribute the rate increases between employees and the board.\n\n\u201cWe do realize the plan has some pretty serious issues, so we\u2019re just going to have to go back to the table,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nShe added the union\u2019s point is that teachers should not be making about the same amount and none should be earning less. Uncertainties regarding testing, evaluations and wages have added to teachers\u2019 frustrations, particularly toward Tallahassee.\n\n\u201cI think we do an outstanding job,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cOur hands are tied with the duties of this job and we\u2019d like to see that reflected.\u201d\n\nTaking measures\n\nAll district employees enrolled in the insurance plan use the same plan.\n\nAn insurance committee includes three members from instructional, non-instructional and management staffs. The committee meets each month and makes decisions responding to particular needs.\n\nIn recent years, the health plan has adopted a two-tier system, generic and low-cost medications, three clinics, and fees.\n\nCathy Weber, director for district benefits and salaries, is liaison between the district and the health centers. She also oversees and coordinates the administration of the insurance plan and committee.\n\nOne of the newest fees is a spousal fee of $35 per pay period, or $665 per year. Employees with spouses who are able to get insurance elsewhere have to absorb some of their costs to the plan.\n\nWeber said the reason it is $35 is that spouses are costing the health plan 15 percent more in claims than the average employee\u2019s claims.\n\nAnother challenge is the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAffordable health care is something that depends on the participation of everyone,\u201d Forson said.\n\nHe added reinsurance fees are of no benefit to the district\u2019s plan. They are paid directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to subsidize the federal program.\n\nThe fees cost the district $63 per member last year and will likely cost $44 this year.\n\nForson said it is still better, however, to operate under the self-funded system.\n\n\u201cWe just have to get to where our cash flow in a given year is positive,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the changes we\u2019ve made. The changes are good changes.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBy the numbers\n\n\u2022 In the 2014-15 school year, for a basic single employee plan, over 19 paychecks, the employee amount is $56.23 per paycheck or $1,068.37 annually. The board\u2019s share is $279.32 per paycheck or $5,307.08 annually.\n\n\u2022 In the 2013-14 school year, for a basic single employee plan, over 19 paychecks, the employee amount was $51.61 per paycheck or $980.59 annually.
