Marvel, saying it doesn\u2019t \u201cremotely merit this Court\u2019s review.\u201d\n\nIn its filing Marvel says that the Kirby family\u2019s constitutional arguments are \u201cbizarre,\u201d and were not part of arguments when the case was heard in lower courts. Marvel\u2019s also points out that there is \u201cno circuit split, no judicial taking, no due process violation, and no grave matter of separation of powers\u201d involved in the Kirby family\u2019s petition. The Supreme Court typically only considers cases in which one of those conditions applies.\n\nThere have been some signs that the Supreme Court may actually hear this case. Back in May, the nine justices asked Marvel to offer a response \u2014 the company initially declined \u2014 because they planned to take the case into conference. That\u2019s the first step towards a possible full Supreme Court hearing. The conference was postponed when Marvel promised to offer a reply. Now that Marvel has filed that reply, one suspects the Supreme Court may move ahead with its conference.\n\nThere\u2019s still a pretty strong chance that the Supreme Court won\u2019t take the case. The Court only takes on a handful of cases each year, and with numerous challenges to the Affordable Care Act in the works, along with other hot-button topics, the Kirby case may simply not make the cut. Marvel\u2019s lawyers certainly seem to want to encourage the notion that other cases have more merit and greater importance.\n\nThere\u2019s always a chance, though.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://comicsalliance.com/files/2014/07/Untitled-31.jpg", "sailthru.author": "matt-d-wilson", "description": "Marvel has filed paperwork requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court reject the case of Kirby V.
