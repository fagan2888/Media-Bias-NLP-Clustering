Now there are just under 100,000 sex offenders on the state\u2019s lifetime registry \u2014 most of whom can be found on the state\u2019s public website. But here\u2019s what a lot of people don\u2019t know: California is one of just four states requiring all sex offenders to register for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u2018The reality is that for most of them the offense happened years ago.\u2019\n\nThe state board that oversees the registry believes it\u2019s time to overhaul the registry to make it smaller and easier to spot those at high risk of reoffending.\n\n\u201cK\u201d \u2014 as he wants to be identified \u2014 is a case in point. He was added to the registry last year when he was released from prison. In 2009, he was convicted of multiple felony charges, including lewd and lascivious conduct.\n\nWhile K claims the touching was consensual, the woman said it wasn\u2019t. In any case, the woman was developmentally disabled and K was her caregiver.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d K told me, \u201cis I believe in law, and if I made a mistake I\u2019ll pay for it, which I did.\u201d\n\nK spent more than three years in prison. He says he had no prior criminal record, and that the state considers him a very low risk to reoffend. He\u2019s not, he says, a hard-core sexual predator.\n\n\u201cYou know, not all of us are the same way,\u201d he says.\n\nThe state\u2019s Sex Offender Management Board agrees with that statement. The board wants to prioritize sex offenders on the registry, based on the type of crime committed and their risk of re-offending. Under a recent proposal, some would have to register for 10 years, some for 20 and some for life. K, for example, would probably be dropped from the registry after 20 years \u2014 when he would be in his 80s \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t reoffend. This \u201ctiered system\u201d is already in use by many other states, including Nevada, for example.\n\nTom Tobin is a clinical psychologist who works with sex offenders and is vice chair of the California Sex Offender Management Board, which oversees the registry. He supports the proposed overhaul, saying that the term \u201csex offenders\u201d suggests that the likelihood of reoffending is always high.\n\n\u201cWhile the reality is that, for most of them, the offense happened years ago,\u201d Tobin says, \u201csometimes many years ago, and they have not reoffended. So to call them \u2018sex offenders\u2019 is not a very accurate use of language, and one I think makes us distort reality.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Tobin says, 95 percent of solved sex crimes are not committed by people on the registry, and most sex offenses are perpetrated by someone the victim knows \u2014 not a stranger.\n\nEven some law enforcement officials are questioning the value of the lifetime registry. Bradley McCartt is a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney with the sex crimes division. He says the current registry isn\u2019t helping keep the public safe.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you have a kidnapped child,\u201d McCartt says. \u201cGoing to that registry has all but become meaningless because when people look at it, you basically have 98,000 people to look at, as opposed to better focus on who your suspect might be, to quickly act to try and save that child.\u201d\n\nMcCartt says that by creating a tiered registry, more attention and resources could be trained on monitoring high-risk offenders, and a lot less time could be taken up with less risky offenders, including young men who had consensual sex with their minor girlfriends or men who merely urinated in public.\n\n\u2018Gambling with Lives\u2019\n\nMarc Klaas argues that the tiered approach is risky. Klaas is the founder of KlaasKids Foundation, named after his daughter, Polly, who was kidnapped and murdered in 1993. He says he\u2019ll fight any major changes to the registry. \u201cThis is a small subset that can be dealt with without a sweeping overhaul of the entire system,\u201d he says.\n\nKlass has a strong ally in Nina Salerno with California Crime Victims United. \u201cI think a tiered system is gambling with lives,\u201d she says.\n\nBoth Salerno and Klaas don\u2019t trust how the state says it would decide who is likely to reoffend. \u201cThe risk assessment tools deserve a lot of scrutiny themselves,\u201d Klaas says.\n\nHe cites the case of John Gardner, a registered sex offender who, while on parole, was considered a low-to-moderate risk. Then in 2010 he was convicted of raping and murdering two teenage girls near San Diego.\n\nBut Tom Tobin of the California Sex Offender Management Board defends the state\u2019s risk assessment tool. He says it\u2019s similar to that used by the insurance industry.\n\n\u201cThey are the first to admit,\u201d Tobin says, \u201cthey cannot predict with perfect accuracy whether or not someone will have a future automobile accident or someone is going to die at a certain age. On the other hand, they can come very, very close.\u201d\n\nThe main assessment tool used by the state spots those likely to reoffend about 75 percent of the time. That number increases when combined with other risk factors. But the margin of error has scared many lawmakers away from backing a bill to change the registry.\n\nDemocratic Assemblymember Tom Ammiano has twice tried and failed to pass legislation creating a tiered sex offender registry, but he hasn\u2019t had a lot of success. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a demographic that people feel warm and fuzzy about,\u201d he notes.\n\nAmmiano is termed out of office this year and says he doesn\u2019t have time to try again to pass the reform. Supporters are hoping another lawmaker will step forward, but it\u2019s likely to be tough \u2014 especially in an election year when no one wants to be seen as going easy on sex offenders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California is one of only four states in which sex offenders must register for the rest of their lives.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Is It Time to Reform California's Sex Offender Registry?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/07\\/is-it-time-to-reform-californias-sex-offender-registry\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-07 11:31:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-07 17:06:50\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19937,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Prison Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/6465253809_10ecedace3_o.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "California is one of only four states in which sex offenders must register for the rest of their lives.", "title": "Is It Time to Reform California\u2019s Sex Offender Registry?", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/07/is-it-time-to-reform-californias-sex-offender-registry/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/6465253809_10ecedace3_o-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "prison health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Democratic Assemblymember Tom Ammiano has twice tried and failed to pass legislation creating a tiered sex offender registry, but he hasn\u2019t had a lot of success.\nTom Tobin is a clinical psychologist who works with sex offenders and is vice chair of the California Sex Offender Management Board, which oversees the registry.\nThe state\u2019s Sex Offender Management Board agrees with that statement.\nBut Tom Tobin of the California Sex Offender Management Board defends the state\u2019s risk assessment tool.\nHe supports the proposed overhaul, saying that the term \u201csex offenders\u201d suggests that the likelihood of reoffending is always high."}
