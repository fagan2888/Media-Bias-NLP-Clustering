Police are still seeking the shooter.\n\nThe incident began at about 10:26 a.m. near Florida Avenue and Federal Boulevard.\n\nA red Jeep Wrangler, and a blue Jeep Cherokee were at the scene and the occupants of those two vehicles knew each other, Campbell said.\n\nSomeone in a third vehicle, which was unconnected with the two Jeeps, said something that upset someone in the Wrangler.\n\nThe Wrangler occupant got out of the vehicle and fired a shotgun, striking the third car, Campbell said.\n\nPolice arrived, and the people in both the Wrangler and the Cherokee, fled. \u201cThey were together, but we don\u2019t know what their involvement was or why they fled,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nPolice chased the Cherokee, which accidently collided with a fourth, unconnected, vehicle at Florida and Federal. Four men jumped out of the Cherokee and were arrested.\n\nPolice have not yet found the Wrangler, Campbell said.\n\nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver police arrest four after wild chase; still looking for shooter", "title": "Denver police arrest four after wild chase; still looking for shooter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/denver-police-arrest-four-after-wild-chase-still-looking-for-shooter/", "image": {"width": 599, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Federal_Florida_shootingp1.jpg", "height": 337}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Federal_Florida_shootingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T11:44:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:36:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37d6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey were together, but we don\u2019t know what their involvement was or why they fled,\u201d Campbell said.\nA red Jeep Wrangler, and a blue Jeep Cherokee were at the scene and the occupants of those two vehicles knew each other, Campbell said.\nPolice have not yet found the Wrangler, Campbell said.\nPolice chased the Cherokee, which accidently collided with a fourth, unconnected, vehicle at Florida and Federal.\nPolice arrived, and the people in both the Wrangler and the Cherokee, fled."}
