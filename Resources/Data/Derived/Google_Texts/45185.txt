KAILUA, Hawaii (AP) — How President Barack Obama spent the second day of his holiday vacation in Hawaii on Sunday:

—POLICE SHOOTING: Obama called New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton on Sunday morning to offer condolences for the killing of two New York City police officers and support in the coming days and weeks, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The officers were ambushed in Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday. During the conversation, Schultz said Obama reiterated his call for the American people to reject violence and “words that harm, and turn to words that heal — prayer, patient dialogue and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.” The president also called Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, a co-chair of the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, asking him to explore ways to engage law enforcement officials across the nation, the White House said.
