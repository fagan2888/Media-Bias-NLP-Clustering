ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: Meetings are like the weather. Everyone complains about it, but sometimes it seems that no one can do anything about it.

An international company I advised was plagued by 800 regularly scheduled meetings on the management calendar, a function of a matrixed organization with hundreds of committees and task forces whose members had to be involved, whether in person or by video conference. The company wanted help. So I was asked to talk with—you’re expecting this, right?—the committee on meetings.

Meeting-averse smaller companies can operate by the bump-into method, in which spontaneous encounters in central open areas sometimes substitute for formal communications, but that doesn’t work for everyone. Meetings are a fact of organizational life, so we’d better make them more productive. Some of the keys involve not the meetings themselves but the company culture surrounding them.

– Start with a strong culture in which everyone understands the company’s purpose and values, which creates a foundation for trust. Trust means that people don’t feel the need to meet about absolutely everything. People can act in their areas of accountability.

– Begin meetings with affirming the larger mission, purpose and values. That saves participants from being bogged down in trivialities or petty disagreements.

– Set norms about meeting discipline. Start on time, end on time. Only those invited can attend. If some send their assistants, soon everyone does, and no one in the meeting can actually do anything.

– Use data and dashboards. Provide access to common indicators that alert everyone to situations, encouraging action without calling a meeting. Do reporting in advance by circulating materials. Minimize reporting on the spot, using meeting time for open questions. Advance materials are also a way to manage egos; if people are named and feels represented, they don’t feel the same need to hog airtime just to show their relevance.

– End with action commitments. Don’t let people leave without next steps, or the only step will be another unproductive meeting.

To avoid getting camels—horses designed by a committee—use subgroups, and let them work it out in advance of formal meetings. Justice Stephen Breyer has described the Supreme Court process, which facilitates dialogue among dissenting voices.

Gordon Bethune’s very successful turnaround of legacy Continental Airlines utilized many of these elements. Higher performance was helped by a common definition of success (on-time arrivals) with something in it for every constituency, coupled with a set of performance indicators. A daily cross-functional operations meeting of 15 minutes every morning went with lightning speed through the issues because data were available in advance, and trust was nurtured. Often problems revealed by the data tackled in self-organized conversations even earlier in the morning, and solved before the meeting began.
