The stock of the Foster City, Calif., firm was down $15.55, or 14%, to $92.90.\n\nFederal regulators approved AbbVie's multi-drug Viekira Pak on Friday, and Express Scripts said it had negotiated a discount from AbbVie on the $83,000 wholesale price for the treatment.\n\n\"This agreement marks a fundamental change in how sustainable access and affordability will be delivered to hepatitis C patients,\" said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, in a statement.\n\nThis move marks the latest development in an ongoing battle over the high cost of new specialty drugs.\n\nMany health insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers have railed against Gilead for charging $1,000 per pill for its blockbuster Sovaldi drug.\n\nA 12-week course of Sovaldi costs about $84,000. Gilead also introduced another hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, with a wholesale cost of roughly $94,000.\n\nSovaldi had sales of about $8.5 billion through the third quarter of this year.\n\nCritics have warned that specialty drug prices are unsustainable and threaten to drive up health costs for employers, workers and taxpayers funding government programs.\n\nMembers of Congress demanded a rationale for the steep price of Sovaldi in the U.S. compared with much lower amounts in other countries.\n\nGilead has defended the value of its hepatitis C drugs.\n\nThe company as well as many medical experts say the new drugs mark a major advance over existing treatments because they offer cure rates as high as 95% with fewer side effects for patients.\n\nGilead says the new therapies can avoid the long-term medical expenses related to liver failure, cancer and transplants. About 3 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, but that number may rise as screening for the disease becomes more common.\n\nGilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said the company \"has been negotiating in good faith with Express Scripts and other payers to ensure patients and healthcare providers have access to our medications.\"\n\nSt Louis-based Express Scripts said the AbbVie treatment will be the exclusive option for most hepatitis C patients on its national preferred formulary, which covers about 25 million Americans.\n\nGilead's drugs will be dropped from that tier. Patients who are already taking the drugs can continue to do so, and Sovaldi will be available to patients with more advanced liver disease, according to Express Scripts.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Gilead shares plunge after Express Scripts spurns its $1,000 hepatitis C pill", "Description": "Gilead Sciences Inc., already under fire for the high costs of its hepatitis C drugs, took another hit Monday when the nation's largest manager of pharmacy benefits struck an exclusive deal with a rival drugmaker.
