An estimated 400,000 people attended the event.\n\nDemonstrators gathered at Central Park West at 11:30 a.m. before making their way down Avenue of the Americas, crossing over to 11th Avenue, and marching down to West 34th Street, where trumpet blasts, drum beats and chants finally dissipated.\n\nTHE MARCH IN PHOTOS\n\nThe march served as a pregame show for Tuesday\u2019s climate change summit led by Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations, U.S. President Barack Obama and 126 heads of state. The leaders will outline a plan for a new international climate agreement to be ratified in Paris in 2015.\n\nNotable no-shows of the United Nations climate summit include Chinese president Xi Jinping, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nWhile well-known politicians, celebrities and environmentalists attended Sunday\u2019s march, it was members of the Indigenous Environmental Network who stole the show. Wearing traditional dress, dozens of tribal members offered visual spectacle, shamanistic energy and climate dances to appease Mother Earth.\n\nThey also set the stage for a wild afternoon of anti-capitalist theater.\n\n\u201cA lot of our communities tend to be on the front lines \u2013 we tend to be the ones living off the land. So when the land gets spoiled and degraded, it affects our health and spirit. So it\u2019s essential that we are here at the People\u2019s Climate March, to be at the forefront and make our voices heard,\u201d Dallas Goldtooth, representative of the Indigenous Environmental Network and a member of the sketch comedy group The 1491s, told Watchdog.org.\n\nGoldtooth was among hundreds of tribal members headlining the parade and calling for justice for the earth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because there\u2019s too much damage being done to the earth, the water and the environment. I\u2019m concerned because I have grandchildren,\u201d said Jake Black Bear, a senior member of the Navajo Nation.\n\nEnvironmentalist leaders and activists were also on hand saying nations will have to make big changes to their energy, food and water habits if the planet is to be spared from imminent climate doom.\n\nPointing to 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy, Emma Ruby-Sachs, campaign director at Avaaz.org, a global advocacy organization with 16 million members worldwide, offered a warning aligned with Tuesday\u2019s global climate summit agenda.\n\n\u201cThe Sandy storm is going to become regular. This is not just a green issue, it\u2019s an everybody issue,\u201d Ruby-Sachs told Watchdog.org\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a six-degree rise in temperature if we do nothing. We know that\u2019s going to mean storms, droughts, lack of food and maybe the end of humanity as we know it. That\u2019s what really sober scientists are saying,\u201d she said.\n\nRuby-Sachs compared the situation to the Ice Age, which she said devastated Europe with just an eight-degree global temperature drop.\n\n\u201cIf we act now to move to 100 percent clean energy, we can keep the planet under two degrees, and we can stop this apocalyptic future from happening,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Bob Linden, a nationally syndicated radio host, said it was too late for political solutions. The only hope now, the host of Go Vegan Radio said, is for the world to stop eating meat.\n\n\u201cIf you want another super storm, keep eating meat, dairy, fish and eggs. You can\u2019t be a meat-eating environmentalist. You must go vegan,\u201d Linden said.\n\nAccording to the animal-rights activist, animal agriculture is responsible for deforestation, soil erosion, habitat destruction, resource depletion and drought. Thus, meat-eating environmentalists are a major cause of climate change.\n\nLinden added that governments are helpless to prevent the disaster imagined by climate justice advocates.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t depend on politicians and governments \u2013 they\u2019ll never make the right changes. Don\u2019t defend our new energy infrastructure \u2013 that\u2019ll take 20 years and at least $35 trillion. We don\u2019t have the time or the money. However, if 50 to 85 percent of us switch to veganism by 2020, scientists tell us we can save the planet from climate change.\u201d\n\nGlobal political leaders at Tuesday\u2019s meeting will propose an agenda that limits the world to a less than two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature. According to the United Nations climate summit website, the goal will be reached by restructuring the global economy and eradicating poverty through solutions related to agriculture, cities, forests, energy and transportation.\n\nBut Bill McKibben, chief organizer of the People\u2019s Climate March and founder of the anti-carbon group 350.org, told Watchdog.org the best thing politicians, cities, and institutions could do to stop climate disaster is pull investments out of oil and gas companies en masse. Collective global divestment from traditional energy sources is a top-level agenda backed by McKibben and 350.\n\nWhen asked what states might do to address climate change, McKibben replied, \u201cThey could divest their pension funds of holdings in fossil fuel companies. (Vermont Gov.) Peter Shumlin became the first governor to endorse the idea earlier this week. It makes no sense to invest in the companies that drive the crisis.\u201d\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Indian tribes, environmentalists, union members and others gathered at the People's Climate March Sunday in New York City to warn of climate catastrophe.", "title": "Indigenous, communists, freaks steal show at People's Climate March in NYC - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/IMG_1703.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-22T20:25:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/172232/peoples-climate-march/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Energy and Environment", "tag": "350,Bill McKibben,Climate change,New York City,People's Climate March,UN Climate Summit", "published_time": "2014-09-21T19:25:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-22T20:25:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Indian tribes, environmentalists, union members and others gathered at the People's Climate March Sunday in New York City to warn of climate catastrophe.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/IMG_1703.jpg"}, "title": "Indigenous, communists, freaks steal show at People's Climate March in NYC - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Indian tribes, environmentalists, union members and others gathered at the People's Climate March Sunday in New York City to warn of climate catastrophe."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd068d\"", "article_summary": "By Bruce Parker | Watchdog.orgNEW YORK \u2013 Indian tribes, environmental activists, vegans, union members, communists and circus freaks united in Manhattan Sunday to protest fossil fuels and warn of imminent climate catastrophe ahead of Tuesday\u2019s United Nations climate summit.\nThe leaders will outline a plan for a new international climate agreement to be ratified in Paris in 2015.Notable no-shows of the United Nations climate summit include Chinese president Xi Jinping, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and German chancellor Angela Merkel.\nPointing to 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy, Emma Ruby-Sachs, campaign director at Avaaz.org, a global advocacy organization with 16 million members worldwide, offered a warning aligned with Tuesday\u2019s global climate summit agenda.\nWearing traditional dress, dozens of tribal members offered visual spectacle, shamanistic energy and climate dances to appease Mother Earth.\nAccording to the United Nations climate summit website, the goal will be reached by restructuring the global economy and eradicating poverty through solutions related to agriculture, cities, forests, energy and transportation."}
