The fight to defund Planned Parenthood is ramping up in Washington following the release of an undercover video showing a top official discussing prices for body parts from aborted babies.

In a statement released after the video, Planned Parenthood said the “heavily edited, secretly recorded videotape … falsely portrays Planned Parenthood’s participation in tissue donation programs that support lifesaving scientific research.”

The video led a group of lawmakers to call for the end of federal dollars flowing to the organization.

Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, who re-introduced the “Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act,” served as a nurse for over 40 years. She believes this video shows that Planned Parenthood isn’t living up to the requirements set forth by the federal government in order to receive funding.

“This is not family planning, this is family destruction,” said Black, a Republican.

“I think the exposure to what is happening at Planned Parenthood is making people more aware of just what they are doing. On one side of the clinic they are doing what they make the public believe is the essential piece of what their programs are, and on the other side they are doing abortions,” Black added.

“I am passionately pro-life but this latest discovery has taken us beyond the pro-life versus pro-abortion debate. This is about basic decency and humanity,” Black commented in a statement.

In an interview with The Daily Signal, Black addressed the following:
