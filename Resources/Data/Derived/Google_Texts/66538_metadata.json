However, that health insurance cooperative will essentially dissolve at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nState regulators placed the financially struggling co-op into receivership last month, after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced that it would pay Arches a tiny fraction of the federal funding it was expecting.\n\nAt about the same time, health insurers BridgeSpan Health and Altius dropped out of Grand County altogether. That leaves SelectHealth as the only local option to choose from on the healthcare.gov marketplace during the current open enrollment period, which runs through Tuesday, Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cHopefully, next year we'll have more competition, but basically, the marketplace, which is supposed to be a competitive marketplace, is now a monopoly,\u201d Kulander said.\n\nOf course, residents who are not insured through their employers can always find non-marketplace coverage through Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield and other insurance companies. However, they won't qualify for federal subsidies that can help offset the costs of their monthly premiums.\n\nAs for those who do sign up for one of SelectHealth's 19 local plans, they will have access to Moab Regional Hospital and Moab Family Medicine, according to Sarah Shea, the hospital's director of marketing and community relations.\n\n\u201cAll of the doctors at the hospital will be covered under SelectHealth,\u201d she said. \u201cMoab Family Medicine is also doing the same thing, so you will have coverage in Moab.\u201d\n\nKulander said that residents who are insured through SelectHealth will be able to see top-notch specialists beyond Moab, even if they have to drive the extra distance into the Salt Lake City area.\n\n\u201cIt's not as bad as we all feared; it's actually looking pretty good on a lot of fronts,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there are a lot of panicked people \u2013 especially Arches (Health Plan) people \u2013 but the ship is righting itself, and we're going to sail right into 2016 with few problems.\u201d\n\nOn the plus side, Kulander said, SelectHealth is affiliated with Intermountain Healthcare, whose network includes Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah Hospital, as well as LDS and Intermountain hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I think it's an even more robust network than Arches was providing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don't have St. Mark's; we don't have Salt Lake Medical Center, but I would trade those any day for Intermountain and LDS.\u201d\n\nFor local consumers, the major downside is that SelectHealth's coverage is limited beyond the state line, despite Grand Junction's geographic proximity to Moab.\n\n\u201cThe out-of-state coverage with SelectHealth is definitely dicey,\u201d Shea said.\n\nIn cases where people need emergency medical care or urgent-care services in Grand Junction, Shea urges them to call SelectHealth. To find out if the insurer will authorize those visits, SelectHealth customers can call a toll-free member advocate hotline at 800-515-2220 between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.\n\nAs a heads-up, though, Central Utah Insurance agent Renee Troutt cautioned that a patient's emergency status will last only so long.\n\n\u201cOnce they stabilize you, you're not necessarily in emergency any more, and it can go against out-of-network charges,\u201d Troutt said.\n\nIf SelectHealth's customers go to a \u201cnon-preferred provider,\u201d the insurer may pay a reduced rate, or it may not cover the service at all, Troutt said. For that reason, Troutt said, they should try to find a medical provider that SelectHealth will cover.\n\n\u201cIf you're buying a (healthcare.gov) marketplace plan, you definitely need to stay within their network to get the best coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nA full list of SelectHealth's approved providers is available on the insurer's website at selecthealth.org.\n\nThe current range of SelectHealth's insurance options starts at $270 per month, and runs up to $411 per month.\n\nMany enrollees may qualify for federal subsidies if they meet certain criteria. Shea also urges those who are still struggling to pay their bills to take advantage of Moab Regional Hospital's financial aid service \u2013 even if they are insured. The service is currently underutilized, she said, especially among those who have health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you're having trouble with your medical bills, come in and sit with one of our financial counselors,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you have insurance, you can get financial assistance if you qualify.\u201d\n\nAs residents continue to shop for new plans, Shea wants them to know that the hospital will continue to accept Arches' insurance through 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cSo don't worry about your coverage with Arches through this year,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "moabnewssun.com", "description": "If you held off on buying health insurance through the federal marketplace at healthcare.gov with the hope that you could find a new plan with access to coverage in Grand Junction, Colorado, you're in for a disappointment.", "title": "Obamacare enrollees in Moab to lose Grand Junction coverage", "url": "http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_564d3440-9f61-11e5-b884-c78d0837fc90.html", "image": {"width": 255, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/moabsunnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/37/b370b5d4-9f61-11e5-95a3-27c5edaead4a/5669b372d17f6.image.jpg?resize=255%2C324", "height": 324}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "If you held off on buying health insurance through the federal marketplace at healthcare.gov with the hope that you could find a new plan with access to coverage in Grand Junction, Colorado, you're in for a disappointment.", "fb": {"app_id": 176896259007058}, "keywords": "newsfront,news", "news_keywords": "newsfront,news"}, "article_summary": "However, that health insurance cooperative will essentially dissolve at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1, 2016.\nThe current range of SelectHealth's insurance options starts at $270 per month, and runs up to $411 per month.\nThe service is currently underutilized, she said, especially among those who have health insurance.\nIn cases where people need emergency medical care or urgent-care services in Grand Junction, Shea urges them to call SelectHealth.\nMoab health insurance broker Charlie Kulander said last week that SelectHealth will not offer Grand County residents access to medical specialists and other providers across the Utah-Colorado state line."}
