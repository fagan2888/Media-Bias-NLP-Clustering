But most employers don\u2019t have monopoly power over customers who are forced to pay.\n\n\u201cPrivate unions are more affected by the forces of the free economy, unlike government unions,\u201d Sheffield said in an email to Watchdog.\n\nPublic employee unions, she said, hurt the people who pay for and rely on public services by increasing costs and red tape at all levels of government. She pointed to teachers union opposition to merit pay and school choice as one example.\n\n\u201cThis hurts young students, trapped inside classrooms run by less-qualified teachers \u2014 a scenario that happens more often with students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds,\u201d Sheffield said.\n\n\u201cYounger employees are disincentivized from innovating and taking risks,\u201d she added, \u201cAnd members of the general public are not protected from strikes and government shutdowns, despite paying taxes to hire these workers.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been this way. Until the late 20th century, America\u2019s labor unions represented a primarily blue-collar movement of private-industry workers.\n\nBy the 1990s, most union members were white-collar workers. Public employee union members have outnumbered private-sector union members since 2009, with membership concentrated in states with sky-high taxes and bloated public pension obligations.\n\nAll four of America\u2019s largest labor unions are predominantly or entirely focused on public-sector workers. Membership in the top four, as reported to the U.S. Department of Labor, is listed below.\n\nNational Education Association: 2,963,121 members as of Aug. 31, 2014\n\nService Employees International Union: 1,893,775 members as of Dec. 31, 2014\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers: 1,597,140 members as of June 30, 2014\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees: 1,337,126 members as of Dec. 31, 2014\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to bargain collectively with the government,\u201d George Meany, longtime president of union coalition AFL-CIO, said 60 years ago. Today, AFL-CIO\u2019s agenda is set by coalition members AFT and AFSCME.\n\nAFL-CIO failed to respond to a request for comment.\n\nReforming public employee unions is possible, Sheffield told Watchdog, citing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s Act 10. She suggested Worker\u2019s Choice, a proposal from F. Vincent Vernuccio of the free-market Mackinac Center, could serve as a national model.\n\nGovernment unions have a typically symbiotic relationship with the Democratic Party, but public pension reform measures in Rhode Island and San Jose have passed with support from Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say unions will stop fighting any effort to restore balance between public-sector and private-sector workers. Public employee union bosses have shown they\u2019re willing to spend millions of dollars of members\u2019 money to protect their own power.\n\nPublic employee unions dominate the list of top federal campaign contributors maintained by The Center for Responsive Politics. SEIU, AFSCME, NEA and AFT are all in the top six \u2014 and have spent even more on super PACs, activist groups, think tanks and state issue campaigns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Powerful public-sector unions may be good for government employees, but they're bad news for private-sector workers.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Powerful public-sector unions may be good for government employees, but they're bad news for private-sector workers.", "title": "Study: Public employee unions hurt private-sector workers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/govt-union-membership-by-state-thumb.gif", "updated_time": "2015-10-01T18:29:01+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/240422/public-unions-hurt-workers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Powerful public-sector unions may be good for government employees, but they're bad news for private-sector workers.", "title": "Study: Public employee unions hurt private-sector workers - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/govt-union-membership-by-state-thumb.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-10-02T04:00:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T18:29:01+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "public-sector unions, government unions, public unions, carrie sheffield, CEI, competitive enterprise institute, union membership, union politics, afl-cio"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e95\"", "article_summary": "Public employee union members have outnumbered private-sector union members since 2009, with membership concentrated in states with sky-high taxes and bloated public pension obligations.\nPublic employee unions, she said, hurt the people who pay for and rely on public services by increasing costs and red tape at all levels of government.\nPublic employee unions dominate the list of top federal campaign contributors maintained by The Center for Responsive Politics.\n\u201cGovernment employee unions create a more expensive and protected class of workers at the expense of nonunion workers, students, and taxpayers,\u201d Sheffield wrote.\nPowerful public-sector unions may be good for government employees, but they\u2019re bad news for private-sector workers."}
