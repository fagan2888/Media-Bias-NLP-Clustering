Clint Trickett threw three touchdown passes, and host West Virginia surprised sloppy No. 4 Baylor, 41-27, on Saturday.

The Mountaineers (5-2, 3-1 Big 12) earned their first win over a top-five opponent since beating No. 3 Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl following the 2007 season.

West Virginia sacked Bryce Petty four times and limited the Bears to one touchdown after halftime.

Baylor (6-1, 3-1) was penalized 18 times for a Big 12-record 215 yards. The old mark of 183 yards was set by Texas Tech against Rice in 2007.

“It certainly affected the flow of the game,” Baylor Coach Art Briles said of the penalties. “I never felt like we were out of control or anything along those lines.”

Trickett was 23 of 35 for 322 yards, his eighth straight 300-yard game going back to last season.
