It\u2019s about people, not politics,\u201d he says.\n\nRelated: New Record High for Independents Slams Both Parties\n\nHeading into the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats face two major challenges from this historically supportive demographic: Lower voter turnout among millennials is almost certain to occur this year, experts say, while at the same time, more millennials describe themselves as independents. Though there\u2019s been evidence the Republican Party has alienated younger voters over such socially divisive issues as the legalization of marijuana and gay marriage, Democrats may actually end up this year with a smaller share of a smaller total vote \u2013 though November is still a long way away.\n\nThe question and the challenge are obvious: Are Democratic doomed this fall, or can the party reconnect with younger voters between now and the midterms?\n\nMillennial voter turnout tends to drop in midterm elections. A recent poll by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics (IOP) found that less than one in four Americans, or 23 percent, under the age of 30 will \u201cdefinitely be voting\u201d in November, a significant decrease from 31 percent around this same time in 2010.\n\nRelated: In Obama\u2019s White House, the Buck Stops Nowhere\n\nIn a separate IOP survey of young Americans\u2019 attitudes toward politics and public service done in November 2013, Harvard found that 38 percent consider themselves Democrats and 25 percent Republicans. But roughly 40 percent of millennials do not identify with either party.\n\nYoung Republican Claire Hardwick of Washington, D.C., thinks unaffiliated or independent voters are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cYou have to choose chocolate or vanilla,\u201d says the 24-year-old Hardwick. As the founder of Elephant News, a website targeting young Republicans, she argues that young people should pick a team with a chance to win and get involved.\n\nNick Troiano takes issue with this stance, however. He thinks his generation wants and deserves more choices. A former Republican, the 24-year-old is now running as an independent for Congress in Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district.\n\n\u201cWe have come of age in a time of choice and customization,\u201d says Troiano. \u201cIndependents get to pick the person, not the party.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Job Insecurity Is Becoming the Norm for Millennials\n\nHe says the disaffection from the major parties is hardly unique to younger voters. \u201cVoters are rational. They don\u2019t want to waste time and energy in a system they don\u2019t think they can change. Real choice will bring people out. Ross Perot showed that in 1992,\u201d adds Troiano. \u201cReal choice and competition will engage more people in our electoral system.\u201d\n\nYes, Perot did energize new voters, especially in his first 1992 run. But the Texas businessman also placed third despite using his personal fortune to bankroll his campaign.\n\nCombine disenchantment and a lack of viable independent alternatives, and Chris Lee, the former Democrat, sees less participation by a generation that had a significant role in Obama\u2019s two presidential victories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a circular pattern,\u201d he says. \u201cYoung people aren\u2019t voting at the rates they should be\u201d and as a result, \u201cthey aren\u2019t given a voice at the table.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul\u2019s Long-Shot Effort to Attract Millennials\n\nEven though 60 percent of millennials voted for Obama\u2019s re-election bid in 2012, the new data suggest their support has not led to a deep and lasting Democratic brand affinity. Many millennials are disappointed in the president who promised change, especially those who are finding it tough going in the Obama economy right now.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center Survey found that millennials today are graduating from college with record levels of student debt. Roughly two-thirds of those receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree are graduating with an average debt load of about $30,000. And when they look to Washington, many young people see bickering and gridlock. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known our current system not to work,\u201d Troiano says.\n\nTroiano\u2019s campaign is trying to tap into both the distrust \u2013 and the disgust. \u201cOur country deserves better than politics as usual,\u201d he says.He takes it as progress that his Pennsylvania campaign team includes two former Capitol Hill interns: one from Democratic Senator Bob Casey\u2019s office, the other from Republican Congressman Tom Marino\u2019s office. Marino is the GOP incumbent Troiano hopes to unseat.\n\nRelated: Millennials\u2019 Joblessness Costs the Government $8.9 Billion a Year\n\nThe odds are overwhelmingly against him \u2013 but Troiano believes it is a flag worth planting. \u201cYoung people who want to make a difference in politics will have to go outside the box to do so.\u201d\n\nBut what about those who have given up on trying to make a difference?\n\nLee understands their disaffection, but says he hopes they can take a longer view. \u201cAs millennials, we are young enough to be able to embrace technology and advancements in communication,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re also old enough to remember a time when things got done, when people sat down and decisions were actually made.\u201d\n\nThat disconnect is what inspired him to get into politics. \u201cThe main reason I ran for office was to bridge that gap between the old way of thinking and young Americans today,\u201d he says.\n\nLee\u2019s hope that young Americans stay politically involved will be tested by their 2014 turnout at the ballot this November. Then, in 2016, the test will be whether the share of the youth vote grows for the third consecutive presidential election \u2013 and whether, without Barack Obama on the ballot, young voters remain a reliable Democratic constituency. The answers mean a great deal to America\u2019s future.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Chris Lee, 24, is a case study in a shifting millennial mindset.", "title": "How Young, Independent Voters May Change America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/25/How-Young-Independent-Voters-Will-Change-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07302012_young_urban_americans_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/25/How-Young-Independent-Voters-Will-Change-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07302012_young_urban_americans_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Chris Lee, 24, is a case study in a shifting millennial mindset.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bcb\"", "article_summary": "Young Republican Claire Hardwick of Washington, D.C., thinks unaffiliated or independent voters are making a mistake.\nLee\u2019s hope that young Americans stay politically involved will be tested by their 2014 turnout at the ballot this November.\n\u201cThe main reason I ran for office was to bridge that gap between the old way of thinking and young Americans today,\u201d he says.\nThe question and the challenge are obvious: Are Democratic doomed this fall, or can the party reconnect with younger voters between now and the midterms?\n\u201cIndependents get to pick the person, not the party.\u201dRelated: Why Job Insecurity Is Becoming the Norm for MillennialsHe says the disaffection from the major parties is hardly unique to younger voters."}
