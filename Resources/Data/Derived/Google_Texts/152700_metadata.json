So does Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who thinks small businesses are crippled by \u201can explosion of regulation\u201d and has called Social Security a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d that should be replaced by individual savings accounts.\n\nJournalists, meanwhile, routinely affix the P word to liberals who want to raise taxes on the rich and to conservatives who claim higher taxes just benefit liberal special interests.\n\nThe same word is applied to office-holders whose ideologies are poles apart because populism in the United States is not a philosophical creed, like liberalism or conservatism. It is a mode of persuasion \u2014 by which left and right compete in the never-ending battle to define the virtuous many and the immoral few.\n\nPopulists on both sides view ordinary people as a noble assemblage not bounded narrowly by class or occupation; see their elite opponents \u2014 \u201cthe establishment\u201d \u2014 as self-serving and undemocratic, and seek to mobilize the former against the latter. In a nation where the people are supposed to rule, the evolving contest to fill those vague yet emotionally powerful terms with meaning helps explain who gets to govern the nation and for what ends.\n\nThe first Populism \u2014 with a capital P \u2014 was the name of a radical third party. Near the end of the 19th century, a mass movement largely composed of small farmers and wage-earners from the rural South and West organized the People\u2019s or Populist Party. The group sought to challenge the \u201cplutocrats,\u201d who were to blame for corrupting politics and impoverishing the masses. The original Populists thought the only virtuous citizens were \u201cproducers\u201d \u2014 those who worked hard, usually with their hands, for the common good.\n\n\u201cWealth belongs to him who creates it,\u201d intoned Ignatius Donnelly, one leader of the new party. Putting the same principle in harsher, biblical terms, Donnelly quoted St. Paul: \u201cIf any will not work neither shall he eat.\u201d\n\nThe economic program of the original Populists was decidedly left-wing. It called on Congress to pass a progressive income tax, inflate the money supply to aid debtors and nationalize the railroads \u2014 all to \u201crestore the Government of the Republic to the hands of the \u2018plain people\u2019 with whom it originated.\u201d\n\nThe Populist Party won control of state governments in Kansas and Colorado, elected 45 congressmen and briefly threw a scare into both major parties before fading away. But its rhetoric and policies endured. Populists had a major influence on the Progressives and New Dealers who constructed the modern regulatory welfare state during the first half of the 20th century. Like Warren today, they insisted \u201cthe people\u201d need a potent and well-funded federal government to raise living standards and hold the \u201ceconomic royalists,\u201d as President Franklin D. Roosevelt once called business tycoons, in check.\n\nDuring the Cold War, however, populism began to slip its liberal moorings. Senator Joseph McCarthy and his fellow Red hunters accused rich Hollywood screenwriters and Ivy League-educated State Department officials of cozying up to, even spying for, the Communist enemy. This New Right\u2019s conspiratorial, anti-elitist rhetoric, argued such prominent intellectuals as the historian Richard Hofstadter and the sociologist Daniel Bell, resembled that of the People\u2019s Party \u2014 if aimed at completely different targets.\n\nMainstream journalists, who thought as little of bygone agrarian rebels as they did of McCarthy\u2019s demagoguery, echoed the intellectuals\u2019 critique. So was born the notion that conservatives could talk populism as naturally as their opponents on the left.\n\nThen, the multiple crises which rocked the nation in the 1960s and \u201870s spawned populisms from all points on the ideological spectrum. Buffeted by racial conflict, a losing war in Vietnam and a long economic downturn, Americans grew mistrustful of nearly every kind of authority. Their sour mood boosted Ralph Nader\u2019s campaign against unsafe cars produced by General Motors, Alabama Governor George Wallace\u2019s assaults on \u201cpointy-headed bureaucrats\u201d and school busing, and Jerry Falwell\u2019s crusade against the \u201csecular humanist\u201d elite. It also helped lift former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, a one-time peanut farmer who promised \u201ca government as good as its people,\u201d into the White House in 1976.\n\nDecades later, what the media once treated as novel has become an unreflective habit. When nearly anyone who rails against \u201cthe establishment\u201d \u2014 political, economic, cultural \u2014 in the name of \u201cthe people\u201d gets labeled a populist, the term risks becoming more a lazy tic than a useful trope.\n\nBut how a politician or movement activist defines those malleable terms still matters. Cruz views ordinary Americans primarily as a group of devout Christians who think their nation is being destroyed by a free-spending, job-killing, godless liberal elite. So it\u2019s logical for him to despise Obamacare and call for most Environmental Protection Agency regulations to be scrapped.\n\nFor Warren, what characterizes the common folk are their economic hopes and woes. They work hard to earn enough money to buy a nice house, send their children to college and enjoy a secure retirement. But Wall Street gambles with their mortgages, and employers refuse to raise their pay \u2014 as the Dow Jones Average soars. So she champions the right of labor to organize and argues for lower interest rates on student loans and stricter rules on how banks can invest other people\u2019s money.\n\nThe popularity of populist talk is unlikely to wane anytime soon. It\u2019s been essential to political conflict in the United States for most of the nation\u2019s history. Populism\u2019s ideologically promiscuous nature practically insures that, for some future group of partisans, yesterday\u2019s tribunes of the \u201cplain people\u201d will become tomorrow\u2019s immoral establishment.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing too. At root, populism is the language of people who engage in politics to protect and advance the imperishable ideals of the American republic which they believe \u2014 often with good reason \u2014 that the powerful and the privileged have betrayed.\n\nAs the great historian C. Vann Woodward wrote almost 60 years ago, \u201cOne must expect and even hope that there will be future upheavals to shock the seats of power and privilege and furnish the periodic therapy that seems necessary to the health of our democracy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"WT.cg_n": "Blogs - The Great Debate", "WT.ti": "Searching for a real populist - The Great Debate", "SEARCH.AUTHOR": "Michael Kazin", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Populism in the U.S. is not a philosophical creed, like liberalism or conservatism.
