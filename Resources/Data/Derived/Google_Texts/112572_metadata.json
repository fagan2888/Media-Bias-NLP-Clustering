Canterbury has been reinstated after being fired for a rough arrest at 33rd and Seward last Spring.\n\n\n\nAction 3 News first broadcast exclusive cell phone video of a rough arrest. It shows a police officer pulling Octavius Johnson to the ground and punching him several times. It also shows several officers running into the Johnson home without a search warrant to confiscate video another Johnson brother was recording. Investigators believe officers destroyed that video. What police didn't know, a neighbor was recording the whole thing.\n\nAccording to the TV report, an arbitrator decided in a 38-page ruling that Canterbury\u2019s use of force was justified, calling the strikes \u201chammer hits\u201d and noting he didn\u2019t kick or elbow Johnson. The arbitrator also decided the city didn\u2019t have enough evidence to show Canterbury purposely failed to mention the second series of strikes, against an already subdued Johnson, in his report, even as two of the officers are facing charges related to the cover-up of the incident.\n\nVideo below, with the second, unreported strikes, coming in at about 2:55, after all the other cops have already run into Johnson\u2019s brother\u2019s house to take whatever he filmed of the incident:\n\nh/t Raven Nation\n\nFollow these stories and more at Reason 24/7 and don't forget you can e-mail stories to us at 24_7@reason.com and tweet us at @reason247.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Good samaritan made sure the incident got on the internet anyway", "title": "Omaha Cop Reinstated After Being Fired For Not Reporting Use of Force on Subdued Man Caught on Camera, Other Cops Ran Into Brother\u2019s Home to Confiscate Video", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/23/omaha-cop-reinstated-after-being-fired-f", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1390501610869.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The\nOmaha Police Department \nsaid it fired six officers after an incident of police\nbrutality caught on tape went viral.
