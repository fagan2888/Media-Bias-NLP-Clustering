Hate to break it to you, but there is no gum that can replace food (at least not yet, that is). However, skin color changes caused by food is an actual occurrence, albeit not very common. Here\u2019s a quick run-through of the foods and beverages that could change your skin color if you\u2019re not careful:\n\nThe Blue Man\n\nPaul Karason is truly a remarkable character. The Oregon native began drinking colloidal silver, a product consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid, in an effort to treat his dermatitis, Today News reported. Although silver has antibacterial properties, the colloidal silver was banned by the FDA in the 1990s because of its ability to cause argyria, a condition where silver collects in the body and does not dissipate.\n\nUnfortunately, it was too late for Karason and years of self-medicating with colloidal silver because his skin eventually turned blue. Karason died last September from issues non-related to his skin coloring, but still remains as one of the most widely known cases of argyria ever documented. Argyria (Greek for silver) is caused by chronic exposure to the element silver. The silver remains in an individual\u2019s body, unable to leave and gives the patient a gray to gray-black staining on their skin and mucous membranes.\n\nIt Ain\u2019t Easy Being Green\n\nA 24-year-old Chinese man\u2019s skin and eyes turned a lovely shade of green after contracting a parasitic infection from eating snails, Want China Times reported. Doctors at Guizhou Aerospace Hospital removed four common liver flukes, a type of parasitic flat worm, from the man\u2019s body. It\u2019s believed that the man\u2019s daily diet of river snails was the root of his ailment.\n\nSuch infections are unfortunately quite common, and Want China reported that in the most extreme cases individuals have been found with close to a thousand parasites in their bodies. Those who eat plants from dirty water or who drink untreated water are at the highest risk for infection.\n\nMellow Yellow\n\nWhen it comes to carrots, you literally are what you eat. Carotenemia is when a person has an excessive amount of carotenoids in their blood, most commonly caused by overconsumption of foods such as carrots, pumpkins, and even papaya. The most popular characteristic of this condition is a slight yellow tint to the patients\u2019 skin.\n\nAlthough the condition can be alarming at first, it is usually harmless and will go away with a simple dietary shift. On the other hand, if your yellow skin is caused by something other than food, it may be cause for concern. Jaundice is a condition caused when the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down. A substance called bilirubin builds up in the blood, and this can cause the skin and the whites of the eye to turn yellow. Unlike carotenemia, this condition is dangerous and requires medical attention.\n\nNice Golden Skin Tone\n\nFinally, here's a food that will change your coloring for the better, not worse. A 2012 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that eating more fruits and vegetables can change skin tone, lending it a healthier glow within a matter of weeks, Medical News Today reported. The main researchers, Dr. David Perrett, and his team found that as little as two extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day for six weeks was enough to cause a detectable change in skin tone.\n\nPeople who eat more fruits and vegetables have a \"golden\" skin tone that looks healthy and attractive. \"Our latest research finds that even small improvements in diet produce visible benefits to skin color,\" explained lead researcher Dr. Ross Whitehead.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how, get, tan, without, sun, or, turn, blue, smurf, 4, foods, can, discolor, your, skin", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eating too much of certain foods, such as carrots and escargot, can change the color of a person's skin.", "title": "4 Foods That Can Discolor Your Skin (For Better Or Worse)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-get-tan-without-sun-or-turn-blue-smurf-4-foods-can-discolor-your-skin-310774", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/14/carrots.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eating too much of certain foods, such as carrots and escargot, can change the color of a person's skin.", "title": "4 Foods That Can Discolor Your Skin (For Better Or Worse)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-get-tan-without-sun-or-turn-blue-smurf-4-foods-can-discolor-your-skin-310774", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/14/carrots.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/14/carrots.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-11-15T10:30:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-15T10:30:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eating too much of certain foods, such as carrots and escargot, can change the color of a person's skin."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb118\"", "article_summary": "Jaundice is a condition caused when the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down.\nUnfortunately, it was too late for Karason and years of self-medicating with colloidal silver because his skin eventually turned blue.\nOn the other hand, if your yellow skin is caused by something other than food, it may be cause for concern.\nHere\u2019s a quick run-through of the foods and beverages that could change your skin color if you\u2019re not careful:The Blue ManPaul Karason is truly a remarkable character.\nA substance called bilirubin builds up in the blood, and this can cause the skin and the whites of the eye to turn yellow."}
