By the May 20 show at the Peoria Civic Center Theater, Chicago\u2019s nearly 30-song set list will be fine-tuned and ready to wow the generations of fans that have encountered the band\u2019s music.\n\nClassics like \u201c25 or 6 to 4\u201d and \u201cSaturday in the Park\u201d will find their way onto the set list just like 1970. These concerts are for the fans after all, according to Pankow, otherwise they would be considered rehearsals. The whole show is littered with the most popular of Chicago songs, dating back to the days of the band\u2019s old name, Chicago Transit Authority. The real surprise would be if any of Chicago\u2019s new work made it into a concert.\n\nUnlike many legacy acts that continue to tour for any variety of reasons, Chicago keeps cranking out new albums with a steadfast persistence. Five albums have been recorded in the last eight years, each bearing the Roman numerals that keep track of the sheer volume of them all. 2014\u2019s \u201cNow\u201d was the 23rd studio album and 36th overall album from the band. Chicago has managed this feat despite all of the touring with the help of a recording rig \u2014 a portable studio that can fit in almost any setting.\n\n\u201cWe can make records backstage, in hotel rooms, on the bus,\u201d Pankow said. \u201cIn the old days, it was a matter of everybody flying to a place and convening in a classic recording studio environment and making a record. Now, it is spur of the moment. Nothing is lost. Ideas are captured when they\u2019re fresh.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the type of evolution one witnesses when they\u2019ve been doing something for almost half a century. At this point, Chicago has outlived some of the buildings it performed in 48 years ago. Pankow can still vividly recall the band\u2019s biggest break, when Jimi Hendrix saw Chicago as the house band in Los Angeles\u2019s famed Whiskey A Go Go. Hendrix then uttered the now-famous line, \u201cYour horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me,\u201d before asking the band to go on tour with him.\n\nMuch has changed in the intervening decades, but Chicago still aims to woo a crowd just like it floored Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s.\n\n\u201cEvery night you walk on that stage, it\u2019s like the first night,\u201d Pankow said. \u201cThis is the fountain of youth.\u201d\n\nThomas Bruch can be reached at 686-3262 or tbruch@pjstar.com.
