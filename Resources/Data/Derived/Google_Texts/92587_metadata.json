King attacks DREAMers In an attempted joke, he calls them \u2018those people that come from the other planet.\u2019\n\nRep. Steve King, at the opening of his Iowa Freedom Summit, took another jab at so-called DREAMers, saying they come from a different \u201cplanet.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa Republican, perhaps the most vocal critic of immigration reform in Congress, made the comment in an ad-libbed remark in his opening address to the gathering of conservatives hailed by some as the beginning of the 2016 Iowa caucus season.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a great people. We have a vitality that\u2019s unequaled on the planet. We come from every possible planet, uh, every possible continent,\u201d King said, to laughter from the crowd. After a brief pause, the congressman referenced the DREAM Action Coalition, an immigration advocacy group protesting the event in Des Moines.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re across the street, those people that come from the other planet,\u201d he said, prompting more laughs and applause from the audience.\n\nThe event is featuring speeches from several potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, among others.\n\nDemocrats and immigration reform advocates have seized on the summit, accusing Republicans of seeking to \u201ckiss the ring\u201d of an influential Iowa congressman who has become known for his provocative statements against immigration and DREAMers.\n\nOn Tuesday, King criticized a DREAMer invited to sit in the first lady\u2019s box at the State of the Union address as \u201ca deportable,\u201d a remark that he defended after facing criticism. The congressman, who has been confronted several times on camera by immigration advocates, has previously said most undocumented immigrations have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d from smuggling drugs and compared them to dogs.\n\nSpeaking at the beginning of the summit he\u2019s co-hosting with Citizens United, an emotional King offered an impromptu prayer for the next president to \u201crestore the soul of America.\u201d He laid out several challenges to Republicans running for president, including supporting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, abolishing the IRS and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKing also predicted that the next president of the United States would be speaking at his summit, an apparent slight to several potential Republican candidates who didn\u2019t appear at the event \u2014 among them Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says immigration advocacy groups come from another planet.", "title": "King attacks DREAMers", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/steve-king-iowa-summit-immigration-dreamers-114552.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/24/150124_steve_king_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Iowa,DREAM Act,Immigration,Steve King,Immigrants,Iowa Freedom Summit", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says immigration advocacy groups come from another planet.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b92\"", "article_summary": "We come from every possible planet, uh, every possible continent,\u201d King said, to laughter from the crowd.\nAfter a brief pause, the congressman referenced the DREAM Action Coalition, an immigration advocacy group protesting the event in Des Moines.\n\u201cThey\u2019re across the street, those people that come from the other planet,\u201d he said, prompting more laughs and applause from the audience.\n\u201cThey\u2019re across the street, those people that come from the other planet,\u201d he says.\nChris Christie, Texas Sen.
