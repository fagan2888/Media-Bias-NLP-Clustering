Let's be fair to the city and let's be fair to these poor people, too because they did work hard,\" Mike Lee the President of Association of City Retired Employees said.\n\nRetirees don't get raises and their insurance premiums are up.\n\nThat's less money to live on and union reps said retirees deserve better.\n\n\"If we're in that dire straight and they can't afford insurance for the insurance and retirees and the people that work here, why are they spending and doing the things that they're doing,\" said Thomas Malone with the Memphis Fire Association.\n\nThe council votes on a budget next Tuesday.\n\nThat's too soon to make the changes suggested happen so some council members said today was more of a long term planning session when it comes to health care.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "35.149534;-90.048980", "description": "A New York based human resources consulting firm suggests alternatives to city of Memphis health care coverage", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WREG.com", "description": "A New York based human resources consulting firm suggests alternatives to city of Memphis health care coverage", "title": "Experts say Memphis has \u201cCadillac\u201d health care coverage", "url": "http://wreg.com/2015/06/10/experts-say-memphis-has-cadillac-health-care-coverage/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/council-committee.jpg", "height": 640}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/council-committee.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@3onyourside", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@3onyourside"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324690258", "fb": {"pages": 114737265221655}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wreg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9bc3246fbdba300537a296bf9ad07b3c?s=16", "application-name": "WREG.com", "ICBM": "35.149534, -90.048980", "keywords": "news, affordable care act, association of city retired employees, city administrators, city employees, city of memphis, health care cuts, im strickland, mike lee, quinton robinson, segal group, thomas malone", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3", "published_time": "2015-06-10T23:16:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T23:16:10+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health Care Cuts, City Employees, City of Memphis, City Administrators,Segal Group, Affordable Care Act,Quinton Robinson,  im Strickland, Mike Lee,   Association of City Retired Employees,  Thomas Malone,"}, "article_summary": "City administrators said their health care package is considered a \"Cadillac plan\" that must become more like a Ford Taurus.\nThe talk of changing health care plans again led to a standing room only committee meeting at City Hall.\nHowever, many in the room for the meeting were retirees concerned they're being factored out of the health care equation.\nThe consulting group found the city paid more for health care coverage than Shelby County Government, Shelby County Schools and the state of Tennessee.\nThat's too soon to make the changes suggested happen so some council members said today was more of a long term planning session when it comes to health care."}
