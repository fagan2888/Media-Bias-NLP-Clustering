It\u2019s an app to help seniors talk to their doctors about medical care.\n\n\u201cLike all great health care breakthroughs, it happened at the International House of Pancakes,\u201d he says, half-jokingly.\n\nVenture capitalists are pouring more money than ever before into digital health start-ups, more than $2 billion so far this year alone, according to the venture capital firm Rock Health. They are betting that entrepreneurs can help doctors, hospitals and insurers become leaner \u2013 which the Affordable Care Act strongly encourages.\n\nVockell\u2019s endeavor started back in April, when Medicare released a huge database of how much it pays individual doctors. The government health plan for senior citizens and the disabled had kept that a secret for decades.\n\nSo when Medicare suddenly dumped an entire year\u2019s worth of data, finally making public millions of transactions, coders like Vockell tried to figure out how to make it useful for seniors.\n\nEnter the I-Hop.\n\n\u201cMy kids go there after school one day for funny face pancake lunch,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were lots of seniors there. And my kids run around, and the seniors love when they come up and sit with them, and I was like, I could totally use my kids to source a whole bunch of interviews pretty fast.\u201d\n\nHis three-year-old in a Batman suit proved a great ice breaker, and over a lot of pancakes, 43 seniors told Vockell that knowing which doctors charge more and less wouldn\u2019t necessarily send them shopping for the lowest price. Seniors generally like their doctors and don\u2019t want to shop for new ones.\n\nMostly the seniors told Vockell, \u201cI know I have some procedures on the horizon, that I don\u2019t know exactly what they mean that I have to do or what they\u2019re going to cost me, I\u2019d love to get some insight into that.\u201d\n\nThey also asked, \u201ccould you make the print really big?\u201d Vockell says. And, he laughs, several mentioned, \u201cthe blueberry syrup is magnificent.\u201d\n\nSo Vockell developed a website that helps seniors understand the procedures their doctors are recommending, and the costs, so they can start conversations with their doctors \u2013 and they can print the information out on paper, in really big type.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say whether his product will be the hot new topic on the shuffleboard circuit, but it was a winner at the big Health Datapalooza conference this month in Washington, DC.\n\nBig health care data is the raw material for a whole new segment of the IT sector. Entrepreneurs like Sean Power are also exploiting databases like the price list Medicare released this spring.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hot,\u201d he says. \u201cAnytime anybody releases a new set of data we get excited.\u201d\n\nPowers\u2019 company, karmadata, is based on the idea that software engineers like him can find ways to use big data to save the government or big companies money, and that they\u2019ll share some of their savings with him. There\u2019s tons of opportunity in streamlining health care, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be starting a company in the health care data space. I think the gold rush is on.\u201d\n\nJust like a real gold rush, hitting paydirt means lots of prospecting. Entrepreneurs can\u2019t always find the information they really need to make a truly useful product. Dr. Omar Alvi is with a start-up called Accordion Health. Their big idea is to help families estimate future health care spending. So you could type in that grandpa\u2019s got hypertension, mom\u2019s got diabetes and one of the kids has asthma, and then get some idea of how much that\u2019s all going to cost, and maybe even shop for the best price.\n\nA great idea, but, Alvi says: \u201cEach patient is very different, and so in order to be able to make a meaningful prediction, you have to have a lot of data. So you can say, patients just like this went through these problems as they moved through the medical system. That\u2019s really where it requires hundreds of millions of data points.\u201d\n\nAnd not even close to the millions of data points Alvi\u2019s company needs are available yet. A lot of information about procedures, cost and effectiveness remain locked up inside insurance company computers, or in hospitals\u2019 and doctors\u2019 medical records \u2013 information they don\u2019t want to share.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership between NPR and Kaiser Health News.
