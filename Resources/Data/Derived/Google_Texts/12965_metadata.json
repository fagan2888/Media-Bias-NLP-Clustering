(Scroll down to read the report itself.)\n\nThe major findings also included a \u201clack of State oversight in Recipient Integrity\u201d that led to instances of potential fraud not being referred to for prosecution and \u201cserious findings\u201d in the state\u2019s employment and training program.\n\nThe Sept. 10 management evaluation rested on visits that officials from the USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service office made in May and June where operations were observed at the state level, as well as in social services offices in Guilford, Pitt and Wake counties.\n\nIt requires DHHS to provide a corrective action plan within the next 60 days.\n\nThe report came on the heels of a major breakdwon in North Carolina\u2019s food stamps delivery system last year that left thousands of low-income families without access to food assistance for weeks or months. The problems were attributed to glitches in a new technology system, N.C. FAST (Families Assessing Services through Technology) and issues that county-level workers had in accessing the new system while struggling under heavy caseloads.\n\nUSDA threatened to cut off more than $80 million in funding if the state didn\u2019t quickly resolve backlogs that topped 30,000 households waiting for help in December.\n\nDHHS communications staff said it would only answer questions Thursday about USDA\u2019s recent findings if questions were put in writing.*\n\nThe agency did issue a written statement from Sherry Bradsher, a deputy secretary in charge of human services, that said DHHS was primarily focused on getting benefits to applicants during last year\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cNone of the findings prevented clients from receiving benefits,\u201d Bradsher said in a written statement. \u201cMany of the issues the USDA cited were administrative in nature, while some of the issues have never been raised before. There are some findings with which DHHS disagrees, and we are currently reviewing our options with those.\u201d\n\nA USDA spokesperson said the federal agency will be working with North Carolina to ensure the state fixes the regulatory, oversight and program deficiencies noted in the report.\n\n\u201cSNAP is one of our country\u2019s strongest defenses against hunger and poverty and a critical support for eligible low-income families in North Carolina so we take the proper administration of this important program seriously,\u201d USDA spokesperson Johnathan Monroe said in a written statement. \u201cIt is incumbent upon the State to resolve these problems in a responsible manner that is consistent with federal statute and regulations.\u201d\n\nDHHS asked federal officials for $12 million to cover the overtime and other costs incurred while clearing the backlogs of food stamps cases in 2013 and 2014. USDA agreed to reimburse the state for $7 million of those costs, Monroe said.\n\nIn a legislative hearing last week, DHHS officials said wait times for food stamps were greatly diminished from last year, with 741 people whose application for food stamps were overdue in late August, and 846 recertifications pending beyond the allowable amount of time.\n\n*Note: This version has changed from its original to reflect that DHHS officials would not answer questions Thursday about the report unless those questions were put in writing.\n\nUsda Sept 2014 Report by NC Policy Watch", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "In a legislative hearing last week, DHHS officials said wait times for food stamps were greatly diminished from last year, with 741 people whose application for food stamps were overdue in late August, and 846 recertifications pending beyond the allowable amount of time.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s food stamps program continues to face major problems in how it operates and monitors federal funds for low-income families struggling to get food on their tables, according to a recent report by federal officials.\nThe report came on the heels of a major breakdwon in North Carolina\u2019s food stamps delivery system last year that left thousands of low-income families without access to food assistance for weeks or months.\n\u201cMany of the issues the USDA cited were administrative in nature, while some of the issues have never been raised before.\n\u201cThere are critical findings in the Claims/TOP area that are related to a lack of State oversight and monitoring,\u201d read one finding in the 19-page report."}
