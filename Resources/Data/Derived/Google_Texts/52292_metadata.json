The officials assured New Yorkers the patient was not on the subway or in public once he had a fever. \u2018I would get on the subway tomorrow and ride the subway,\u2019 acting state health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1toeBox\n\n-- Obama spoke by phone with Cuomo and also de Blasio. The White House read out: \u201cThe President offered the Governor and Mayor any additional federal support necessary to provide the highest standard of patient care, maintain the strictest safety protocols for healthcare workers, and to identify and, as necessary.\u201d\n\n-- AP\u2019s Jonathan Lemire and Colleen Long: \u201cThe doctor, Craig Spencer, a member of Doctors Without Borders who had been working in Guinea, returned six days ago and reported Thursday morning coming down with a 103-degree fever and diarrhea. \u2026 days before Spencer fell ill, he went on a 3-mile jog, went to the High Line park, rode the subway and, on Wednesday night, got a taxi to a Brooklyn bowling alley. Bassett said he felt fatigued Wednesday but not feverish until Thursday morning.\u201d http://bit.ly/ZPuRDs\n\n-- NY Post: \u201cHipster bowling hot spot The Gutter was closed last night due to \u2018unforeseen circumstances.\u2019 \u2026 An army of emergency vehicles swarmed Spencer\u2019s block around noon and completely shut the street down. \u2026 FDNY specialists in hazmat suits sealed off his fifth-floor apartment, sources said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1wvtMNI\n\n-- Daily News: \u201cFDNY hazardous materials specialists sealed-off Spencer\u2019s apartment on W. 147th St. and took the doctor out on a stretcher. \u2026 the super in Spencer\u2019s building, said firefighters took the doctor\u2019s door off its hinges when they took him out of the apartment.\u201d http://nydn.us/1ys8QGN\n\nHOW IT\u2019S PLAYING: N.Y.

This wasn't Cuomo pledging his support to a Democratic leader who has foreclosed the possibility of him running for national office, and for that matter, this wasn't an endorsement at all. After all, as the governor told reporters in a post-event scrum, \u201cHillary Clinton can\u2019t be endorsed because Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t said she\u2019s running for anything.\u201d http://bit.ly/1tPv0Vd\n\nRUPERT-ZUCKERMAN -- Tabloid union? -- Capital\u2019s Joe Pompeo: \u201cWhat if New York City's two tabloids, those famously bloody newsstand warriors, joined forces? Recently, the age-old rivals were considering just that \u2026 The New York Post and the Daily News have been, by popular definition, locked in a tabloid war for decades. But within the past year or so, even as they waged their vituperative battle in public, they were talking about a number of potential business deals that would have made unlikely bedfellows of enemy combatants\u2014had they not broken down, according to several sources familiar with the matter. \u2026\n\n--Out of Print: \u201cWithin tabloid circles, chatter is rampant that the News is already considering a plan to go digital-only sometime in the next few years. A source close to News management corroborated that such conversations are taking place. \u2018The discussions are not about if, they're about when,\u2019 the source told Capital.\u201d http://goo.gl/ruZkti\n\nRIVERS AFTERMATH -- \u201cMelissa [Rivers] has 'no choice' but to sue'\u201d\u2013 TMZ: \u201cMelissa Rivers will sue the medical center where Joan died and the doctors as well because it's the only way she can find out what really happened to her mom. Sources connected to the Rivers family tell TMZ ... after the New York Dept. of Health and Human Services came out with its findings that Yorkville Endoscopy LLC was \u2018deficient\u2019 in surgical services and medical staff ... Melissa tried to find out the root of the problems and if they caused her mom's death, but she was shut down.\u201d http://bit.ly/1xga72p\n\nSPEAKERS ANNOUNCED FOR TAMI TALKS: We're pleased to announce TAMI Talks: Tech & the City, the first in Capital's highly anticipated TAMI Talks event series.

Pizza parlors MUST serve slices. So New York favorites like Grimaldi\u2019s, Lombardi\u2019s, or Patsy\u2019s are out of the running.2. The pizza parlors must come from all five New York City boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Staten Island).3. I can only get around using NYC public transportation.4. I will order whatever I want.5. Go big or go home (I have to finish every slice. Leaving out the crust is OK, though).6. Do not, under any circumstances, die.\u201d http://bzfd.it/1wo47ph\n\nBILL RIFF \u2013 \u201cThe de Blasio Diaries, Chapter 2: Highline and Dry\u201d on VanityFair.com: \u201cDear Diary, I have a confession to make. Last night, I went to the Highline. I know, I know. I know. The Highline. Basically as bad as getting tea with Gwyneth at the St. Regis. I told some reporter I had never been, and it became a whole thing, and talking so much about how I had never been . . . well, it made me want to see it. \u2026 But I couldn\u2019t go and be photographed and give the Post headlines for a week (\u2018Highline and Not So Mighty!\u2019). So, I put on a tracksuit and told Chirlane I was going out on a Citi Bike, but instead I took a cab (I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me) to the Highline. I put on one of those blue wigs Chiara used to wear in high school, and took Dante\u2019s giant headphones.\u201d http://vnty.fr/1pGRxwh\n\nDONOR CAMPAIGN -- \u201cDisgraced hotel magnate uses powerful friends in bid to lessen prison sentence,\u201d by Post\u2019s Selim Algar: \u201cDisgraced hotel magnate and Clinton family pal Sant Chatwal Singh has submitted hundreds of letters of support from high-powered pals including self-helper Deepak Chopra, media honcho Robert Johnson and restaurant titan Geoffrey Zakarian in his bid to impress a judge before his sentencing \u2026 Chatwal pleaded guilty in April to illegally using straw donors to raise more than $180,000 for three political campaigns \u2014 including Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2008 presidential bid \u2014 and faces up to six years in prison. From powerful politicians to prominent surgeons to former New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, Chatwal appears to have retained a slew of friends in high places despite his fall from grace earlier this year.\u201d http://bit.ly/1tp0qiX\n\nNO CAPITAL FOR YOU -- \u201cM.T.A. Told It Must Focus on Repairs, Not Growth,\u201d by Times\u2019 Patrick McGeehan: \u201cThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority should concentrate on improving the condition of its existing transit systems before plowing ahead with the second phase of the Second Avenue subway and other expansion projects, a watchdog agency said on Thursday. In a report that called the authority\u2019s priorities \u2018misplaced,\u2019 the Citizens Budget Commission called for more emphasis on safety and increasing the capacity of the New York City subway system. The subways have been carrying heavier and heavier loads, exceeding six million riders on four separate days last month.\u201d http://nyti.ms/ZKU7dK\n\nBOOSTING OBAMACARE -- Capital\u2019s Gloria Pazmino: The City Council plans to work with community organizations to make sure Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers increase during the program\u2019s upcoming enrollment period. The next period runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. At a rally Thursday before a health committee hearing about how the city performed during the last enrollment period, Councilman Corey Johnson, the committee chair, said 89 percent of people who are currently uninsured in New York city do not know another enrollment period is coming up. http://goo.gl/JZGUzD\n\nPOST-MORELAND REFORMS FALL FLAT\u2014New York World\u2019s Harry Stevens: If the 2014 elections are anything to go by, the package of campaign finance reforms enacted this year by Cuomo and the state Legislature will have little, if any, impact on the business of campaigning in New York. http://bit.ly/1D4d4oC\n\nMOBILE NYPD -- \u2018Fewer arrests\u2019 -- Capital\u2019s Azi Paybarah: A new \"mobility initiative\" will equip city police officers with smart phones and tablets, and allow officials to instantly communicate with every officer in the field. The $160 million initiative will provide for 35,000 smart phones, one for each officer, and 6,000 tablets, one for each police car, over the next three years.\n\n-- Technology upgrade: \u201cYou can literally, with this technology, take a fingerprint on a street corner in New York City,\" de Blasio said. \"A police officer can take a fingerprint, process it immediately, [and see] whether someone has a warrant out, confirm an identity. This is going to speed the work of law enforcement. It\u2019s also going to allow us to not have to bring as many people into the station houses. It\u2019s going to allow us to more summonses and fewer arrests, where appropriate.\u201d Bratton said the new technology may also lead to improved relations between officers and local residents, since the police will be able to easily display pictures of suspects in order to say: \u201cHere is who I am looking for.\u201d http://bit.ly/1wvoPVc\n\nREAL ESTATE -- \u201cAmtrak weighing development of massive Queens rail yard,\u201d by Capital\u2019s Ryan Hutchins: \u201cAmtrak is considering developing Sunnyside Yards in Queens as part of a nationwide evaluation of its real estate portfolio and could turn to investors as early as next spring to find partners willing to explore potential uses for those properties \u2026 The Sunnyside Yards is one [of] the largest undeveloped parcels in New York City and holds virtually limitless potential to developers willing to build a platform above the tracks. Planners have long dreamed about what could be built on the property, which remains an active rail yard used by several train companies.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rsqcxu\n\n--Cond\u00e9 Nast move to World Trade Center starts next weekend, by Capital\u2019s Ryan Hutchins: Cond\u00e9 Nast executives will move into 1 World Trade Center next week, beginning a months-long process to migrate thousands of employees from Midtown to its 24 floors in the gleaming new skyscraper, according to Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of CBRE New York. The company plans to start with its top employees as well as its attorneys from the law firm Sabin, Bermant & Gould LLP. \u201cThey\u2019re stacking from the top rolling down in the space,\u201d Tighe said. Durst Organization confirmed to The New York Times that the shuffle to Lower Manhattan would start on Nov. 1, next Saturday. Capital reported several weeks ago that an opening was planned by early November.\n\nStill unclear, however, is when an opening ceremony will be held. The Port Authority and Durst had looked at several days next week as possible targets but that has not come to fruition. The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources saying Cond\u00e9 employees would start work at Tower One on Nov. 3, said the delay comes after staffers for New York and New Jersey\u2019s governors spent weeks haggling over the date. An opening will happen at some point after Election Day.\n\n-- \u201cIn Reversal, Barnes & Noble Executives Say Store Will Remain in the Bronx,\u201d by Times\u2019 Winnie Hu: The Bronx\u2019s only full-service bookstore, on the brink of closing, will remain open after a frenzied campaign by the borough\u2019s leaders and residents to save it.Barnes & Noble executives said on Thursday that its store in Bay Plaza in Co-op City will remain open for two more years, reversing an earlier decision to close it after the year-end holidays.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1znAglg\n\n--\u201cFound: The Brooklyn Residence that\u2019s Farthest from the Subway\u201d \u2013 IquantNY: \u201cAnd the home that is farthest from a subway in Brooklyn is\u2026 2336 National Drive in Mill Basin: The property \u2026 was described in a real estate listing as a \u2018Fisherman\u2019s dream\u2019 and sold for $860,000 in 2012. It is about 2.2 miles from the nearest subway as the pigeon flies.

Covering nearly 500 acres in the middle of Brooklyn, the land of the dead feels a world away from the skyscrapers of Manhattan, visible in the distance from the hilltops.Visitors are greeted by a looming gothic gate, the kind used to signify that important residents lie behind its spires.
