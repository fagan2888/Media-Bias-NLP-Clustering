Because it's the biggest football tournament we've hosted since the 2000 Olympics and a real chance for the Socceroos to win a significant trophy for the first time (not including four Oceania titles). The curiosity factor will drive some fans to games not involving Australia, while the different immigrant communities (notably China and Iran) will show their support in decent numbers, but overall it's our first big chance to connect properly with Asian football.

2. Which team are you particularly looking forward to watching and why?

Palestine because of what they represent and the support they'll get from all Australians, including non-Arabs. It's an incredible achievement for Palestine not only to qualify, but to assemble a team given the troubles they've had in 2014.

3. Who will make a name for themselves in this tournament?

Nathan Burns. A man in the right place at the right time. After years of under-achievement, this tournament could be his coronation. In pure talent, Burns suffers little in comparison to the likes of Son Heung-min and Shinji Kagawa — his challenge is to handle the pressure of expectation and prove it.

4. What will a successful tournament look like for a) the Socceroos and b) the AFC?

A semi-final place will be the minimum for the Socceroos, to win the title will be a game-changer. The players are well aware of their chance to make history, and they also know the public will not be as forgiving as they were during the World Cup. For the AFC, getting anything over 500,000 fans will be deemed a success, while avoiding any security issues will be a huge relief.

5. Everyone needs a second team. Who should it be and why?

My second team will be Iraq because they're always good to watch, and continue to produce outstanding young players (Ali Adnan is the latest off the production line) despite the ongoing problems at home. Like Palestine, Iraq represent the power of football as a unifying force. Of all the countries in Asia, perhaps only Iran has a deeper football culture, which makes you wonder just how powerful they would be if they could resolve their security issues.

6. Tell me one thing I should not miss in this tournament.

Australia's first match against Kuwait because not only will it set the tone for the Socceroos, but the whole tournament. A win is critical, but we can dream of a dominant, expansive performance to vindicate the ideology of Ange Postecoglou, who insists all the tribulations of the last 12 months are about to be washed away.

7. Prediction time. Who's going to win and why?

Australia. It won't be easy to get past an expected meeting with Japan in the semi-final, but revenge from 2011 (losing the final) should be a powerful motivation — particularly for the seven players who survive from Qatar. The Socceroos were the better team in the final four years ago — now they get the chance to go one better. Home advantage is massive.

SEBASTIAN HASSETT

1. Why should we care about the Asian Cup?

For all its wonderful assets, Australia is notorious for its "backwater" mentality – and our failure to engage with our near neighbours is a huge part of that. Fortunately, here's something we can all agree on: football. While Asia may not dominate the game just yet, it's the continent's only common language, and the next time you walk into a bar in Seoul, a business meeting in Beijing, a mall in Dubai or a café in Jakarta, sharing your Asian Cup experience makes for an instant talking point.

2. Which team are you particularly looking forward to watching and why?

This is a dream opportunity for Australian football fans to see the depth of Asian football in their own backyards – and each team is worthy of some of your time. I can't wait to watch Japan, simply because they are the standard bearers of football in the region. North Korea we know nothing about. A highly-lauded South Korean side is promising the world. From the Middle East, the money is starting to talk: the investment in elite programs for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates is bearing fruit. Can they challenge the regional hegemony of Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia?

3. Who will make a name for themselves in this tournament?

Omar Abdalrahman is a certifiable nobody in Australia – even if his Marouane Fellaini-like hair makes him easily identifiable – but he'll be a cult hero by the end of January. He's arguably world-class already. Ashkan Dejagah's pace and dare for Iran will win hearts everywhere. Qatar's Khalfan Ibrahim has matured from a teenage wunderkind into a senior star. By the 2019 Asian Cup, South Korean Son Heung-min will be the biggest name in Asian football. For Australia, Nathan Burns is in such hot form that it's impossible to think he won't make an impact.

4. What will a successful tournament look like for a) the Socceroos and b) the AFC?

The Socceroos have to win matches and win them well. They need to play enterprising, entertaining and attacking football. The public loved their never-say-die attitude at the World Cup but didn't like seeing the team rag-dolled, conceding nine goals in three games. Extra-time in the semi-finals is my pass mark. The AFC would like to see big crowds, genuine engagement and matches that showcase to the world why, as their slogan suggests: "The future is Asia". Don't forget that no Asian team won a match in Brazil, which heightens the importance for an exciting tournament.

5. Everyone needs a second team. Who should it be and why?

The obvious answer is Palestine – but there are plentiful other options. North Korea's footballers could do with some vocal support in the stands and might draw some curious onlookers. If you're a looking to satisfy your Eurosnob cravings, Japan and South Korea have ample players playing in some of the world's best leagues. That Iraq has maintained a competitive football team over the past decade is nothing short of a miracle.

6. Tell me one thing I should not miss in this tournament.

The geopolitics of Asian football make these events potential powder kegs, yet despite the surplus of Middle Eastern teams coming to Australia, there's no majorly spiteful contests in the group stages. There is, however, the quite remarkable contest of Palestine and Jordan in Melbourne on January 16. So much of Palestine's refugee community has fled to Jordan – 3.2 million Palestinians are estimated to be there – and that makes this game unique in world football.

7. Prediction time. Who's going to win and why?

For all their pre-tournament difficulties, Samurai Blue remain the shining light of Asian football. Since Japan started to take football seriously in the 1990s, they've won four of the past six Asian Cups and have to be favourites to land a fifth. The big guns – Shinji Kagawa, Keisuke Honda, Shinji Okazaki and Yuto Nagatomo – remain in the continent's top ten players. Australia and South Korea occupy the next rung down; there's more quality in the Koreans but Australia have home ground advantage. Qatar or the United Arab Emirates could well throw a spanner in the works with a surprise run.

MICHAEL LYNCH

1. Why should we care about the Asian Cup?

It's probably the third or fourth biggest football tournament in the world, at least at international level (World Cup, European Championships and arguably Copa America are all bigger) but is the most important competition in this region. It's probably the biggest thing Australia has a realistic chance of winning, and it gives local fans a chance to benchmark the Socceroos against the best in the Asian Confederation on home soil. It's also the closest we will get to feeling what hosting a World Cup would have been like.

2. Which team are you particularly looking forward to watching and why?

Very keen to see how Iran perform over the next month. The Iranians (known as Team Meli) have always produced good players with a mixture of toughness, speed and skill - as Australia knows to its cost, as those who can remember the devastation football fans here felt in November 1997 when Iran denied the Socceroos a place at France 98 will attest. They have a top level coach in Carlos Queiroz and did well in Brazil against Bosnia, Argentina and Nigeria.

3. Who will make a name for themselves in this tournament?

Omar Abdulrahman (Al Ain and UAE). There will be plenty of young guns like Australia's Tomi Juric hoping to become the breakthrough stars of the tournament, but he may not start enough to really become a household name. So Abdulrahman can become a poster boy for the competition should the UAE go deep into the tournament. The 23-year-old Saudi Arabian born playmaker has been linked with moves to big name European clubs in the past, and should he stand out in this tournament those offers are likely to come again.

4. What will a successful tournament look like for a) the Socceroos and b) the AFC?

The tournament will have been a success for Australia if the Socceroos make the semi-finals, and a massive boost for the game should they go on to make the final or win outright. It might not be a disaster if they even went out in the quarter-finals, depending on who they played and the manner of defeat - on penalties, say, after dominating a game but failing to break down a stubborn opponent. That would, however, be a tough sell to a public expecting more. For the AFC it will be a success if crowds are good, television ratings hold up and there are no political demonstrations or crowd incidents.

5. Everyone needs a second team. Who should it be and why?

Got to be North Korea, hasn't it, just for the sheer novelty value of seeing the men from the Hermit Kingdom whose leader, Kim Jong-un, is such a figure of fun, intrigue and concern in the western world. I have seen them play in a few tournaments and they are organised, disciplined and committed - and that is just their fans, many of whom are suspected to be party functionaries or soldiers. I am old enough to remember them beating Italy in the 1966 World Cup (I was nine at the time) so they know how to produce an upset.

6. Tell me one thing I should not miss in this tournament.

Don't miss Australia's opening game. Get to AAMI Park (known as Melbourne Rectangular Stadium for the duration of this competition) if you can, but otherwise watch on television. I hope (and expect) Ange Postecoglou to send out a team that will make a statement in their first game against Kuwait. Australia will want to send a signal to the rest of the tournament and the country at large that they should be excited by their national team and the tournament. If possible also try to see Palestine play. This is the first time they have qualifed for a major tournament.

7. Prediction time. Who's going to win and why?

The smart money says Japan for all the usual reasons: top players, big game experience and the all round quality of the squad. But I think that Australia can buck its recent trend of poor results and, plugging into the emotional charge of big home crowds, give the tournament a real shake. Ange Postecoglou has constantly asked to be judged on his team's performance in the Asian Cup, and not before: now is the time to deliver, and they can go all the way.

DOMINIC BOSSI

1. Why should we care about the Asian Cup?

Not since the 2000 Olympics has Australia hosted an international football tournament near this scale and unlike those games, our national team has a realistic chance of winning silverware. However, this tournament means much than the prize of glory for the Socceroos, it also marks our real entrance as a major player in Asia. We have a rare opportunity to host some of the world's biggest nations giving us access to compelling backgrounds whether it be North Korea, Palestine or Saudi Arabia. On our doorstep, a month-long festival of football begins, one that will be watched by billions.

2. Which team are you particularly looking forward to watching and why?

Japan. The Blue Samurai are emerging as the stand alone monolith of Asian football and are as entertaining as they are powerful. They're a nation whose football philosophy is steeped in the Brazilian game and, over time, parallels in their pace, skill and flair can be found. Combined with a tireless work ethic, they make for great viewing.

3. Who will make a name for themselves in this tournament?

The spotlight will naturally be on the Australian team and within their ranks are a number of bolters who could become genuine stars. In the midfield is Terry Antonis, a 21-year-old destined for a successful career in Europe someday. In defence is Trent Sainsbury, a certain starter who was denied a chance to go to Brazil last June due to injury but who can now atone for that disappointment. In attack, however, are two players who will be given a chance to inflate their A-League stardom to the international game, Tomi Juric and Nathan Burns.

4. What will a successful tournament look like for a) the Socceroos and b) the AFC?

Anything less than a semi-finals appearance for the Socceroos will be considered an absolute failure for Ange Postecoglou and could have a negative knock-on affect for the rest of the tournament. Australia sacrificed a slim chance at success at the 2014 World Cup in preparation for the future, thus heaping more expectation to deliver on home soil this summer. Public interest largely hinges on the success of Australia who possess the ability to dictate the popularity of this tournament through their performances.

5. Everyone needs a second team. Who should it be and why?

Palestine. A war ravaged country competing in their first ever Asian Cup via the cut-throat qualification process of the Challenge Cup, they are the team for the romantics and those with plenty of empathy. They don't have big name players, they are rarely able to host international games due to security issues and they're national league is split between isolated regions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They're a team built on unity, with players from as far as Slovenia, Egypt, Sweden and Chile pledging their allegiance to their ancestral home. They showed enough fighting spirit just to reach this tournament so imagine what they might be able to do once they're here.

6. Tell me one thing I should not miss in this tournament?

Getting to the venues. Yes it is simple, broad but obvious - this is our one and only time to be part of Asia's biggest football tournament. Get out this summer and go see even the most random games. Get to Uzbekistan v North Korea, Saudi Arabia v China or Palestine v Iraq. You will be exposed to all backgrounds in the stadium celebrating football and perhaps be fortunate enough to witness the most amazing moment - whether it be a goal, a boil over or something contentious. A tournament of this scale won't be hosted in Australia for the foreseeable future, so don't rue missed opportunities.

7. Prediction time. Who's going to win and why?

Iran are enjoying a resurgence within the continent and, managed by former Real Madrid and Portugal coach, Carlos Quiroz, the Princes of Persia are becoming a giant once again. They were perhaps the best performing Asian team at a disappointing World Cup for the continent and have the vital blend of experience, youth and talent to challenge for the title. They have quality all over the park and, most importantly, a coach who can help them reach their potential. They're disciplined in defence but have enough enigmatic players to balance that consistency with flair. They should reach the semi-finals unscathed and, from there, anything can happen.

SCOTT McINTYRE

1. Why should we care about the Asian Cup?

Simple – it's one of the world's largest and most important footballing tournaments – older than even the European Championships and it's here in our own backyard. It's a chance to see some of Europe's finest players first hand and the next generation of Asian talent that is just as promising as the list of established stars. More importantly, though, it's a celebration of culture and a bridge to a deeper understanding of our own region – even in the middle of uncertain political times.

2. Which team are you particularly looking forward to watching and why?

Iraq. The 2007 Asian champions emerged from deep political problems with a generation at the height of their powers;now they arrive in Australia from a nation bogged down in an intractable cycle of violence but with a team of 21 and 22-year-olds set to light up the nation. An enigmatic side with the capability of both finishing bottom of the group or actually winning the tournament, they come with a team flush with exciting young talent – the poised central defender Ahmed Ibrahim, composed central midfielders Saad Abdul-Amir and Yaser Kasim and the diminutive 18 year old playmaker, Humam Tariq, dubbed the Iraqi Messi – and for good reason. With 19 of their 23-man squad aged 23 or younger, win, lose or draw they'll certainly be entertaining.

3. Who will make a name for themselves in this tournament?

From a team perspective either Qatar or the UAE. Both nations are investing heavily in football and Qatar, particularly, have some of the world's best resources available – a final appearance for either nation wouldn't surprise. Individually there are a host of young stars waiting to emerge for Australian audiences; Iraq's left fullback Ali Adnan, volatile Qatari defender Abdulkareem Hassan, Palestinian playmaker Ashraf Nu'man, Iranian forward Sardar Azmoun and the mercurial Emirati Number 10, Omar Abdulrahman – a player so gifted he could walk into virtually any European club.

4. What will a successful tournament look like for a) the Socceroos and b) the AFC?

For the Socceroos anything less than a semi-final appearance will be viewed in a dim light and the broader expectation is of a title on home soil – how the players respond to this pressure may be a key factor in how far they progress. From an AFC perspective, it's about avoiding the negatives – no crowd trouble, no major refereeing clangers and no repeat of the ticketing fiasco from the final in Qatar four years ago.

5. Everyone needs a second team. Who should it be and why?

Palestine are likely to be most neutrals' favourite, although they are at short odds to finish as the whippings boys in Group D. The side qualified as winners of the 2014 Challenge Cup – a tournament for emerging nations that has now been scrapped – so their role as underdogs is well-earned. Yet it's the story of a team drawn predominantly from the semi-professional West Bank Premier League and the spectre of emerging from a lengthy and deadly battle with the Israeli occupation that is likely to see Palestine backed to upset the odds and perhaps gain a point, especially against neighbouring Jordan with a significant Palestinian population.

6. Tell me one thing I should not miss in this tournament.

The fans. Some of the world's fiercest – and most lively – club derbies are in Asia and the fans of Iran, Iraq and Japan in particular are likely to be a tournament highlight. Football fans in most Asian nations live and breathe the game and that often comes with a fanatical support; colours, music, dancing and the joy of the game. Take time to say hello, learn a little bit about our Asian neighbours and enjoy the rare opportunity this coming-together provides.

7. Prediction time. Who's going to win and why?

Despite their coach being embroiled in a match-fixing scandal and patchy recent performances, Japan still possess more players capable of changing a match than any other nation here. Being drawn in a soft group allows the team the chance to ease into the tournament and with a mixture of experienced campaigners, including J.League MVP Yasuhito Endo and European stars Keisuke Honda, Shinji Kagawa and Shinji Okazaki, as well as some exciting young talent led by FC Tokyo's Yoshinori Muto, Japan could well claim their fifth Asian Cup.
