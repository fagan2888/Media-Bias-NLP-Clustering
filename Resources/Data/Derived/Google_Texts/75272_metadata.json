Total A/R over the same time period from uninsured self-pay patients decreased 22 percent, mostly as a result of high financial risk patients joining Medicaid in expansion states.\n\nFor every one uninsured self-pay patient payment dollar in the first quarter this year, there were approximately 22 insured self-pay patient payment dollars. Lower average payments from the insured self-pay population weigh more heavily than uninsured payments on a provider\u2019s bottom line, according to the report.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance is expensive, what used to be a small part of somebody\u2019s income and has become a large part,\u201d Levitt said in the Healthcare Finance article.\n\nOn the front end, a hospital can use a credit report to determine a consumers\u2019 ability to pay their portion of a medical bill. David Esquivel, an attorney with Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville, Tenn., said in the article that collection agencies use credit reports on the back end if they are working on accounts for a healthcare provider client.\n\n\u201cA credit report can show if the patient has a long history of not paying his or her bills, or whether good credit history indicates payment is worth pursuing,\u201d according to Healthcare Finance.\n\nA more detailed report can highlight consumers\u2019 \u201clifestyle choices\u201d and what they spend their money on in addition to how they keep up with their bills, according to the article.\n\nThe cost of credit reports range from 50 cents up to $1.25, adding up to between $10,000 and $15,000 per month.\n\nIn 2015, three of the major U.S. consumer reporting agencies, Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, announced the National Consumer Assistance Plan, which includes changes to how consumers\u2019 medical debts are listed on their credit reports, ACA reported in Pulse.\n\nThe plan for CRAs aims to enhance their ability to collect complete and accurate consumer information and will provide consumers more transparency and a better experience interacting with credit bureaus about their consumer credit reports.\n\nMedical debts won\u2019t be reported until after a 180-day waiting period from the date of delinquency.\n\nThe plan will ensure medical debt information on consumers\u2019 credit reports is accurate for healthcare providers evaluating those reports, but other details about their bill pay history and spending habits can be helpful if providers choose to access services that provide more in-depth reports.\n\nFollow ACA on Twitter @ACAIntl and @acacollector or Facebook for news and event updates.
