Liberals are playing with theories. They range from the man is brilliant but may be an idiot savant or that he only knows one thing but knows it\u2019s really well to the theory that he\u2019s a freaking idiot or a sociopath. Carson supporters tend to ignore it.\n\nNews came out that Dr. Carson stated seven years ago that the Egyptian pyramids were not built to serve as tombs but to store grain. You would think if you Googled \u201cCarson\u201d and \u201cpyramid\u201d that the word \u201cscheme\u201d would show up. But anyway, it\u2019s a \u201cGod thing\u201d for Carson. I really don\u2019t like to disrespect anyone\u2019s faith, but it\u2019s hard when people use it to justify their stupidity.\n\nIntelligent people are actually having to spend time explaining why this ridiculous pyramid belief is not true. But does Carson still feel that way? You bet he does. He doubled down on it. He also stated that many scientists believe aliens built the pyramids. Now I don\u2019t think the man knows what a scientist is.\n\nLet\u2019s waste a little space and play with crazy: The pyramids are not hollow. Scientists don\u2019t believe aliens built them. The Egyptians actually wrote what the pyramids were for. The pyramids\u2019 purpose is not a mystery. It\u2019s not Stonehenge, but someone should ask Dr. Carson about that. Maybe he\u2019ll say Jesus built them as a testament that gay people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sing karaoke.\n\nToday, many people are thinking Carson is crazy, yet it may not be the most baffling thing he\u2019s claimed.\n\nThis man has stated he\u2019s qualified to serve as president because the Titanic, which sank, was built by professionals. Noah\u2019s Ark was built by amateurs. Got a headache yet? The Titanic was real. Noah\u2019s Ark is mythology. And I don\u2019t care how much God has faith in the guy, I\u2019d rather take a Carnival cruise than ride on a wooden boat built by a 300-year-old man.\n\nHe\u2019s also stated people go into prison straight and come out gay.\n\nHe claims he never had an involvement with a company selling snake oil despite being paid by them to give speeches and being prominently featured on their website.\n\nHe\u2019s stated Obamacare is worse than slavery. That\u2019s red meat for Republicans.\n\nHe believes Fox News has saved the United States from becoming another Cuba.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand the debt ceiling. He\u2019s believes Congress can remove Supreme Court Justices if they rule an opinion the majority of citizens don\u2019t like.\n\nWhile saying people should rush shooters, he described an incident when he had a gun pulled on him in a Baltimore Popeyes (in which he did not actually rush the gunman but rather told him he needed to rob the man behind the counter). The Baltimore police say they can\u2019t verify the incident ever happened.\n\nSpeaking of being unable to verify stuff Carson claims, he says he was violent when he was younger. He attacked his mother once and his brother pulled him off. He attacked people with rocks, bricks and baseball bats. He once attempted to stab a fellow student when he was a teenager. CNN tried talking to people who knew Carson when he was younger, and not one person can remember him ever being a hostile person. It\u2019s called lying.\n\nA lot of conservatives have this narrative that Obama came out of nowhere. That nobody knew him when he was younger, as a kid, or as a high school or college student. That\u2019s really not true, but they still believe it. It will be interesting to see how these people handle Carson\u2019s fictional violent childhood as a member of The Warriors.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s funnier, the stuff Carson says or the fact he\u2019s leading in a lot of polls.\n\nI\u2019m OK with Carson and Trump leading the polls. If Republicans are too stupid to nominate someone with real talent and a real danger of winning, like Marco Rubio, then that\u2019s fine with me.\n\nhttp://claytoonz.com/2015/11/06/ben-carson-and-a-grain-of-truth/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Carson stated seven years ago that the Egyptian pyramids were not built to serve as tombs but to store grain ...
