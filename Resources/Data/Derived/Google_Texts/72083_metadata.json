(Photo: Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office)\n\nA Freehold man was arrested in the shooting death of a man whose body was discovered Thursday inside a defunct restaurant in Jackson.\n\nHector Calderon, 47, was charged with murdering 34-year-old Peyman Sanandaji during an altercation between the two men. Sanandaji was shot multiple times, police said.\n\nMORE: Jackson man found dead in Casanova Ristorante\n\nAuthorities found Sanandaji\u2019s body in the shuttered Casanova Ristorante, in Romeo\u2019s Plaza on New Prospect Road, around 11 p.m. Thursday after receiving a report about an injured employee.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office spokesman Al Della Fave said Calderon and Sanandaji were acquaintances and went to the restaurant for \u201csome type of meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they were meeting about, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Della Fave said.\n\nCalderon was arrested at his South Street home in Freehold just before noon on Friday, authorities said.\n\nHe was charged with murder, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Calderon was being held at Ocean County Jail on $1 million bail.\n\nThe shooting, which has been ruled a homicide, shook up some nearby merchants in the township, which before Thursday had not seen a murder since 2010, according to police records. Prior to that, the last murder was in 2004.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s too close to home,\u201d said Joe Napolitano, who runs the deli in the Italian market two doors down from where Sanandaji\u2019s body was found.\n\nJackson Police Chief Matthew D. Kunz said there are no signs of danger to the community.\n\n\u201cI believe this is an isolated incident involving these acquaintances,\u201d Kunz said. \u201cAnd it certainly is not indicative of any criminal trend in the area that would suggest that the area is any less safe.\u201d\n\nOfficials said Casanova Ristorante was once a popular eatery for local families but has sat idle since it closed a few years ago.\n\nIt is unclear if Calderon or Sanandaji had any connection with the restaurant.\n\nJackson Mayor Michael Reina said he was \u201csaddened\u201d to learn of the passing of a township resident.\n\n\u201cThis is something that doesn\u2019t happen in Jackson,\u201d Reina said. \u201cAnd it kind of took everybody by surprise.\u201d\n\nAuthorities on Saturday declined to release any further details on the murder, saying it was an active investigation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1yllWKt", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Freehold man has been arrested in the shooting death of a man whose body was discovered Thursday inside a defunct restaurant in Jackson.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A Freehold man has been arrested in the shooting death of a man whose body was discovered Thursday inside a defunct restaurant in Jackson.", "title": "Man arrested in Jackson murder", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/04/11/man-arrested-jackson-murder/25629253/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Freehold man has been arrested in the shooting death of a man whose body was discovered Thursday inside a defunct restaurant in Jackson.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37d2173d6c52b3c946a4d250321ba7e01441e9c7/c=0-60-480-540&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/04/11/B9316944752Z.1_20150411152411_000_GF8AFNP86.1-0.jpg", "title": "Man arrested in Jackson murder", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicquel.terry"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Freehold, Jackson, murder, Casanova Ristorante"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbc0\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office)A Freehold man was arrested in the shooting death of a man whose body was discovered Thursday inside a defunct restaurant in Jackson.\nHe was charged with murder, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.\nHector Calderon is charged with murder.\nCalderon was arrested at his South Street home in Freehold just before noon on Friday, authorities said.\nMORE: Jackson man found dead in Casanova RistoranteAuthorities found Sanandaji\u2019s body in the shuttered Casanova Ristorante, in Romeo\u2019s Plaza on New Prospect Road, around 11 p.m. Thursday after receiving a report about an injured employee."}
