But he believed it was the Shahada, or declaration of faith, largely because a black flag with white writing in a contemporary context often contains that message. He said he could make out the word \u201cMuhammad.\u201d\n\nAli said the Shahada translates as \u201cThere is no deity of worship except God (Allah), and Muhammad is the messenger of God.\u201d It is considered the first pillar of Islam\u2019s five pillars of faith, and has been used by groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State but wasn\u2019t invented by them, Ali said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,\u201d Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra. \u201cWe have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, there are people who would wish to do us harm.\u201d\n\nA police spokeswoman said no injuries had been reported from the incident. Heavily armed officers were lined up outside the cafe, and a man with a backpack inside the cafe could be seen walking back and forth in front of the glass doors.\n\nAbbott said the National Security Committee of Cabinet met to be briefed on the situation.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAustralia is a peaceful, open and generous society \u2013 nothing should ever change that. And that\u2019s why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual.\u201d\n\nThe cafe is located in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city\u2019s financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. It is home to the state premier\u2019s office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of the nation\u2019s largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away.\n\nStreets in the area were closed, offices evacuated and the public told to stay away.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A hostage situation erupted inside a chocolate shop and cafe in Australia's largest city on Monday, with the nation's prime minister saying it may be \"politically motivated.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A hostage situation erupted inside a chocolate shop and cafe in Australia\u2019s largest city on Monday, with the nation\u2019s prime minister saying it may be \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d", "title": "Hostages held in Sydney, Australia cafe; black flag with Arabic writing displayed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/14/hostages-held-sydney-australia-cafe-black-flag-ara/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/australia-police-operationjpeg-07d50.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/australia-police-operationjpeg-07d50.jpg", "description": "A hostage situation erupted inside a chocolate shop and cafe in Australia's largest city on Monday, with the nation's prime minister saying it may be \"politically motivated.\"", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Hostages held in Sydney, Australia cafe; black flag with Arabic writin"}, "Author": "Kristen Gelineau", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Australia, Zain Ali, Tony Abbott"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc53f\"", "article_summary": "But he believed it was the Shahada, or declaration of faith, largely because a black flag with white writing in a contemporary context often contains that message.\nTelevision footage shot through the cafe\u2019s windows showed several people with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people holding up what appeared to be a black flag with white Arabic writing on it.\nIt is home to the state premier\u2019s office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of the nation\u2019s largest banks.\nHeavily armed officers were lined up outside the cafe, and a man with a backpack inside the cafe could be seen walking back and forth in front of the glass doors.\n\u201cThe whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,\u201d Abbott said."}
