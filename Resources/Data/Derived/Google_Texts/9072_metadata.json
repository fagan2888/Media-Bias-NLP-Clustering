He also said an autopsy is being performed to identify the exact cause of Chris' death.\n\nThroughout the entire legal ordeal, Chris' mother Evelyn did not give up on her son and never left his bedside. She said today in a statement:\n\nChris' family and I are grateful for all of the prayers, kind notes of encouragement, and support we have received from around the world. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the nurses who have cared for Chris and for Methodist Hospital for continuing life-sustaining treatment of Chris until his natural death. Chris' health battle has now ended, but I intend to continue the fight against this horrible law. No family should have to fight for the right to life of their loved one.\n\nChris was 46 years old.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/breaking-texas-hospital-patient-previously-fighting-for-his-life-died-this", "image": "http://www.churchmilitant.com//images/social_images/2015-12-23-gonzalez-c.jpg", "title": "Texas Hospital Patient at Center of Pro-Life Battle Dies"}, "twitter": {"site": "@church_militant", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Texas Hospital Patient at Center of Pro-Life Battle Dies"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Throughout the entire legal ordeal, Chris' mother Evelyn did not give up on her son and never left his bedside.\nWe would like to express our deepest gratitude to the nurses who have cared for Chris and for Methodist Hospital for continuing life-sustaining treatment of Chris until his natural death.\nChris' health battle has now ended, but I intend to continue the fight against this horrible law.\nHe also said an autopsy is being performed to identify the exact cause of Chris' death.\nNo family should have to fight for the right to life of their loved one."}
