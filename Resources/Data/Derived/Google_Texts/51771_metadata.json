In preparation for this new law, the Marion Police Department and Modern Outfitters have teamed up for a \u201cRights and Responsibilities\u201d presentation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go over different techniques, different mindsets and how that affects people both, emotionally afterwards as well as financially with lawsuits and the responsibility that goes with owning a firearm,\u201d Eric Stubbs with Modern Outfitters says.\n\nMarion Police Chief Randall Davis says his department has decided to take a proactive approach with new gun laws. He says he wants to let the public know the rights and wrongs in a class setting instead of elsewhere when a law might be unknowingly broken.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s our duty to inform people and let them know about these new laws. We\u2019ve teamed up with the experts at Modern Outfitters to help us do that,\u201d Marion Police Chief Randall Davis says.\n\nStubbs says the two hour class will be perfect for those who might not know even own a gun or know much about them.\n\n\u201cThis is the perfect class for anyone who is a beginner. Anyone that is new to firearms, anybody that is looking to get a gun for the first time. We will go over how they operate and some different things to consider when purchasing a firearm,\u201d Stubbs says.\n\nThe class will be Tuesday June 23rd at 6:30pm.\n\nIt will be held inside of the Hamasa Shriner\u2019s building in Marion.\n\nThe class will be free and open to all\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Marion Police Dept. is teaming up with Modern Outfitters to teach a free, public class on guns and gun safety.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "The Marion Police Dept. is teaming up with Modern Outfitters to teach a free, public class on guns and gun safety.", "title": "Marion PD and Modern Outfitters to Hold Class about Firearms and Safety", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Marion-PD-and-Modern-Outfitters-to-Hold-Class-about-Firearms-and-Safety-307315201.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B28/D39/B28D39CE015C4EE78E50A857B1EF0B85", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/097/B80/097B80AD6C1A4F5E89780A2B0B6A9321.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Marion Police Dept. is teaming up with Modern Outfitters to teach a free, public class on guns and gun safety.", "title": "Marion PD and Modern Outfitters to Hold Class about Firearms and Safety", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Marion-PD-and-Modern-Outfitters-to-Hold-Class-about-Firearms-and-Safety-307315201.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Modern+Outfitters+Glock.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Marion PD and Modern Outfitters to Hold Class about Firearms and Safety", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Marion PD and Modern Outfitters, to Hold Class about Firearms"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc17b\"", "article_summary": "In preparation for this new law, the Marion Police Department and Modern Outfitters have teamed up for a \u201cRights and Responsibilities\u201d presentation.\nWe\u2019ve teamed up with the experts at Modern Outfitters to help us do that,\u201d Marion Police Chief Randall Davis says.\nMarion Police Chief Randall Davis says his department has decided to take a proactive approach with new gun laws.\nStubbs says the two hour class will be perfect for those who might not know even own a gun or know much about them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go over different techniques, different mindsets and how that affects people both, emotionally afterwards as well as financially with lawsuits and the responsibility that goes with owning a firearm,\u201d Eric Stubbs with Modern Outfitters says."}
