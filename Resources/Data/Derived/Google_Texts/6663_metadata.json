Nicole Huberfeld, a professor of law at the University of Kentucky College of Law and bioethics associate at the College of Medicine, told California Healthline that both laws prompted \u201ccries of \u2018socialized medicine,\u2019 which have always been the rallying cry of the politicians and stakeholders who oppose health care reform.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Sally Pipes, president and CEO of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute, told California Healthline that both Medicare and the ACA \u201cput government in increasing control of our health care system and will lead, in my mind, to government completely controlling the health care system.\u201d\n\nSuch criticism stems from \u201ca centuries-old debate in the U.S. about centralization versus decentralization\u201d of the health care system, Commonwealth Fund President David Blumenthal told California Healthline.\n\nBlumenthal said, \u201cBoth [laws] were extremely controversial. In both cases they instigated controversies about the proper role of government in health care and in American life more generally, in both cases they were accomplished using similar legislative strategies \u2026 [and] both extended coverage and, in that sense, were rare events in the history of U.S. health care.\u201d\n\nLaws Are More Different Than They May Seem\n\nHowever, Blumenthal said similarities between Medicare and the ACA \u201care high level \u2014 the more closely you look at it the more the differences are apparent,\u201d adding, \u201cThe differences have to do with the complexity of the legislation and the complexity of the goals of the legislation.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Huberfeld noted that while \u201cMedicare is a purely federal program,\u201d the \u201cACA relies heavily on the private insurance markets across the country.\u201d\n\nAnother major difference is that the ACA is financially sustainable, while Medicare is expected to become insolvent before 2030. The ACA includes measures to offset the cost of the law, while Medicare spending is growing as its enrollment increases with an influx of baby boomers.\n\nIn addition, Blumenthal said, \u201cThe Medicare program and the Medicaid program aimed to take care of segments of the U.S. population,\u201d while the ACA \u201cattempts to really much more comprehensively offer coverage to \u2026 everyone but the elderly. That\u2019s a much more complicated thing to do.\u201d\n\nFurther, \u201cThe politics have been very different\u201d with the ACA than they were when Medicare was passed, Blumenthal said.\n\nFor one thing, \u201cMedicare was more thoroughly vetted politically before it passed than was the ACA,\u201d Blumenthal said. He noted that legislative models for Medicare were debated for a decade and there had been votes on the program in the Senate during President Kennedy\u2019s administration that \u201chad come close but had not passed.\u201d There also had been two presidential elections \u2014 in 1960 and 1964 \u2014 in which Medicare was featured, Blumenthal said.\n\nThe ACA also \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a constituency, and the Medicare program has among the most powerful constituencies that exists in the U.S., and that has enabled the program to overcome the partisan elements much faster than the ACA has been able to do,\u201d he said.\n\nBlumenthal added, \u201cNow, unlike in 1965, almost every large segment of the American population has insurance, the people who don\u2019t have insurance don\u2019t tend to have a unique or separate political identity. \u2026 They\u2019re not organizable.\u201d\n\nHow the ACA Is Building on Medicare\n\nMeanwhile, the ACA \u201ccontains key reforms intended to address some of Medicare\u2019s ongoing challenges,\u201d such as:\n\nClosing the so-called \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d in the program\u2019s Part D prescription drug coverage;\n\nCovering all preventive care services without beneficiary cost-sharing;\n\nCreating the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation; and\n\nExpanding on payment reforms, including through the Medicare Shared Savings Program, by creating incentives for reduced hospital admissions and hospital-acquired infections, and by expanding pay-for-value programs.\n\nBlumenthal said, \u201cThe ACA is part of the solution to the future of Medicare, but not the entire solution. The reforms \u2026 that it is trying to promote will be extremely helpful to containing cost in Medicare and increasing value to Medicare patients if those reforms are successful.\n\n\u201cA lot of things the ACA is trying to accomplish are core to the Medicare agenda as well,\u201d he added. However, he said, \u201cThere are some things \u2026 unique to Medicare that would probably require different legislation to accomplish.\u201d\n\nRelatedly, Huberfeld said that while the Medicare-related portions of the ACA are important, \u201cMedicare was a relatively minor part of the ACA.\u201d\n\nA recent New England Journal of Medicine report \u2014 which Blumenthal wrote \u2014 notes that although \u201cthe ACA has filled in some remaining gaps in Medicare benefits, the program still has substantial limitations in coverage.\u201d As a result, about 90% of Medicare beneficiaries are covered by supplemental insurance.\n\nHowever, Pipes said \u201cthe ACA is detrimental to the survival of the Medicare program,\u201d noting that the law \u201ccuts to Medicare over 10 years to help fund the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the two laws are tied together by a common goal \u2014 increasing the insured rate in the U.S.\n\nRegardless of its tumultuous start, Medicare now has strong support by the large group of Americans it is meant to help and the ACA has only made it stronger.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the ACA will have the same strong support five decades from now.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nReform efforts driving up some costs.

Montana Republicans are pushing legislation that would expand Medicaid eligibility to about 10,000 veterans, low-income parents and some residents with disabilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just like the Affordable Care Act, Medicare went through some growing pains when it started 50 years ago.
