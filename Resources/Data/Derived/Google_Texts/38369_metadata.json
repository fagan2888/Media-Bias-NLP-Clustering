Chris Christie questioned New York City\u2019s low crime statistics this week, he \u201cmade a fool of himself,\u2019\u2019 according to New York City\u2019s top cop.\n\n\u201cWhen he gets Trenton, when he gets Newark, when he gets Camden to be anywhere near as safe as New York City, then he might be able to criticize us,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said of the Republican candidate for president.\n\nBratton in a cable television interview pointed out that Camden\u2019s murder rate is 10 times higher than New York\u2019s.\n\nSee the interview: NYC top cop hits back at Christie\n\nChristie, who is campaigning in Minnesota and Illinois Thursday, launched his attack Tuesday on MSNBC when he held up a New York Post front page referencing a shooting.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio and wife Chirlane McCray had appeared on the program and touted the city\u2019s low summer crime statistics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just stunned \u2014 as are most people who live in this area \u2014 that this has been the safest summer in New York,\u201d Christie said. \u201cNo one else believes that, except for the two people who were just on your set.\u201d\n\nBratton shot back the next day as news made the rounds that the head of United Airlines resigned amid an investigation into his dealings with Christie\u2019s former Port Authority chairman, David Samson.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a little scandal going on over there in New Jersey today that he\u2019s looking to deflect attention from,\u201d Bratton said. \u201cBridgegate has reared its ugly head with the United Airlines scandal...so maybe the governor is looking to deflect some attention away from that issue.\u201d\n\nBob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
