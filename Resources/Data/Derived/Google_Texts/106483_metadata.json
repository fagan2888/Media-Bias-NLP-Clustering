But if Medicaid plans want to succeed, they\u2019ll need to work closely with government agencies to address the many challenges associated with treating former inmates.

Those with mental illness who are taking medication or seeing therapists are less likely to act out in ways that land them back behind bars. Research has shown that health care, particularly in the areas of substance abuse and mental illness, reduces the likelihood of ex-offenders returning to prison.\u2019 \u2018We know that many persons who have been incarcerated have limited or no experience\u2019 with health care, says Barbara Gordon, director of social services for KIPDA.

Prison is more structured Anne Peak, KIPDA\u2019s social services planner, says that the agency has trouble enrolling about-to-be released jail inmates because people in jail have a much shorter length of incarceration. \u2018The prison system is more structured because inmates\u2019 length of stay is longer,\u2019 she says. \u2018This makes it easier to create a systematic intervention process within the prison system.\u2019 Education is key The Department of Corrections is working on the idea of informing these departing inmates about, and connecting them with, Medicaid or subsidized insurance plans. KIPDA is looking to expand its multichapter education program, which includes a health literacy program, throughout the jails in the 16-county area it covers and other parts of the state. \u2018We are trying to branch out to get other prison systems involved and are currently in talks between the Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and institutions here in Kentucky to provide a comprehensive education-and-enrollment process.\u2019 \u2018Jails and prisons have very regulated security protocols and systems,\u2019 Gordon says. \u2018If someone, one of our kynectors, for example, is coming into a facility to sign up a prisoner for health care, they would normally use their cell phone to access a secure line.

According to a September Kaiser Foundation report titled Health Coverage and Care for the Adult Criminal Justice-Involved Population, \u2018Expanding health insurance to these individuals will likely facilitate their ability to access needed care and manage their ongoing conditions.\u2019 The report noted reduced recidivism in Michigan after implementation of an initiative that links newly released prisoners to a medical home; helps them gain access to needed medications, primary care, and specialty care; and helps them to obtain their medical records upon release. \u2018Studies in Florida and Washington found that people with severe mental illness who were enrolled in Medicaid while in jail were more likely to access community mental health and substance abuse services than those without Medicaid,\u2019 according to the report, and \u201812 months after release, Medicaid enrollees had 16% fewer detentions and stayed out of jail longer than those who either were not enrolled or had been enrolled for a shorter time.\u2019 While extending care under the ACA may seem like a good idea from a social perspective, implementation is slow. \u2018This is very new,\u2019 Edelson, of UnitedHealthcare, says. \u2018Each state is different.\u2019 Achieving good results will require careful planning and coordination among suppliers, including health care and health insurance programs, Medicaid, and providers. \u2018When the right thing to do aligns with the financial benefit, it is a pretty powerful combination,\u2019 ASTHO\u2019s Jarris adds.    Here\u2019s how Kentucky helps Medicaid plans Never has managed care stepped so boldly into the public policy arena (managed Medicaid has three times the enrollment of Medicare Advantage), and rarely have the stakes been so high. But if Medicaid plans want to succeed, they\u2019ll need to work closely with government agencies to address the many challenges associated with treating former inmates. Advocates say that providing Medicaid benefits to former inmates who qualify could cut the costs of treating neglected illnesses, help to keep the mentally ill on their medications, and provide treatment for the addicted \u2014 all of which can reduce recidivism. PEW\u2019s take A PEW Trust report states, \u2018Addicts who no longer use drugs no longer need to be involved in illegal activities to finance their habit. Those with mental illness who are taking medication or seeing therapists are less likely to act out in ways that land them back behind bars. Research has shown that health care, particularly in the areas of substance abuse and mental illness, reduces the likelihood of ex-offenders returning to prison.\u2019   \u2018We know that many persons who have been incarcerated have limited or no experience\u2019 with health care, says Barbara Gordon, director of social services for KIPDA.  Barbara Gordon, director of social services for Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency (KIPDA), says her agency is partnering with the Louisville Department of Corrections to help former inmates. \u2018It\u2019s a multiprong initiative,\u2019 she says. Her agency provides \u2018kynectors,\u2019 who are in-person navigators to help people sign up in the Louisville region. Prison is more structured Anne Peak, KIPDA\u2019s social services planner, says that the agency has trouble enrolling about-to-be released jail inmates because people in jail have a much shorter length of incarceration. \u2018The prison system is more structured because inmates\u2019 length of stay is longer,\u2019 she says. \u2018This makes it easier to create a systematic intervention process within the prison system.\u2019 Education is key The Department of Corrections is working on the idea of informing these departing inmates about, and connecting them with, Medicaid or subsidized insurance plans. KIPDA is looking to expand its multichapter education program, which includes a health literacy program, throughout the jails in the 16-county area it covers and other parts of the state. \u2018We are trying to branch out to get other prison systems involved and are currently in talks between the Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and institutions here in Kentucky to provide a comprehensive education-and-enrollment process.\u2019 \u2018Jails and prisons have very regulated security protocols and systems,\u2019 Gordon says. \u2018If someone, one of our kynectors, for example, is coming into a facility to sign up a prisoner for health care, they would normally use their cell phone to access a secure line. But there is a catch: They can\u2019t use cell phones in the jails or prisons. Currently, the kynectors are registering prisoners by filling out the paperwork, then taking the paperwork out of the jail or prison and inputting the information into the system at another location, for example, the office.\u2019 Support system needed Health care is just the beginning, though. For Medicaid expansion to be effective, a comprehensive support system that includes discharge planning, case management, and access to care must also be implemented. \u2018There are very high rates of chronic physical illnesses and substance disorders among this population,\u2019 says Paul Jarris, MD, MBA, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). \u2018It is essential that when the prisoners are released, there is a transition of care available to them in their community.\u2019 KIPDA has also co-created the HRC \u2014 Healthy Re-entry Coalition of Kentucky \u2014 with other providers and advocates throughout the state to ensure that released prisoners get the full range of education and care that they need. \u2018We know that many persons who have been incarcerated have limited or no experience with health care,\u2019 Gordon says. \u2018They must learn how to use it.\u2019  Nan Myers writes frequently about health care.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dcterms.title": "Managed Medicaid Braces for Influx of Ex-Inmates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2234\"", "article_summary": "It also has rules for community health, mental health, primary care, and medical homes.\n\u2018We know that many persons who have been incarcerated have limited or no experience with health care,\u2019 Gordon says.\nMost people don\u2019t lose sleep worrying about health care services provided to inmates in jails or prisons, but maybe they should.\n\u2018They must learn how to use it.\u2019Nan Myers writes frequently about health care.\n\u2018Each state is different.\u2019 Achieving good results will require careful planning and coordination among suppliers, including health care and health insurance programs, Medicaid, and providers."}
