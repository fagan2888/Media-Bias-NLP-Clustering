With recent minimum wage increases taking place in a number of states and municipalities, families are more likely to hit that threshold sooner.\n\nRead More: Some Americans Would Prefer an IRS Tattoo to Paying Taxes, Survey Says\n\n\"There used to be a gray area, [but] the DOL and IRS have really, really tightened the definition,\" Breedlove said. \"They've essentially said all household workers should be treated as employees,\" he said.\n\nThere also is more awareness on the part of workers about their rights, said Guy Maddalone, founder and CEO of GTM Payroll Services. More are seeking out legal advice, and more attorneys are advertising their services to represent domestic workers.\n\n\"Six states have legislation that secures the rights of domestic workers, and five of those have full bills of rights,\" Marzena Zukowska, spokeswoman for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said in an email. These laws generally spell out (among other things) requirements for tax-related compensation topics like minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed IRS and FBI Issue Urgent Warning Over Pervasive Tax Fraud Scam 2:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nAlong with stricter rules, the government today has a better chance of catching up with people who misclassify the people who do work for them. Since people now have to be able to prove their income to obtain subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance, there is less incentive for childcare, eldercare and other domestic workers to want to get paid off the books, and an additional opportunity for the government to spot discrepancies between reported incomes.\n\nRead More: New Tax Fraud Safeguards May Mean Delays in Getting Refunds\n\nThe rub is that while the stakes are higher, experts say a shift in the way service providers connect with the people they work for has created a knowledge gap that can leave people unaware of who they need to classify as an employee and when.\n\nMaddalone said the rise of \"gig economy\" platforms is disrupting the traditional agency placement model for domestic workers.\n\n\"Their business is shrinking,\" he said, as more workers turn to sites that connect buyers and sellers of services but don't offer any guidance about worker classification or labor law and tax obligations. \"The advice is not getting out there.\"\n\n\"All those sites and boards have really disrupted the ability of the local expert in the community [to] let them know there's certain laws here,\" Maddalone said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should you be worried about the dreaded \"nanny\" tax?While the growing gig economy implicitly treats service providers as independent contractors, fami", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Should you be worried about the dreaded \"nanny\" tax?While the growing gig economy implicitly treats service providers as independent contractors, fami", "title": "'Nanny Tax' Could Trip Up More Taxpayers This Year", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/nanny-tax-could-trip-more-taxpayers-year-n544341", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_12/1470121/160323-childcare-worker-yh-1128a_8d591ec38ed297924f3a94d3eacf7c16.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Should you be worried about the dreaded \"nanny\" tax?While the growing gig economy implicitly treats service providers as independent contractors, fami", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_12/1470121/160323-childcare-worker-yh-1128a_8d591ec38ed297924f3a94d3eacf7c16.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "'Nanny Tax' Could Trip Up More Taxpayers This Year - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-24", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/nanny-tax-could-trip-more-taxpayers-year-n544341", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Business,Taxes"}, "article_summary": "\"Six states have legislation that secures the rights of domestic workers, and five of those have full bills of rights,\" Marzena Zukowska, spokeswoman for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said in an email.\nMaddalone said the rise of \"gig economy\" platforms is disrupting the traditional agency placement model for domestic workers.\nMore are seeking out legal advice, and more attorneys are advertising their services to represent domestic workers.\nShould you be worried about the dreaded \"nanny\" tax?\nThese laws generally spell out (among other things) requirements for tax-related compensation topics like minimum wage and overtime pay."}
