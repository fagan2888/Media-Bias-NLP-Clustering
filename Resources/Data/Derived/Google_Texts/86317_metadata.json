LOUIS \u2014 Rams quarterback Sam Bradford has a torn ACL in his left knee for the second straight year and is out for the season.\n\nCoach Jeff Fisher confirmed the extent of the injury Sunday night, news first reported by ESPN and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\n\u201cWe lost our quarterback,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cFor Sam, it was devastating.\u201d\n\nIn all, five starters were hurt against the Browns.\n\nCornerback Trumaine Johnson was carted off with a knee injury and three others \u2014 guard Rodger Saffold and defensive tackles Kendall Langford and Michael Brockers \u2014 left with ankle injuries.\n\nJohnson will be out 4-6 weeks with an MCL tear, but Fisher said Saffold, Langford and Brockers could play if needed in the preseason finale Thursday at Miami.\n\nBradford was injured in the first quarter of Saturday night\u2019s 33-14 preseason victory at Cleveland. He was hit on his left side by Browns defensive end Armonty Bryant as he threw a pass.\n\nBradford hopped briefly on his right leg before dropping to the ground.\n\nBradford, the first overall pick of the 2010 draft, missed the last nine games last season after getting injured at Carolina. Veteran Shaun Hill is the backup and the Rams also have rookie Garrett Gilbert and Austin Davis on the roster.\n\n\u201cShaun\u2019s our guy,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI brought him here.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Fisher thought Bradford might have hyperextended the knee and was \u201cvery optimistic.\u201d Bradford walked off the field, and then walked to the locker room after the injury.\n\nWide receiver Brian Quick said he was assured by the quarterback that he was \u201cOK.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a tremendous loss for them,\u201d Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \u201cWe knew that it didn\u2019t look like much when it happened, but I just think it was a good amount of weight that got put on it. It\u2019s such an unfortunate thing.\u201d\n\nPettine said there \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t any intent\u201d by Bryant to hurt Bradford.\n\nBradford had 14 touchdown passes and four interceptions last season. The Rams then upgraded their offensive line by drafting guard-tackle Greg Robinson No. 2 overall.\n\nBradford played in two preseason games and was 4 for 9 for 77 yards against the Browns.\n\nThe 34-year-old Hill has thrown only 16 passes the past three seasons as the backup in Detroit. He made 10 starts in 2010 for the Lions in place of injured Matthew Stafford and beat the Rams for Detroit\u2019s first win after a 0-4 start.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rams QB Sam Bradford out for season after re-tearing ACL", "title": "Rams QB Sam Bradford out for season after re-tearing ACL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/24/rams-qb-sam-bradford-out-for-season-after-re-tearing-acl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__bradfordp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__bradfordp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T15:09:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:17:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded83\"", "article_summary": "ST.
