(KTTC) -- From Med City to Main Street, Southeast Minnesota is home to many different small businesses. However, the vision of a perfect America can greatly vary from one business owner to the next.\n\n\n\nOne of those business owners is Jett Hotopp, who owns the Old Tyme Cafe in Chatfield with his wife. Despite saying things have been trending upward for his business since the recession.\n\nHotopp hopes that President Obama takes the needs of small towns like Chatfield, population 2,800, more seriously. \"I wish he would work a little bit harder to help out the Main Street people and not the Wall Street people,\" said Hotopp.\n\nHotopp says Obamacare and the rising minimum wage may have dire implications for small businesses like his. \"Because we take credit cards, we have to pay that as well as wages,\" said Hotopp. \"It's a detriment to us.\"\n\nIn Rochester, population 106,000, the bustling city's viewpoint is a stark difference from that of small town Chatfield. For Svaar Vinje, owner of the Knight's Chamber suit store in downtown Rochester, his ideal future is centered around America building around its middle class.\n\n\"It's always been a defining part of the growth in America's economy,\" said Vinje. \"We've always had a strong middle class, we need to insure that it continues to thrive and prosper.\"\n\nWhile Vinje's clientele differs greatly from Hotopp's, they both share the desire to help the people they serve.\n\n\"People are an investment, and you want to see people and invest in people that you get a good return on,\" said Vinje.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "CHATFIELD, Minn.
