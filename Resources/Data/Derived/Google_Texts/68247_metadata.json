(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nAs we begin to worry about the possibility of an Ebola epidemic taking hold in the United States, we must not forget the epidemic already firmly rooted here. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has raged for more than 30 years in this country with more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. living with HIV/AIDS and African Americans experiencing \u201cthe most severe burden of HIV,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control. While a positive diagnosis no longer means guaranteed death, it does mean a life of expensive medications and care to manage the chronic disease. Lack of awareness and of access to care continue to help spread an infection that is relatively easy to avoid.\n\nThe arrival of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 improved health care options for people living with HIV/AIDS. Insurance coverage was finally possible because the law prohibited insurers from denying health coverage because of a preexisting condition. And that meant access to care and medications that prolong life and help slow the epidemic\u2019s rate of transmission. The expansion of Medicaid would loop even more people with HIV/AIDS into care.\n\nThe imperative of doing so was vividly demonstrated in three maps presented by Lauren Banks of AIDS Alabama during a panel I moderated on HIV/AIDS at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation legislative conference late last month. Right now, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid. The states that have yet to extend the federal government health care program are also home to some of the highest concentrations of HIV infections and those living with HIV/AIDS. To see those maps is to wonder why governors and state legislators in those states seem willing to deprive their citizens of health care and the life-prolonging and life-saving treatment that come with it.\n\nThe first map Banks presented showed the \u201crates of persons living with an HIV diagnosis, by county.\u201d The heavy concentrations in the South, Northeast and urban areas are hard to miss. Those counties in the deepest red reported a rate of more than 384 persons per 100,000 living with HIV or an AIDS diagnosis as of 2010.\n\n\n\n(Courtsey AIDSVu)\n\nThe second map Banks presented showed the data filtered to just show the rate of African Americans living with an HIV or AIDS diagnosis. The first thing you notice is that the areas of highest concentration on this map are almost identical to those in the map above. Those counties in the deepest red reported a rate of more than 1,061 persons per 100,000 living with HIV or an AIDS diagnosis as of 2010.\n\n\n\n(Courtsey AIDSVu)\n\nNow, look at the map below to see the stark and disparate impact of this epidemic on blacks and whites. Banks didn\u2019t show this next map, but I found it while researching this post.\n\n\n\n(Courtsey AIDSVu)\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, an estimated 50,000 people tested positive for HIV in the United States in 2011. African Americans \u201caccounted for an estimated 44 percent of new HIV infections in 2010\u201d and \u201caccounted for 44 percent of people living with HIV infection in 2009.\u201d\n\nOther data from the CDC show the South had the highest percentage of new AIDS diagnoses (45 percent) at the end of 2010. The South had the highest percentage of people \u201cliving with an AIDS diagnosis\u201d (40 percent) in 2009. And the South \u201caccounted for 48 percent of the 17,774 persons with a diagnosis of AIDS who died in the 50 states and the District.\u201d\n\nAnd this brings me to the third map Banks presented during the panel, which shows the status of Medicaid expansion. You don\u2019t need to be a geography whiz to see that the HIV/AIDS epidemic rages in the Southern states that are \u201cnot moving forward at this time\u201d on Medicaid expansion.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation)\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) reported last March on a study which estimated that \u201cnearly 115,000 uninsured, low-income people living with HIV/AIDS would be eligible for Medicaid if all states adopted the expansion.\u201d But it added, \u201cOf these, nearly 60,000 live in states not moving forward with the Medicaid expansion.\u201d The KHN story notes that \u201cAbout 70 percent of the group living in states not expanding Medicaid earn too little to qualify for financial help to buy insurance in the marketplaces created by the health law.\u201d\n\nSylvia Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, is in talks with the governors of Tennessee, Utah and Indiana to expand Medicaid in their states. This is great, but there is no action in the states where it is needed most in the fight against HIV/AIDS. And an HHS official told me Friday that the agency has \u201cworked with both Democratic and Republican Governors to be flexible so they can design a solution that works best for their states and their low-income residents.\u201d The official added, \u201cAs we approach open enrollment for 2015, we urge all Governors to help people both get covered and stay covered, and we are committed to working with all states to implement Medicaid expansion in a way that maximizes coverage options for uninsured residents.\u201d\n\nIf the moral argument for the need to extend health coverage to all those who want and need it doesn\u2019t hold sway then perhaps the economic one will. The ACA mandates full federal financing of a state\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Starting in 2017, that 100 percent federal match will gradually taper to and remain at 90 percent by 2020. Thus, the remaining 23 states that haven\u2019t done so are leaving money on the table that could help thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS to get health coverage, care and treatment for \u201ca big disease with a little name.\u201d Knowing that, it takes a special kind of callousness to continue to say no to those in need.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four maps show the imperative in expanding Medicaid.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Four maps show the imperative in expanding Medicaid.", "title": "States not expanding Medicaid hobble the fight against HIV/AIDS", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/10/06/states-not-expanding-medicaid-hobble-the-fight-against-hivaids/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/files/2014/10/HIVWhiteHouseProtest2012.jpeg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@capehartj"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/10/06/states-not-expanding-medicaid-hobble-the-fight-against-hivaids/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rates of persons living with an HIV, aidsvu.org, hiv, aids, hiv/aids, congressional black caucus foundation, lauren banks, aids alabama, Centers for Disease Control, medicaid, kaiser health news, medicaid expansion, ebola, chronic disease, aids chronic disease, aids epidemic, affordable care act, expansion of medicaid, congressional black caucus, sylvia burwell, hhs secretary burwell, a big disease with a little name, federal match medicaid expansion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rates of persons living with an HIV, aidsvu.org, hiv, aids, hiv/aids, congressional black caucus foundation, lauren banks, aids alabama, Centers for Disease Control, medicaid, kaiser health news, medicaid expansion, ebola, chronic disease, aids chronic disease, aids epidemic, affordable care act, expansion of medicaid, congressional black caucus, sylvia burwell, hhs secretary burwell, a big disease with a little name, federal match medicaid expansion"}, "article_summary": "The ACA mandates full federal financing of a state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nThe arrival of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 improved health care options for people living with HIV/AIDS.\nThis is great, but there is no action in the states where it is needed most in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\nThe expansion of Medicaid would loop even more people with HIV/AIDS into care.\nThe South had the highest percentage of people \u201cliving with an AIDS diagnosis\u201d (40 percent) in 2009."}
