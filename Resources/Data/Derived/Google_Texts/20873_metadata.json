The man, whose face was covered, also threatened to execute another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, if the U.S. involvement in Iraq continues.\n\nHowever, judging from the public outcry over Foley\u2019s murder, it seems possible that support for President Obama\u2019s limited efforts to impede the progress of IS, rather than being cooled, may be strengthened going forward.\n\nThe decision to recommit even limited American military assets to Iraq was criticized by politicians on the left and right. But an outpouring of disgust in both the traditional media and on social media Wednesday left little doubt that there is now a powerful strain of public opinion in favor of taking further action to rein in \u2013 and severely punish \u2013 the Islamic State.\n\nTo be sure, some warn that further U.S. engagement might be exactly what ISIS wants. But the idea that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, is sitting in the desert playing three-dimensional chess with the U.S. doesn\u2019t hold much water.\n\nRelated: Why Obama\u2019s Mideast Policy Won\u2019t Stop Genocide\n\nWhat ISIS is trying to do, by all accounts, is establish an actual functioning Islamic state or Caliphate in the Middle East. It may be different from its neighbors in that its rulers intend to impose a centuries-old legal system designed to oppress millions of people. But it will not be different in its need for centralized institutions of government, transportation and energy infrastructure, and a more or less public set of leaders.\n\nAll these things are necessary for a functioning state. They are all, also, potential military targets if the U.S. were to decide to intervene against the establishment or the continued existence of the Islamic State.\n\nThe U.S. military has struggled with certain kinds of adversaries over the years. In living memory, the Viet Cong and Al Qaeda, for example, have been challenging foes particularly because they were less concerned about holding territory than they were with damaging American troops.\n\nFor the U.S. military, fighting established governments has been a very different story. Ask Saddam Hussein, or Mullah Omar. That doesn\u2019t bode well for the future of ISIS.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the release of a video showing one of its fighters brutally beheading American journalist James Foley, the so-called Islamic State may have achieved exactly the opposite of what it intended.", "title": "Reporter\u2019s Execution Could Unleash U.S. Against ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/Will-Reporter-s-Execution-Free-Obama-s-Hand-Iraq", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_James_Foley_Execution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/Will-Reporter-s-Execution-Free-Obama-s-Hand-Iraq", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_James_Foley_Execution.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the release of a video showing one of its fighters brutally beheading American journalist James Foley, the so-called Islamic State may have achieved exactly the opposite of what it intended.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa02\"", "article_summary": "The decision to recommit even limited American military assets to Iraq was criticized by politicians on the left and right.\n\u201cObama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,\u201d he said.\nThe man, whose face was covered, also threatened to execute another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, if the U.S. involvement in Iraq continues.\nRelated: Why Obama\u2019s Mideast Policy Won\u2019t Stop GenocideWhat ISIS is trying to do, by all accounts, is establish an actual functioning Islamic state or Caliphate in the Middle East.\nThey are all, also, potential military targets if the U.S. were to decide to intervene against the establishment or the continued existence of the Islamic State."}
