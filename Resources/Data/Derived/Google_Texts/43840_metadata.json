Burwell are claiming that the simple act of filling out a form requesting the accommodation is something they view as a sin, and that they, too, should be automatically exempted.\n\nWe're at the Supreme Court today to say: #HandsOffMyBC! pic.twitter.com/o0j2nxXmDf \u2014 CenterforReproRights (@ReproRights) March 23, 2016\n\nIt is worth noting that thanks to that ACA\u2019s contraception mandate, an estimated 55 million more women with private insurance are now able to get contraceptives without any out-of-pocket co-pay costs. This has increased the use of contraceptives in general, and upped the use of many of the most reliable contraceptive methods that used to be more expensive before the ACA\u2014like IUDs and hormonal implants\u2014which is kind of a huge deal in a country where more than half of all pregnancies are unintended.\n\nRELATED: What's Going On With the Supreme Court and Birth Control?\n\nThe outcome of this case is relevant not only to the half of the population capable of conceiving babies, but also to the physical and economic wellbeing of future generations of children. In one of the many amicus briefs filed in support of the government in this case, a group of doctors\u2019 associations that includes the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote, \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified family planning as one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century, finding that smaller families and longer birth intervals contribute to the better health of infants, children, and women, as well as improving the social and economic roles of women.\u201d\n\nYour medical decisions are just that \u2014 your own.

If they do, chaos is likely to ensue\u2014the law will be interpreted differently state by state, which could lead to unequal access to basic medical coverage for millions of workers across the US.\n\nLike other \u201creligious freedom reform\u201d laws and statutes at the state and federal level, the potential scope of this ruling also definitely runs into slippery slope territory. If SCOTUS rules in favor of Zubik in this case, it would set a precedent that could begin to allow religiously affiliated organizations to defy civil rights and anti-discrimination mandates that protect people not only on the basis of gender, but also sexual orientation and race\u2014which is well worth rallying against.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zubik v.
