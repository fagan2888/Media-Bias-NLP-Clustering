Fiorina has spent the last two weeks doubling down on her erroneous descriptions of videos secretly recorded by anti-abortion activists, and she shows no sign she'll back off her misrepresentations as she makes her strident opposition to Planned Parenthood a centerpiece of her 2016 campaign. (AP Photo/Richard Shiro, File)\n\n\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) \u2013 GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina visited Iowa on Friday with stops in Clinton and Davenport. At the Figge Art Museum, Fiorina spent about an hour mingling with individuals and small groups. Around 100 people attended.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you\u2019ll hear from her you wont see on TV,\u201d Silvis resident Jim Robinson said.\n\n\u201cIt was fantastic because she was so personable and gracious,\u201d said Moline resident Jacyln Dooley, who represents Rock Island County Republicans.\n\nVisitors had the opportunity to ask questions firsthand.\n\n\u201cIn a general sense, I want to know how she is going to clean up America,\u201d Robinson said\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that\u2019s on just about everybody\u2019s mind right now is basically the defense issue, defending the country against terrorist threats,\u201d Coal Valley resident Bruce Peters said.\n\nFiorina says several issues, like Social Security and Medicare, are important. However, she says she wouldn\u2019t prioritize them. She\u2019s instead promoting what she calls her blueprint of things that need to get done.\n\n\u201cWe have to secure the border and enforce a pro-American immigration system,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cWe have to restore the character of this nation by standing for life and religious liberty. We have to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that\u2019s going to work for everybody. We have to go to zero-based budgeting.\u201d\n\nThe sixth priority, she says, is to simplify the tax code from 73,000 pages to just three.\n\n\u201cBecause unless we do those things first, we will not restore people\u2019s faith in their government, in their leadership,\u201d she said.\n\nDooley says she agrees with Fiorina\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWell you have to prioritize because if you dont prioritize keeping our country safe is number one,\u201d she said.\n\nDavenport resident Julie Ross says there wasn\u2019t enough focus on other issues. She asked Fiorina a question about whether CEOs have \u201cthe people in their best interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, in response to the question I specifically asked, she didn\u2019t answer it,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThe local event comes just days after the latest GOP debate. Fiorina has since been accused of lying in one of her answers. She didn\u2019t address that at the Figge on Friday, but, elsewhere, on Wednesday, she insisted she didn\u2019t misspeak.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably one of the things that brought me here tonight is I deeply respect her integrity for not retracting a stand that she has obviously thought well through,\u201d Peters said.\n\nFiorina is scheduled to stop in Burlington on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina visited Iowa on Friday and spoke about immigration and religious liberty.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina visited Iowa on Friday and spoke about immigration and religious liberty.", "title": "Fiorina shares her \u201cblueprint\u201d for America", "url": "http://wane.com/2015/12/19/fiorina-shares-her-blueprint-for-america/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/gop-2016-fiorina-plan_carr.jpg", "height": 340}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina visited Iowa on Friday and spoke about immigration and religious liberty.", "title": "Fiorina shares her \u201cblueprint\u201d for America", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/gop-2016-fiorina-plan_carr.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wane15", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16", "application-name": "WANE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2015-12-19T19:54:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T19:54:36+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At the Figge Art Museum, Fiorina spent about an hour mingling with individuals and small groups.\n\u201cWe have to secure the border and enforce a pro-American immigration system,\u201d Fiorina said.\nWe have to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that\u2019s going to work for everybody.\n(AP Photo/Richard Shiro, File)DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) \u2013 GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina visited Iowa on Friday with stops in Clinton and Davenport.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you\u2019ll hear from her you wont see on TV,\u201d Silvis resident Jim Robinson said."}
