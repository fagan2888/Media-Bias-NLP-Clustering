The refugees are part of newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to resettle 25,000 Syrians in Canada by February. Trudeau\u2019s position is a reversal from the stance taken by his predecessor, Stephen Harper, who had declined to accept more refugees from the war-torn country.\n\nShift in U.S. Gun Policy: Connecticut\u2019s governor announced he would sign an executive order that would ban people on federal \u201cwatch lists\u201d\u2014like the no-fly list\u2014from buying firearms in his state, which already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Meanwhile, in Washington, Obama administration officials are finalizing executive action that would expand background checks on gun purchases.\n\nThis Response to Trump: More than 475,000 people in the United Kingdom have responded in kind to the Republican presidential frontrunner\u2019s call for banning Muslims from entering the U.S. by calling for a blanket ban of their own\u2014on all Donald Trumps entering the U.K. The petition has garnered more than four times the necessary signatures to be considered for debate in the British Parliament.\n\nSnapshot\n\nQuoted\n\nTina Collier, a Donald Trump supporter: \u201cI really am worried that if he keeps saying some of what he\u2019s been saying he might drive people away.\u201d\n\nSteven Allison, a biology professor: \u201cDead animals are big, concentrated blobs of protein and fat, and these microbes are lurking in the soil ready to start eating our bodies when we die.\u201d\n\nChris Urmson, who designs self-driving cars, on the early response to elevators: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly imagine relinquishing your life to this thing. So it was people\u2019s job to sit in the elevator and press the button for you\u2014because it was so complicated.\u201d\n\nEvening Read\n\nMegan Garber on what we talk about when we talk about \u201cdemagogues\u201d:\n\nAs an insult, certainly\u2014as an implicit invalidation of one\u2019s political rhetoric\u2014\u201cdemagogue\u201d is a very good word. It\u2019s slightly gentler than \u201cfascist\u201d and slightly more dignified than \u201cbuffoon\u201d; it\u2019s extremely opinionated, and yet carries itself with the gravitas of informed objectivity. Uttered aloud\u2014that evocative agog\u2014 it forces one\u2019s mouth to gape appropriately. And while Trump is certainly not the only contemporary politician to be dismissed under its auspices (\u201cDemagoguery 101,\u201d Charles Krauthammer wrote of President Obama and his policies), no figure has so clearly deserved the word since Huey Long and Joe McCarthy and Pat Buchanan riled the former century. So deep has the impact of Trump\u2019s fist-pounding rhetoric been that, at this point, there\u2019s a metonymic circularity to the whole thing. The Economist recently published an article titled \u201cThe Art of the Demagogue.\u201d It did not need to clarify who it was about. But what, actually, are people accusing Trump of when they accuse him of demagoguery? It\u2019s not simply Biffery or buffoonery or baboonery; it\u2019s something more contextualized. More systemic. More dangerous. To call Trump a \u201cdemagogue\u201d is to do two things at once: to dismiss him as a political candidate and amplify him as a political threat. That is appropriate, because the key thing about demagogues, historically, is that they have been people who, by way of their very popularity, threaten the populace. They undermine the stability of a \u201cby the people\u201d form of government particularly by turning \u201cthe people\u201d against each other. They represent a danger not just to electoral outcomes or political parties, but to democracy itself.\n\nNews Quiz\n\n1.

I am very split about affirmative action. On one hand, I hate it. I am never recognized for any of my accomplishments, never given the respect I feel is due because of affirmative action. When I got into my Ivy League undergrad (and unlike Abigail Fisher, I was actually in the top 10 percent of my class when I was applying to college). I took the second hardest course load in my school, had a 2250 SAT, and pretty much knocked the Verbal section out of the park by getting a cool 800. But the same classmates I went to school with, spoke to, and beat in competitions grumbled behind my back: \u201cIt was affirmative action.\u201d ... Affirmative action seemed to tarnish my achievements like a black mark. ... On the same hand, I do not want to see AA go. Why? Because our college system is not fair. At my Ivy, I met some very dumb people who were legacy admits (why should you go to school because your father or mother went there?), development admits (mom and dad gave the school money), prep students who play obscure sports (polo, squash, sailing, horseback riding, etc.) and mediocre sons of professors, famous people, or CEOs. Yet there is no outcry over that.\n\nRead the full comment here.\n\nVerbs\n\nChocolate bar-involved punching attack reported, hoverboard-riding store thief caught, history of bathroom signage explored.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first of thousands of asylum-seekers traveled to Canadian cities, Connecticut\u2019s governor announced a new firearms measure, Britons boycotted the U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner, and more.", "author": "Marina Koren and Rosa Inocencio Smith", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The first of thousands of asylum-seekers traveled to Canadian cities, Connecticut\u2019s governor announced a new firearms measure, Britons boycotted the U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner, and more.", "title": "The Atlantic Daily: Canada and Syrian Refugees, U.S. and Gun Laws, Britain and Trump", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/AP_440364193016/facebook.jpg?1449787711", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2015/12/the-atlantic-daily-canada-syria-refugees-guns-trump/419940/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "I am never recognized for any of my accomplishments, never given the respect I feel is due because of affirmative action.\nAffirmative action seemed to tarnish my achievements like a black mark.\nI am very split about affirmative action.\nThe refugees are part of newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to resettle 25,000 Syrians in Canada by February.\nBut the same classmates I went to school with, spoke to, and beat in competitions grumbled behind my back: \u201cIt was affirmative action.\u201d ..."}
