Now health care is emerging as an industry that attracts talent and capital. It\u2019s an industry that has gone from a liability to a long-term asset for attracting business to the region.\n\nFor Alan Iftiniuk, CEO of French Hospital Medical Center in SLO, a big piece of the healthcare puzzle fell into place on Nov. 17 when around 250 business and civic leaders gathered to unveil the three-story Copeland Health Education Pavilion, a research and community center that was funded with substantial gifts from the Copeland Family.\n\nThe normally low-key Copelands, who built and sold a sporting goods retail empire and remain major investors in downtown San Luis Obispo, turned out for the ribbon-cutting for the 18,000-square-foot pavilion.\n\nThe pavilion will pave the way for a new era of \u201csmart technology innovation\u201d at French Hospital, Iftiniuk said.\n\nFor Cal Poly and Cuesta College, the pavilion offers a new way for students to connect with the local healthcare system \u2014 offering a healthcare version of the hugely popular SLO HotHouse incubator that\u2019s opened in the heart of downtown.\n\nThe Copeland Pavilion has labs that can be used for research and even an incubator space for hatching new businesses. Initial teams will study issues around pregnancy and obesity and use the data collected to provide analytics needed to develop prevention programs.\n\nIt will also be opened to nonprofits in the region for use for community events and the design includes a large auditorium, meeting rooms and a board room.\n\nJust a few days earlier in Santa Maria, Marian Regional Medical Center CEO Chuck Cova took the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Dignity Health hospital to announce a series of upgrades to a new regional hospital that looked like a daring move when the 191-room facility opened in 2012.\n\nThe new hospital opened just as Santa Maria was beginning to recover from a deep recession and civic leaders held their breath as patients were shifted to the new facility. Today, with the city growing and attracting investment from firms like the Towbes Group, which is developing a second large apartment complex in the city, it looks like a smart call.\n\nMarian\u2019s emergency room, the cornerstone of its Level III trauma center, doubled from 16 beds to 32 with the opening of the new hospital three years ago. Now it\u2019s set to grow again and the Nov. 12 presentation underscored that demand has increased roughly 50 percent from about 50,000 patients per year before the new hospital to more than 72,000 last year.\n\nThe next phase is to convert some current storage space in the main hospital into an expanded emergency room \u2014 adding an additional 15 new beds and other equipment. The emergency room now staffs a neurosurgery unit around the clock, Cova said.\n\nThe success of Mission Hope Cancer Center, an affiliated facility on the Marian campus off Main Street, has prompted thinking about a \u201cMission Heart\u201d facility for cardiac care. \u201cWe want to concentrate services into a dedicated site,\u201d Cova said.\n\nOne big change is that rather than simply serving the Santa Maria community, the expanded Marian Regional Center is attracting patients from as far away as King City.\n\nAnother is that Marian is beginning to build regional clinical partnerships; working with UCLA and Stanford in some areas and building a relationship with the USC Keck School of Medicine to host family practice residents at Marian. Many of those residents stay in the region when they begin to think about setting up practices.\n\nCova has a broader oversight role over Dignity\u2019s Arroyo Grande Hospital and the Ventura County Dignity Health operations. In Ventura County, Dignity is investing more than $70 million in a new facility at St. John\u2019s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo and St. John\u2019s CEO Darren Lee continues to develop new programs at its Ventura County flagship, St. John\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.\n\nNot so very long ago, the five hospitals that now comprise Dignity\u2019s Central Coast region were separate operations under the Catholic Healthcare West banner.\n\nIn the past few years, they\u2019ve concentrated on winning high marks by focusing more closely on patient outcomes, working to bring more patients into the system via the Affordable Care Act and benefiting from strategic partnerships.\n\nFor North Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo, which struggled for years to attract doctors and provide services, health care has become a swing factor in business retention and economic development.\n\n\u2022 Reach Editor Henry Dubroff at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "dignity health,central coast,santa maria,san luis obispo,camarillo,oxnard,french hospital,copeland,,columns,health care,latest news", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "During the past five years, Dignity Health has made methodical moves to bolster the healthcare system in North Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.
