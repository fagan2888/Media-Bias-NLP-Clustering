C.-based nonprofit with ties to the Obama administration. \u201cA lot of people are hesitant to sign up for health insurance because they think they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nMayor Nan Whaley, who helped Filipic kick off the Dayton leg of Enroll America\u2019s \u201cGet Covered\u201d bus tour on Tuesday, said she thinks an increasing number of the 42,000 Montgomery County residents eligible for coverage under the health care law are \u201cbeginning to pay attention.\u201d\n\nBut, she added: \u201cI am surprised at the number of people that don\u2019t know that they have opportunities out there.\u201d\n\nAbout 85 percent of the nearly 80,000 Ohioans who have signed up for private health plans sold through the state\u2019s health care marketplace were eligible for federal tax credits to help pay premiums and deductibles, according to the latest government report. Ohio mirrored the national rate of those who qualified for some form of tax credit under the health care law, which so far has enrolled more than 5 million Americans, the White House said earlier this week.\n\nStill, only 69 percent of uninsured Americans recently polled by Enroll America, which works with more than 18,000 volunteers and 2,000 partner organizations, knew that financial assistance was available, Filipic said: \u201cI think that says a lot about why some people haven\u2019t taken action.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Enroll America is focusing on raising awareness about the availability of subsidized coverage during its nationwide bus tour, which started last week in Texas. Those efforts include attending major sign-up events, including a student-led enrollment effort Tuesday at Wright State University.\n\nEnroll America officials were joined there by student organizers Sasha Cahill and Kellie Roberts, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who ran off a laundry list of benefits for Ohioans under the health care law, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nAccording to Brown, Ohioans benefiting from the law include more than 140,000 previously uninsured Ohioans who now have private coverage or Medicaid; about 900,000 Ohio seniors who no longer have to pay Medicare Part B deductibles or co-payments for screenings for osteoporosis and other diseases; and about 100,000 young adults who have been allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26, regardless of whether they attend college, live with their parents or are dependents on a tax return.\n\nWhen asked about continued opposition to the law from his Republican colleagues in Congress who have voted more than 50 times to repeal the law, Brown said: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for this country. When people say repeal Obamacare, they need to explain to the 140,000 Ohioans who have health insurance that they\u2019re going to loose it.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s Republican counterpart, Sen. Rob Portman, said the law is too \u201conerous and complex\u201d to remain on the books as it\u2019s currently written.\n\n\u201cObamacare should be repealed for everyone and replaced with something that works better,\u201d Portman said. \u201cBut until then, I will fight to make sure that this onerous and complex law harms as few Ohioans as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With less than two weeks left to sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the group leading the national enrollment effort is canvassing Ohio, reaching out to throngs of uninsured residents with a simple message: If you think you can\u2019t afford health insurance, think again.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/enroll-america-bus-tour-promotes-health-law-in-day/nfGCW/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/03/18/1d/fd/Enroll-America-04.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With less than two weeks left to sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the group leading the national enrollment effort is canvassing Ohio, reaching out to throngs of uninsured residents with a simple message: If you think you can\u2019t afford health insurance, think again.", "title": "Enroll America bus tour promotes health law in Dayton."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/03/18/1d/fd/Enroll-America-04.jpg", "description": "With less than two weeks left to sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the group leading the national enrollment effort is canvassing Ohio, reaching out to throngs of uninsured residents with a simple message: If you think you can&rsquo;t afford health insurance, think again.", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "title": "Enroll America bus tour promotes health law in Dayton."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/enroll-america-bus-tour-promotes-health-law-in-day/nfGCW/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2396828/news/news/enroll-america-bus-tour-promotes-health-law-in-day/nfGCW/", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15f8\"", "article_summary": "Senator Sherrod Brown joined the \u201cCountdown to get covered\u201d bus tour to alert Miami Valley residents of local resources available for help enrolling in the new health insurance marketplace Tuesday at Wright State University in Fairborn.\nOhio mirrored the national rate of those who qualified for some form of tax credit under the health care law, which so far has enrolled more than 5 million Americans, the White House said earlier this week.\nWhen people say repeal Obamacare, they need to explain to the 140,000 Ohioans who have health insurance that they\u2019re going to loose it.\u201dBrown\u2019s Republican counterpart, Sen.\n\u201cBut until then, I will fight to make sure that this onerous and complex law harms as few Ohioans as possible.\u201d\nEnroll America officials were joined there by student organizers Sasha Cahill and Kellie Roberts, as well as Sen.
