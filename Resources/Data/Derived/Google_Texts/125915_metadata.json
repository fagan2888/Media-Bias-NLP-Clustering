(The Washington Post)\n\nThe big political story of the day is the continued fallout from Marco Rubio\u2019s performance in Saturday night\u2019s Republican debate, when he repeated a particular line about Barack Obama multiple times, even after being ridiculed by Chris Christie for doing so. This has led to all kinds of uncomplimentary questions about Rubio.\n\nBut what\u2019s missing is the context \u2014 exactly what Rubio was trying to argue, and where it comes from. What\u2019s missing from much of the discussion is that Rubio is embracing some of the most lunatic ideas on the right \u2014 and he\u2019s managing to do so without most in the media hearing the dog whistle, even as he\u2019s being criticized for being overly scripted and robotic.\n\nIn case you missed the debate, Rubio said over and over, \u201cLet\u2019s dispel [sic] once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d That\u2019s because, Rubio repeated, Obama is trying to change America into something unrecognizable, even horrific.\n\nToday, all of the focus is on Rubio\u2019s seeming inability to stray from his prepared talking points. \u201cDebate slip-up seems to halt Rubio\u2019s momentum,\u201d says the Post\u2019s story; \u201cRubio starts digging out after debate debacle,\u201d says Yahoo News; \u201cIn the light of the morning after, how bad was Rubio\u2019s repetition?\u201d asks NPR; \u201cRubio\u2019s problem: an excess of caution,\u201d concludes Politico. Rubio\u2019s opponents aren\u2019t letting it go either. \u201cMarco just \u2014 you know, he gets told what to say and he repeats it. That is what he does,\u201d said Chris Christie. Jeb Bush called him \u201ctotally scripted and kind of robotic.\u201d\n\nBut to understand what Rubio was trying to communicate, you have to see it on two levels. On the surface, Rubio\u2019s claim about Obama is a defense of his own youth and limited r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Some Republicans have said of Rubio that he\u2019s too inexperienced to be president, just like Barack Obama was. So Rubio can counter that argument by saying that despite his short time in prior office Obama has actually been a brutally effective president, skillfully carrying out his nefarious schemes, and therefore experience isn\u2019t all that important. But the real message goes deeper, into the dark heart of the conspiracy theories and twisted loathing of Obama that has persisted on the right for the last seven years.\n\nLet\u2019s look more particularly at what Rubio said, after saying that Obama knows what he\u2019s doing. \u201cBarack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America.\u201d He repeated the line about Obama wanting America to be like the rest of the world, and summed up at one point: \u201cAll this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate.\u201d\n\nJust to be clear, when a Republican talks about \u201cthe rest of the world,\u201d he doesn\u2019t mean it in a good way. So when Rubio says Obama \u201cwants America to become more like the rest of the world,\u201d he\u2019s saying that Obama is trying to harm America, to bring it down, to weaken it, to punish it, to make it less than it has been and should be.\n\nLet\u2019s pause before we proceed to acknowledge how positively insane this idea is. The fact that it has been espoused by untold numbers of supposedly mainstream conservatives in recent years makes it no less so. It\u2019s one thing to say that your political opponents are wrong, that their plans will fail, that they are unconcerned about problems that you believe demand immediate action, or even that their values are misguided. But it\u2019s quite another to think that they are intentionally seeking the destruction of the country.\n\nYet that is just what Rubio argues. In his bizarre telling, Obama didn\u2019t pass the Affordable Care Act because he wanted to provide health insurance to the millions of Americans who lack it and rein in runaway costs; he passed the ACA because he wanted to ruin the American health care system. He didn\u2019t pass Dodd-Frank to avoid a repeat of the Great Recession; he passed it in the hopes of sabotaging the American economy. Obama, in short, wants his presidency to be such a catastrophe that we can never recover, because he is so driven by his hatred of America.\n\nIf you\u2019re saying, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, nobody really thinks that,\u201d or if you\u2019re reminded of General Jack T. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove ranting about the communists sapping and impurifying our precious bodily fluids, it means that you\u2019ve never watched Fox News or listened to conservative talk radio. Because these ideas have been staples of right-wing media for Obama\u2019s entire presidency. The audiences for those programs have been told constantly that whatever problem Obama claims to be trying to solve, his actual intention is not to solve problems but to create them, so that out of the chaos will come a twisted, unrecognizable version of the country we once knew.\n\nAs Glenn Beck said, \u201cChanging America into something other than it always has been is the goal, always has been the goal of this administration. There are enemies inside and outside the gates of our country.\u201d And there\u2019s no escaping the racial undertones of this argument, because that\u2019s where so many on the right find the explanation for Obama\u2019s supposed hunger to bring woe and misery down upon us. \u201cObama has a plan,\u201d Rush Limbaugh tells his listeners. \u201cObama\u2019s plan is based on his inherent belief that this country was immorally and illegitimately founded by a very small minority of white Europeans who screwed everybody else since the founding to get all the money and all the goodies, and it\u2019s about time that the scales were made even.\u201d\n\nOr as Newt Gingrich said in 2010, \u201cWhat if he is so outside our comprehension, that only if you understand Kenyan, anticolonial behavior, can you begin to piece together [his actions]? That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio knows full well that conservatives have been imbibing these ideas for years, and so he has essentially staked his campaign on being the candidate who hates and fears Barack Obama as much as primary voters do. None of his opponents talk about Obama nearly as much; in some of the debates it has become almost comical, as every question Rubio gets on any subject is answered with a diatribe about Obama\u2019s malevolent schemes. Rubio is now sending out fundraising emails referencing Saturday\u2019s debate, saying that \u201cPresident Obama has been very deliberate about achieving his bad policies \u2014 they\u2019re no accident; he\u2019s really trying to change this country for the worse.\u201d\n\nThis is the deep irony of Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign. He is presenting himself as the candidate above all of those who are frightened of change, for whom Barack Obama is a symbol of everything they think has been lost from the America of their youth. As Rubio said in an ad he began airing in December, \u201cThis election is about the essence of America, about all of us who feel out of place in our own country.\u201d That is indeed a powerful feeling among many Republican voters: older whites, often in rural areas, who feel that the country is changing around them too fast. Their values are being questioned, they hear unfamiliar languages all around them, today\u2019s technology is baffling, and they generally feel as though they\u2019re being left behind, just like older people always do.\n\nYet it\u2019s a bizarre message coming from Rubio, whose attraction was supposed to be precisely that he\u2019s a Republican who doesn\u2019t feel out of place in a changing America. Young and Hispanic, he was supposed to be the fresh face who could sell conservatism to the new polyglot America. Rubio was going to be the candidate of the future, yet he\u2019s presenting himself as the candidate who is as disturbed, as unsettled, and as angry as you are that the past is slipping away.\n\nYou can mock Rubio for repeating himself all you like. But the substance of what he\u2019s saying is a lot more troubling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not the repetition, it's what he's saying and why.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's not the repetition, it's what he's saying and why.", "title": "The real problem with Marco Rubio\u2019s scripted debate performance: His ideas", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/02/08/the-real-problem-with-marco-rubios-scripted-debate-performance-his-ideas/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/07/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Debate_-08b34.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/02/08/the-real-problem-with-marco-rubios-scripted-debate-performance-his-ideas/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "marco rubio, marco rubio debate performance, marco rubio talking points, new hampshire primary, fox news, rush limbaugh, glenn beck", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "marco rubio, marco rubio debate performance, marco rubio talking points, new hampshire primary, fox news, rush limbaugh, glenn beck"}, "article_summary": "But the substance of what he\u2019s saying is a lot more troubling.\nIn case you missed the debate, Rubio said over and over, \u201cLet\u2019s dispel [sic] once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\nSome Republicans have said of Rubio that he\u2019s too inexperienced to be president, just like Barack Obama was.\nHe knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d That\u2019s because, Rubio repeated, Obama is trying to change America into something unrecognizable, even horrific.\n\u201cDebate slip-up seems to halt Rubio\u2019s momentum,\u201d says the Post\u2019s story; \u201cRubio starts digging out after debate debacle,\u201d says Yahoo News; \u201cIn the light of the morning after, how bad was Rubio\u2019s repetition?\u201d asks NPR; \u201cRubio\u2019s problem: an excess of caution,\u201d concludes Politico."}
