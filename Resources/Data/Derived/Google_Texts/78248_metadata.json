The Council\u2019s chief executive Premila Kumar said supermarkets and other food stores should destroy such items.\n\nSurvivors spoke of the horror of the cyclone, while aid workers scrambled to help victims.\n\n\"The noise was deafening. At one point, I turned to my partner and questioned whether we would actually survive,\" Sarah Bingham, an Australian on holiday on Tokoriki Island, told Reuters by telephone.\n\n(Additional reporting by James Regan; Editing by Paul Tait and Richard Borsuk)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fiji began a massive cleanup on Monday after one of the most powerf", "title": "Death toll from Fiji cyclone mounts amid health crisis fears", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/21/Fiji-super-cyclone-kills-10-and-raises-fears-health-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cyclone-fiji_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/21/Fiji-super-cyclone-kills-10-and-raises-fears-health-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cyclone-fiji_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fiji began a massive cleanup on Monday after one of the most powerf", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"The death toll from Cyclone Winston continues to rise and reports of widespread damage are coming in from across Fiji,\u201d said New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully.\nAid agencies were told at a meeting of Fiji's National Emergency Operations Center on Monday of potential \"catastrophic\" damage to Koro Island, Fiji's seventh-largest island.\nAlmost 8,000 people remained hunkered down in hundreds of evacuation centers across Fiji where they had headed before tropical cyclone Winston hit late on Saturday with winds of up to 325 kph (200 mph).\nThe Fiji Broadcasting Corp, quoting the country's National Disaster Management Office, said 21 people had died and four were still missing at sea.\nThe Consumer Council of Fiji has urged traders not to sell food and other perishable items that have gone bad due to the effects of the cyclone."}
