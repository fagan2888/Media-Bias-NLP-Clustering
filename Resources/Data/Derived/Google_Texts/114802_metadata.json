Following violent skirmishes, Russian forces occupied Georgia\u2019s separatist provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nThis happened during the George W. Bush administration, which was so willing to use military force that it invaded Iraq on trumped up pretexts and in violation of international law. If Moscow were taking its cues based on Washington\u2019s willingness to use force, surely it would have held back in Georgia for fear of retaliation from the Bush administration.\n\nWhenever the United States fails to act with violence abroad\u2014a rarity, mind you\u2014you have politicians and pundits howling about America\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d being at stake. If other countries see us backing down, goes the thinking, they won\u2019t properly fear U.S. power and therefore they\u2019ll be unrestrained in their actions.\n\nActually, the technical political science literature has largely put the \u201ccredibility\u201d argument to rest. \u201cThere\u2019s little evidence that supports the view that countries\u2019 record for keeping commitments determines their credibility,\u201d write two scholars who have studied the concept.\n\n\u201cThe illusory belief of America's ability to shape, leverage, influence, sway, direct, or control foreign events is widespread within Washington's foreign policy community,\u201d writes Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIts direct implication is that whenever or wherever things go wrong elsewhere on earth, it must be America's fault.\u201d\n\nObama indeed foolishly drew a \"red line\" for the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad: If chemical weapons were used in its civil war, he promised, the U.S. would use military force in Syria.\n\nBut when it looked like that red line had been crossed, the president found himself trapped in a box of his own making. As the administration began preparing for war, U.S. allies were unsupportive, the American people were strongly opposed, and it looked as if Congress would vote no.\n\nIn other words, if Obama had gone through with his promise to bomb Syria, the action would have had no international legitimacy and no Congressional consent. In fact, it would have been a war crime according to international law, which prohibits the use of force against another state without the approval of the UN Security Council or unless it preempts an imminent threat.\n\nIf anything, America\u2019s utter disregard for international law gives license to other powerful countries, like Russia, to behave similarly.\n\n\u201cThe steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity\u2026they\u2019re a violation of international law,\u201d President Obama said this week.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this was exactly the argument Putin used in opposing Obama\u2019s plan to bomb Syria. He even wrote an Op-Ed in the New York Times warning that such action would violate Syrian sovereignty and international law.\n\nRussia also used this argument when it opposed the Clinton administration\u2019s military intervention in the Balkans in 1999. Serbia, a Russian ally, was quelling a separatist movement in its province of Kosovo and, under the pretext of preventing \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d the United States bombed Serbia without UN authorization and without the justification of self-defense.\n\nAnd of course there is the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which is a model example of the clearest violation of international law. It fit the description of what a Nuremberg Tribunal judge called \u201cthe supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\u201d\n\nIf America flouts international law as a matter of routine, how can it then turn around and condemn Russia for its own illegal military actions?\n\nWhen people see the actions of Russia, or some other government, as the result of alleged \u201cweakness\u201d on the part of the U.S. for failing to more readily bomb whatever country at the drop of a hat, what they are really advocating is for America to rule the world by force.\n\nAs any mafia don knows, the threat or use of violence can be an effective way to enforce obedience. But if that\u2019s how the U.S. is supposed to act on the world stage, advocates should have the courage to say it, and drop the usual platitudes about self-determination, international law, and American \u201ccredibility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Whenever the United States fails to use violence abroad\u2014a rarity\u2014politicians and pundits howl about America\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d being at stake.", "title": "Russia Didn't Invade Ukraine Because of US 'Weakness'", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/05/russia-didnt-invade-ukraine-because-of-u", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_03/obama-and-putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_03/obama-and-putin.jpg", "description": "One of\nthe more vivid political talking points to come out of Washington\nin the midst of Russia\u2019s military incursions into Ukraine is that\nRussian President Vladimir Putin carried out such provocative\nactions because Obama\u2019s failure to enforce his \u201cred line\u201d on Syria\nand commence with a bombing campaign this past fall signaled to\nPutin he would not face consequences.\n\u201cI really believe that when Vladimir Putin looks around the\nworld\u2014sees what happened in Syria when the red line turned pink and\nthe pre", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Russia Didn't Invade Ukraine Because of US 'Weakness'"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-03-05T18:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/john-glaser"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a3d\"", "article_summary": "If anything, America\u2019s utter disregard for international law gives license to other powerful countries, like Russia, to behave similarly.\nHe even wrote an Op-Ed in the New York Times warning that such action would violate Syrian sovereignty and international law.\nBut when it looked like that red line had been crossed, the president found himself trapped in a box of his own making.\n\u201cThe steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity\u2026they\u2019re a violation of international law,\u201d President Obama said this week.\nAnd of course there is the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which is a model example of the clearest violation of international law."}
