Conservatives are certainly having a terrible, no good, very bad week; the assault on Obamacare failed once again in the Supreme Court, and marriage equality became the law of the land.

So what is a social conservative to do in the wake of such defeats?

Roll up their sleeves, crack their knuckles, and do what they do best: complain.

Curated for your maximum entertainment, here are some tweets from social conservatives reacting to the SCOTUS marriage equality ruling:

Governor Abbott, saying Christians are under siege from the same-sex marriages they don’t have to have.

Marriage was defined by God. No man can redefine it. We will defend our religious liberties. #tcot — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) June 26, 2015

If this were a dog show of ignorance, I’d have to give the gold to Bryan Fischer. His tweets represent the essence of the anti-marriage equality crowd: loud, ignorant, and theatrical.

Enjoy your marriage equality, America, and while you’re at it, scroll up and read some of these tweets again.

Who knows how much longer you’ll be able to get such a prime view of the bigotry on this issue?
