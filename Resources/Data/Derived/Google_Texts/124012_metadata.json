As you might have experienced, it can be confusing.\n\nCovering Kids and Families has counselors available for free all day Friday to help you navigate through it all.\n\n\"Some people have come in and started the process on their own but once they get into picking plans and looking to see what each healthcare provider offers, then that\u2019s kind of where it gets a little tricky and a little bit confusing,\" said Alisha Callicott, Certified Navigator Enrollment Specialist at Covering Kids and Families.\n\nOnce you enroll, you'll be covered March 1st.\n\nEven if you think you don't need health insurance, Callicott says you'll want to do this for tax purposes.\n\n\"People that do qualify for the health insurance marketplace, you do need to be on there and enrolling before Sunday,\" she said. \"That way come next year, 2016, when you file your taxes, you don\u2019t want to get hit with the high penalties that they do automatically take out.\"\n\nSome people might not qualify for Obamacare. In that case, the counselors can help you find a plan that you do qualify to use.\n\nCovering Kids and Families is located near 38th and Keystone at 2951 East 38th Street. The counselors will be available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and no appointment is necessary.\n\nAfter the Sunday deadline, only people with a major life change that changes their insurance coverage, such as a job loss, will be able to enroll.\n\n\"Covering Kids and Families is here. If you feel confused, we\u2019re here. Our doors are open. Whoever needs help, we have something that we can sign you up for.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Lindy Thackston INDIANAPOLIS, IN (February 13, 2015) - The deadline to sign up for Obamacare is Sunday.
