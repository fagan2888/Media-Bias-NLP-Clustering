And there is the narrative that he is suspect in the clutch, a good bet to make a crippling decision late in a game to kill his own team\u2019s chances.\n\nThere are examples of that, of course, from throughout his nine-year career. Just last week Romo threw a late interception after his team had blown a 23-point lead to the Green Bay Packers. His critics howled and the Cowboys appeared headed for another disastrous finish.\n\nSEE ALSO: FENNO: Pierre Garcon\u2019s record season can\u2019t mask buffoonery around him\n\nBut don\u2019t sell that narrative to the Redskins, who five times now have seen Romo rally to beat them in the fourth quarter of a game. The latest was Sunday afternoon at FedEx Field when Washington led 23-14 with 14:56 to go and still lost 24-23.\n\nDallas would get the ball just twice more after falling behind by nine. Both times resulted in points, including the game-winning touchdown pass to running back DeMarco Murray with 1:08 remaining.\n\n\u201c[Romo is] a tough guy to play against regardless of the criticism he receives. We\u2019d rather him not be in the division,\u201d Redskins defensive tackle Barry Cofield said. \u201cNot a guy you want to play against twice a year, especially with the talent he has on the perimeter. He can make those big plays so that\u2019s why you have to try and make them. You can\u2019t count on him to not make them.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Redskins left star-struck again as Cowboys rally\n\nBattling a sore back, which he\u2019d faced during practice this week and tweaked again during the game, Romo fought through the pain and produced a dominant fourth quarter en route to the victory.\n\nWith the Redskins leading 23-14, Romo was 9-for-12 for 140 yards on his team\u2019s final two drives. He helped put the Cowboys in position to hit a field goal and then led them 87 yards down the field for the go-ahead score to Murray.\n\n\u201cIt was time we had to score,\u201d Romo said. \u201cI think we enjoy those opportunities to be in that situation. These last few years we\u2019ve done really good when we get in that position to go down and score. And you just have to have that belief. I think our football team does.\u201d\n\nNo NFL quarterback over the last three seasons has led more fourth-quarter comebacks than Romo, who is now at 12 game-winning drives when his team entered the fourth quarter tied or trailing. In his career, he has 19 fourth-quarter comeback wins.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, [Romo has] done that to us a number of times since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Redskins linebacker London Fletcher said. \u201cBut, again, take our hats off to him. I know he\u2019s much maligned in some of the things he\u2019s done in the past that probably cost them ballgames. But today he made plays to win the ballgame.\u201d\n\nAnd that included two key fourth-down conversions with his team\u2019s season likely on the line. On the first drive, which ended with a Dan Bailey 25-yard field goal, Romo found wide receiver Cole Beasley for a 20-yard pass on fourth down at the Washington 40. Six plays later the Cowboys were within 23-17.\n\nRomo later took advantage of a blown coverage when Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson slipped trying to cover wide receiver Terrance Williams. That 51-yard play set up the game-winning points.\n\nThe touchdown pass to Murray was classic Romo. He dropped back, didn\u2019t see an opening and then rolled to the right, hitting Murray with a bullet. The running back plunged into the end zone and the Cowboys had set up another winner-take-all battle next weekend against Philadelphia for the NFC East title.\n\n\u201c[Romo\u2018s] playmaking ability, it\u2019s backyard football,\u201d Cofield said. \u201cWhenever a play breaks down he\u2019s got that ability to slip sackers and make a big throw. He\u2019s a test every snap.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I know he's much maligned in some of the things he's done in the past that probably cost them ballgames,\" said Redskins linebacker London Fletcher. \"But today he made plays to win the ballgame.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cI know he\u2019s much maligned in some of the things he\u2019s done in the past that probably cost them ballgames,\u201d said Redskins linebacker London Fletcher. \u201cBut today he made plays to win the ballgame.\u201d", "title": "Tony Romo flips the script to stun Redskins", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/22/tony-romo-flips-the-script-to-stun-redskins-again/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_redskins108-12221708201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_redskins108-12221708201.jpg", "description": "\"I know he's much maligned in some of the things he's done in the past that probably cost them ballgames,\" said Redskins linebacker London Fletcher. \"But today he made plays to win the ballgame.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Tony Romo flips the script to stun Redskins"}, "Author": "Brian McNally", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys, Barry Cofield, Demarco Murray"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6fd\"", "article_summary": "Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo plays two opponents at once when he is on the field.\n\u201cUnfortunately, [Romo has] done that to us a number of times since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Redskins linebacker London Fletcher said.\nWith the Redskins leading 23-14, Romo was 9-for-12 for 140 yards on his team\u2019s final two drives.\nRomo later took advantage of a blown coverage when Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson slipped trying to cover wide receiver Terrance Williams.\nJust last week Romo threw a late interception after his team had blown a 23-point lead to the Green Bay Packers."}
