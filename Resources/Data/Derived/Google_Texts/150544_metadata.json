Coach Mike Babcock smiled for likely the first time all day, and injured center John Tavares joined the group for the medal presentation.\n\nToews, who scored on a first-period tip-in, and Crosby are among Canada\u2019s 11 returning players from the 2010 championship team. Kunitz, widely criticized for failing to finish chances earlier in Sochi, capped the scoring with a vicious wrist shot in the third.\n\nWhile Canada got goals from its two best centers, Sweden had to play without its top three centers. With Henrik Sedin and Henrik Zetterberg already out for the tournament, Nicklas Backstrom was scratched shortly before game time. Swedish Olympic officials said Backstrom had a positive drug test. Swedish news agency TT said it was because of an allergy medicine.\n\nThe Swedes also were unbeaten in Sochi until the final, but they struggled against Canada\u2019s formidable defense and Price, a first-time gold medalist who played splendidly in Sochi.\n\nAlthough the predominantly Russian crowd wasn\u2019t exactly buzzing for the opening faceoff, both teams came out at speedy tempo. Gustav Nyquist hit Canada\u2019s post early, and the puck ricocheted under Price before the goalie gloved it. Patrice Bergeron then beat Lundqvist with a wrist shot, but also drew only iron.\n\nCanada went ahead nearly 13 minutes in when Jeff Carter threw a quick pass in front to Toews, who nimbly held off Patrik Berglund and deflected it underneath Lundqvist for the Chicago captain\u2019s first goal of the tournament. Toews also scored Canada\u2019s first goal in the gold-medal game in Vancouver four years ago.\n\nLate in the second period, Crosby scored after taking the puck away from Jonathan Ericsson at the Canada blue line. Loui Eriksson couldn\u2019t catch Canada\u2019s captain as he skated in on Lundqvist for a textbook-quality deke and a backhand past the Swedish goalie\u2019s sprawled toe.\n\nCanada and Sweden were the most popular picks for gold heading into Sochi, and both teams backed up that belief with steady play despite relatively meager offensive performances. Both teams emphasize defense, but Sweden\u2019s big-ice proficiency and Canada\u2019s peerless talent made them dominant.\n\nWhen Backstrom was ruled out shortly before game time, Sweden was left without its top three pivots. Jimmie Ericsson attempted to fill in between Daniel Sedin and Eriksson, but he\u2019s not a natural center, and he lost all six of his faceoffs in the first period.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Canada wins gold in hockey with 3-0 win over Sweden", "title": "Canada wins gold in hockey with 3-0 win over Sweden", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/23/canada-wins-gold-in-hockey-with-3-0-win-over-sweden/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223__p_f16b5752-33bd-49f6-a3ec-8f83064ce5a9lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223__p_f16b5752-33bd-49f6-a3ec-8f83064ce5a9lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-23T07:28:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:52:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1f0\"", "article_summary": "Toews also scored Canada\u2019s first goal in the gold-medal game in Vancouver four years ago.\nLate in the second period, Crosby scored after taking the puck away from Jonathan Ericsson at the Canada blue line.\nCanada never even trailed in Sochi while winning its record ninth Olympic hockey gold medal \u2014 its first outside North America since 1952 \u2014 and joining the women\u2019s team to complete Canada\u2019s second straight Olympic hockey sweep.\nWhile Canada got goals from its two best centers, Sweden had to play without its top three centers.\nCanada and Sweden were the most popular picks for gold heading into Sochi, and both teams backed up that belief with steady play despite relatively meager offensive performances."}
