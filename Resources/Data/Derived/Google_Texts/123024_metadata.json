As WikiLeaks puts it, the regulations together create \u201cinternational legal regime which aims to deregulate and privatize the supply of services\u2014which account for the majority of the economy across TISA countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe analyses suggest that TISA would have sweeping implications\u2014from rolling back financial regulations to lowering seafarers\u2019 wages to infringing on privacy rights and internet freedoms.\n\n\u201cAs governments around the world implement the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis by re-regulating financial firms to prevent another crisis, the leaked TISA rules could require countries\u2014including the world\u2019s largest financial centers\u2014to halt and even roll back financial regulations,\u201d said Ben Beachy, research director at Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch and author of the analysis on the leaked Financial Services annex.\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he continued, \u201cTISA would expand deregulatory \u2018trade\u2019 rules written under the advisement of large banks before the financial crisis, requiring domestic laws to conform to the now-rejected model of extreme deregulation that led to global recession.\u201d\n\nOWINFS, which has been advocating against TISA and other so-called \u201cfree-trade\u201d deals for years, calls the section covering e-commerce \u201cperhaps the most explosive.\u201d\n\nPublic Citizen lawyer Burcu Kilic, who co-authored the Electronic Commerce annex analysis, said the leak \u201conce again demonstrates that trade negotiations are playing an important role in shaping the future of internet governance. Because these negotiations are closed, they are a poor forum for making internet policy, leading to policy that naturally favors businesses with major lobbying operations in Geneva and Washington, D.C., rather than the sort of open and multi-participant forums deciding issues on the merits we would prefer.\u201d\n\nThe WikiLeaks e-commerce analysis shows how TISA threatens both net neutrality and personal data privacy.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right central to the maintenance of democratic societies,\u201d Kilic said. \u201cTISA includes requirements that could damage privacy protections. TISA should be debated publicly, in order to ensure that adequate, express privacy safeguards are included.\u201d\n\nThe 52 nations currently negotiating TISA account for two-thirds of global GDP. Those nations are the United States, the 28 members of the European Union, and 23 other countries, including Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Israel. According to WikiLeaks, TISA \u201cis the largest component of the United States\u2019 strategic neoliberal \u2018trade\u2019 treaty triumvirate,\u201d which also includes the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP).", "article_metadata": {"description": "TISA Leaks Part Deux: More Evidence Of Concerted Attack On Democracy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Deirdre Fulton | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "TISA Leaks Part Deux: More Evidence Of Concerted Attack On Democracy", "title": "TISA Leaks Part Deux: More Evidence Of Concerted Attack On Democracy", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/tisa-leaks-part-deux-more-evidence-of-concerted-attack-on-democracy/207247/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tisano.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TISA Leaks Part Deux: More Evidence Of Concerted Attack On Democracy", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tisano.jpg", "title": "TISA Leaks Part Deux: More Evidence Of Concerted Attack On Democracy", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Wikileaks", "published_time": "2015-07-03T08:38:25-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf57e\"", "article_summary": "According to WikiLeaks, TISA \u201cis the largest component of the United States\u2019 strategic neoliberal \u2018trade\u2019 treaty triumvirate,\u201d which also includes the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP).\n\u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right central to the maintenance of democratic societies,\u201d Kilic said.\nTISA should be debated publicly, in order to ensure that adequate, express privacy safeguards are included.\u201dThe 52 nations currently negotiating TISA account for two-thirds of global GDP.\nThose nations are the United States, the 28 members of the European Union, and 23 other countries, including Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Israel.\nAs with Wednesday\u2019s documents, Thursday\u2019s batch of texts reveals \u201ca concerted attempt to place restrictions on the ability of participating governments to regulate services sectors, even where regulations are necessary to protect the privacy of domestic populations, the natural environment or the integrity of public services,\u201d WikiLeaks declares."}
