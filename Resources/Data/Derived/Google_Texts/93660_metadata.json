Miller is acting her age. She and her soon-to-be former WFB colleagues are not the \u201chyper-conservative\u201d provocateurs Byers makes them out to be. And once the rest of the lame-stream media figures that out, will there be anything to stop the entire Free Beacon staff from forsaking the cause of combat journalism, moving to the heart of Hell, and posting corgi GIFs online?\n\nWhat I am talking about is this: The WFB has been derelict in its coverage of the one thing giving true conservatives hope in these trying times: Louis Buller \u201cLouie\u201d Gohmert, Jr., congressman from Texas.\n\nUnlike most Free Beacon employees, who spend their free time trying on jeans, watching movies with subtitles, and \u201cenjoying\u201d soccer, I pal around with real Americans. Just the other night I was over at my buddy Ken\u2019s place, watching Rizzoli & Isles on DVD and drinking Keystone Light with a solid crew of patriots we met at the recent Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC. And maybe it was the suds talking, but we were in a Gohmert state of mind.\n\nWho can blame us? Gohmert is consistently rated as one of the most conservative members of Congress. He has sponsored legislation that would allow lawmakers to carry guns on the House floor. Not only does he want to defund Obamacare, he wants to defund President Obama\u2019s golf game. He was the only congressman who voted against a bill to prohibit the use of the term \u201clunatic\u201d in federal law. This is a man I can stand behind.\n\nThe question raging in conservative circles is not should Louie Gohmert run for higher office. Rather, the question is which higher office should he seek?\n\nMost agree that a White House run in 2016 is the most plausible option, but others say mounting a primary challenge against Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) in 2018 would be the savvier move from a tactical perspective. Needless to say, we would have to revisit this strategy when Cruz is elected president in 2016.\n\nIt concerns me that the Free Beacon appears to have no interest in covering a political groundswell of this magnitude. We did run an article about the personal tours of the Capitol that Gohmert leads for his constituents\u2014an article written, I should point out, by reporter Andrew Evans, who recently left the Free Beacon for National Affairs, a \u201cquarterly journal of essays\u201d edited by RINO wonk Yuval Levin.\n\nHowever, when I searched the Free Beacon website for common phrases such as \u201cGohmert for president,\u201d \u201cGohmert in 2016,\u201d and \u201cGohmert should primary Ted Cruz,\u201d I found nothing.\n\nAll of this Gohmert chatter takes me back to the autumn of 1993. I was kicking around the Balkans at the time, doing some light mercenary work, and wound up in Mostar, Bosnia, at the height of the siege. A band of Albanian gypsies smuggled me through a Croat checkpoint by strapping me to the belly of mule. The mule did not survive.\n\nFollowing an annulled marriage to the niece of a local strongman, I settled in with a hardy clan of Bosniak teens. \u201cBorn with AK-47s in our hands,\u201d they used to joke in broken Russian, in between sips of warm \u201cmudshine,\u201d the makeshift spirit of the resistance. Once a fortnight we would snake through town under cover of darkness to meet up with our supplier Zlatan, always at a different, pre-arranged location.\n\nZlatan and his associate Ermin grew up playing handball with some of the mid-ranking Serbian military brass, non-ideological types who looked the other way if a supply drop came in underweight. The Serbs were well compensated, of course, and Zlatan made a hefty profit in a most hellish business environment\u2014one rivaled only by President Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s economy.\n\nZlatan, Ermin, the mule, and I called these supply wagons \u201cGo Marts.\u201d They were nothing more than a rudimentary carriage with old hubcaps for wheels, filled to the brim with vodka, cigarettes, Russian mortar rounds, goat\u2019s milk, propane, and French pornography. \u201cGo Marts\u201d were our Amazon.com. The supplies they carried ensured that the besieged populace never lost hope, even when the Croats shelled the Old Bridge. And the city held.\n\nPoll:\n\nWhat is the greatest threat to Freedom?\n\na) Barack Obama\n\nb) RINOs\n\nc) Adam Kredo\u2019s neck-beard\n\nd) People who take pictures of food\n\ne) Username 5tarzN5tripz, who won\u2019t return my messages on ChristianMingle.com\n\nEmail me your answers!
