“I’m fiercely protective of them and obviously I don’t think its easy. It’s not a job that they wanted and so it’s hard,” Hager said of being a teenager in the White House. “But it’s also a privilege.”

As the younger of the Bush twins, Hager recalled that she “had a hard time” under the media spotlight – alluding to her 2001 alcohol-related incidents while in college.

Hager had nothing but praise for the Obama’s daughters. “They’re great girls,” she said. “I think social media exploded.” The GOP staffer who wrote the post has resigned.
