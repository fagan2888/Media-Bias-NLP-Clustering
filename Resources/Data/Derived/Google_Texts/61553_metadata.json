Shapleigh Smith Jr. took his seat in the Vermont House in January 2003, a fresh member of the chamber\u0092s Fish and Wildlife Committee. Early Saturday, now-Speaker Smith gaveled to a close the legislative biennium, closing the book on a major chapter in his life and lingering questions about what his future holds.\n\n\n\nSmith, 50, has been widely viewed as a commanding leader as he orchestrated the chamber\u0092s work for the past eight years. Bills making it to the House floor were certain to pass. He\u0092s been known to flash his wit from behind the podium, and offer a stern glare to members who seem to be deviating from the carefully crafted playbook.\n\n\n\nAlways among the first to arrive at the State House during the legislative session, Smith excelled as speaker by reaching out to his caucus and the other side when needed. He could frequently be seen in the cafeteria moving from table to table to impress upon members what was needed.\n\n\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t think that I am a natural glad-hander, but I do think that in many respects, I am naturally a one-on-one politician,\u0094 Smith said in an interview in his office last week. \u0093I really enjoy spending time with people on a one-on-one basis and getting to know them, finding out what\u0092s important to them and just finding out what they care about. I think that those things are really important to be an effective speaker.\u0094\n\n\n\nSmith credits his ability to reach people in more intimate settings for his success. But it was not always clear that Smith would rise to lead the chamber he was first elected to in 2002. But just six years into his career, he knew that he wanted to succeed former House Speaker Gaye Symington in 2008 when she launched a bid for governor.\n\n\n\nHis interest in politics emerged in his youth, and he carried it through to the University of Vermont where he served in the student senate. After a stint practicing law in New York City he returned to the community where he was raised. Three years after his return he was elected to the House.\n\n\n\n\u0093I think I was a little big for my britches and I was expecting some plum assignment. I ended up on Fish and Wildlife Resources, which is not where I asked to be. But what I found after my initial disappointment was just an incredible level of camaraderie on that committee as well as the ability to make big changes for the people of the state of Vermont \u0097 changes around the deer herd, big stormwater changes. My first term was just great. It was also an opportunity for me to sit back and watch how things got done,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nSmith was part of a Lamoille County delegation that included chairs of powerful committees. He used that to his advantage, observing them and studying how to be an effective legislator. He never served as chairman of a committee, and was only an informal part of House leadership. But that didn\u0092t hold him back.\n\n\n\n\u0093I think that what happened is that I had spent a lot of time getting to know my colleagues. I had tried to be someone who people felt like they could come to, particularly around money matters, and just had spent a lot of time soaking in the place and getting to know people who I thought were influencers,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nAs Symington\u0092s plans became clear, Smith became more interested in running for speaker. The idea seemed out of reach, though.\n\n\n\n\u0093At the time I wasn\u0092t really able to see a path when I first started thinking about it, but as I talked to people it became clear that there might be an opportunity,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nFour others were also vying for the job. Reps. Johanna Donovan and Carolyn Partridge were angling, as was former Rep. Mark Larson and now Sen. John Rodgers. Smith turned to a few allies for help. Rep. Tony Klein, the chair of House Energy and Natural Resources, Rep. Donna Sweaney, chair of House Government Operations, and former House Speaker and current Buildings and General Services Commissioner Michael Obuchowski came to his aid.\n\n\n\n\u0093All of those people were people who I turned to for advice in how to move forward if I wanted to run for speaker,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nSmith emerged as the victor, laying claim to the House leadership as former Republican Gov. Jim Douglas entered his final term in office and as Vermont and the nation grappled with the Great Recession. He said he began his tenure as speaker in uncertain times but found a Democratic majority that was ready to stick together to help the state.\n\n\n\n\u0093You have to remember the time. It was 2009, and we were very concerned about what the economy was looking like, and I think that there was a real cohesion around the fact that we had to address that issue. How we would address it was a different question. I think pretty quickly people realized that we needed to work as a team, together, even people who had not been supporters of mine,\u0094 Smith said. \u0093I think that we clearly understood that if we were going to be effective we were going to have to work together.\u0094\n\n\n\nAs the financial situation worsened, the House also took on gay marriage \u0097 a controversial social issue that divided lawmakers by conscience more than party. After Douglas vetoed the legislation to make Vermont the first state to embrace gay marriage through the legislative process, Smith and then-Sen. Peter Shumlin found the votes to override Douglas. That cemented Smith\u0092s position of authority in the House.\n\n\n\n\u0093Certainly the passage of marriage equality, I think, helped establish a reputation of someone who could get things done,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nSmith would go on to use his power and the Democratic majority he controlled to pass more legislation. Among the successes he claims are death with dignity, paid sick leave, GMO labeling, the recovery following Tropical Storm Irene and improving the state\u0092s transportation infrastructure. Stabilizing the state\u0092s unemployment trust fund is an accomplishment that \u0093has flown under the radar,\u0094 according to Smith.\n\n\n\nAs \u0093a delegator,\u0094 Smith credits his caucus, and in particular the committee chairs he put in place, with much of his success.\n\n\n\n\u0093I think that I\u0092m someone who sets broad direction, but who can discuss the details if necessary,\u0094 he said. \u0093I place a lot of responsibility and confidence and trust in not only my leadership team but (also) in the chairs, and expect them to come back to me when they have concerns about particular issues. I tried to be someone who would set the broad direction with them dealing with the details.\u0094\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Don Turner, of Milton, has been leading House Republicans for six of Smith\u0092s eight years as speaker. Turner said Smith is \u0093commanding in the way he presents himself and the issues\u0094 and has worked well with his leadership team.\n\n\n\n\u0093I have a lot of respect for Shap Smith as a person, as a leader,\u0094 Turner said. \u0093I respect him. I think he was fair, generally, and when I called him on it he would respond, generally. When he\u0092s leaving I have some concern because you wonder who\u0092s going to be the next speaker. At least in the number of years I\u0092ve worked with him I\u0092ve come to know what to expect. I know I could yell at him if I have to and vice versa.\u0094\n\n\n\n\u0093He knows my role. I know his role. He\u0092s a very controlling leader. He rules with a firm hand,\u0094 he said. \u0093I\u0092ve known since I\u0092ve been leader that if it comes to the floor it\u0092s passing. No matter what we try to do to it, he\u0092s not going to allow it to change much. He\u0092s had a pretty strong control over those majorities he\u0092s had,\u0094 Turner added.\n\n\n\nDespite his respect for Smith and his abilities, Turner said the state will be worse off for the policies enacted during Smith\u0092s tenure. The Democratic Party has misfired on health care reform and budgeting, according to Turner.\n\n\n\n\u0093For Vermont\u0092s sake, I think we\u0092re in a bad place under his leadership. I think that he was too close to the governor. I think that they were unchecked and single party rule was not good for Vermont. I think that the state is going to pay for the Speaker Smith-Gov. Shumlin era for decades,\u0094 Turner said.\n\n\n\nThe state\u0092s online health insurance marketplace, Vermont Health Connect, created under the federal Affordable Care Act, has been a blight for Shumlin and Democratic lawmakers who have struggled with how to respond. Smith said he regrets that the Legislature was not able to correct issues in a more timely fashion.\n\n\n\n\u0093I regret that we were not able to facilitate a better rollout of Vermont Health Connect and I still ask myself the question, given that we were going to do a state exchange, what it is that we could have done better to facilitate the correction of the mistakes earlier?\u0094 Smith said. \u0093It\u0092s not clear to me what we could have done. As I leave this office and as I do whatever I do next, I still will think about what we could have done differently.\u0094\n\n\n\nRep. Cynthia Browning, D-Arlington, has been the most persistent thorn in Smith\u0092s side. Like Turner, she praised Smith\u0092s leadership abilities but faulted the outcomes.\n\n\n\n\u0093I think in terms of running the House and effectively exerting himself as speaker, I think he\u0092s been a very good speaker,\u0094 she said. \u0093In terms of content, not so much. We blew the opportunity to fix the budget, to fix the tax code. One of the strongest agendas for Democrats is to have a simple, fair and effective tax code. We had the Blue Ribbon Tax Commission laid out. To me, that was a fundamental betrayal.\u0094\n\n\n\nWrapping up his speakership without reforming the tax code is a regret, according to Smith.\n\n\n\n\u0093I really wish that we could have undertaken a systematic restructuring of our revenue code,\u0094 he said. \u0093I don\u0092t think we\u0092ve ever had, not only people in all of the respective offices that would drive that conversation who were on the same page or who wanted to do it, but I also think that we have never been able to engage outside interests in a way that they would be ready for that kind of change.\u0094\n\n\n\nAs he reflected Wednesday on his time in the House, Smith declared that he was fully engaged in the end-of-session push and had yet to become nostalgic or emotional. He said doing so was not really part of his nature.\n\n\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t think anybody would suggest that I\u0092m the most emotive guy in the world, unless they see me when I\u0092m sort of angry about something,\u0094 he said. \u0093My sense is that probably as we gavel out it will hit me. I really love this place. I love this job. There is no job that I\u0092ve ever loved more. Bar none. The people that I\u0092ve worked with all across the aisle have been great and I will miss a lot of them,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nAs he offered his final remarks to the House late Friday night, the typically reserved Smith finally did show emotion. He may yet join the race for lieutenant governor and look to continue his service to the state. Or, he may go back to his legal career and focus on life with his wife Melissa, and his two children, Eli and Mia. Either way, few will suggest that Smith failed to leave his mark.\n\n\n\nneal.goswami @timesargus.com", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "rutland herald, rutland, montpelier, vermont, politics, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "owx42JO8vuWkAqHrRECpIvAKOvyL0ayHOzHQkbWgm5w", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Rutland Herald Online  -  Vermont election news, news coverage, local news, state government, sports, classifieds", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "MONTPELIER \u0097 Rep.
