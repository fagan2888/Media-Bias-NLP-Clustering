The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup.\n\nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27.\n\nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale.
