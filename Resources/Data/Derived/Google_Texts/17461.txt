Sen. Dick Durbin sported a tie suitable for Halloween as he spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, but his orange had a much different meaning: The Illinois Democrat was plugging National Gun Violence Awareness Day, an idea with roots in his home state.

As Durbin reminded his Senate colleagues, Hadiya Pendleton was just 15 years old when she was gunned down in Chicago on Jan. 29, 2013. Her death resonated nationally because just one week before, she had played with her King College Prep High School band at President Barack Obama’s second inauguration.

Since then, Pendleton’s friends have been active in trying to get guns off the streets. They started a group called Project Orange Tree, which joined forces with the Michael Bloomberg-backed Everytown for Gun Safety and similar groups. They stood together to create the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day on June 2.

“They decided that they would ask us to wear something orange today,” Durbin explained. “The color that hunters use when they’re in the woods to make sure no one shoots them.”

While Durbin showed his support on the Senate floor, some of his peers – including Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Al Franken, D-Minn. – used Twitter to get their constituents involved.

A number of celebrities also pledged support, but the effort got the National Rifle Association riled up. The NRA called the day “pointless” and classified it as “an easy way of scoring points for being ‘socially conscious.’”

“It’s a shame that quite a few presumably well-meaning celebrities are caught up in a thinly veiled anti-gun stunt orchestrated by Bloomberg and friends,” reads a post on the NRA America’s 1st Freedom website.

Ignoring the NRA's assessment, here's a group of politicians and celebrities who are #WearingOrange on Twitter:
