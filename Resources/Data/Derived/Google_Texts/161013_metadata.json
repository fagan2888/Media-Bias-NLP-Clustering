Burwell) allows Obamacare premium tax credits (subsidies) in states that do not run their own health insurance exchanges. The decision pretty much guarantees that all the Obamacare tax increases will be with us through at least 2016 \u2014 and probably forever. If the Court had ruled the other way, Obamacare detractors had hoped to trade the nullification of some or all of these tax increases for an extension of the premium tax credits for folks who would have lost them. That possibility is now off the table. With that thought in mind, here\u2019s a quick refresher course on the now-entrenched Obamacare tax increases that could affect you.\n\nAdditional 0.9% Medicare tax on salaries and self-employment income earned by \u201crich\u201d folks\n\nBefore Obamacare, the Medicare tax on salary and/or self-employment (SE) income was a flat 2.9%. If you\u2019re an employee, 1.45% was withheld from your paychecks, and the other 1.45% was paid by your employer. If you\u2019re self-employed, you paid the whole 2.9% yourself.\n\nAfter Obamacare, an extra 0.9% Medicare tax is charged on: (1) salary and/or SE income above $200,000 for an unmarried individual, (2) combined salary and/or SE income above $250,000 for a married joint-filing couple, and (3) salary and/or SE income above $125,000 for those who use married filing separate status. For self-employed individuals, the additional 0.9% Medicare tax hit comes in the form of a higher SE bill.\n\nAdditional 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income collected by \u201crich\u201d folks\n\nBefore Obamacare, investment income was not subject to any sort of Medicare tax.\n\nAfter Obamacare, all or part of your net investment income, including long-term capital gains and dividends, can get socked with a 3.8% Medicare surtax (the so-called net investment income tax). Therefore, the maximum federal rate on long-term gains and qualified dividends is actually 23.8% (20% for the \u201cregular\u201d capital gains tax plus 3.8% for the net investment income tax) versus the advertised 20% maximum rate.\n\nFortunately, the 3.8% surtax will not hit you unless your adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds: (1) $200,000 if you\u2019re unmarried, (2) $250,000 if you\u2019re a married joint-filer, or (3) $125,000 if you use married filing separate status.\n\nIf you are affected, the 3.8% surtax applies to the lesser of your net investment income or the amount of AGI in excess of the applicable threshold. For example, a married joint-filing couple with AGI of $325,000 and $100,000 of net investment income would pay the 3.8% surtax on $75,000 (the amount of excess AGI). If the same couple has AGI of $400,000, they would pay the 3.8% surtax on $100,000 (the entire amount of their net investment income).\n\nFor details on the 3.8% surtax, see Are you exposed to the net investment income tax?\n\nCap on Healthcare FSA contributions\n\nBefore Obamacare, there was no tax-law limit on annual contributions to your employer\u2019s health care flexible spending account (FSA) plan (although many plan imposed their own limits). Amounts you contribute to a health care FSA are subtracted from your taxable salary. Then you can use the funds to reimburse yourself tax-free to cover qualified medical expenses.\n\nAfter Obamacare, the maximum annual health care FSA contribution for each employee is capped at $2,500 (with periodic inflation adjustments).\n\nHigher threshold for itemized medical expense deductions\n\nBefore Obamacare, you could claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses paid for you, your spouse, and your dependents, to the extent those expenses exceed 7.5% of your AGI.\n\nAfter Obamacare, the hurdle is raised to 10% of AGI. However, if either you or your spouse is age 65 or older at year-end, the more favorable 7.5%-of-AGI threshold remains in force for this year and next year. For 2017 and beyond, however, the 10%-of-AGI deduction threshold will apply to everybody, regardless of age.\n\nPunitive penalty on employer reimbursements for individual employee health policy premiums\n\nAs I explained in last week\u2019s column, Obamacare also imposes a stiff penalty on employers that offer plans that reimburse employees for premiums paid by them for individual health insurance policies. The penalty can also apply to direct employer payments of premiums for employees\u2019 individual health policies. The penalty is $100 per-employee per-day, which can amount to $36,500 per employee over the course of a full year. Needless to say, employers aren't going to continue arrangements that would be hit with the penalty, and that is too bad for employees who would have benefited. For details on this penalty, see What changes to Obamacare could mean for small-business taxes.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nRealistically, King v. Burwell virtually eliminates any chance of dismantling Obamacare \u2014 and all the tax increases buried within. Even if the Republican presidential candidate wins in 2016, legislation to repeal Obamacare would probably not make it through the Senate. On the other hand, folks who are now sure to be eligible for Obamacare premium tax credits have reason to be happy with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Here\u2019s a quick refresher course on the now-entrenched Obamacare tax increases that could affect you.", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO817_obamac_ZG_20150625120114.jpg", "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Bill Bischoff", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Here\u2019s a quick refresher course on the now-entrenched Obamacare tax increases that could affect you.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-tax-increases-are-now-locked-in-at-least-through-2016-2015-06-25", "author": "Bill Bischoff", "parsely-title": "Obamacare tax increases are now locked in at least through 2016", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-25T14:56:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Here\u2019s a quick refresher course on the now-entrenched Obamacare tax increases that could affect you.", "title": "Obamacare tax increases are now locked in at least through 2016", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-tax-increases-are-now-locked-in-at-least-through-2016-2015-06-25", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO817_obamac_ZG_20150625120114.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DO817_obamac_ZG_20150625120114.jpg"}, "article.id": "734B18A8-1B6A-11E5-9CD3-68FCA03518AE", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Additional 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income collected by \u201crich\u201d folksBefore Obamacare, investment income was not subject to any sort of Medicare tax.\nThe decision pretty much guarantees that all the Obamacare tax increases will be with us through at least 2016 \u2014 and probably forever.\nWith that thought in mind, here\u2019s a quick refresher course on the now-entrenched Obamacare tax increases that could affect you.\nAdditional 0.9% Medicare tax on salaries and self-employment income earned by \u201crich\u201d folksBefore Obamacare, the Medicare tax on salary and/or self-employment (SE) income was a flat 2.9%.\nAfter Obamacare, all or part of your net investment income, including long-term capital gains and dividends, can get socked with a 3.8% Medicare surtax (the so-called net investment income tax)."}
