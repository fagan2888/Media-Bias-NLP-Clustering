PRESIDENT OBAMA: The only thing that our democracy can't afford is a situation where one side says, 'Unless I get my way and only my way, unless I get concessions before we even start having a serious give and take, I will threaten to shut down the government or I will threaten to not pay America's bills.' So, I will not eliminate any topic of conversation and I have shown myself willing to engage all the parties involved, every leader, on any issue.
