And for this final one, I\u2019m going to try to make it shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.\n\nI also understand that because it\u2019s an election season, expectations for what we\u2019ll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again.\n\nBut tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I\u2019ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.\n\nBut for my final address to this chamber, I don\u2019t want to talk just about the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.\n\nI want to focus on our future.\n\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change \u2014 change that\u2019s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It\u2019s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It\u2019s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.\n\nAmerica has been through big changes before \u2014 wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \u201cdogmas of the quiet past.\u201d Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America\u2019s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did \u2014 because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril \u2014 we emerged stronger and better than before.\n\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2014 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law \u2014 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It\u2019s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It\u2019s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.\n\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer \u2014 regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.\n\nFirst, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?\n\nSecond, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us \u2014 especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?\n\nThird, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?\n\nAnd finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\u2019s best in us, and not what\u2019s worst?\n\nLet me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We\u2019re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the \u201990s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\n\nAnyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true \u2014 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2014 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven\u2019t let up. Today, technology doesn\u2019t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.\n\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It\u2019s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\n\nFor the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We\u2019ve made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we\u2019ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.\n\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\u2019ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.\n\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We\u2019ve already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower\u2019s income. Now, we\u2019ve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\u2019m going to keep fighting to get that started this year.\n\nOf course, a great education isn\u2019t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn\u2019t lose what they\u2019ve already worked so hard to build.\n\nThat\u2019s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn\u2019t weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\u2019s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we\u2019ll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\n\nNow, I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\u2019s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\u2019t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\u2019s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\u2019s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.\n\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I\u2019d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.\n\nBut there are other areas where it\u2019s been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years \u2014 namely what role the government should play in making sure the system\u2019s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.\n\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there\u2019s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won\u2019t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn\u2019t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren\u2019t the reason wages haven\u2019t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who\u2019ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.\n\nIn fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?\n\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\u2019t deny Sputnik was up there. We didn\u2019t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.\n\nThat spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We\u2019re Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We\u2019re Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We\u2019re every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world. And over the past seven years, we\u2019ve nurtured that spirit.\n\nWe\u2019ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We\u2019ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.\n\nBut we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they\u2019ve had in over a decade. Tonight, I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\u2019s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I\u2019m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we\u2019ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.\n\nMedical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.\n\nLook, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You\u2019ll be pretty lonely, because you\u2019ll be debating our military, most of America\u2019s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\u2019s a problem and intend to solve it.\n\nBut even if the planet wasn\u2019t at stake; even if 2014 wasn\u2019t the warmest year on record \u2014 until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2014 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?\n\nSeven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal \u2014 in jobs that pay better than average. We\u2019re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2014 something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.\n\nGas under two bucks a gallon ain\u2019t bad, either.\n\nNow we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future \u2014 especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.\n\nNone of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\u2019ll create, the money we\u2019ll save, and the planet we\u2019ll preserve \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.\n\nClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that\u2019s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there\u2019s a problem.\n\nI told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It\u2019s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead \u2014 they call us.\n\nAs someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\u2019s not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria \u2014 states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.\n\nPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\u2019s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.\n\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That\u2019s the story ISIL wants to tell; that\u2019s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don\u2019t need to build them up to show that we\u2019re serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world\u2019s largest religions. We just need to call them what they are \u2014 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\u2019s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.\n\nOur foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can\u2019t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2014 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t pass muster on the world stage.\n\nWe also can\u2019t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It\u2019s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq \u2014 and we should have learned it by now.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\n\nThat\u2019s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\u2019re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.\n\nThat\u2019s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\n\nThat\u2019s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.\n\nThat\u2019s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs. With TPP, China doesn\u2019t set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.\n\nFifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That\u2019s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.\n\nAmerican leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world \u2014 except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change \u2014 that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria \u2014 something I\u2019ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\n\nThat\u2019s strength. That\u2019s leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.\n\nThat\u2019s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn\u2019t a matter of political correctness. It\u2019s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\u201d When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn\u2019t make us safer. That\u2019s not telling it like it is. It\u2019s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As prepared for delivery.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "As prepared for delivery.", "title": "Read the Full Transcript of Obama's Final State of the Union", "url": "http://time.com/4178279/state-union-transcript-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/president-barack-obama-state-of-the-union-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/president-barack-obama-state-of-the-union-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "As prepared for delivery.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Read the Full Transcript of Obama's Final State of the Union"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "full transcript, state of the union, obama, 2016 sotu, barack obama, state of the union", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "full transcript, state of the union, obama, 2016 SOTU, barack obama, state of the union"}, "article_summary": "We made change work for us, always extending America\u2019s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people.\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change \u2014 change that\u2019s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.\nThis is a full transcript of his remarks, as prepared for delivery.\nThat\u2019s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.\nToday, technology doesn\u2019t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated."}
