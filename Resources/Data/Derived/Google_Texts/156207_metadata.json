The government loses about $100 billion in such payments annually.\n\nIn its financial statement for 2013, the Pentagon reported that it had lost about $68 million to improper payments. In a new report, auditors say the real number is much higher. That\u2019s because the Defense Department did not review at least 73 million claims worth a total of $13.1 billion. These claims had been flagged as being fraudulent so as part of their accounting practice, the agency leaves them out of the total improper payment tally.\n\nRelated: 5 Years of Over $100 Billion in Improper Payments\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s Inspector General estimated that had these claims been included in DoD\u2019s report, the actual amount of improper payments would be closer to about $213 million, or $145 million higher than DoD\u2019s estimate.\n\n\u201cThe inadequate methodologies resulted in unreliable improper payment estimates, and limit DoD\u2019s ability to identify and report improper payments, determine underlying weaknesses that cause the improper payments, and initiate corrective actions to reduce the improper payments,\u201d the auditors said in the report.\n\nInstead of reviewing all of the claims, officials from the Defense Health Agency tested a select number of contracts and excluded claims that they said were at risk for fraud or abuse\u2014a move that the auditors say does not fairly reflect the actual amount of money lost to erroneous payments.\n\nThe practice of allowing \u201cat-risk payments to be excluded from consideration increase the risk that improper payments may not be identified,\u201d the IG said in the report.\n\nRelated: 10 Outrageous Examples of Government Waste\n\nThe Pentagon disagreed. It argued that the reporting requirements surrounding improper payments don\u2019t pertain to fraudulent health care claims.\n\n\u201cThe primary basis for this belief rests in an understanding that reporting of such information could and would expose investigative and litigation pending actions to public disclosure,\u201d Joseph Marshal, DHA\u2019s business support director, wrote in a response to the report.\n\nHe added that the agency has a whole separate unit dedicated to investigating fraud.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s watchdog is flagging the behemoth agency for severely underestimating h", "title": "Pentagon Didn\u2019t Report $145 Million in Improper Payments", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/16/Pentagon-Didn-t-Report-145-Million-Improper-Payments", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/16/Pentagon-Didn-t-Report-145-Million-Improper-Payments", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s watchdog is flagging the behemoth agency for severely underestimating h", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe inadequate methodologies resulted in unreliable improper payment estimates, and limit DoD\u2019s ability to identify and report improper payments, determine underlying weaknesses that cause the improper payments, and initiate corrective actions to reduce the improper payments,\u201d the auditors said in the report.\nIn its financial statement for 2013, the Pentagon reported that it had lost about $68 million to improper payments.\nUnder federal law, agencies are required to report how much they lose to improper payments each year.\nThe practice of allowing \u201cat-risk payments to be excluded from consideration increase the risk that improper payments may not be identified,\u201d the IG said in the report.\nIt argued that the reporting requirements surrounding improper payments don\u2019t pertain to fraudulent health care claims."}
