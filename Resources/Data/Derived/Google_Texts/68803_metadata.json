Paul Curtman told The Daily Signal. \u201cWhat makes us different is, we\u2019re recognizing all of that, and the legislature is vetting legislation for our Constitution, but then, ultimately, the idea is to let the people to continue to be the final arbitrator of this issue.\u201d\n\nCurtman is the House sponsor of a religious liberty bill known as Senate Joint Resolution 39, which would amend the state\u2019s constitution. In March, after a historic 36-hour filibuster, the state Senate approved the bill. Now the measure is working its way through the House, where, if it passes, it won\u2019t go to the governor\u2019s desk, but rather to a ballot initiative later this year where every Missouri citizen has a chance to weigh in.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u2019s SJR39 represents a seminal moment in the battle for religious liberty,\u201d said Ryan Johnson, president of the Missouri Alliance for Freedom. \u201cThe election will be the first opportunity for the people to vote on this issue since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Missouri\u2019s historic role as the bellwether state will be an important gauge by which we measure the opinion of the American electorate in the ongoing religious freedom vs. gay marriage contest.\u201d\n\nSupporters say if SJR 39 were to take effect, it would ban government discrimination against people of faith because of their beliefs about marriage. Schools and charities, for example, would be protected from losing access to government programs because of their beliefs about marriage.\n\nOpponents argue that the measure would encourage discrimination against gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals by allowing some private business owners such as photographers and florists to deny service for a wedding or marriage because of their religious beliefs.\n\nThey believe that such measure would drive business out of the state, sending the message that Missouri condones discrimination against the LGBT community.\n\nAlready, big businesses are threatening boycotts. Missouri Competes, a group of more than 100 businesses that came together to fight the effort, called the bill \u201cmisguided\u201d and said it would \u201cdamage Missouri\u2019s reputation and hamper our state\u2019s ability to attract top talent.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas City Sports Commission estimated that the effort could cost the state more than $50 million annually.\n\n\u201cSenate Joint Resolution 39 would have severe negative ramifications for the entire state of Missouri, not to mention the additional negative impact from a loss of conventions, other events, and leisure travel that would cause irrevocable economic harm,\u201d Kathy Nelson, president and CEO of the Kansas City Sports Commission, said. \u201cThese events do not have to come to Missouri; most of the fans that spend their money in our state at these events come from outside Missouri; and once they are lost they are not likely to come back.\u201d\n\nCurtman, the bill\u2019s House sponsor, called the claims \u201chighly disingenuous.\u201d In a phone interview with The Daily Signal, he said:\n\nWe have these business elites who are choosing what states to do business in and the reason they\u2019re choosing what states to do business in is due to their deeply-held beliefs. But when they tell us that they\u2019re not going to do business with us if we pass a bill like this or if the people approve this bill, then what they\u2019re really saying is they want to reserve the right to do business in states based on how they believe, but they don\u2019t want the people of our state to be able to reserve the right to do business based on their deeply-held religious beliefs.\n\nMore important than a price tag, Curtman said, are principles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not they think there\u2019s a certain price tag for our First Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s $1 or $1 million, I just don\u2019t think the First Amendment\u2019s for sale, and I think people should have the right to exercise or practice their business in accordance with their own faith.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Missouri lawmakers say they won't back down to pressure by big businesses to withdraw a religious liberty bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Missouri lawmakers say they won't back down to pressure by big businesses to withdraw a religious liberty bill.", "title": "Missouri Tries to Send Religious Liberty Bill to the People", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/missouri_Sunset.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T23:04:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Xw45bo"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Missouri lawmakers say they won't back down to pressure by big businesses to withdraw a religious liberty bill.", "title": "Missouri Tries to Send Religious Liberty Bill to the People", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/missouri_Sunset.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Religious Liberty", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2016-04-13T16:41:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T23:04:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "missouri lgbt, religious liberty, missouri religious freedom, missouri religious liberty, Senate Joint Resolution 39, lgbt"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMissouri\u2019s SJR39 represents a seminal moment in the battle for religious liberty,\u201d said Ryan Johnson, president of the Missouri Alliance for Freedom.\nAs religious liberty bills continue to draw ire from big businesses in North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi, another state is bracing for a similar battle: Missouri.\nBut unlike other states where the fate of the legislation was left to the governor, in Missouri, lawmakers want the people to decide.\nThey believe that such measure would drive business out of the state, sending the message that Missouri condones discrimination against the LGBT community.\nIn March, after a historic 36-hour filibuster, the state Senate approved the bill."}
