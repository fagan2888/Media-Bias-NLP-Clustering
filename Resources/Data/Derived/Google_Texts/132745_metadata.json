Although surgery comes with a risk, it seems more complications arise post-surgery from the hands of no other than the surgeon herself. Doctors have coined the term as \u201cretained surgical items\u201d (RSI).\n\nEvery year, 1,500 patients in the U.S. have surgical objects accidentally left inside them after surgery, according to The Joint Commission, an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies more than 20,500 health care organizations and programs in the country. Most of the RSI are sponges used to control patient bleeding during long operations. RSI can lead to pain, infections, and other medical complications.\n\nThe implementation of electronic scanners and sponge tracking systems has been promoted for use in order to account for all items after surgery. For example, doctors and nurses in the Indiana University Health system would use sponge counts to keep track of the gauzy pads during surgery. However, out of the 34,000 surgeries performed each year at IU Health\u2019s three-hospital campus in Indianapolis, they would get one or two cases in which the sponges were left in a patient.\n\nIU Health now uses tracking technology, which costs about $275,000 a year, including the annual cost of the tagged sponges which are about $8 per surgery, USA Today reported. IU hospitals have not had a single lost-sponge case in five years since the use of the tracking technology. This has led to a lot of savings and reduced medical costs.\n\nClick \u201cView Gallery\u201d to view the case reports of patients whose lives were in jeopardy when it came to surgery and surgical tools.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smooth operator, left behind, surgical tools, surgery tools, operating room, surgeons, medical procedure, nothing left behind, retained surgical items", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Surgeons create patients\u2019 worst nightmares by unintentionally leaving behind these surgical tools \u2014 from 7-inch forceps to a 12-inch metal rod \u2014 inside their bodies.", "title": "7 Surgical Tools Accidentally Left Inside Patients [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/not-so-smooth-operator-7-surgical-tools-accidentally-left-behind-after-surgery-315298", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/22/doctors-and-medical-staff-work-during-knee-prosthesis-surgery-operation-room-hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Surgeons create patients\u2019 worst nightmares by unintentionally leaving behind these surgical tools \u2014 from 7-inch forceps to a 12-inch metal rod \u2014 inside their bodies.", "title": "7 Surgical Tools Accidentally Left Inside Patients [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/not-so-smooth-operator-7-surgical-tools-accidentally-left-behind-after-surgery-315298", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/22/doctors-and-medical-staff-work-during-knee-prosthesis-surgery-operation-room-hospital.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/22/doctors-and-medical-staff-work-during-knee-prosthesis-surgery-operation-room-hospital.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-12-24T09:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T09:20:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Surgeons create patients\u2019 worst nightmares by unintentionally leaving behind these surgical tools \u2014 from 7-inch forceps to a 12-inch metal rod \u2014 inside their bodies."}, "article_summary": "Click \u201cView Gallery\u201d to view the case reports of patients whose lives were in jeopardy when it came to surgery and surgical tools.\nIU hospitals have not had a single lost-sponge case in five years since the use of the tracking technology.\nThe implementation of electronic scanners and sponge tracking systems has been promoted for use in order to account for all items after surgery.\nAlthough surgery comes with a risk, it seems more complications arise post-surgery from the hands of no other than the surgeon herself.\nDoctors have coined the term as \u201cretained surgical items\u201d (RSI)."}
