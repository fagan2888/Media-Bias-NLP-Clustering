College baseball leagues give players a chance to work on their skills



Former Londonderry High School standout Rob Del Signore didn't pitch much last spring during his freshman season at Southern New Hampshire University. Del Signore appeared in seven games (two starts), but spent a total of 16 innings on the mound.

..

That lack of work is the primary reason Del Signore is spending his summer playing for the Futures Collegiate Baseball League's Nashua Silver Knights.



"Just getting live innings on the mound as opposed to (bullpen sessions) - it's a huge difference," Del Signore said. "I haven't pitched consistently since my senior year in high school. If you don't play over the summer, you lose a lot."

..

Playing college baseball at a high level requires almost a year-round commitment, which helps explain why New Hampshire is home to four summer teams stocked with college talent: The Silver Knights and Portsmouth-based Seacoast Mavericks of the FCBL, and the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Keene Swamp Bats and Laconia Muskrats. The rosters of all four teams are dotted with New Hampshire residents who are playing summer ball to elevate their game.

..

Derry resident Tim Viehoff is pitching for Muskrats this summer, and entered the weekend leading the NECBL in strikeouts (36 in 32 innings), tied for the league lead in victories (five) and ranked second in ERA (0.28). Viehoff, who attended Pinkerton Academy of Derry, went 4-1 with a 2.10 ERA for SNHU last spring, but, because of arm trouble, was limited to 30 innings on the mound.

..

"I should have pitched 80 or 90 (innings)," Viehoff said. "To make it to the next level you have to show you can pitch a lot.



"I'm just going out there pitching and trying to get better. The competition is so high in this league. Almost every kid is a big Division I player. My coaches want me to work on my breaking ball, my offspeed stuff in general. Getting a feel for it when you're throwing to batters."

..

Many players in the NECBL and FCBL are placed in those leagues by their college coach. Some are given specific instruction on where improvement is needed. That was not the case with Ryan Moloney, who is playing for the Silver Knights this summer. Like Del Signore, Moloney played high school baseball at Londonderry. He will be entering his junior season at the University of Massachusetts.

..

"My (college) coach didn't tell me anything to work on, but I had stuff I wanted to work on," Moloney said. "Mainly my slider. That's my out pitch here. I just have to make it sharper . better location with it. I have to work on burying it more.

..

"I think the more you throw the better. We'll have time off in the winter, so I'm not worried about my arm or anything."



Although Moloney said playing in the FCBL is primarily about advancing a player's development, winning games is still a high priority. He said a there are times when fine-tuning a pitch has to take a back seat to retiring a batter at a key moment in a game

..

"I'm not going to try to work on things in big situations," Moloney explained. "I'm going to throw what I feel comfortable with and what I feel will work the best."



The most difficult job in these summer leagues may belong to a team's manager. Just ask St. Anselm pitching coach Nick Cenatiempo, who is in his first season as the Muskrats manager. Centatiempo played at Manchester West before he pitched at St. John's, and will manage the Northern Division in next Sunday's NECBL All-Star Game at Goodall Park in Sanford, Maine.

..

"The toughest part of my job is working for the GM/ownership, who want to win, but dealing with college coaches who have placed players here so they can improve," Cenatiempo said. "It's tough to please everybody, but you want to make both parties happy."

..

"(Development) is definitely secondary to winning," Viehoff added.



Cenatiempo said he tries to use his players in the same role they have on their college team. He also said his job is more about managing than teaching.

..

"I don't touch the guys," Cenatiempo said. "What I mean by that is if a guy's mechanics aren't good, I don't correct it. That's not my job. I'm not his pitching coach.



"These players are also here because they want exposure for professional scouts. It's also a good maturity time for these guys who are here on their own (Laconia players live with host families)."

..

Nick Angelini is an outfielder with the Silver Knights and one of the few players in the FCBL who did not play in college last season. Angelini completed his senior season at Bedford High School in the spring, when he was named the Division I Player of the Year.

..

Angelini was planning to play American Legion Baseball this summer, but had a strong game against Bishop Guertin of Nashua at Holman Stadium - the Silver Knights home field - during the regular season, when a member of the Silver Knights front office was in attendance. Angelini was offered a roster spot following that game.

..

Angelini said he accepted because he wanted to face better pitching than he saw in high school before starting his college career. He will be a freshman at Bryant University in the fall.



"What I wanted to do is become familiar with this style of play - the intensity of the game - to hopefully give myself a chance of starting next year," Angelini said. "I wanted to know what I was coming in to."
