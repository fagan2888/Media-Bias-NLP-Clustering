The state has issued an emergency suspension of a day care home in northeast Wichita.

On Wednesday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) issued the order against the Lighthouse Learning Day Care, operated by Brittiney Hardwell at a home in the 5100 block of Crestview.

According to the order, surveyors were sent to conduct a compliance survey of the day care on March 31. When they arrived, someone besides Hardwell answered the door and was holding an infant. They also saw another child and heard other children's voices coming from inside the home. But the person who answered said no day care children were there and that she would not allow a survey of the home.

After calling police, the surveyors were allowed to enter. Inside they found the operator of the daycare and numerous children under their care.

Hardwell told the surveyors the day care was closed for the day, but they found 12 children currently under her care including 10 in the basement - which per a fire inspection was not approved for use. The number of children also exceeded the number allowed by her temporary permit.

The order also said the operator was "not tending to the needs of the children in care and was not aware at all times of the location and activity of the children."

Records for other adults in the home had also not been submitted to the KDHE.

The order can be appealed. To view the order in its entirety, click the link attached to this report:
