And he dismissed Republicans who declared their inclusion in the spending bill is a victory against ObamaCare.\n\nThe spokesman noted that Congress has voted 50 times to repeal the president\u2019s signature healthcare law since 2010.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider their ambitions, the steps that are included in this proposal are quite, quite meager,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers also lifted the four-decade-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports, another provision the White House is against. But in exchange, Republican lawmakers agreed to extend a series of tax breaks for renewable energy producers.\n\n\u201cThe administration doesn\u2019t support every element of the agreement, but there are a lot of reasons for the president to feel good about what was accomplished,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nDemocrats also won victories in the deal by making permanent the expansions of the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit and college tuition tax breaks. All were key pieces of Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus law.\n\nEarnest called those tax provisions \u201ca great example of how the president brought change to Washington, D.C. in a way that will be felt by 24 million Americans across the country.\u201d\n\nCongress will need to pass a stopgap funding measure on Wednesday to avoid a government shutdown. That continuing resolution will run through Dec. 22 to give the Senate enough time to pass both the tax and spending bills.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the tax measure on Thursday, and the spending bill Friday.\n\n--This report was updated at 2:49 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "There are strong signals Obama will sign the measures if they pass the House and Senate.", "description": "There are strong signals Obama will sign the measures if they pass the House and Senate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jordan Fabian", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "There are strong signals Obama will sign the measures if they pass the House and Senate.", "title": "White House praises sweeping omnibus, tax deal", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/263457-white-house-praises-sweeping-omnibus-tax-deal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamaspeech120715getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/263457-white-house-praises-sweeping-omnibus-tax-deal", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-16T12:22-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ashley Perks", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Omnibus spending bill,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-16T12:22:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/263457-white-house-praises-sweeping-omnibus-tax-deal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "There are strong signals Obama will sign the measures if they pass the House and Senate.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House praises sweeping omnibus, tax deal"}, "dcterms.title": "White House praises sweeping omnibus, tax deal"}, "article_summary": "The White House gave a thumbs-up on Wednesday to a sweeping year-end deal on taxes and government funding.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe feel good about the outcome, primarily because we got a compromise budget agreement,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.\nLawmakers also lifted the four-decade-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports, another provision the White House is against.\nThe House is expected to vote on the tax measure on Thursday, and the spending bill Friday.\nThe omnibus spending measure was largely stripped of controversial policy riders opposed by the White House and Democrats, including language rolling back Obama\u2019s Syrian refugee plans and key environmental and financial regulations."}
