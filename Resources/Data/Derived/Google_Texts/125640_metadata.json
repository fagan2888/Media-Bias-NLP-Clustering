On Wednesday, Judge Dennis Hall asked Attorney General John Suthers\u2019 office for a response to the Fildeys\u2019 request for a judgment based on the arbiter\u2019s recommendation.\n\nOver two days of hearings this week, the board agreed to recommend that legislators pay about $12 million to 26 claimants, including the Fildeys. The arbiters had recommended payouts totaling more than $16 million plus interest.\n\nThe arbiters recommended awards for noneconomic losses, including the deaths of three people, as well as for property loss and other economic losses.\n\nAndrew Newcomb, a lawyer for 15 of the claimants, said his clients also will ask Hall for judgments.\n\nBy statute, the board cannot make recommendations on noneconomic losses.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop the legislature from considering remedies for economic and noneconomic losses recommended by arbiters.\n\nEven for economic losses, the panel\u2019s recommendations were lower than those of arbiters by as much as 40 percent, Newcomb said.\n\n\u201cWe all assumed they would honor the economic (damages), at least,\u201d Newcomb said. \u201cThere is no rhyme or reason \u2014 that is one of the reasons we were so shocked.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado State Forest Service set the fire, which was supposed to be a controlled burn but later roared into a wind-whipped inferno that scorched more than 1,400 acres.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lower North Fork victims challenge board\u2019s damage recommendations", "title": "Lower North Fork victims challenge board\u2019s damage recommendations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/10/lower-north-fork-victims-challenge-boards-damage-recommendations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140410__041312_HOOVER_CFW_13566xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140410__041312_HOOVER_CFW_13566xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-10T12:42:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:11:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19a5\"", "article_summary": "The arbiters recommended awards for noneconomic losses, including the deaths of three people, as well as for property loss and other economic losses.\nEven for economic losses, the panel\u2019s recommendations were lower than those of arbiters by as much as 40 percent, Newcomb said.\nThat doesn\u2019t stop the legislature from considering remedies for economic and noneconomic losses recommended by arbiters.\nBy statute, the board cannot make recommendations on noneconomic losses.\nA member of a Judicial Arbiter Group had earlier recommended that the Fildeys receive $891,187 plus interest."}
