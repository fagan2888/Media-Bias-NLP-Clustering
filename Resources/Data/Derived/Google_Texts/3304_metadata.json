Not because it sees growth and opportunity there, but because of onerous taxes here in the U.S. It\u2019s an ominous trend.\n\nThe Financial Times of London calls it \u201cone of the largest tax inversions ever.\u201d That is, a company seeking to avoid punitive taxes in one market by moving to another.\n\nNo doubt the FT is right. And after its recent $16 billion takeover of Swiss-based Alliance Boots, it would be easy for Walgreen to remake itself as a Swiss company.\n\nIf it did, the Democratic Party\u2019s liberals would no doubt call Walgreen unpatriotic for wanting to lessen its tax burden. In fact, they are responsible for an economic environment so hostile to capital and investment that companies now find it intolerable.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, corporate tax rates in the U.S. are the highest among the developed nations. The average rate in America in 2013 was 39.13%; for all of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, it stood at 28.2%.\n\nIn short, being headquartered here is a major competitive disadvantage for American firms.\n\nAccording to an analysis by UBS, Walgreen\u2019s U.S. tax rate is 37.5% \u2014 compared with Alliance Boots\u2019 rate in Europe of about 20%. That\u2019s a huge gap, worth billions of dollars a year.\n\nBut it\u2019s even worse than that. A recent OECD study says the \u201cintegrated tax rate\u201d \u2014 taxes on capital and income \u2014 for U.S. companies is a nightmarish 67.8% vs. 43.7% for the OECD.\n\nMany companies facing steep tax rates and insane regulations in the U.S. have had enough. They\u2019re keeping their profits overseas. Last week, Senate Finance Committee chief Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, reported U.S. corporations now hold $2.1 trillion in earnings in overseas accounts \u2014 a massive amount, roughly equal to 12% of U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nA total of 547 companies \u2014 including Apple, GE, Microsoft and Pfizer \u2014 have dramatically expanded their so-called foreign indefinitely reinvested earnings overseas, which let them avoid the punishing rates here at home.\n\n\u201cThe new numbers \u2026 certainly highlight what is one of the key challenges for tax reform,\u201d said Wyden. No kidding.\n\nWyden and his fellow Democrats will try to raise taxes even higher or gut foreign tax exemptions. If so, it will backfire. Companies won\u2019t invest here if government takes more of their money; they\u2019ll just find new ways to put it out of reach.\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t they?\n\nNot only are taxes too high, but also new laws such as Dodd-Frank and ObamaCare, a vast expansion of regulation, debt and the size of government, the federal takeover of entire industries, the bullying of Wall Street and demonization of CEOs, and forced CO2 cuts that will hammer manufacturers have made this the least pro-free market U.S. government in generations.\n\nEventually, a new Congress and president will get wise and reform our tax code, cut regulations, get government out of picking winners and losers, and end the war on entrepreneurs, business and investment.\n\nWhen they do, that $2.1 trillion will come flooding back as investment in America. And the resulting boom, with millions of new, high-paying jobs, will make our current stagflation-malaise seem like a bad memory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxes: Walgreen, America's venerable drug-store chain, is thinking the unthinkable: relocating to Europe.
