"Both schools talked this over, and we both agreed after seeing the weather forecasts and talking with local meteorologists that we should play the game Thursday instead," East High Principal Scott Rhodes said.

The change moves Thursday's scheduled JV game at North to 7 p.m. Monday.

This is the first time a game has been played on another night other than Friday night since 2008, when the Chase at East game was moved to a Monday night due to heavy rains.

Friday's forecast for East Flat Rock calls for a 90 percent chance of thunderstorms, and Thursday's forecast is mostly clear with just a 10 percent chance of rain.

WHKP 1450 AM will be broadcasting Thursday's game at East, and their on-the-air time will now be moved up to 6:30 p.m., according to WHKP Vice President and Sports Director Richard Rhodes.

As of 5:45 p.m. Wednesday, of the six area games, the North-East game is the only one that has been moved to Thursday. The only other in-town game on Friday night is Madison at Hendersonville, and it's Homecoming for the Bearcats.

"That's our big dilemma," HHS Athletic Director BJ Laughter said. "We have all of our Homecoming festivities set for Friday night, and our dance is Saturday. We are also honoring the three 1964 state championship teams of baseball, track and field and cross country prior to the game. It's their 50th anniversary. In addition to all of that, we're also announcing our Hendersonville High School Hall of Fame inductees for this year, so to move all this to another night would be quite a big undertaking."

The other area games still scheduled for Friday are Brevard at Tuscola, Mountain Heritage at Polk County, West Henderson at Smoky Mountain and Rosman at Hayesville.
