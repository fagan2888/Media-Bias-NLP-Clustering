I came home caked in mud, legs like jelly and half-cut on a mixture of sloe gin, cherry brandy and Whisky Mac. And as usual I offered up two silent prayers of gratitude \u2013 the first for my having survived another suicidal day in the saddle; the second for my good grace in having discovered \u2013 albeit rather late in life \u2013 the greatest sport on God\u2019s green earth.\n\nEveryone who hunts knows this. It\u2019s why, 10 years after it was rendered supposedly illegal, the sport remains at least as popular as it ever was , whatever Tracey Crouch says. According to the latest research, some 80 per cent of hunts have either held on to their supporters or recruited new ones since the Hunting Act came into effect. As one of those new recruits, I can tell you why this is: because once you\u2019ve tried it quite simply nothing else will do.\n\n\"Horses are herd animals and like nothing better than to hang out with a crowd of mates \u2013 especially if it involves galloping at reckless speeds...\"\n\nHunting is so brilliant because it combines so many of the things that make life worth living: the matchless beauty of our countryside; the camaraderie of shared danger; the glamour of a mobile cocktail party; the spirit of a warehouse rave; the application of hard-won skills; the escapist joy of living purely in the moment; the thrill of the chase; dressing up in fabulous costumes; rampant sex and passionate affairs (well, apparently).\n\nOf all these, what I\u2019ve come to enjoy most is the relationship you have with your horse. I don\u2019t come from a riding background; I used to dislike horsey people. Once you\u2019ve been out hunting, though, you get it totally. Your survival \u2013 it\u2019s quite a dangerous sport \u2013 depends almost entirely on the wildly unpredictable, almost uncontrollably powerful beast between your legs. The bond between you during the four or five hours of a hunt is so intense it\u2019s like becoming one united creature: no longer human and horse; more like a centaur.\n\nAnd the weird thing is, your horse is even more up for it than you are. Horses are herd animals and like nothing better than to hang out with a crowd of mates \u2013 especially if it involves galloping at reckless speeds and flying over hedges. When horses in a field see a hunt go past or even hear a horn or the \u201cmusic\u201d of the hounds, they go almost insane with excitement.\n\nThe people who want to ban hunting \u2013 including celebrities such as Ricky Gervais \u2013 claim to be animal lovers. But in my experience, the people who love animals best \u2013 because they understand them so deeply \u2013 are the ones involved in hunting: the kennel man who cares for the pack of 40 hounds (never \u201cdogs\u201d); the huntsman who can think like both fox and hound and can marshal his pack like a battle fleet; the terrier men on their quad bikes; the riders and their cherished mounts.\n\nChildren: I haven\u2019t yet mentioned them but I must for they are one of hunting\u2019s greatest joys. Rosy-cheeked pony clubbers in ties and hacking jackets, vying, fence for fence with the adults. There\u2019s no other activity on earth where children and adults can compete and bond on equal terms \u2013 same hardships, same risks, same buzz. Truly it\u2019s a pleasure to watch.\n\n\"If, on occasion \u2013 whoops! \u2013 the hounds do chase a fox, things get rather exciting.\"\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the fox. It\u2019s a complete misconception that hunting people hate foxes, let alone that they take pleasure when \u2013 only by accident, of course, these days \u2013 the fox gets despatched by the hounds.\n\nCharlie (as he\u2019s known) may be a pest and a villain but he\u2019s also the hero. The fox that meets his maker after a 10-mile point (not that this happens these days; we can but dream) will live forever in the hunting hall of fame. (Which is more than can be said for the many thousands of foxes who die each year in the slower, more \u201cnatural\u201d way of disease and starvation.)\n\nIf, on occasion \u2013 whoops! \u2013 the hounds do chase a fox, things get rather exciting. When you learn to ride there are all sorts of sensible rules about safety you follow: don\u2019t jump when it\u2019s too muddy or hard; don\u2019t gallop round tight bends. But following fast-moving hounds gives you licence to ignore them all.\n\nAfterwards, it feels a bit like it must do when you\u2019ve survived a battle. Everyone\u2019s amazed to be in one piece; you feel an extraordinary bond with those who have shared the experience. People who were strangers an hour before now feel like your oldest, most intimate friends.\n\nHunting has a reputation for exclusivity. But it\u2019s really not the case: you can do it too, if you want. Admittedly the horse hire and the kit and the \u201ccap\u201d don\u2019t come cheap but what I mean is it\u2019s not necessary to be the world\u2019s greatest rider (I\u2019m not) or even to be able to jump (there are always gates). The only things you do need are an appetite for speed and a steady nerve (though the booze does help) and a love of life. Perhaps you\u2019ve left it a bit late to be ready for the hunt on New Year\u2019s Day. But Boxing Day 2016 \u2013 why not? You\u2019re not getting any younger\u2026\n\nJames would love to hear from any hunts or any hunting folk who would like to assist him with his book Mr Delingpole's Sporting Tour (James@jamesdelingpole.com)", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "earth", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03535/hunt_pic_3535761k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "fox, hunting, fox-hunting, foxhunting, tracey crouch, ban, repeal, countryside, toffs, tally ho, Countryside,Earth,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Comment;Personal_View;Countryside", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/earth/countryside", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "fox, hunting, fox-hunting, foxhunting, tracey crouch, ban, repeal, countryside, toffs, tally ho", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Fox-hunting is the greatest sport on God's green earth", "section-id": 4884, "GSAGenre": "countryside", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-earth-countryside", "GSAMLC": "news/earth/countryside", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "earth", "description": "Boxing Day hunts are a highlight of the year for those who love the beauty of \n  our countryside", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 12070105, "DCSext.Category": "earth", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-26", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-earth-countryside", "last-modified": "2015-12-26", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 1227, "embedcount": 4, "authorName": "James Delingpole", "tag": "Countryside", "subsection": "Countryside", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 0, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 4}, "DCSext.articleId": 12070105, "tmgads.articleid": 12070105, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Fox-hunting is the greatest sport on God\u2019s green earth \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/12070105/Fox-hunting-is-the-greatest-sport-on-Gods-green-earth.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03535/hunt_pic_3535761k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"12070105\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-26T18:43:44Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"James Delingpole\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Comment\",\"Personal View\",\"Countryside\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Boxing Day hunts are a highlight of the year for those who love the beauty of   our countryside", "title": "Fox-hunting is the greatest sport on God's green earth", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/12070105/Fox-hunting-is-the-greatest-sport-on-Gods-green-earth.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03535/hunt_pic_3535761k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "countryside", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.earth.countryside", "DCSext.author": "James Delingpole", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2015-12-26 18:43"}, "article_summary": "Your survival \u2013 it\u2019s quite a dangerous sport \u2013 depends almost entirely on the wildly unpredictable, almost uncontrollably powerful beast between your legs.\n\u2013 the hounds do chase a fox, things get rather exciting.\n\u2013 the hounds do chase a fox, things get rather exciting.\"\nIt\u2019s why, 10 years after it was rendered supposedly illegal, the sport remains at least as popular as it ever was , whatever Tracey Crouch says.\nAnd as usual I offered up two silent prayers of gratitude \u2013 the first for my having survived another suicidal day in the saddle; the second for my good grace in having discovered \u2013 albeit rather late in life \u2013 the greatest sport on God\u2019s green earth."}
