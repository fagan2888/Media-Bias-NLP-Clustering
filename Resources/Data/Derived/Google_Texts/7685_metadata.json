Earlier installments profiled Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Vice President Joe Biden, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Congressman Paul Ryan, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Rand Paul, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nNot many names in Washington are more certain to elicit a strong response than that of Ted Cruz, Republican senator from Texas. To admirers, he\u2019s courageous, bold, and virtuous. To detractors, he\u2019s foolhardy, arrogant, and abrasive. And that\u2019s just when you listen to Republicans.\n\nCruz is the son of a working-class mother and an immigrant father who fled to America to escape communist persecution in Cuba. From his election to the Senate in 2012, it was clear to many observers that Cruz, with his unmistakable fighting spirit, was going to be a force within the GOP. Cruz\u2019s penchant for poking at what he sees as a class of stale, spineless, old-guard Republicans has earned the senator a devout following among tea partiers who describe the GOP establishment exactly the same way. But the establishment hasn\u2019t been silent.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

That didn\u2019t sit well with many Republicans who agreed with Cruz in principle, but not on tactics or strategy.\n\nBeginning with Cruz\u2019s effort to defund the president\u2019s healthcare law, many Republicans and Democrats alike believe he was the catalyst for last year\u2019s partial government shutdown, which proved to be politically damaging to Republicans. Cruz later said the GOP lost the fight because Senate Republicans didn\u2019t stand with House Republicans.\n\nCruz was saying the GOP shouldn\u2019t have folded, but rather pushed all of its chips to the center of the table and called the administration\u2019s bluff. But the Democrats legitimately had the better political hand all along. The electorate is predisposed to blame gridlock more on the opposition party than on the party that holds the White House. Beyond that, media reporting on the shutdown was overwhelmingly negative toward Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown damaged Cruz\u2019s chances at a presidential nomination since he it made him a polarizing figure, even within his own party. But if he does run, he has a passionate following. He\u2019s charismatic, a fantastic communicator, and no one will question his conservative credentials.\n\nLast week, Cruz was delivering the keynote address at a conference for Middle-Eastern Christians in Washington. Things started to go south when he said, \u201cChristians have no greater ally than Israel.\u201d He started hearing boos from the crowd at that point and responded by saying some in the crowd were consumed with hate. He walked off the stages after saying, \u201cIf you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people said, good for him. He stood by his convictions and stood up for Israel. But others said Cruz\u2019s actions were petulant, especially since Middle-Eastern Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet. But that\u2019s Ted Cruz. There\u2019s never any question where he stands on an issue. It\u2019s why some people find him off-putting, and it\u2019s the same reason why others love him.\n\nListen to more analysis of Ted Cruz\u2019s White House chances on The World and Everything in It:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "This article is the ninth in a series called\u00a0White House Wednesday,\u00a0by the staff of\u00a0The World and Everything in It,\u00a0looking at potential", "title": "WORLD | Ted Cruz: A polarizing figure inside and outside the GOP | Kent Covington | Sept. 17, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/09/ted_cruz_a_polarizing_figure_inside_and_outside_the_gop", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ap485693698201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "This article is the ninth in a series called\u00a0White House Wednesday,\u00a0by the staff of\u00a0The World and Everything in It,\u00a0looking at potential"}, "article_summary": "Not many names in Washington are more certain to elicit a strong response than that of Ted Cruz, Republican senator from Texas.\nListen to more analysis of Ted Cruz\u2019s White House chances on The World and Everything in It:\nBut that\u2019s Ted Cruz.\nCruz later said the GOP lost the fight because Senate Republicans didn\u2019t stand with House Republicans.\nThe electorate is predisposed to blame gridlock more on the opposition party than on the party that holds the White House."}
