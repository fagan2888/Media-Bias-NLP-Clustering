The plan would also seek to limit mega-mergers in the insurance and healthcare provider industries, which Clinton says can lead to higher prices and lower-quality care. She says she would enforce antitrust laws and strengthen authority to block unreasonable health insurance rate increases.

Clinton also said she would propose public-private efforts to incentivize insurers to provide coverage based on the value of care, rather than the number of tests and care. The plan would also expand Obamacare’s transparency provisions.

Republicans accused Clinton of “doubling down” on Obamacare. “Hillary Clinton’s ‘ObamaCare 2.0’ plan is a tacit admission that the president’s health law hasn’t succeeded, but doubling down on the same principles is only a recipe for more failure,” said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short.

She has lambasted Republicans for seeking to repeal Obamacare, pointing to the more than 16 million newly insured Americans under the law.
