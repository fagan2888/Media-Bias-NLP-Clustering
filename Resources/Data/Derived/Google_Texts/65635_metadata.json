While blocking Democratic initiatives is par for the course, Cruz even launched filibusters to block deals worked out by Republican leaders.\n\nLess than a week before the Illinois primary, Cruz, who took an unpaid leave from her high profile job at Goldman Sachs to support her husband on the campaign trail, pitched his candidacy to a crowd who might more naturally favor a fellow businessman like Donald Trump.\n\nShe struck a diplomatic tone, distinguishing Cruz from Trump, but also praising the Republican frontrunner for tapping into a pent up anger among the American electorate.\n\nEvading a question about a potential Trump-Cruz ticket, she said that it was very important to elect someone \u201cwho when our kids are sitting on the living room floor watching television, that we are proud to have them watch our president\u201d\u2014a not-so-subtle dig at the brash billionaire. She also called him a \u201cmaster marketer of calling out some of the problems that have been on the hearts and minds of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up. We need to address that and I think we can do so in a way that\u2019s positive, optimistic appeals to our better selves as Americans, not to our fears, and things that have historically divided us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe should be running for president,\u201d joked Mark Weyermuller, a small business owner and a longtime enthusiastic Cruz supporter. \u201cShe\u2019s on top of the issues, and she\u2019s very personable.\u201d He says he is supporting the Texas senator as the \u201cmost conservative\u201d in the crowd of Republican candidates.\n\nHeidi Cruz has said in the past that she can \u201csoften\u201d her husband\u2019s image, as she \u201cloves people.\u201d Her husband, she says, \u201ccalls it like it is.\u201d He\u2019s the combative lawyer who gladly picks a fight, while she is the deal-maker businesswoman. Asked by an audience member about being married to someone who argued in front of the Supreme Court, she quoted her young daughter\u2019s somewhat perplexing words: \u201cDad doesn\u2019t really talk at home.\u201d\n\nCruz tried to frame her husband in personal terms\u2014he is apparently a \u201cbig sleeper\u201d who likes to have 10-11 hours a night during stressful times.\n\nAsked by a father of a cancer survivor about Cruz\u2019s opposition to Obamacare, she underlined that she knew the costs of healthcare firsthand, since the family does not receive benefits through her job while she is on leave. In fact, the Cruz family does have health insurance, his campaign has reluctantly admitted.\n\n\u201cThe cost of our healthcare has gone through the roof,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many checks I write every month.\u201d\n\nLauren Stone and Jennifer Northouse are registered Republicans and owners of a Chicago recruiting firm. They are still deciding whether to vote for Cruz or Trump, and didn\u2019t leave the event entirely convinced, but were definitely \u201cmore excited\u201d about the prospect of a Cruz presidency.\n\nStone likes that Trump\u2019s campaign is self-funded, that he has been a \u201csuccessful businessman,\u201d and could be a \u201cturnaround president.\u201d But she agreed with her Northouse, her business partner, that Cruz would bring \u201ca certain level of class\u201d to the office. \u201cThe process and office should be treated with reverence,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Northouse, Cruz\u2019s emphasis on national security was crucial, as well as his pitch for tax reform.\n\nAs for the candidate\u2019s wife? \u201cIt was refreshing to see such a poised individual who could be the First Lady,\u201d Stone said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicago, Illinois Heidi Cruz, an investment manager at Goldman Sachs, likes to tell her business friends that they would last \u201cabout two minutes\u201d in Congress before they went looking for another job. \u00a0 \u201cThis is an environment where there\u2019s been no compromise on either side,\u201d she\u00a0told an an audience full of Chicago business and civic...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Hanna Kozlowska", "og": {"site_name": "Quartz", "description": "She's on leave from Goldman Sachs to help her husband on the campaign trail.", "title": "Heidi Cruz\u2019s sales pitch to business: her husband will \u201cnegotiate and compromise\u201d as president", "url": "http://qz.com/635715/heidi-cruzs-sales-pitch-to-big-business-her-husband-will-negotiate-and-compromise-as-president/", "image": "https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/rtx26e2f-e1457567054951.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chicago, Illinois Heidi Cruz, an investment manager at Goldman Sachs, likes to tell her business friends that they would last \u201cabout two minutes\u201d in Congress before they went looking for another job. \u00a0 \u201cThis is an environment where there\u2019s been no compromise on either side,\u201d she\u00a0told an an audience full of Chicago business and civic...", "title": "Heidi Cruz\u2019s sales pitch to business: her husband will \u201cnegotiate and compromise\u201d as president", "url": "http://qz.com/635715/heidi-cruzs-sales-pitch-to-big-business-her-husband-will-negotiate-and-compromise-as-president/", "image": "https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/rtx26e2f-e1457567054951.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=640", "creator": "@hannakozlowska", "site": "@qz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Quartz", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://qz.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7fd9e2ee486de5ce0c713891ec823ea6?s=16", "msapplication-tooltip": "Quartz is a digitally native news outlet for the new global economy.", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "application-name": "Quartz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/quartznews"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B2AFFFDBF9736993D778515CB307FAF", "google-site-verification": "Fm_AozADu13Rytwyc4XvQo_081WOanaXLa6xKd8dUgc", "bitly-verification": "3cc1017cee1d", "news_keywords": "chicago, Donald Trump, Goldman Sachs, GOP, Heidi Cruz, illinois, policy, politics, presidential race, primaries"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is an environment where there\u2019s been no compromise on either side,\u201d she told an an audience full of Chicago business and civic leaders at a breakfast event this week.\n\u201cShe should be running for president,\u201d joked Mark Weyermuller, a small business owner and a longtime enthusiastic Cruz supporter.\nWhile blocking Democratic initiatives is par for the course, Cruz even launched filibusters to block deals worked out by Republican leaders.\nFor Northouse, Cruz\u2019s emphasis on national security was crucial, as well as his pitch for tax reform.\n\u201cWe have to have someone who will negotiate and compromise, but advance the ball.\u201dThat\u2019s a striking statement from the wife of senator Ted Cruz, who has drawn the disdain of virtually all of his Senate colleagues largely because of his refusal to compromise."}
