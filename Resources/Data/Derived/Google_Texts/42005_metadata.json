She also, apparently, identifies as conservative. After introducing herself to the crowd, Bey used her three-minute spot to invite audience members to drop by the American Atheist table in the exhibition hall and learn more.\n\nAmerican Atheists is at CPAC on a mission, according to the organization\u2019s president, David Silverman. \u201cBy our calculations there are approximately 17 to 20 million atheists in this country who would vote Republican but don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we theorize, very reasonably, I think, that they don\u2019t vote Republican because the Republicans are pushing them away. I don\u2019t vote Republican because Republicans push me away.\u201d\n\nThe group wants conservative leaders to consider doing the unthinkable and not leading with their faith. \u201cIf they come out with \u2018We\u2019re a Christian nation,\u2019 that\u2019s akin to saying I\u2019m somehow less of an American. So why should I vote for that?\u201d Silverman asks. \u201cIf somebody comes out and says, \u2018I can\u2019t trust people who don\u2019t pray,\u2019 well, I don\u2019t pray. So when the conservatives come out, instead of saying we\u2019re for small government, and responsible gun rights, and a strong military, they\u2019re saying all of that after they say I\u2019m a second-class citizen.\u201d\n\nSilverman thinks this would be a win-win, benefitting both atheists and the GOP. Republicans would gain access to tens of millions of secular voters who agree with them on the issues already\u2014and right-leaning nonbelievers would get a real choice. Right now, \u201catheists by and large only have one party for which to vote,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re voting Democrat in huge numbers, but it\u2019s a defensive move. It\u2019s not because we agree with the policies, it\u2019s because atheists are afraid of Republicans, because Republicans are overtly hostile to us. And that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nBey, speaking to attendees at the organization\u2019s booth, is warm and welcoming. She describes American Atheists as a \u201cFirst Amendment group,\u201d says \u201cI love this country and I love this Constitution,\u201d and insists, \u201cWe\u2019re not here to hurt anyone or tell anyone that they\u2019re not free to worship or believe. We are just here to say, you can\u2019t say in order to believe in small government, you have to believe in Jesus. In order to believe that an American child should be well-educated, you\u2019ve got to give the glory to God. That\u2019s all we\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nThe group believes their message is resonating. \u201cPeople have been wonderful to me,\u201d Bey says. Minutes later, a woman who appears to be in her 60s or 70s walks by and, pointing at Bey, says, \u201cGreat job. Great job.\u201d Smiling widely, Bey says, \u201cThank you!\u201d then turns back to me and another reporter. \u201cThat\u2019s what people have been doing all day to me. I\u2019m not exaggerating, that\u2019s probably the hundredth person who\u2019s walked past me and said, \u2018Hi, good job!\u2019\u201d As for haters? \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten one.\u201d\n\nAmerican Atheists had to fight for its place at the conference this year. Silverman says the group paid for a table at 2014\u2019s CPAC only to have their booth pulled and their money returned to them after \u201ccertain members of the religious right\u201d complained. He came anyway, handing out flyers in the hallway and encouraging attendees to urge CPAC to let them have a table in 2015. Apparently it worked.\n\nWhether Bey and Silverman will have success convincing conservatives to stop talking about religion is another story. Their main point seems to be that faith is a private thing, and politicians should keep theirs to themselves. To many on the right, that\u2019s simply not the way it ought to be.\n\nDespite Silverman\u2019s claims, the group\u2019s policy positions may also hurt it. American Atheists, in addition to opposing mandatory school prayer and tax breaks for religious but not secular nonprofits, wants to completely overturn the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That\u2019s the law that gave us last summer\u2019s Hobby Lobby Supreme Court ruling, allowing certain religious business owners to opt out of providing contraception coverage to their workers. Silverman is adamant that employers are \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and that faith-based objections are irrelevant\u2014nobody should be excused from following the law.\n\nThat stance is unlikely to win him many friends at a place like CPAC. But at least this year he has a seat at the table to make his case.\n\nUPDATE 3/2/15: Jason Torpy, president of the Military Association of Atheists & Freethinkers, points out that many atheists serve their country in the armed forces.
