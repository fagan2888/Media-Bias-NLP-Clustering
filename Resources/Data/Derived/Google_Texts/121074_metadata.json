At that time, it estimated that Obamacare would reduce deficits by $109 billion over a decade. But that was for the 2013-22 budgetary window. Using growth rates derived from that estimate, Senate Budget Committee (SBC) staff found that this $109 billion budgetary surplus for 2013-22 would have become a $180 billion budgetary surplus for 2015-24, if nothing had changed in the interim.\n\nHowever, much has changed. Since the CBO last scored the deficit impact of Obamacare more than two years ago, Americans have witnessed the troubled rollout of the Obamacare exchanges, and President Obama has refused to enforce significant portions of the legislation (like the employer and individual mandates, at least as they pertain to some employers and some individuals). Meanwhile, the CBO has made technical adjustments to its baseline projections for federal health spending, has updated its economic forecasts, and has scored the legislation\u2019s effect on labor markets. Therefore, the 2012 figure of $109 billion for 2013-22, extrapolated out to $180 billion for 2015-24, is no longer current.\n\nThe CBO divides Obamacare\u2019s deficit impact into three areas, which it then adds together to produce its overall deficit tally. The first is \u201cnet changes in the deficit from insurance coverage provisions.\u201d That\u2019s the spending side of Obamacare (or at least its net spending on insurance coverage provisions).\n\nThe second is \u201cnet changes in the deficit from other provisions affecting direct spending.\u201d That\u2019s the money that would have been used to fund Medicare (or, to a lesser extent, other federal health programs) but is now slated to be used to fund Obamacare instead.\n\nThe third is \u201cnet changes in the deficit from other provisions affecting revenues.\u201d That\u2019s the taxes, fees, and penalties under Obamacare that don\u2019t have much, if any, relation to insurance coverage provisions. (The taxes that do relate to insurance coverage provisions \u2014 namely, the tax on \u201cCadillac plans\u201d and the fines for those who violate the individual or employer mandates \u2014 are instead included in the first area.)\n\nOf these three areas, the first \u2014 \u201cnet changes in the deficit from insurance coverage provisions\u201d \u2014 is the only one that the CBO updated in its most recent scoring of Obamacare, released in April 2014. Because of lower-than-expected enrollment in the Obamacare exchange, changes in health cost assumptions, and reduced penalties collected from individuals and employers due to the president\u2019s selective enforcement of the law, the CBO reduced Obamacare\u2019s \u201cnet changes in the deficit from insurance coverage provisions\u201d significantly. In 2012, it said this tally would be $1.171 trillion for 2013-22. The SBC staff\u2019s extrapolation, based on the CBO\u2019s projected growth rates, found that this tally would have been $1.466 trillion for 2015-24 if nothing had changed. In April 2014, the CBO said the tally would actually be $1.383 trillion, a reduction of $83 billion versus the straight extrapolation, resulting from lower enrollment, selective enforcement, and changes in health cost assumptions. That\u2019s on the spending side of Obamacare.\n\nBut the CBO hasn\u2019t updated its scoring for the other two areas \u2014 the revenues Obamacare gets from Medicare, and those it gets from non-coverage-related taxes, fees, or penalties \u2014 in the past two years and two months. The CBO therefore hasn\u2019t incorporated the technical adjustments it has made to its baseline projections for federal health spending as they pertain to Medicare, its updated economic forecasts, or its scoring of Obamacare\u2019s effects on labor markets.\n\nThe SBC staff, however, has now incorporated these CBO projections to provide updated tallies for the remaining two areas in order to determine Obamacare\u2019s deficit impact.\n\nFor the second area \u2014 Medicare \u2014 the SBC staff notes \u201ca series of technical and economic revisions made by CBO to its baseline projections for Medicare and Medicaid spending since its last cost estimate was produced in 2012.\u201d These \u201cbaseline changes reduce the amount of projected federal health care savings from the other provisions affecting direct spending in the legislation by a total of $132 billion over the 10-year period, from $979 billion under the CBO 2012 extrapolation to $847 billion based on the SBC staff calculation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Obamacare is now projected to get $132 billion less out of Medicare (and, to a lesser extent, other federal health programs) than it was expected to get as of the summer of 2012.\n\nThe third and final area \u2014 the \u201cnet changes in the deficit from other provisions affecting revenues\u201d \u2014 is where Obamacare\u2019s projected effect on labor markets comes into play.\n\nThe SBC report says,\n\n\u201cIn the February 2014 baseline, CBO conducted its first comprehensive analysis of the labor market effects of the health care law. [CBO] found that by 2024 the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers will exit the labor force as a result of the law. CBO estimates the law will reduce the total number of hours worked by 1.5 to 2 percent during the FY 2017\u20132024 period and will reduce aggregate labor compensation by 1 percent over the same period.\u201d\n\nThe SBC staff \u201cassumed that like the reduction in aggregate labor compensation, taxable personal income will also be reduced by 1 percent and that this amount would be taxed at the average rate for the population as a percentage of taxable income (approximately 13.5 percent for income taxes and 8.5 percent for Medicare and Social Security taxes).\u201d Based on these assumptions, Obamacare is now projected to get $262 billion less in (non-coverage-related) revenue because of its detrimental effect on job growth, a notion that wasn\u2019t registered in the CBO\u2019s July 2012 scoring.\n\nSo, compared to the deficit surplus of $180 billion for 2015-24 that a straight extrapolation from the CBO\u2019s 2012 scoring would yield, current projections now indicate that Obamacare's decreased spending (in relation to prior expectations) will reduce deficits by another $83 billion (bringing the estimated surplus to $263 billion), but those projected surpluses will be more than offset by the projected $132 billion decrease in Medicare revenue and $262 billion decrease in tax revenue due to lower job growth.\n\nIn all, therefore, CBO projections indicate that Obamacare will increase deficit spending by $131 billion from 2015-24. That\u2019s a $311 billion swing from the extrapolated 2012 numbers, a $240 billion swing from the actual 2012 numbers, and a $255 billion swing from what we were told when Obamacare was passed.\n\nPolling has consistently shown that Americans do not believe that Obamacare, with its roughly $2 trillion in new federal spending, would somehow reduce deficit spending. To the contrary, they believe it would send deficits soaring. Still, it\u2019s good to know that even the CBO, which has been one of Obamacare\u2019s few friends in this regard, now seems to think Obamacare would increase deficits by over $100 billion.\n\nIt seems relatively safe to say that Obamacare \u2014 which Democrats passed over unanimous Republican opposition with just three votes to spare in the House and without a single vote to spare in the Senate \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have passed had it been scored as a deficit bill. It likewise wouldn\u2019t have passed if its 10-year price-tag had been doubled, if people had been told they couldn\u2019t keep their insurance or their doctors, or if they\u2019d been told Obamacare would provide taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Budget,Government,Health Care,insurance,Jeffrey H.
