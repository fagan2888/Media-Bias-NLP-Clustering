Carroll of Nonesuch Oysters was happy to show the food enthusiasts her 5-year-old farm in the estuary, starting with her floating nursery.\n\nFishing out a few spats from her upweller, she produced a minuscule oyster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like little oyster caviar,\u201d she told them, resting one on the tip of her finger. Her show and tell was met with a chorus of \u201cwows.\u201d\n\nBut before that mollusk lands on a bed of ice, a farmer needs to nurture it for years. In June, the oyster entrepreneur opened her bivalve business to an increasingly food-curious public.\n\nOn her tours, guests board a working skiff and venture out to her grow site, where oysters are planted in the river bed and grow in bags. The excursion, which costs $50 per person, includes hands-on education and a half-dozen freshly harvested oysters, as well as a crash course on how to make a mignonette sauce on the fly. She also offers tours by kayak.\n\nWith a foodie culture intent on eating sustainable and local foods, the 44-year-old Biddeford resident is seen as a trailblazer in aquaculture tourism \u2014 the newest ripple in the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201c[Visitors to Maine] are looking for special interest experiences that are authentic and unique,\u201d said Carolann Ouellette, director of the Maine Office of Tourism. \u201c[Maine is] starting to recognize the market value.\u201d\n\nCulinary tourism, which includes trips to farms and food processing plants, is on the rise.\n\n\u201cPeople want a closer look at how their food is being grown and produced,\u201d Ouellette said.\n\nThose who work in the fishing industry are happy to oblige.\n\n\u201cThe general trend, of course, is people want to know where their food comes from. They want to meet their farmer and fisherman. And when they do, they want real experiences,\u201d said Dana Morse, marine extension associate for Maine Sea Grant. \u201cAbigail is really doing some leading work here.\u201d\n\nSimilar to talking shop with a brewer or winemaker, the opportunity to meet an oyster farmer and gain a firsthand glimpse at their process, from infancy to market, is the essence of food tourism.\n\nOfficials at Maine Department of Marine Resources recognize the significance of tours such as Carroll\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMaine has great resources. A lot of folks are looking at how we can create an experience [for visitors] and opportunities for people in agriculture and fisheries,\u201d said Jeff Nichols, communications director for the department. \u201cThere are economic opportunities for growers and harvesters to create an experience and connect with the public. There are a lot of folks looking at how we can leverage this.\u201d\n\nFor now, all eyes are on Carroll.\n\nMaine has about 18 full-time oyster farms, 14 small farms and 18 startups, according to Morse. Carroll is in the minority of oyster growers who double as tour guides. But that doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cIf a person wants to connect with a farmer, they should give the farmer a call,\u201d Morse said. \u201cThey are in the high season now, but you never know.\u201d\n\nTo make it easier, Maine Sea Grant created an oyster map in 2011 and updates it regularly. The map of self-guided tour of farms, markets and raw bars is digital, but it may be produced on paper soon.\n\n\u201cLike the Maine wine trail and islands trails,\u201d he said\n\nStill, tourists such as Amy and Jon Edwards are finding them. Amy Edwards Googled oyster farm tours before she stumbled across Nonesuch.\n\n\u201cI had assumed that with the general trend of \u2018know your food,\u2019 this would have been easy to find, but it certainly was not the case,\u201d said Edwards of Wellesley. \u201cI am glad I decided to see if there were any oyster farms up in Maine doing this before I came up.\u201d\n\nWhen compared to the lush beauty of Acadia, the Edwards couple said it was \u201ctough to beat the tour, which gave us the opportunity to learn more about a food we love while out on the water and, best of all, fresh oysters straight out of the water.\u201d\n\nThe new trends in tourism, similar to lobster boat tours, don\u2019t work for all entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing for a grower to do,\u201d Morse said. \u201cTheir main business is growing oysters.\u201d\n\nMark Green of Basket Island Oyster Co., in its second season, is too busy meeting demand from wholesalers to operate tours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about for several years. It\u2019s page 79 of our business plan,\u201d said Green, who sees aquatourism as \u201ca great thing for the Maine economy \u2014 it\u2019s like nothing else.\u201d\n\nBut the arduous nature of oyster farming, which can take up to three years to produce a market-ready mollusk, has given him pause.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to sell widgets on your shelf on Exchange Street, you can order them and open doors on the first morning and sell them. With oysters, the ramp-up time is significant,\u201d he said.\n\nOne recent incentive Carroll orchestrated is a change in the state\u2019s aquaculture laws to allow farmers to sell oysters directly from their grow sites. Without it, \u201cit would be like visiting a winery and having to buy the wine at a grocery store,\u201d she said.\n\nCarroll approached the Maine Department of Marine Resources more than a year ago to establish a Maine Oyster Tasting Trail. All these initiatives help increase the visitor\u2019s appetite for oysters, which taste different up and down the coast \u2014 Carroll calls it \u201cmeroir,\u201d of the sea, like terroir, a wine term, which means of the earth.\n\nNonesuch Oysters can be found at Eventide Oyster Co. in Portland, Earth in Kennebunkport and have been served at the famed Grand Central Oyster Bar and Restaurant in New York City. Running tours takes time away from harvesting, but its needed revenue after a brutal winter when many oysters died.\n\n\u201cThis will ease the pain in a production cycle that is low,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nHeading into the crucial tourist season, her phone keeps ringing with request to join her.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m feeling very optimistic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a boon for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SCARBOROUGH, Maine \u2014 \u201cWhat do you guys know about oysters?\u201d Abigail Carroll asked a couple standing on a pier in the Scarborough River on a sunny afternoon. \u201cThat they are delicious,\u201d Amy and Jon Edwards said in unison.
