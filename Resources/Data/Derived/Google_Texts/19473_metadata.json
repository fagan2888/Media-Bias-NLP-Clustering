But the 3,000 pages of messages released late Tuesday offer a few tantalizing and amusing insights to Clinton\u2019s early days as Secretary of State.\n\nThe fresh batch of Clinton\u2019s official emails provided to a special House panel investigating the Benghazi incident focus on her first year in office, and they show a top cabinet member occasionally bewildered by the interaction with the White House or fearing that she had been left out of the loop.\n\nRelated: As Hillary\u2019s Numbers Dip, Benghazi Rises As an Issue\n\n\u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am,\u201d she wrote on June 8, 2009. \u201cIs there? Can I go?\u201d As it turned out it wasn\u2019t a cabinet meeting but one for lower level administration officials. But just four days later, she showed up for a 10:45 a.m. meeting at the White House, only to learn that it had been canceled.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time this has happened,\u201d she wrote huffily. \u201cWhat\u2019s up???\u201d\n\nThe fresh cache of emails are part of more than 55,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s official emails that have been promised to the House investigative committee but are still being reviewed by the State Department. State Department officials wanted to wait and submit the entire collection at one time, but a federal judge ruled that the department must release installments on a monthly basis.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Achilles' Heel: Trust\n\nHere are five other highlights of the latest batch of Clinton emails:\n\nSenior White House officials were well aware that Clinton used private, non-government email for her official communications but apparently did not object, according to NBC News. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel requested and received Clinton\u2019s private email address in 2009, as did senior political adviser David Axelrod.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlumenthal played a far more important role in keeping Clinton up to speed on issues than she publicly acknowledged. The White House blocked her efforts to hire Blumenthal at State, according to Politico. However, the Clinton family foundation paid him $10,000 a month to serve as a consultant. Beyond his subsequent assistance to her when the Benghazi tragedy blew up, the new emails indicate he also acted as an intermediary with officials involved in the Northern Ireland peace process and monitored other international developments for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton was obsessed with her media coverage. \u201cDid you see the photo in the NYPost of Bill and me from yesterday?\u201d she wrote to her advisor, Huma Abedin, in August 2009. \u201cIt was after lunch but I didn\u2019t see anybody w a camera so obviously a long lens from afar.\u201d Or as the Los Angeles Times reported, she expresses concern about sitting for a joint interview with Henry Kissinger, which might raise unflattering comparisons about the two secretaries\u2019 access to their presidents. \u201cI see POTUS at least once a week while K saw Nixon everyday,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nreported, she expresses concern about sitting for a joint interview with Henry Kissinger, which might raise unflattering comparisons about the two secretaries\u2019 access to their presidents. \u201cI see POTUS at least once a week while K saw Nixon everyday,\u201d she wrote. Clinton helped friends on Wall Street when she could. That included helping one investment chief executive get a visa and fielding another corporate executive\u2019s complaint about export control regulations that interfered with sales. And when Terrence Duffy, executive chairman of derivatives trader CME Group, asked her to stop by a Washington dinner he was hosting for \u201c150 or so folks from the exchange,\u201d Clinton asked an aide to try to find time for the group to visit the State Department, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Where Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley Stand on the Issues\n\nFinally, while taking the helm of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, Clinton still fretted about retiring her $23 million campaign debt from her unsuccessful bid for the presidency. Clinton\u2019s chief of protocol, Capricia Marshall, wrote to Paul Begala, a long-time Clinton family friend and Democratic strategist, to thank him for helping in raising $500,000 from an \u201cemail contest.\u201d She said in April 2009 email, \u201cYou are all amazing,\u201d adding that \u201cYou put a serious hole in HRC debt!\u201d, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There was nothing to learn in the State Department\u2019s latest email dump about Hillary R", "title": "5 Things We Learned from Clinton\u2019s Latest Email Dump", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/01/5-Things-We-Learned-Clinton-s-Latest-Email-Dump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/01/5-Things-We-Learned-Clinton-s-Latest-Email-Dump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There was nothing to learn in the State Department\u2019s latest email dump about Hillary R", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel requested and received Clinton\u2019s private email address in 2009, as did senior political adviser David Axelrod.\nBut just four days later, she showed up for a 10:45 a.m. meeting at the White House, only to learn that it had been canceled.\nState Department officials wanted to wait and submit the entire collection at one time, but a federal judge ruled that the department must release installments on a monthly basis.\nThere was nothing to learn in the State Department\u2019s latest email dump about Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s role before, during and after the terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\nThe White House blocked her efforts to hire Blumenthal at State, according to Politico."}
