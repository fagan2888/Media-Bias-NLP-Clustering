For three decades Riverlawn Christian Church has given out Christmas presents and food for the holidays to families in need.

Lead Pastor Jeff Isaacs says that giving during the holidays is beneficial for everyone involved. "I believe we as a church get more out of it than the community gets out of it," Pastor Icaacs said.

The church works with local organizations like the Salvation Army to find families in need and then has church members donate cloths, gifts and food. Some church members spends months sewing together quilts to give away.

There are also what staff call "big ticket items" hidden away in black bags. Inside there was wrapping paper and gifts for families to wrap together.

An estimated 270 people were helped by Saturdays Christmas drive. One of them being Linda Frazier who has 13 grandchildren. She says she is very appreciative of today's events. "I tell you god is good," she said, "and I thank the church for helping us out."
