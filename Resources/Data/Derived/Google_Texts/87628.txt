SNL’s ‘Hillary Clinton’ explains why all her email is totally legit and not about Benghazi

SNL let “Hillary Clinton” (Kate McKinnon) explain to the public why she didn’t use government email during her time at the State Department–and Hillary has a super fun and relatable explanation for everything, none of which has to do with Benghazi!

“Those emails are clean as a whistle. This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down,” she informed the audience. “I mean, what did you think my emails said? ‘Hi, it’s Hillary, I really screwed up on Benghazi today.’”

“I wasn’t born yesterday — I was born 67 years ago, and I have been planning to run for president ever since,” she added.

“But if, after all this, people still want someone like Elizabeth Warren to run instead — God bless Elizabeth, Lizzy, I love ya girl, we need more women like you — but it’s not your time. It’s my time.”
