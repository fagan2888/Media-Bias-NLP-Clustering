Thirty-five Miss Louisiana contestants showed off the latest trends Wednesday at Pecanland Mall.

The event, outside Dillard’s, incorporated the Fluer de Lis Princesses and was followed by a meet and greet at center court.

Darris Waren, Vice President of the Miss Louisiana Organization said the best part of the pageant is “the opportunity we have to provide scholarships to young ladies all across the great state of Louisiana.

“It’s also a great opportunity to showcase northeastern Louisiana and the many different tourist attractions we have to offer. The pageant has a huge economic impact on all of our area as well.”

The pageant preliminaries start at 7:30 p.m. Thursday and will continue at 7:30 p.m. Friday. The finals, which will be televised, will start at 8 p.m. Saturday.

This year’s show will feature Miss Louisiana 2014, Lacey Sanchez, as well as the Miss Louisiana Band and a male vocalist group from West Monroe. Ed Walsh, Melissa Whitworth, Blair McCurdy, Kelsi Crain and Jaden Leach will emcee. Also featured will be more than 60 Fleur de Lis Princesses.

“The Miss Louisiana Organization is a board of directors made up of volunteers primarily from the Monroe/West Monroe area.” Waren said. “We have local directors and contestants from all over the state and it truly is a family. The friendships forged across the state is like no other in a volunteer organization.”
