ObamaCare, \u201cBut we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy.\u201d\n\nWell, the \u201cfog of the controversy\u201d lifted in 2010 when the President\u2019s bill transforming our health care system was pushed through Congress and signed into law.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat we\u2019ve had since is a storm of outrage.\n\nIt turns out that what was in the bill \u2013 taxpayer subsidized abortion, for instance \u2013 was, indeed, egregious. But we knew all along that ObamaCare contained support for abortion, the President\u2019s denials notwithstanding.\n\nIt\u2019s what was not in the bill \u2013 that the government would force religious non-profit groups to violate their faiths \u2013 that has resulted in over 50 lawsuits against the executive branch. Our case, Priests for Life vs. HHS, and six others consolidated with it under the title Zubik v. HHS, are now under review by the Supreme Court after oral arguments March 23.\n\nThe ministry in which we serve, Priests for Life, has brought forth one of those cases and was the first of the petitioners currently before the Court to challenge what has become known as the \u201cHHS mandate.\u201d\n\nThe mandate requires that religious non-profit entities like Priests for Life, Catholic charities, and Christian colleges be complicit in providing employees with abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that our faiths teach are gravely sinful. It demands that we obey the government instead of God. And it will levy crushing fines against us if we don\u2019t.\n\nThe administration claims that the HHS mandate is based on an amendment to the Obamacare act passed by the House and Senate. The truth, however, is that the mandate, at least as drafted and imposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, was not authorized by Congress. To say that the regulation has a legislative basis is akin to one of those Hollywood movies that claims to be \u201cbased on a true story\u201d \u2013 the connection is tenuous, at best.\n\nThe HHS mandate is, basically, a device invented by the administration. As convincingly argued by the Cato Institute and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in support of the 37 religious petitioners in Zubik vs. Burwell, federal agencies \u201chave overstepped their bounds\u201d in creating a \u201cbizarre and unprecedented\u201d rule that tramples on religious liberty.\n\nThe amendment to the Obamacare bill that is used to justify the creation of the HHS mandate required that employers\u2019 insurance plans provide coverage for women\u2019s \u201cpreventive care and screenings.\u201d But it did not specify abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives. Congress was talking about prevention of disease, not of pregnancy.\n\nOnce Obamacare became law, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted with the Institute of Medicine, a non-governmental advisory agency, to make recommendations for what should be included in \u201cpreventive care.\u201d Six months later, after inviting groups like Planned Parenthood to testify before it, the IOM issued a report that urged coverage for 20 different kinds of FDA-approved birth control, four of which can cause abortions.\n\nNow, employers would be required to provide coverage for abortifacients and other drugs and procedures that are highly objectionable to many people of faith. But again, this pressure did not come from Congress. In fact, Congress knows that if it wants, it can include in legislation an exemption from the strict protections that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) gives to Americans and groups like Priests for Life. But Congress made no such exception in the Affordable Care Act, and therefore RFRA applies to it.\n\nHHS quickly adopted the IOM report and issued the first version of the HHS mandate. Years and several versions of the regulation later, the government is still arguing that it has the authority to decide which religious groups it will exempt from the mandate \u2013 that is, favor \u2013 and which it will not \u2013 that is, disfavor.\n\nUnder the mandate\u2019s current language, churches do not have to violate their beliefs, but entities like the Priests for Life and the Westminster Theological Seminary do. Why? Because federal civil servants say they can discern who is sufficiently religious and who is not.\n\nAs the Cato Institute and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum point out, the federal departments that came up with these distinctions have no ability or expertise to make them; they certainly don\u2019t have the authority \u2013 not in America.\n\nThe Cato/IWF brief argues that the Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t even bother weighing whether the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. They say that the Court should strike down the regulation because \u201cCongress in no way, shape, or form delegated to HHS the authority to regulate religion\u2014much less to make untenable distinctions among religious groups.\u201d\n\nUltimately, then, Priests for Life v. HHS involves the separation of powers \u2013 the executive branch should not appropriate the powers of the legislative branch. But the case also involves the separation of church and state \u2013 the government should not be picking and choosing religious groups for reward and punishment.\n\nFather Frank Pavone is National Director, Priests for Life", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brief in Zubik v.
