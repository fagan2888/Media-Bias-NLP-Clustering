They threw away a victory, dropped the ball and lost their grip on the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. This loss ripped out around 76,000 hearts in the stadium. And that\u2019s not the worst of it. This sad-beyond-belief, 15-12 defeat against the lowly Oakland Raiders was so damaging to Denver it could slowly tear the team apart.\n\nThat sound you heard at 5:21 p.m. Sunday, when quarterback Brock Osweiler went down for the last time under the weight of Oakland linebacker Khalil Mack, was the sound of Broncos Country screaming in frustration. You mad, bro? Well, so are the players on a team where the disparity between defensive greatness and offensive ineptitude is now a real threat to locker room unity.\n\nPAIGE: Gary Kubiak\u2019s Broncos offense pitiful again in loss to Raiders\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hot, man. We\u2019re not supposed to lose that game,\u201d cornerback Chris Harris said.\n\nYes, the record says the Broncos are 10-3. But the offense stinks, and the resulting strain on the defense is beginning to show. Coach Gary Kubiak has turned back to the clock to 1985, in an apparent effort to see if he can devise a game plan more conservative than the most yawn-inducing schemes from the dustiest corners of Dan Reeves\u2019 mind.\n\nWATCH: Is friction starting to form in the Denver locker room?\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong goes far deeper than Denver\u2019s ineptitude in the red zone. For the first time all season, I heard the type of grumbling from players that indicates a lack of trust in each other. Let the finger-pointing begin. In fact, it already has started, and the blame game is never pretty.\n\nIt seems to defy logic how Oakland could score the game\u2019s only two touchdowns, despite producing only 126 yards of offense. But after Emmanuel Sanders fumbled a punt early in the fourth quarter, the Raiders were in business 11 short yards from the goal line, trailing only 12-9.\n\nThe Denver defense, put in impossible situations all season long by its quarterback, whether the man making mistakes has been Osweiler or Peyton Manning, was asked to make a stand yet again. And the Broncos did, until third down when tight end Mychal Rivera ran a route through the gut of the secondary, and was inexplicably lefft alone in the end zone, catching a touchdown pass so head-slapping easy it had Denver players cursing in disbelief.\n\nRECAP: Raiders stun Broncos, shut out inept offense in second half\n\nWhat happened? How could Rivera, who has never been mistaken for Rob Gronkowski, get so wide open?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the dude\u2019s name?\u201d said Harris, rolling his eyes, struggling to identify the street free agent playing in the absence of injured safeties T.J. Ward and David Bruton. \u201cThe new safety. He just didn\u2019t play the coverage right. He\u2019s a new guy and he didn\u2019t play the coverage right.\u201d\n\nShiloh Keo, who last held an NFL job in 2013, was the guy who blew the coverage against Rivera. He was not a member of the Broncos until approximately 100 hours before kickoff against Oakland. Let his blunder be a lesson to us all. Twitter is a good place to discover snark. But as a place to recruit an NFL safety? Well, to use the social media vernacular: LMAO.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to pick me up, huh?\u201d Keo had tweeted to Denver defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, when the Broncos were hurting for help in the secondary. Well, I guess the team violated Twitter Rule No. 1: Don\u2019t feed the trolls.\n\nKeo dressed alone in a corner after the loss. He pulled a shirt over his badly bruised torso, threw a backpack over his shoulder and offered me a handshake. \u201cI made a mistake. And it costs us the game,\u201d Keo said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t focused. I wasn\u2019t doing my job on the coverage. It cost the team. You can put that on my back.\u201d\n\nThis loss cracked open the door for Manning to be a hero. If he can get healthy, the 39-year-old quarterback might get one more shot at being the starting quarterback, because the Broncos cannot find a groove on offense.\n\nREPORT CARD: Grade the Broncos\u2019 performance against the Raiders\n\nAgainst the Raiders, Osweiler got Macked up. The game tape of Oakland\u2019s No. 52 will look like a horror movie. Mack made a mockery of the pass blocking of Michael Schofield on his way to five sacks, including a strip sack that resulted in a safety late in the third quarter and blew up any semblance of the Broncos\u2019 mojo. \u201cYou can never point the finger at anybody,\u201d said Osweiler, who led zero touchdown drives in 13 Denver possessions.\n\nHere\u2019s the thorny problem: At 17.3 points per game, the Broncos have the No. 1 defense in the league. But among the 15 NFL teams that have scored fewer points that Denver, only one has a winning record.\n\nFor a playoff contender, Kubiak is stuck with a squad that has zero margin of error, and week after week, it\u2019s emotionally draining. It sometimes feels as if Denver cannot win unless the defense produces a pick-6. The Broncos are fighting the same negative feeling I\u2019ve seen engulf the Colorado Rockies clubhouse, where talented hitters lose trust in awful pitchers, and unity swirls down the drain from a lack of trust.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is what they call nut-crunching time,\u201d said defensive end Antonio Smith, addressing the big pressure stakes he and his Denver teammates face.\n\nMark Kiszla: , mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Loss to Raiders could slowly tear this Broncos team apart", "title": "Kiszla: Loss to Raiders could slowly tear this Broncos team apart", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/kiszla-loss-to-raiders-could-slowly-tear-this-broncos-team-apart/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T21:14:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:08:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mark Kiszla"}, "article_summary": "This sad-beyond-belief, 15-12 defeat against the lowly Oakland Raiders was so damaging to Denver it could slowly tear the team apart.\nPAIGE: Gary Kubiak\u2019s Broncos offense pitiful again in loss to Raiders\u201cI\u2019m hot, man.\nREPORT CARD: Grade the Broncos\u2019 performance against the RaidersAgainst the Raiders, Osweiler got Macked up.\nRECAP: Raiders stun Broncos, shut out inept offense in second halfWhat happened?\nBut among the 15 NFL teams that have scored fewer points that Denver, only one has a winning record."}
