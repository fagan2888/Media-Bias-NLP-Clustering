Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what\u2019s going on with premiums where they\u2019re up 40, 50, 55 percent,\u201d replied Trump.\n\nPelley then pressed him to offer his own specific plan for fixing the U.S. healthcare system.\n\n[RELATED: Trump: Rivals Want to Start World War 3 Over Syria]\n\nTrump began explaining, \u201cThere\u2019s many different ways, by the way. Everybody\u2019s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, \u2018No, no, the lower 25 percent that can\u2019t afford private.\u2019 But\u2026\u201d\n\nPelley then interrupted, noting that Trump was describing a universal healthcare plan.\n\nTrump continued, \u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\n\nThe real estate billionaire then explained that he \u201cwould make a deal with existing hospitals to take care\u201d of uninsured Americans.\n\nWhen Pelley asked him to clarify who would pay for the plan, Trump replied, \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it. But we\u2019re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it\u2019s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more election coverage, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes on CBS, Donald Trump said that \"Obamacare is a disaster\" and that he plans to repeal it and replace it with a government-", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Barry Donegan", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "On Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes on CBS, Donald Trump said that \"Obamacare is a disaster\" and that he plans to repeal it and replace it with a government-", "title": "Trump Proposes Replacing Obamacare with Government-Funded Universal Healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/maxresdefault13.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-09-28T16:45:31-04:00", "url": "http://truthinmedia.com/trump-obamacare-government-universal-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes on CBS, Donald Trump said that \"Obamacare is a disaster\" and that he plans to repeal it and replace it with a government-", "creator": "@BenSwann_", "image": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/maxresdefault13.jpg", "title": "Trump Proposes Replacing Obamacare with Government-Funded Universal Healthcare", "site": "@BenSwann_", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 801708913249498, "pages": 124075334324092}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BenSwannRealityCheck", "published_time": "2015-09-28T13:54:24-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/barry.donegan", "section": "Election", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T16:45:31-04:00", "tag": "Universal Healthcare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Sunday\u2019s episode of 60 Minutes on CBS, Donald Trump said that \u201cObamacare is a disaster\u201d and that he plans to repeal it and replace it with a government-funded universal healthcare plan.\nWhen Pelley asked him to clarify who would pay for the plan, Trump replied, \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it.\nObamacare is a disaster if you look at what\u2019s going on with premiums where they\u2019re up 40, 50, 55 percent,\u201d replied Trump.\nEverybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201dThe real estate billionaire then explained that he \u201cwould make a deal with existing hospitals to take care\u201d of uninsured Americans.\nDuring the lengthy interview, CBS correspondent Scott Pelley asked billionaire real estate mogul and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump his position on healthcare reform."}
