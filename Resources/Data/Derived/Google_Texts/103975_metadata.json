Senator Rand Paul blames the current disarray in Iraq on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. \u201cWere they right in their predictions? Were there weapons of mass destruction there?

If Bush lied, then he must have been quite the Svengali, because he got many leading Democrats in America to tell the same lie. Senators John Kerry, Tom Daschle, Dianne Feinstein, Joe Lieberman, and others signed a letter to President Clinton in 1998 urging him to act, militarily if necessary, to \u201crespond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq\u2019s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\u201d\n\nSenator Barbara Boxer, whose stomach is so sensitive, might want to avoid her own history on \u201clies\u201d about Iraq\u2019s WMDs. In 2002, she said, \u201cIraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement.\u201d\n\nThe late Teddy Kennedy was equally blunt: \u201cThere is no doubt that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\u201d The list of Democrats who said identical things includes Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, and many more. Fifty-eight percent of Democratic senators voted in favor of the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein in 2002.\n\nSure President Bush made mistakes, but he corrected them in time to salvage the sacrifices of more than 4,000 Americans.
