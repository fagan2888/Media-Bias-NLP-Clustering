The exact dollar amount was not included.\n\nThe companies charged are Click4Support, IsourceUSA, Innovazion, and Spanning Source. Four of the companies\u2019 owners were cited in the complaint.\n\nThe trade commission alleged the companies used pop-up warnings and ads online that appeared to be from well-known technology companies to trick people into believing their computers were infected with viruses.\n\nPeople were directed to a phone number, where telemarketers led people to believe they worked for the well-known tech giants. According to the FTC, customers were then \u201cgiven a high-pressure sales pitch for unnecessary tech support services.\u201d\n\nIn last month\u2019s ruling, Judge Stewart Dalzell ruled the FTC had a strong likelihood of success in proving that the companies violated multiple consumer protection laws.\n\n\u201cAn asset freeze as to Defendants is necessary in order to preserve the possibility of complete and meaningful relief in the form of disgorgement and/or consumer redress at the conclusion of this litigation,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nThe judge also ruled there was cause to gain access to the company\u2019s property, freeze its phone service and suspend its websites. Many of the websites named in the FTC complaint remained accessible to the public Friday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FTC accused the companies as posing as affiliates of Google, Microsoft and AT&T.", "description": "The FTC accused the companies as posing as affiliates of Google, Microsoft and AT&T.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FTC accused the companies as posing as affiliates of Google, Microsoft and AT&T.", "title": "FTC sues scammers who allegedly posed as major tech companies", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260054-ftc-sues-it-scammers-allegedly-posing-as-major-tech-companies", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/biz_cybersecuritystory.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260054-ftc-sues-it-scammers-allegedly-posing-as-major-tech-companies", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-13T12:25-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-13T12:25:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Federal Trade Commission,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260054-ftc-sues-it-scammers-allegedly-posing-as-major-tech-companies", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FTC accused the companies as posing as affiliates of Google, Microsoft and AT&T.", "card": "summary", "title": "FTC sues scammers who allegedly posed as major tech companies"}, "dcterms.title": "FTC sues scammers who allegedly posed as major tech companies"}, "article_summary": "The companies allegedly posed as technicians for major technology companies including Microsoft, Google and AT&T.\nADVERTISEMENTThe consumer protection agency is now trying to recoup the millions of dollars that the companies allegedly bilked from customers.\nThe trade commission alleged the companies used pop-up warnings and ads online that appeared to be from well-known technology companies to trick people into believing their computers were infected with viruses.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is suing a group of companies and their owners for allegedly scamming people into buying antivirus and other software.\nMany of the websites named in the FTC complaint remained accessible to the public Friday afternoon."}
