It\u2019s a form sent by your health insurer or employer that shows you had the minimum health insurance needed to avoid a tax penalty during the tax year. (In short, it\u2019s an Obamacare thing.) You could also receive a similar form, the 1095-C, if you work for a company with more than 50 employees. You might actually receive both or multiple forms, depending on your insurance setup and employment situation throughout the tax year.\n\nIf that seems confusing, relax. You don\u2019t even need these forms to file your taxes.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou just need to check a box that says you had health coverage,\u201d said Debra Hammer, a senior communications manager with TurboTax. \u201cYou most likely will receive a form, but it\u2019s not required.\u201d\n\nRead More: Can You Pay Your Taxes With a Credit Card?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have health coverage for the full year and don\u2019t qualify for an exemption, like financial hardship or gaps in coverage for less than 3 months, you may need to pay a penalty. Tax software should help you calculate that penalty, and if you\u2019re going the pen-and-paper route for tax preparation, you can find information about the penalties on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cThe only real problem with the 1095-B is that people are afraid that if they don\u2019t have one that they cannot file their tax returns until that get the form when in reality, most of the time the information about health insurance is on their W-2 coded DD in box 12,\u201d wrote Bill Farmer, an Enrolled Agent with HTI Tax Service, in an email. \u201cAnother dead giveaway that a person has had health insurance is that they have a code W in box 12 which indicates that they have a Health Savings Account.\u201d\n\nEven if you get a 1095-B or 1095-C, it\u2019s quite likely you won\u2019t need to do anything with them other than file them away with the rest of your tax paperwork. The extent of your Obamacare-related tax activities may be limited to checking that single box indicating you had health insurance for the year.\n\nRead More: What\u2019s a Good Credit Score?\n\nBut not everyone has it so easy. There\u2019s the 1095-A, which has been around for two years and goes to people who had coverage through the health insurance marketplace. It\u2019s required to reconcile the insurance premium credits you may have received and what you really qualify for, based on the difference in your actual income and the estimated income you used when applying for health coverage \u2014 it determines if you received too little or too much of a health care subsidy and will affect your tax refund or tax bill.\n\n\u201cWhere the whole thing starts getting hairy is when you have an A-B or an A-C combination \u2014 the person got a credit part of the year and had company-provided insurance part of the year,\u201d Farmer said. It\u2019s common for such taxpayers to have to repay the credits they received, he added.\n\nIt can be understandably stressful to end up owing taxes you didn\u2019t expect to have to pay, but figuring out a way to cover that bill is important. You could pay your taxes with a credit card, though there are fees associated with that option, or you could take out a personal loan if you need help. You could also work out a payment plan with the IRS. Not paying isn\u2019t a great option, because it can eventually get more expensive with fees and interest, not to mention the potential impact on your credit score.\n\nRead More: Chase Slate Review: A Great Bet If You Need Breathing Room From Your Debt\n\nWhether or not you\u2019re fretting over 1095s, it\u2019s probably a good idea to started filing those tax returns, if you haven\u2019t already.
