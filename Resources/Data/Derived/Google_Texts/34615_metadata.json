I only make between $600 and $700 each month. So that\u2019s basically half my paycheck gone. And then I have to put food on the table.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dems Keep Unemployment Insurance in Spotlight\n\nThe president held the event Monday to advance his case that more family-friendly workplace flexibility is key to economic growth in 21st Century. Specifically, the summit addressed three primary issues for working women who now make up more than half of the American workforce. Topping the list was low wages, erratic scheduling, and gender pay disparities.\n\n\u201cAnything that makes things harder for women makes things harder for families,\u201d the president said in his remarks. \u201cWhen women succeed, America succeeds. These are common sense issues.\u201d\n\nRepublicans label such events as more political propaganda than policy, but White House allies argue that good policy arguments make good political arguments.\n\n\u201cThis White House has appealed to women from the beginning, they just haven\u2019t publicized it very much,\u201d said Kim Gandy, former president of the National Organization for Women and now president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. \u201cThey do a lot of things behind the scene at 4 o\u2019clock on Fridays.\u201d\n\nRelated: Relentless Incompetence: Americans Are Giving Up on Obama\n\nStill, there is no disputing the importance of women voters to Democrats\u2019 chances in 2014. Monday\u2019s summit followed a spring Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee women\u2019s bus tour, a push for Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, and the president\u2019s executive action to extend family and medical leave benefits to same-sex couples. In the days before the summit, Obama selected journalists who were all working mothers, or soon-to-be mothers, to interview him.\n\n\u201cWhat are people supposed to do to try and get elected?\u201d asked Amy Traub, Senior Policy Analyst at the liberal organization D\u0113mos and the author of Retail\u2019s Choice: How Raising Wages and Improving Schedules for Women in the Retail Industry Would Benefit America. \u201cTo the extent that it is part of an election ploy, it\u2019s good to see elections fought on the basis of issues and policies.\u201d\n\nIt was the president\u2019s personal touch that resonated with Walmart worker Holmes.\n\n\u201cI take this personally,\u201d the president said. \u201cI was raised by strong women who worked hard to support my sister and me. I saw what it was like for a single mom.\u201d\n\nWalmart rakes in over $16 billion in profits each year, yet most of the megastore\u2019s employees earn less than $25,000 annually. Holmes lives with her parents, and like many Walmart workers, relies on food stamps and other government subsidies to get by.\n\nRelated: How About This 2016 Matchup? Clinton vs. Romney\n\nRecently, she went from struggling worker to activist.\n\nIn February, Holmes suffered a miscarriage while on the job at Walmart. \u201cI had asked my assistant manager for lighter duty. He said no. I was lifting two big bottles of bleach in a brown box.\u201d\n\nHe told her that when she signed up for the job, she also signed up for lifting fifty pounds. She joined OUR Walmart, an organization speaking out against the work standards of the country\u2019s largest employer of women.\n\nRetail salesperson is the most common job in America, and retail is one of the country\u2019s largest and fastest-growing industries. For each of the top three issues women addressed at the summit, women in the retail sector are hit particularly hard.\n\nFirst, less than 50 percent of retail jobs are filled by women, for example, yet women make up 55.4 percent of the industry\u2019s low-wage workers.\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton Must Run in 2016\n\nSecond, scheduling issues are a particular challenge for women in retail. Traub says it\u2019s because women still take on the majority of family responsibilities. \u201cWorkers\u2019 schedules fluctuate from week to week, even from day to day. It\u2019s very hard to set the childcare if you don\u2019t know how many hours or which hours you\u2019re going to be working the following week. That\u2019s one challenge that falls disproportionately on women,\u201d she explained.\n\nTaking time off, even when they need to care for a sick child, can come at a high cost. A recent Oxfam America study found that 19 percent of the working mothers in the survey had lost a job as a result of getting sick themselves, or leaving work to care for a sick child.\n\nObama says he gets the juggle many working mothers face, and even tried to make a joke about his good fortune. \"I never had to meet a world leader with Cheerios stuck to my pants,\" Obama said.\n\nThird, there\u2019s the low-wage pay gap. According to Traub the typical woman working in retail earns just $10.58 per hour. For single parents, that means either a second job or diving deep into debt to support their families.\n\nRelated: Wolf of Wall Street Says He\u2019ll Make $100M This Year\n\nIn Traub\u2019s latest Demos study, she finds that if the country\u2019s biggest retailers upped their wages to $25,000 per year for full-time employment, an estimated 437,000 employed women would no longer have to live in poverty.\n\nDemocrats and their allies in the wage fight also insist there\u2019s plenty of evidence raising wages doesn\u2019t hurt business. Case in point: San Francisco. With a minimum wage of $10.74 per hour (which is higher than any state minimum wage or the federal minimum wage), San Francisco has had faster job growth than any other major American city over the past decade. According to new data from payroll-processor Paychex, small businesses in the \u2018City by the Bay\u2019 are thriving.\n\nWhether or not those flipping burgers at In-N-Out in California are living better lives is up for debate. But Traub says California is making giant steps forward. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration nationally, and hopefully, it will be to Congress,\u201d said Traub. Then she added: \u201ceventually.\u201d\n\nThat may be wishful thinking, with Republicans already opposed to most of the Democratic initiatives and seemingly poised to make midterm election gains.\n\nRelated: More Insurers in Obamacare Mean Lower Premiums\n\nAs the president was speaking Monday, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida released a statement saying the president\u2019s focus on government-based solutions was all wrong. \u201cTelling federal agencies to do what they\u2019re already supposed to do and endorsing partisan legislation that will never pass is not the sort of bold, innovative leadership we need,\u201d said Rubio, who plans to announce his own conservative reforms this Wednesday.\n\nThat partisan divide is why Gandy believes it\u2019s going to be corporations, not government, that will lead the way for women in the workplace. \u201cI think it takes a few top companies in competitive industries to set the standard,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen companies who are behind start seeing a brain drain to forward thinking companies, they\u2019ll get in line.\u201d\n\nBut it will require workers to take a stand too. \u201cUntil employees start making it clear that if they aren\u2019t treated well, it will affect the company\u2019s bottom line,\u201d said Gandy, \u201cprogress will move slowly.\u201d\n\nHolmes is an example of that.\n\n\u201cIf things don\u2019t change,\u201d said Holmes, I will leave Walmart.\u201d\n\nHolmes didn\u2019t get to meet President Obama, but she did meet her president\u2014that\u2019s Walmart President, Doug McMillon.\n\n\u201cHe apologized, said Holmes. \u201cHe touched my elbow, told me he was sorry for my loss, and took down my story number.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To Bene\u2019t Holmes, the White House Summit on Working Families was personal, not just an", "title": "The Single Mom Dilemma\u2014Low Pay, High Pressure", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/24/Single-Mom-Dilemma-Low-Pay-High-Pressure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05032012_Overworked_Mom_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/24/Single-Mom-Dilemma-Low-Pay-High-Pressure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05032012_Overworked_Mom_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "To Bene\u2019t Holmes, the White House Summit on Working Families was personal, not just an", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbec0\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, the summit addressed three primary issues for working women who now make up more than half of the American workforce.\nFor each of the top three issues women addressed at the summit, women in the retail sector are hit particularly hard.\n\u201cIf things don\u2019t change,\u201d said Holmes, I will leave Walmart.\u201dHolmes didn\u2019t get to meet President Obama, but she did meet her president\u2014that\u2019s Walmart President, Doug McMillon.\n\u201cI believed everything he said,\u201d the 25-year-old single mom said of the president\u2019s pitch.\nRetail salesperson is the most common job in America, and retail is one of the country\u2019s largest and fastest-growing industries."}
