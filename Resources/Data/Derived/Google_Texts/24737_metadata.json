John Kasich, elected to a second term last November, has been in office since January 2011. Kasich was preceded by Democrat Ted Strickland, who served from 2007-2010, and by Republican Bob Taft, who served from 1999-2006.\n\nWith the exception of the 2009-2010 Ohio General Assembly, both houses of Ohio\u2019s legislature have been controlled by Republicans every year dating back to 1995.\n\nAsked how Kasich\u2019s implementation of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion and his increased spending factored into ALEC\u2019s economic outlook ranking, Moore said Kasich\u2019s cuts to the income tax have been \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Kasich)\u2019s got a good record,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat is certainly a negative, that they\u2019ve added so many people to the Medicaid rolls, but Ohio\u2019s economy is doing better, too, there\u2019s just no question about it, and that figures into these rankings as well.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion added 510,000 Ohioans to the Medicaid rolls in the past year. Spending for Ohio\u2019s current fiscal year is expected to be 20 percent greater than when Kasich took office.\n\n\u201cWhat (Kasich)\u2019s done is he\u2019s trying to substitute a carbon tax for an income tax cut, which in my book is pretty smart,\u201d Laffer said. \u201cA carbon tax is one of the least-bad taxes, an income tax is probably the most-bad tax.\u201d\n\nFor the fourth time since 2012, Kasich \u2014 with Republican supermajorities in the Ohio House and Senate \u2014 has proposed a tax hike on oil and gas drilling to help pay for an income tax cut.\n\nLaffer said Ohio still has \u201csome way to go\u201d in reducing the income tax. He also pointed to the state\u2019s lack of a right-to-work law, which would forbid mandatory union dues, as a drag on the economy.\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s making progress, and John Kasich, you can see how much progress he\u2019s making by the landslide victory he had last November,\u201d Laffer continued, citing Kasich\u2019s re-election win against a Democrat challenger who quit campaigning in August.\n\n\u201cSome of the leading indicators are starting to look a little bit better for Ohio, but I think it certainly could be a couple more years before we see significant changes on the performance side as well,\u201d Williams said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Low job growth, productivity and population growth from 2003-2013 caused Ohio to come in next-to-last in state economic rankings released Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Low job growth, productivity and population growth from 2003-2013 caused Ohio to come in next-to-last in state economic rankings released Wednesday.", "title": "Ohio ranks next to last in economic study - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/alec-rich-states-poor-states.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-08T16:14:24+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/210923/ohio-ranks-49th/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Low job growth, productivity and population growth from 2003-2013 caused Ohio to come in next-to-last in state economic rankings released Wednesday.", "title": "Ohio ranks next to last in economic study - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/alec-rich-states-poor-states.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-04-09T04:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T16:14:24+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohio, rich states poor states, ALEC, american legislative exchange council, arthur laffer, stephen moore, jonathan williams, john kasich, ohio general assembly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9919\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogLow job growth, productivity and population growth from 2003-2013 caused Ohio to come in next-to-last in state economic rankings released Wednesday.\nLaffer, Moore and Williams discussed their study\u2019s focus on income tax rates and state-level reforms during a press call Tuesday.\nBut the future looks brighter: because of recent income tax cuts and improving job creation, Ohio was 23rd in the report\u2019s economic outlook ranking for the second year in a row.\nLaffer said Ohio still has \u201csome way to go\u201d in reducing the income tax.\nOhio\u2019s economic performance was worse than every state except Michigan in the pro-growth American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s 2015 Rich States, Poor States report."}
