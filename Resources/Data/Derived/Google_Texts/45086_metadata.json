Well, according to the Swedish courts, you\u2019re not to blame. Mikael Halvarsson of Sundsvall, Sweden, was recently acquitted of rape charges after doctors confirmed he did, in fact, suffer from the rare condition of sexomnia and had committed the crime unintentionally while asleep. Surprisingly enough, Halvarsson isn\u2019t the first man to be cleared of rape charges because of this rare condition.\n\nOn April 2, 2014 Halvarsson and a female friend shared a bed together, but according to ABC News, \u201ceach had their own blanket.\u201d Later that night the victim awoke to find Halvarsson sexually assaulting her, and quickly called the police. Officers arrived to find Halvarsson still asleep in the victim's bed. In his defense, Halvarsson claimed that he had not meant to harm the woman and suffered from a rare, although not unheard of, condition called sexomnia.\n\nSexomnia is a type of parasomnia, a condition where an individual completes activities in his sleep without being aware of it. During a bout of sexomnia, the individual may masturbate or initiate intercourse with the person sleeping next to him, whether willing or not. Fox News reported that the condition is believed to only affect about one percent of the world\u2019s population, with most individuals reporting spurts of the condition during times of high stress and fatigue. The condition is well documented and found in both men and women.\n\nHalvarsson isn\u2019t the first man to blame his rape charges on the condition, so how does one set apart those suffering from parasomnia from a common criminal? Dr. Kingman Strohl, a professor of medicine and director of research at the Sleep Center at Case Medical Center in Cleveland told ABC News that contrary to common belief, the condition is actually quite difficult to fake.\n\n\u201cUsually people are very scared and also quite confused as to what's going on,\u201d he said, adding that doctors look for signs in the patient's medical history, and that it has \u201cgone on before and occurs in context of sleep walking and sleep talking.\" In Halvarsson\u2019s case, both his ex-girlfriend and his mother testified that the man did indeed have a history of abnormal sleeping behavior, which included sexual activity.\n\nOther signs include the \u201cskillfulness\u201d that the individual will apply to activities done while asleep. In the case of parasomnia, such as sleepwalking and sexomnia, the person isn\u2019t dreaming but rather dong an automatic action. This could include everything from walking around the house to, of course, initiating intercourse.\n\nThey aren\u2019t able to complete complex tasks, so when telling fakers apart from those with the condition, it\u2019s important to take note of the individual\u2019s composure during the crime. For example, sexomniacs are described as being \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d during sexual activity, just as a sleepwalker would appear unresponsive when meandering around the house.\n\n\"You want to know how people react to it. You want to know what the people look like and want to know how each partner reacts to it,\" said Strohl of diagnosing a sexomnia incident.\n\nThankfully, the condition is treatable. Treatment includes a combination of medication, CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea, and even anticonvulsant therapy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sexomnia, made, me, do, it, man, acquitted, rape, court, rules, he, committed, crime", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man in Sweden was cleared of his rape charges because he allegedly suffered from sexomnia and committed the crime unintentionally.", "title": "Man With 'Sexomnia' Escapes Rape Charges", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexomnia-made-me-do-it-man-acquitted-rape-court-rules-he-committed-crime-unintentionally-304248", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/sleepwalker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man in Sweden was cleared of his rape charges because he allegedly suffered from sexomnia and committed the crime unintentionally.", "title": "Man With 'Sexomnia' Escapes Rape Charges", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexomnia-made-me-do-it-man-acquitted-rape-court-rules-he-committed-crime-unintentionally-304248", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/sleepwalker.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/sleepwalker.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-22T11:24:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-22T11:24:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man in Sweden was cleared of his rape charges because he allegedly suffered from sexomnia and committed the crime unintentionally."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb725\"", "article_summary": "Mikael Halvarsson of Sundsvall, Sweden, was recently acquitted of rape charges after doctors confirmed he did, in fact, suffer from the rare condition of sexomnia and had committed the crime unintentionally while asleep.\nSurprisingly enough, Halvarsson isn\u2019t the first man to be cleared of rape charges because of this rare condition.\nSexomnia is a type of parasomnia, a condition where an individual completes activities in his sleep without being aware of it.\nDuring a bout of sexomnia, the individual may masturbate or initiate intercourse with the person sleeping next to him, whether willing or not.\nIn the case of parasomnia, such as sleepwalking and sexomnia, the person isn\u2019t dreaming but rather dong an automatic action."}
