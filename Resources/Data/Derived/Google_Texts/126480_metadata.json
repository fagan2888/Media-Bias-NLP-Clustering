While the federally-mandated Title IX inquisition against Media Professor Laura Kipnis grabbed more national attention, Northwestern\u2019s campaign of censorship against a faculty-produced bioethics journal is equally disturbing.\n\nThe journal, Atrium, has always been produced without administrative oversight. Its February 2014 issue featured a \u201cBad Girls\u201d theme and a slightly provocative cover. It also contained an essay by Syracuse University Professor William Peace, who described being paralyzed as a young man and receiving oral sex from a hospital nurse, curing his erectile issues.\n\nThis essay, as well as the theme, drew concerns from administrators, who censored it until May of this year, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education:\n\nNorthwestern officials were reportedly concerned about the \u201cBad Girls\u201d issue, and Peace\u2019s article in particular, worrying that it would hurt the \u201cbrand\u201d of FSM and Northwestern Medicine, the corporate parent overseeing the university\u2019s hospital system. Under pressure from the university, the Medical Humanities & Bioethics Program (MHB Program, which publishes Atrium) removed the \u201cBad Girls\u201d issue, as well as all previously published Atriumissues, from its website. It was not until May 18, 2015\u201414 months after the \u201cBad Girls\u201d issue was removed from its website\u2014that Northwestern officials withdrew their objections to the issue\u2019s posting. This reversal came only a day after Dreger informed the university that she intended to publicize the controversy. Though Atrium\u2019s issues are back online, its most serious struggles may be yet to come. Dreger reports that Northwestern has formed a new oversight committee tasked with reviewing the content of Atrium\u2019s next issue. This is a significant departure from the publication\u2019s past editorial practice, giving rise to concerns that the university will take an active role in policing the publication\u2019s content.\n\nAlice Dreger, professor of Clinical Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, edited the censored issue. She had this to say:\n\n\u201cThrough this censorship my dean\u2019s office put me in the position of either staying silent and being a hypocrite or calling out my own dean on censorship,\u201d said Dreger, who recently authored a book on academic freedom and the struggle for truth and justice in the sciences. \u201cI told our university public relations people, the dean\u2019s office, and ultimately our provost that I resented being put in this position, particularly when the censorship was so unnecessary and capricious.\u201d\n\nWhile Northwestern\u2019s treatment of Kipnis is due to the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights misinterpreting Title IX of higher education law, Dreger and Atrium\u2019s ordeal is solely the fault of university bureaucrats. If medical experts can\u2019t give frank opinions about sex\u2014especially in the context of an essay about the ethics of sexual healing\u2014then Northwestern is an intellectually stifling environment that puts knee-jerk PR concerns before the university\u2019s stated commitment to free expression.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Why is Northwestern so squeamish?", "title": "It\u2019s Not Just Kipnis: Northwestern Censored Another Prof Over Mildly Provocative Sex Views", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/16/its-not-just-kipnis-northwestern-censore", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14344849996275.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why is Northwestern so squeamish?", "title": "It\u2019s Not Just Kipnis: Northwestern Censored <em>Another</em> Prof Over Mildly Provocative Sex Views", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14344849996275.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-06-16T20:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Northwestern University\u2019s squeamishness is only surpassed by its lack of respect for academic freedom, it seems.\nAlice Dreger, professor of Clinical Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, edited the censored issue.\nIts February 2014 issue featured a \u201cBad Girls\u201d theme and a slightly provocative cover.\nIt was not until May 18, 2015\u201414 months after the \u201cBad Girls\u201d issue was removed from its website\u2014that Northwestern officials withdrew their objections to the issue\u2019s posting.\nIt also contained an essay by Syracuse University Professor William Peace, who described being paralyzed as a young man and receiving oral sex from a hospital nurse, curing his erectile issues."}
