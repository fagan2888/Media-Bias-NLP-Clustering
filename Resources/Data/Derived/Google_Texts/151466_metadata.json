Those who ignore the deadline and go without health insurance could see their tax bills grow by hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s because the penalty for not having health insurance will be added to people\u2019s tax bills or subtracted from their tax refunds. Many people who didn\u2019t have insurance this year will see these penalties show up on their tax returns for the first time when they start preparing their 2014 taxes in the spring. (The fee for not being covered this year is $95 per person or roughly 1 percent of household income. Next year it grows to $325 per person or roughly 2 percent of household income.)\n\nNow some people who are confused about the deadline for signing up risk having to pay the penalty for 2015 as well. Anyone who doesn\u2019t sign up by Monday won\u2019t have insurance until Feb. 1 at the earliest. But they still have a chance to avoid the penalty for 2015.\n\nThe final, final deadline for buying insurance for next year \u2014 and for avoiding the penalty \u2014 will be Feb. 15. Anyone who doesn\u2019t sign up by then will have to wait until the next open enrollment period starts in the fall \u2014 and will go without insurance for the rest of 2015.\n\n\u201cOn Feb. 16 it will be too late, says Kathy Pickering, executive director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to get in early.\u201d\n\nPeople who change jobs, get married, have children or face another qualifying life event may be eligible for a special enrollment period that will give them another chance to sign up for coverage. Some people will also qualify for exemptions that will let them avoid the penalty altogether.\n\nWhile 62 percent of people without insurance generally know that they could face a penalty, there is a lot of confusion about how the penalty will be applied and what people need to do to avoid it, according to a survey from TurboTax. Some 87 percent of the uninsured people polled by the online tax preparation company in November said they didn\u2019t know the deadline for avoiding the 2014 tax penalty had passed.\n\n\u201cDespite all the talk of Obamacare, the lack of knowledge is astounding,\u201d says Bob Meighan, a vice president at TurboTax.\n\nRelated:\n\nMedical debt is ruining the credit score of millions of Americans\n\nHow to make sure you don\u2019t chose the wrong health plan this open enrollment season\n\nThe small change that can save you thousands of dollars a year in health costs\n\n7 things you can do now to lower next year\u2019s tax bill", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dec. 15 is the last day to sign up for health insurance for people who want coverage starting Jan. 1.
