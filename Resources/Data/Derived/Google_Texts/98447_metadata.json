Most arose from work-design flaws lacking lean principles, such as insufficient workspace (29 percent), poor process design (23 percent) and a lack of integration in the internal supply chains (23 percent), according to the research summary.\n\nTo increase hospital productivity and therefore care quality, timeliness and efficiency, hospitals must directly connect supply departments to patients' needs.\n\nThe authors found that when items on the nursing unit did not match what patients needed, the nurses would \"go on an expedition\" to find the necessary materials or equipment. Nursing departments will avoid operational failures by giving suppliers a yes or no work request on behalf of a specific patient.\n\nIn addition to ensuring employees have the basic infrastructure necessary to do their work and a supply department that is responsive to patients' needs, attributes of high-performing hospitals and health systems also include the use of information technology and evidence-based medicine for making clinical decisions, patient monitoring and drug prescribing, and compensation practices that promote quality metrics on chronic disease, prevention and patient experience, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the summary\n\n- read the paper (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDistracted hospital leaders thwart patient experience efforts\n\nDevelop, nurture leadership to improve the bottom line\n\nHospitals improve care by borrowing strategies from manufacturing\n\n7 traits of a high-performing system", "article_metadata": {"description": "Operational failures waste at least 10 percent of caregivers' time and can compromise the quality, timeliness and efficiency of care delivery, according to a working paper from the Harvard Business School.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Operational failures waste at least 10 percent of caregivers' time and can compromise the quality, timeliness and efficiency of care delivery, according to a working paper from the Harvard Business School.", "title": "Operational failures that hurt hospital performance", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/operational-failures-hurt-hospital-performance/2013-10-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "efficiency,Harvard Business School,hospital operations,Operations & Business Management,Supply Chain", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe58\"", "article_summary": "Moreover, nurses' workaround to the operational failures--searching for needed items and securing them for their own use--created operational failures for other nurses.\nNursing departments will avoid operational failures by giving suppliers a yes or no work request on behalf of a specific patient.\nTo increase hospital productivity and therefore care quality, timeliness and efficiency, hospitals must directly connect supply departments to patients' needs.\nOperational failures waste at least 10 percent of caregivers' time and can compromise the quality, timeliness and efficiency of care delivery, according to a September working paper from the Harvard Business School.\nThe authors observed nurses on medical/surgical units at two hospitals and support staff and identified 120 operational failures, including instances where an employee lacked the supplies, equipment, information or people needed to complete work tasks."}
