The project is part of a larger 10 year expansion for the college.\n\nThe new $20 million, 60 thousand square foot Health Sciences Institute will have specialized labs for students studying nursing, radiography, surgical technology and physical therapy.\n\nEastern Florida State College is expanding programs mainly in the areas of health care, business and computer technology. John Glisch, Associate Vice President of Communications, said the majority of the college\u2019s students are Brevard residents.\n\n\u201cThe average age of our bachelor students is 34, 35, so it\u2019s just a tremendous opportunity for them to come back to school and get degrees that they maybe wanted to get but couldn\u2019t for a variety of different reasons including having to maybe travel too far to go to school, costs. Most of them are married and raising families,\u201d Glisch said.\n\nHe said a recent study shows graduates from the new institute are expected to add about $6.3 million annually to the local economy through their salaries and spending power.\n\nThe institute, funded with state dollars, is scheduled to open early 2017. It\u2019s the second of six new buildings planned for Eastern Florida State College\u2019s Melbourne campus.
