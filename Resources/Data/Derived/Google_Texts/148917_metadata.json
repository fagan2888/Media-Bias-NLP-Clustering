In what may be the first move of its kind, Highmark in April stopped paying higher fees for chemotherapy drugs given to patients whose doctors work for hospitals, instead paying the same price they would have had the doctor remained independent.\n\nThe move is being watched closely by insurers around the country, and \u201csome will probably follow suit,\u201d said Kathryn Fitch, a healthcare management consultant at Milliman, whose 2013 study documented chemotherapy costs in hospital outpatient settings ran as much as 53 percent higher than in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung toward hospitals buying up physician practices to get better revenue,\u201d Fitch said.\n\nOther insurers are trying different ways to hold down costs. WellPoint, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, will soon begin paying oncologists a bonus of $350 a month per patient for sticking with specific, less-costly, chemotherapy regimens. Florida Blue has partnered with some doctor practices to create cancer-specific \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d that reward doctors if the new organizations save money while hitting quality targets.\n\nAnd UnitedHealthcare, the biggest insurer by market share, is expanding a pilot project that uses flat, or \u201cbundled,\u201d payments for the treatment of certain cancers \u2013 which include the cost of drugs.\n\nTargeting Cancer Treatment\n\nChanging the way cancer care is paid for is a top priority for insurers and employers, with treatments costing the U.S. more than $127 billion each year. That is projected to grow 27 percent from 2010 to 2020 as the population ages, said epidemiologist Robin Yabroff at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nMeanwhile, the average monthly cost of a brand-name cancer drug has doubled to $10,000 in the past decade, according to a May report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.\n\nThat\u2019s important because the traditional way to pay for cancer drugs given in a doctor\u2019s office is to reimburse the physician for the average sales price of the drug, plus an added percentage to cover overhead and a de facto profit margin. In Medicare, for instance, the added percentage is 6 percent.\n\nHighmark\u2019s Fischer and others say that payment method creates an incentive to use higher-priced drugs \u2014 and more of them.\n\n\u201cIf you give a 10,000 drug, it\u2019s $600 [for the doctor]. If you give a $100 drug, you get a margin of $6,\u201d said Fischer.\n\nHe said that such \u201cbuy and bill\u201d programs are being phased out in other specialties, but have continued in cancer care because insurers fear losing oncologists from their networks.\n\nAdministering chemotherapy in hospital outpatient settings is even more expensive, studies show. IMS Health reported that per-dose payments were 189 percent higher for brand-name drugs given in hospital outpatient settings than in independent doctor offices.\n\nSome of that added burden falls on patients, who paid $134 more per dose on average for cancer drugs given in hospital outpatient settings than in doctors\u2019 offices, the report found.\n\nWhile the health law limits annual out-of-pocket costs to $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families, paying such sums out of pocket is daunting for many consumers.\n\nStudies of breast cancer patients show that even small increases in copayments led some to stop treatment.\n\nThe amount \u201cis unachievable for many of the patients we represent,\u201d said Brian Rosen, senior vice president at The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. \u201cPatients who need lifesaving therapies often can\u2019t afford access to the cure.\u201d\n\nThe problem is likely to grow as more physician practices are purchased by hospitals. In a recent six-month period, for example, Medicare payments tripled for chemotherapy in hospital outpatient settings and dropped 14 percent in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nIn March, the advisory group MedPac recommended that Medicare reduce or eliminate differences in payment rates between outpatient departments and physician offices for many services.\n\nDrugmakers Worry About Innovation\n\nAs more attention focuses on costs, the drug industry has fired back, concerned that standardized regimens will discourage the innovation that it says has led to better survival rates.\n\nSuch drug regimens or bundled payments could \u201ccreate significant barriers and disincentives toward continued innovation,\u201d said Randy Burkholder, vice president of policy at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry\u2019s lobbying arm.\n\nSome physicians also reject a one-size-fits-most approach, concerned about impact on quality.\n\nInsurers insist they can lower cost without hurting quality or innovation. Wellpoint, for instance, said it expects to save at least 3 percent on overall cancer costs through its plan to give bonuses to doctors who follow specified treatment regimens, or \u201cpathways.\u201d Such regimens are based on analyses of effectiveness and costs by private firms, such as U.S. Oncology, or by insurers\u2019 themselves.\n\nTo date, evidence of savings is inconclusive. Some insurers have reported significant savings, while others have not, said Lindsay Conway, practice manager at the Advisory Board Company, a consulting firm that works with hospitals.\n\nDespite their own cost concerns, patient groups also express misgivings about standardized drug regimens and flat payments, fearing they may encourage providers \u201cto make treatment decisions based on cost and less on the evidence,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nYabroff, the epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, said concerns about quality are real, and make additional research imperative so that both \u201cquality and cost are evaluated.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
