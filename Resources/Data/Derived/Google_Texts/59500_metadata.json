Now Hanukkah has Mensch on a Bench \u2014 not to mention Maccabee on the Mantel. Christmas has gingerbread houses; Manischewitz now sells Chanukah House kits, using cookie dough with blue-and-white icing.\n\nThese are just a few of the Hanukkah-themed products inspired by Christmas traditions and toys. Pinterest and Etsy are loaded with blue-and-white Hanukkah crafts like wreaths and stockings. There are Hanukkah greeting cards, cookie cutters and even tree ornaments shaped like the three symbols \u2014 Stars of David, menorahs and dreidels.\n\nSome may say \u201cOy vey!\u201d to all this kitschy retooling of Christmas stuff. But others, like Rabbi Evan Moffic of Congregation Solel in suburban Chicago, ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d He sees the crossover trend as part of how Jews \u201cembrace the larger culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat most of us think of as Jewish food was borrowed from all the different countries Jews lived in in Eastern Europe,\u201d said Ted Merwin, a Dickinson College professor who\u2019s writing a book about the history of Jewish delis called \u201cPastrami on Rye.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why people think that when Jews come to America we would stop taking from the surrounding culture.\u201d\n\nMerwin says the products are \u201cdriven by high rates of intermarriage between Jews and Christians, but some of it is simply the reality\u201d of living as a minority in a multicultural society.\n\nDianne Ashton, a Rowan University professor and author of \u201cHanukkah in America,\u201d says Jews began giving gifts at Hanukkah to show they had joined America\u2019s consumer culture.\n\n\u201cFor immigrants in the early 20th century on the Lower East Side, buying presents for your kids showed you weren\u2019t a greenhorn, and it also showed that you had earned enough money.\u201d\n\nNeal Hoffman created Mensch on a Bench last year after his son asked for Elf on the Shelf, the doll that watches kids\u2019 behavior so Santa knows whether they deserve Christmas presents. Hoffman is Jewish, his wife is Catholic, but they\u2019re raising their children Jewish. He raised $22,000 on Kickstarter for a prototype Mensch last year and is producing 50,000 units for sale this year in retailers like Target and Toys R Us.\n\nBut Mensch on a Bench is different from Elf on the Shelf: Kids can\u2019t touch the elf, but the mensch \u201cis an old Jewish guy\u201d designed to be played with like any doll, Hoffman said. Other Hanukkah toys that echo Elf on the Shelf include Kippah Kantor and Maccabee on the Mantel.\n\nThe Manischewitz Company launched Chanukah House kits in 2012. Manischewitz hosts a competition on Facebook for the best-decorated house, with a $2,000 first prize.\n\nOne of Merwin\u2019s favorite examples is a children\u2019s book, \u201cHow Murray Saved Christmas,\u201d a rhyming spoof of \u201c\u2018Twas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d Murray, a deli owner, fills in for Santa and gets the toys delivered even though he smells like pickles and can\u2019t remember the reindeer names.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant parody,\u201d said Merwin.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mensch on a Bench: American Hanukkah riffs on Christmas kitsch", "title": "Mensch on a Bench: American Hanukkah riffs on Christmas kitsch", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/14/mensch-on-a-bench-american-hanukkah-riffs-on-christmas-kitsch/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141114__20141115_C3_FE15AHWANNUKAHp1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141114__20141115_C3_FE15AHWANNUKAHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-14T16:54:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:32:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Other Hanukkah toys that echo Elf on the Shelf include Kippah Kantor and Maccabee on the Mantel.\nNow Hanukkah has Mensch on a Bench \u2014 not to mention Maccabee on the Mantel.\nChristmas has gingerbread houses; Manischewitz now sells Chanukah House kits, using cookie dough with blue-and-white icing.\nChristmas has Elf on the Shelf.\nThese are just a few of the Hanukkah-themed products inspired by Christmas traditions and toys."}
