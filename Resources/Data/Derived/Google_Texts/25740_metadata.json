Networks are required to have sufficient numbers and types of providers to deliver services without \"unreasonable delay,\" though \"unreasonable\" is left to the states to define.\n\nIn sizing provider networks in gold, silver and bronze tiers, the report found that in a 2014 national analysis of silver plans, 41 percent were extra-small or small, meaning that they included 25 percent or less of the physicians in a rating area.\n\nNetwork size varied across type of plans, with HMOs more narrow than PPOs.\n\nThe report also found that the distribution of networks that were large or extra large could be found in Delaware, Kansas and North Dakota and those smaller are in Georgia, Florida and Oklahoma.\n\nOthers that are well balanced across sizes include Minnesota, New York and Washington.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nAlthough the concept of narrow networks has gained national attention, the report found 12 states had none.\n\nThe prevalence of narrow networks in states range from 83 percent in Georgia to 13 percent in Idaho and North Carolina.\n\nThe report found significant variability within plan types by state; for example, none of Idaho's three HMO networks are narrow, compared to half of its PPO networks; 91 percent of California's 11 HMO networks are narrow, compared to 33 percent of its PPOs.\n\nThe question of why one state has more narrow networks than other states awaits future research.\n\nThe report conclude that well-functioning narrow networks would survive only if they are made more transparent to consumers and are regulated to ensure sufficient network adequacy.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/narrow-networks-dominate-states-more-hmos-study-finds", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/story-map-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Narrow insurance networks are gaining traction across the United States, as insurers have limited options for offering plans at different price points, according to a report by the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "title": "Narrow networks dominate in states with more HMOs, study finds"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/story-map-feature.jpg"}, "description": "Narrow insurance networks are gaining traction across the United States, as insurers have limited options for offering plans at different price points, according to a report by the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Narrow networks dominate in states with more HMOs, study finds"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Narrow insurance networks are gaining traction across the United States, as insurers have limited options for offering plans at different price points, according to a report by the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.&#13; However, some states are offering more of these networks than others.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a88\"", "article_summary": "There is also a strong correlation between states that offer Health Maintenance Organization plans and states that have more narrow networks, the report states.\nThe prevalence of narrow networks in states range from 83 percent in Georgia to 13 percent in Idaho and North Carolina.\nThe question of why one state has more narrow networks than other states awaits future research.\nLike Healthcare Finance on FacebookAlthough the concept of narrow networks has gained national attention, the report found 12 states had none.\nStates with a 60 percent or more narrow networks are dominated by HMOs, where states that have the lowest prevalence -- 20 percent or less -- are dominated by Preferred Provider Organizations, the authors said."}
