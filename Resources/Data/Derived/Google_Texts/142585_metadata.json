Associated Press\n\nIn the good ole days before Texas businessman Samuel Wyly filed for bankruptcy during an expensive securities-fraud fight, Mr. Wyly could call it like he saw it on the state of entrepreneurship and other topics in the books he wrote.\n\nThese days, the ex-billionaire-on-a-budget has to think creatively about how to get his latest publication, \u201cThe Immigrant Spirit: How Newcomers Enrich America,\u201d into print.\n\nMr. Wyly had nearly finished his book about the achievements of immigrants when he filed for bankruptcy in October, hit with a $198.1 million judgment for securities fraud involving secret trading through offshore accounts. He still needed about $15,000 to finish the manuscript, publish it and start selling it.\n\nShortly after the filing, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Barbara Houser scrutinized Mr. Wyly\u2019s request to spend tens of thousands of dollars on his writing pastime.\n\nLawyers for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also had criticized the spending request, especially because Mr. Wyly said he couldn\u2019t afford to pay the damages against him for civil fraud involving secret trading through offshore accounts that netted millions of dollars in profits, according to court papers. Mr. Wyly filed for chapter 11 protection on Oct. 19 after SEC lawyers tried to restrict his financial maneuvering.\n\nSo out of Mr. Wyly\u2019s bankruptcy budget went the cost of his two personal writing assistants. And publishing \u201cThe Immigrant Spirit\u201d will have to be done on the cheap.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Wyly\u2019s lawyers asked Judge Houser to sign off on his latest publication strategy. Under that strategy, Mr. Wyly is proposing to transfer the book\u2019s copyright to a new nonprofit, then look for publishing grants from charities like New York-based Fractured Atlas, which helps authors raise money, his lawyers said.\n\n\u201cImmigration into the United States of America, although not well understood, has become ever more prominently a topic of public debate,\u201d his lawyers said in court papers.\n\nMr. Wyly\u2019s earlier books include his 2008 memoir titled \u201c1,000 Dollars & An Idea: Entrepreneur to Billionaire\u201d (Amazon sales ranking: 1,635,929) and \u201cTexas Got It Right,\u201d written with his son Andrew (Amazon sales ranking: 503,409). He\u2019s got two more in progress, including one tentatively titled \u201cSoul of an Entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nHis lawyers said that 850,000 copies of Mr. Wyly\u2019s books are in print, and many have been \u201cgifted\u201d to high school teachers and college professors.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
