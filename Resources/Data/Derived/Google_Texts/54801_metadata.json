John Kasich, the runner-up in the GOP New Hampshire primary Tuesday, brought his call for less divisive politics, tax cuts and a balanced federal budget to the Charleston area Wednesday.\n\nAt the Nucor Steel mill in Huger, he pledged to improve trade deals and \u201cbreak some glass, if necessary\u201d to support the U.S. steel industry, if elected president.\n\n\u201cI grew up blue collar, just outside Pittsburgh,\u201d said Kasich, who said domestic manufacturing is important. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job at negotiating these trade deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you, and I see America,\u201d he told the workers.\n\nKasich also said protecting the environment is important, but that the Environmental Protection Agency needs to be reigned in.\n\nEarlier in the day, he spoke in Charleston about helping veterans find jobs and access to health care, and he met with supporters at a town hall meeting in Mount Pleasant at a pizza restaurant where the crowd was packed shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nSupporters there said they appreciate his generally positive campaign, which has focused on Kasich\u2019s message that he\u2019s an experienced leader who\u2019s shown he can get things done.\n\n\u201cWhen did \u2018consensus\u2019 become a bad word?\u201d said supporter Cindy Moury, a retired department store manager from North Charleston.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most sensible and logical candidate,\u201d said Hanahan resident Stephanie Jackson. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything I disagree with.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s reinvigorated bid for the Republican presidential nomination after coming in second behind Donald Trump in New Hampshire faces new challenges in South Carolina that Kasich acknowledged.\n\n\u201cThey warned me when I was coming down here, you\u2019re going to South Carolina, and they are VERY conservative,\u201d Kasich told the crowd. \u201cBut people are people. I\u2019m not going to run for president by pitting one group against another.\u201d\n\nAt Finn\u2019s Brick Oven in Mount Pleasant, Kasich told his now-familiar anecdotes \u2014 he\u2019s the son of a mailman, grandson of a coal miner, and he talked his way into a 20-minute Oval Office meeting with President Richard Nixon when he was an 18-year-old college student.\n\nOne woman in the audience told Kasich that she was a life-long Democrat who was supporting George McGovern while Kasich was meeting with Nixon, but now she\u2019s supporting him.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kasich pledged to press ahead with a positive campaign aimed at uniting people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Republican Party got so off-kilter,\u201d he said, promising to \u201chelp people who live in the shadows.\u201d\n\nHe said he knows how to get spending under control and cut taxes, and said that if elected \u201cwithin the first 100 days I\u2019ll have a massive plan.\u201d\n\nHis campaign pitch was right out of the Republican play book from the Reagan era, which is when Kasich was in Congress. Cut regulations, shift authority for education, transportation and other federal functions to the states. Cut red tape, balance the budget.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a bunch of people around me to educate me,\u201d he said, in response to a foreign policy question. It was a rare poke at his primary opponents.\n\nHe offered no specifics about how he would balance the federal budget while also cutting taxes.\n\nKasich said he did well in New Hampshire because \u201cwe showed up in the snow and the rain with a positive message.\u201d\n\nIn campaign appearances, Kasich touts his image as a pragmatic compromise-seeking member of Congress who helped balance the budget, albeit briefly, and his role in guiding Ohio out of the recession.\n\nUnlike S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley, Kasich expanded Medicaid in Ohio under Obamacare, and has often said that\u2019s a decision he could defend before St. Peter at the gates of Heaven. Both states have among the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation.\n\nBut in conservative South Carolina, any support for Obamacare may be seen as heavy baggage among Republican primary voters.\n\nKasich said Obamacare doesn\u2019t work, but he said people should not lose health insurance because of pre-existing conditions \u2014 something the Affordable Care Act guaranteed. Kasich said his state is pressing for market-based reforms, working with insurers and health providers.\n\n\u201cWe want high quality at a low price,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWhen I make promises about what I want to do, we\u2019ve done all these things before.\u201d\n\nReach David Slade at 843-937-5552 or twitter.com/DSladeNews", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kasich promises tax cuts, balanced budget while touring Charleston area, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Election 2016,John Kasich,Republican presidential primary", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Ohio Gov.
