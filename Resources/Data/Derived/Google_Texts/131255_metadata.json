Ted Cruz (R-TX) praised a former conservative senator best known for his opposition to African American civil rights and gay people on Wednesday, suggesting that the nation would be better off if Congress were still filled with lawmakers who shared his beliefs and positions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s every bit as true now as it was then,\u201d Cruz said at a fundraiser hosted at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cWe need 100 more like Jesse Helms in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nHelms, the longest serving senator from North Carolina, is renowned for speaking out against civil rights, voting rights, gay rights, and abortion \u2014 causes that Cruz himself has embraced in his short senate tenure.\n\nThe late Helms, who died in 2008, famously led a 16-day filibuster to prevent the Senate from approving the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday, described the Civil Rights Act as \u201cthe single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress,\u201d organized against the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, and opposed any \u201cfederal financing of AIDS research and treatment,\u201d arguing that \u201cThere is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy.\u201d \u201cHomosexuals are weak, morally sick wretches,\u201d Helms was once quoted as saying and he sought to block a nominee \u201cbecause she\u2019s a damn lesbian.\u201d\n\nCruz is less inflammatory, but remains committed to Helms\u2019 causes.\n\nFor instance, both men sought to undo a Voting Rights Act provision that requires Southern states with histories of discrimination to receive pre-clearance when changing election laws. Helms argued that the measure treated Southerners as \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d and proposed an amendment that extended its terms to the entire United States. Cruz calls for repeal of the pre-clearance provision and insists that \u201cwe need to be fighting to ensure the law is colorblind and fair to everyone.\u201d In June, he praised the Supreme Court for striking down a key section of the Act that determined which areas of the country should be subject to federal oversight.\n\nHelms claimed that gay people revolt him, while the Texas senator now insists that gays are trying to silence Christians. During an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s David Brody in July, Cruz complained that marriage equality will jeopardize the \u201cfuture of our country\u201d and lead to hate speech charges against Christian pastors who decline to perform same-sex weddings. Both also agree on reducing the food stamps program, eliminating the progressive tax code system and replacing it with a flat tax and limiting women\u2019s access to abortions.\n\nSignificantly, Helms and Cruz share the goal of purifying the party of moderate influences, pushing the GOP into a narrow ideological tent. Cruz mocks mainstream Republicans as \u201csquishes\u201d and decries members who don\u2019t commit to fully defunding the Affordable Care Act. In 1994, Helms decried Republicans who supported President Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill as \u201cJudases\u201d and later, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, opposed the nomination of former GOP Gov. William Weld (MA) to an ambassadorship. Helms disliked Weld\u2019s \u201cblend of fiscal conservatism and progressive social stances, such as his support for abortion-and gay-rights\u201d and eventually forced him to withdraw his nomination.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s event, billed as the \u201cJesse Helms Lecture Series,\u201d Cruz said that he gave his very first political donation to Helms and has since followed his mentor\u2019s ideological foot steps. But it\u2019s far from certain that Helms would have equally appreciated Cruz, who is of Cuban descent. During a 1986 visit to Mexico, Helms was encountered by protesters and remarked, \u201cAll Latins are volatile people. Hence, I was not surprised at the volatile reaction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Helms, the longest serving senator from North Carolina, is renowned for speaking out against civil rights, voting rights, gay rights, and abortion -- causes that Cruz himself has embraced in his short senate tenure.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Helms, the longest serving senator from North Carolina, is renowned for speaking out against civil rights, voting rights, gay rights, and abortion -- causes that Cruz himself has embraced in his short senate tenure.", "title": "How Ted Cruz Is Keeping Jesse Helms\u2019 Legacy Alive", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2013/09/12/2609951/ted-cruz-keeping-jesse-helms-legacy-alive/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ted-cruz-tea-party-star-senator-elect-and-white-house-hopeful-e1377438538688.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Helms, the longest serving senator from North Carolina, is renowned for speaking out against civil rights, voting rights, gay rights, and abortion -- causes that Cruz himself has embraced in his short senate tenure.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ted-cruz-tea-party-star-senator-elect-and-white-house-hopeful-e1377438538688-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Ted Cruz Is Keeping Jesse Helms\u2019 Legacy Alive", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ted-cruz-tea-party-star-senator-elect-and-white-house-hopeful-e1377438538688.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ted-cruz-tea-party-star-senator-elect-and-white-house-hopeful-e1377438538688.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T12:27:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At Wednesday\u2019s event, billed as the \u201cJesse Helms Lecture Series,\u201d Cruz said that he gave his very first political donation to Helms and has since followed his mentor\u2019s ideological foot steps.\nFor instance, both men sought to undo a Voting Rights Act provision that requires Southern states with histories of discrimination to receive pre-clearance when changing election laws.\nPolitics How Ted Cruz Is Keeping Jesse Helms\u2019 Legacy Alive CREDIT:Sen.
