That\u2019s the basic finding of two new studies, including one that found that employees who worked near windows during the day slept longer at night, got more exercise and had better quality of life than their colleagues toiling away in rooms without windows.\n\nA second study found that nurses whose workstations had natural light had lower blood pressure, communicated more with their colleagues, laughed more and were in a better mood when dealing with patients compared with nurses exposed to only artificial light.\n\n>> 9 Nasty Things You Should Throw Away\n\nIt has to do with our body\u2019s need for natural light, which increasing evidence finds can improve our sleep at night, as well as our mood, metabolism and alertness during the day, said Phyllis Zee, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, who was senior author on the first study.\n\nZee and her colleagues had previously found that exposure to early morning light helped people better manage their weight.\n\n\u201cWorkers are a group at risk because they are typically indoors often without access to natural or even artificial bright light for the entire day. The study results confirm that light during the natural daylight hours has powerful effects on health,\u201d she said in a university news release. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine in June.\n\nThe study included 49 day-shift office workers \u2013 22 in workplaces with windows and 27 in windowless workplaces \u2013 who answered questionnaires about their sleep and life quality; a subset had their sleep, activity and light exposure measured by a special device. The findings underscore the need to design offices that provide adequate natural daylight for workers, the authors said.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nA second study, by researchers at Cornell University and published in the journal Health Environments Research and Design, found that nurses whose workstations had more exposure to natural light had lower blood pressure; also, these nurses were better able to stay alert and communicate more with coworkers during long shifts, study author Rana Zadeh, an assistant professor of design and environmental analysis at Cornell, said in a university news release. Plus, the nurses were in better moods and laughed more than those without natural light, she noted.\n\n\u201cAs a nurse, it\u2019s an art to keep your smile, which helps ensure an excellent connection to patients. Designing affordable space that is conducive to the work is a smart way to bring positive mood \u2013 like laughter \u2013 into the workplace,\u201d Zadeh said.\n\nWhere adequate natural light isn\u2019t feasible, electrical lighting should be provided that helps provide the same beneficial effects to the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythms, she added.\n\nThe study group included 49 day-shift office workers; 27 in windowless workplaces and 22 in workplaces with windows. \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf\n\nPhoto: Squaredpixel/iStock\n\n>>Next: Cool It \u2013 Lower Temps May Help You Lose Weight\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more\n\nWorkers without windows reported poorer scores than their counterparts on quality of life measures related to physical problems and vitality, as well as poorer outcomes on measures of overall sleep quality and sleep disturbances. \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf\n\nOffice workers with more light exposure at the office had longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, more physical activity and better quality of life compared to office workers with less light exposure in the workplace \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf\n\nOffice workers with more light exposure at the office had longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, more physical activity and better quality of life compared to office workers with less light exposure in the workplace \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf\n\nOffice workers with more light exposure at the office had longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, more physical activity and better quality of life compared to office workers with less light exposure in the workplace \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf\n\nOffice workers with more light exposure at the office had longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, more physical activity and better quality of life compared to office workers with less light exposure in the workplace \u2013 See more at: http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/08/natural-light-in-the-office-boosts-health.html#sthash.ZeS25G9l.dpuf", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Windows \u2013 and the light they let in \u2013 make us healthier.
