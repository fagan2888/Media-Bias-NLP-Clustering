And let me tell you, help is on the way,\u201d the Republican senator said as boisterous supporters waved the Cruz campaign fans given to them to help beat the outdoor heat.\n\nSince he was elected in 2012, Cruz has become the most popular Republican in Texas and the face of the state\u2019s tea party movement.\n\nHe wants to expand his following nationwide in hopes that a hard-right conservative can win the GOP nomination, fire up the base and claim the White House.\n\nFor about 30 minutes, Cruz thrilled the home-state crowd with promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s pending Iran nuclear agreement, rebuild the military and abolish the IRS.\n\nCruz said that if he\u2019s elected, the IRS would become unnecessary because he would develop a simple flat tax for all Americans. Then he joked about what to do with the 90,000 IRS employees left without an agency.\n\n\u201cWe need to padlock that building and take all 90,000 and put them on our southern border,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz also promised to end the practice of allowing cities to provide sanctuary to people in the U.S. illegally, and he said he would strip all federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you I\u2019m going to do something, I\u2019m going to do exactly what I say I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nPolls show that Cruz, while well-funded and organized, is significantly behind businessman Donald Trump and others in the GOP race.\n\nBut unlike other candidates, Cruz has embraced Trump. He even invited the front-runner to join him next week at a rally against the proposed deal aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nCruz said before his speech that Trump is helping, not harming him. He contends that it was Trump\u2019s presence at last month\u2019s GOP debate that helped draw an audience of 24 million. While viewers may have tuned in to see Trump, he said, many came away liking Cruz, boosting his fundraising.\n\nTrump, Cruz said, has also forced the media to focus on illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cA lot of the other Republican candidates have gone out of their way to smack him with a two-by-four and say really nasty vicious things about him,\u201d Cruz said of Trump. \u201cI think that\u2019s foolish. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I\u2019ve gone in the other direction and sang his praises.\u201d\n\nIn previous presidential election cycles, a campaign rally in Texas would have been unnecessary because the state\u2019s primaries were held too late to shape the race\u2019s outcome.\n\nBut in this election, the March 1 primary is expected to be critical because of the high number of candidates and the belief by many observers that the early contest won\u2019t produce a clear front-runner.\n\nSo Cruz will battle primarily against former Gov. Rick Perry for Texas delegates. Other candidates with ties to the state include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nCruz, who also had stops in Tyler and Kingwood, said Thursday that he was confident he could do well at home.\n\n\u201cOur support in Texas is tremendous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s our intention to compete hard to win this state and to win states across the country.\u201d\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican presidential candidate promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s pending Iran nuclear agreement, rebuild the military and abolish the IRS.", "og": {"description": "The Republican presidential candidate promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s pending Iran nuclear agreement, rebuild the military and abolish the IRS.", "title": "At Stockyards, Ted Cruz vows to get rid of IRS, Iran deal, health care act", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150903-at-stockyards-ted-cruz-vows-to-get-rid-of-irs-iran-deal-health-care-act.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150903-nmc_3cruz_cover.ece/BINARY/original/NMC_3cruz_COVER", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-04T04:48:55Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-04T04:23:26Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"At Stockyards, Ted Cruz vows to get rid of IRS, Iran deal, health care act\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150903-at-stockyards-ted-cruz-vows-to-get-rid-of-irs-iran-deal-health-care-act.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/photos/20150903-nmc_3cruz30aj.ece/BINARY/original/NMC_3cruz30AJ\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2420172\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-04T04:23:26Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"GROMER JEFFERS JR.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/photos/20150903-nmc_3cruz30aj.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NMC_3cruz30AJ", "publishtime": "2015-09-04T04:23:26Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen I tell you I\u2019m going to do something, I\u2019m going to do exactly what I say I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Cruz said.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s our intention to compete hard to win this state and to win states across the country.\u201dFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.\nTrump, Cruz said, has also forced the media to focus on illegal immigration.\nBut unlike other candidates, Cruz has embraced Trump.\nSince he was elected in 2012, Cruz has become the most popular Republican in Texas and the face of the state\u2019s tea party movement."}
