P.A. was recognized as a \u201cFirm to Watch\u201d by a top accounting magazine.\n\n\u201cAccounting Today\u201d named the company, which has offices in Lawrence and Overland Park, to its list of businesses that are experiencing significant growth, called \u201cFirms to Watch.\u201d Mize Houser revenues in 2015 jumped 5.94 percent to $24.63 million.\n\nShareholder James Hilbert said the company has seen steady growth, that has accelerated through significant investments in technology and with business in 40 states.\n\n\u201cWay back into the early \u201970s, they were one of the first firms to invest in technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re unique in that we have programmers in house. A lot of FPA firms our size don\u2019t have an IT department. We developed our own accounting software package that we can market to firms or companies throughout the United States. Investing in that technology, it\u2019s really opened a lot of doors to us.\u201d\n\nHilbert said Mize Houser competes with national firms like ADP for payroll accounts, by offering personal service. \u201cI think what sets us apart from them, the big payroll firms, is if you call them and have a question, you never know who\u2019s going to answer the phone. We assign a person to work on your account,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, they have acquired new clients whose payroll companies couldn\u2019t handle the reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re large enough that we can provide real technical responses, and we\u2019re small enough that we can give them mom-and-pop service.\u201d\n\nThe company has grown from about 135 employees in about 2005 to about 230 now. The Topeka office has 160 employees, while 35 work in Overland Park and 35 in Lawrence.\n\nLegacy Financial Strategies Topeka office moves\n\nThe Topeka office of Legacy Financial Strategies LLC has relocated, moving up one floor in the business\u2019s current location to increase the space available for its use.\n\nMarguerite Armitage, a spokesperson for the Overland Park-based firm, said the company moved upstairs at its 1414 S.W. Ashworth Place location.\n\nThe additional space is useful to the company, which merged three businesses together last year. Legacy Financial, an Overland Park-based business, combined with two Topeka businesses, Peoples Wealth Management and Peoples Benefit Group.\n\n\u201cMichael Lutz is our CEO, and he grew up in Rossville,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cHe worked for a number of years in Topeka, and he has always wanted to expand into Topeka, so he was looking for the right merger. For Jim (Reardon, owner of Peoples Wealth Management), he also spent a few years looking for the right candidate. He had a solo practice, and he wanted to make sure his clients had continuity if he wasn\u2019t able to take care of them.\u201d\n\nNick Neukirch, formerly president and CEO of Peoples Benefit Group, had already partnered with Legacy and officially came into the fold in 2015, she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, Jobs, News, Local, Morgan Chilson, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Topeka-based Mize Houser & Co.
