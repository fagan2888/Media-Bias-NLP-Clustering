Molina Healthcare of Long Beach reported a significant increase in its quarterly revenues this week.

Molinaâ€™s revenues for the quarter ending March 31 added up to nearly $3.2 billion, which is 53 percent greater than revenues reported for the comparable period in 2014.

The company reported net income of $28.2 million (56 cents a share) for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $4.5 million (10 cents a share) earned one year prior.

Molina Healthcare provides health coverage plans to customers who are eligible for government assistance programs including Medi-Cal and Medicare. The firm reported its enrollment of nearly 3 million customers at the end of the first quarter was 38 percent greater than its enrollment level of one year prior.

As of March 31, Molina had 266,000 customers enrolled through state-run health insurance marketplaces such as Covered California. Molina had only 15,000 marketplace customers at the end of the first quarter in 2014. Company leaders have said the Affordable Care Act, which requires Americans to buy health insurance and allowed for the creation of state-run insurance marketplaces, is a major business opportunity for Molina.

Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) traded at $60.50, up 4 percent from the closing price, in after hours trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
