CC BY 2.0\n\nWith Suicide Prevention Day coming up on Sept. 10 this year, let\u2019s take a moment to discuss some of the risk factors \u2014 and some pathways involved in prevention \u2014 of suicide. A new large international study, known as the BRIDGE-II-MIX study, examined behavior patterns that might possibly lead up to suicide attempts.\n\nIn the study, researchers reviewed 2,811 patients who were suffering from depression; 628 of them had already attempted suicide at some point. Every participant was interviewed by a psychiatrist, and the researchers examined their previous suicide attempts, family history, treatments, and how they scored on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale \u2014 a test used by mental health professionals to rate patients\u2019 ability to function in social settings, work, and on their own individual psychological level.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the researchers focused on the patterns of behavior that occurred leading up to suicide attempts, then compared these to the patterns of depressed people who had not attempted suicide. The researchers found several parallel patterns between the two.\n\nSome of the behaviors included exhibiting risky behaviors like reckless driving; agitation like pacing the room, wringing hands, pulling clothing off and putting it back on; and being impulsive. The researchers note that if a depressed person is behaving in one or more of these ways, their risk of attempting suicide is 50 percent higher.\n\n\u201cWe found that \u2018depressive mixed states\u2019 often preceded suicide attempts,\u201d Dr. Dina Popovic, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cA depressive mixed state is where a patient is depressed, but also has symptoms of \u2018excitation,\u2019 or mania. We found this significantly more in patients who had previously attempted suicide, than those who had not. In fact, 40 percent of all the depressed patients who had attempted suicide had a \u2018mixed episode\u2019 rather than just depression.\u201d\n\nDepression typically involves feelings of fatigue, despair, indifference or apathy, and self-deprecating thoughts. Mixed episodes or depression typically involves some level of polarity, and exhibiting features of both mania and depression \u2014 including anxiety, agitation, irritability, and impulsiveness.\n\nThe researchers conclude that patients who had \u201cmixed depression\u201d were more likely to commit suicide. They also discovered that standard mental health criteria, as dictated by the DSM, doesn\u2019t always identify the people who are at risk. \u201cThe standard DSM criteria identified 12 percent of patients at showing mixed states, whereas our methods showed 40 percent of at-risk patients,\u201d Popovic said in the press release. \u201cThis means that the standard methods are missing a lot of patients at risk of suicide.\u201d\n\nIf someone is exhibiting these behaviors or has attempted suicide before, some of the prevention pathways involve removing the means of suicide (such as guns or pills), and providing the person with a strong social community. One recent study found that strong social connections may decrease the risk of suicide, particularly for middle-aged women. Other therapies include calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, or clinical/psychological care for substance abuse and depression.\n\n\u201cThis is an important message for all clinicians, from the GPs who see depressed patients and may not pay enough attention to these symptoms, which are not always reported spontaneously by the patients,\u201d Popovic said in the press release. \u201cThe strength of this study is that it\u2019s not a clinical trial, with ideal patients \u2014 it\u2019s a big study, from the real world.\u201d\n\nSuicide Prevention Day is meant to curb the 800,000 suicides that occur around the world each year.\n\nSource: Popovic D, Vieta E, Azorin J, Bowden C, Young A, Perugi G.
