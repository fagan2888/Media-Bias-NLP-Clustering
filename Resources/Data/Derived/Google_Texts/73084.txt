ARLINGTON, Texas — Alabama will start its season with a new quarterback in the NFL stadium where Blake Sims and the Crimson Tide wanted to be last January.

The third-ranked Tide plays its opener Saturday night against No. 20 Wisconsin in the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium. That is where Ohio State won the national championship game after first beating SEC champ Alabama in a College Football Playoff semifinal at the Sugar Bowl.

Since three national titles in a four-season span, Alabama has now gone consecutive seasons without even winning a bowl game.

“The biggest question that I have might not get answered in this game, but over the course of time, is the dynamics of Alabama football have changed a little bit over the last couple of years. And I’ve been anxious to get back to what we used to do,” coach Nick Saban said. “Identity is not something that you inherit or assume or get from somebody else.”

There are three options to replace Sims, but Alabama’s starter might not be known until the first snap of the game. There is a chance that Jake Coker, Cooper Bateman and Alec Morris could all play at some point.

Wisconsin, which last season won the Big Ten West Division title during its third 11-win season in five years, is settled at quarterback with Joel Stave. Running back Corey Clement takes over for Heisman finalist Melvin Gordon, and already with seven 100-yard rushing games in his career. The Badgers play their first game under coach Paul Chryst.
