The super rich are passionate about their supercars, but Lamborghini owner Gino Gargiulo's passion for Lambos runs deeper than most.

The producers of CNBC's "Secret Lives of the Super Rich" wanted to know which Lambo was faster, so they set up the first-ever Lambo vs. Lamboat race to find out.

The race takes place in Miami (where else?) and which Lambo wins will be broadcast in the season premiere of "Secret Lives of the Super Rich" on Tuesday, June 10, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. May the best Lambo win.
