The former Texas governor has even decided to use one of Reagan\u2019s old campaign theme songs.\n\nLast Thursday, at an event in Washington D.C., Perry walked onto the stage to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s iconic 1984 single, \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d About thirty years ago this song peaked at #9 on the Billboard charts and it continues to be a quintessential American anthem and a crowd favorite at Springsteen concerts.\n\nLike Reagan in 1984, Rick Perry and his staff seem to have no clue about the song\u2019s meaning. Anyone who listens carefully to the lyrics of \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d will quickly realize that there is little about the song that reflects conservative values.\n\n\u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is about veterans living in the wake of Vietnam War. The first verse describes a veteran who can\u2019t find a job when he returns home. He is rejected by potential employers so many times that he ends up like a \u201cdog who has been beat too much\u201d until he \u201cspends half his life just covering up.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen also sings about a fictional \u201cbrother\u201d who was killed while fighting the Vietcong. He\u2019s dead, but they\u2019re \u201cstill there,\u201d while the woman who he loved is left only with a picture.\n\nLike most Springsteen songs, \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is a lament for the American working class. It reminds us that Vietnam was a \u201crich man\u2019s war\u201d and a \u201cpoor man\u2019s fight.\u201d This is a protest song. It is a song of tragedy. It tells stories of young men who sacrificed themselves for their country and got nothing in return.\n\nOn Sept. 19, 1984, a few months before his overwhelming victory over Walter Mondale, Reagan made a campaign stop in Hammonton, New Jersey, a rural and hardscrabble community with a large Italian-American population. It was a perfect place to test out his new theme song, \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nAfter the song blared over the loudspeakers, Reagan stepped up to the podium and said: \u201cAmerica\u2019s future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts; it rests in the message of hope in songs so many young Americans admire: New Jersey\u2019s own Bruce Springsteen. And helping you make those dreams come true is what this job of mine is all about.\u201d\n\nOn one level, Reagan interpreted Springsteen correctly. A lot of his music is about the way ordinary Americans yearn to live the American Dream. This theme in Springsteen\u2019s music is what attracted conservative columnist George Will to bring The Boss\u2019s songs to the attention of the Reagan re-election team in the first place.\n\nBut \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is also a song about what Springsteen has recently described as the large gap between American reality and the American Dream. The song is more about the tragic side of American life than the sunny pursuits of happiness that politicians, especially conservative politicians, like to talk about on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cBorn in the U.S.A.,\u201d with Max Weinberg\u2019s drum blasts and Springsteen\u2019s rugged voice, is a musical assault on the purveyors of the American dream. It reminds us that for many people in American history the dream has been more like an illusion.\n\nSpringsteen heard about the way Reagan was using his song and he lashed back. Two days later, while playing a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen paused from the music to say few words of introduction for \u201cJohnny 99,\u201d a song about an unemployed New Jersey autoworker. \u201cJohnny 99\u201d is a cut from Nebraska, one of Springsteen\u2019s darker albums. It is filled with songs that are about brokenness, hardship and death.\n\nBefore he played \u201cJohnny 99\u201d that night, Springsteen referenced Reagan\u2019s Hammonton speech: \u201cThe President was mentioning my name the other day, and I kinda got to wondering what his favorite album must have been. I don\u2019t think it was the Nebraska album. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been listening to that one.\u201d\n\nThe chorus of \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d may send chills of inspiration up the spines of Rick Perry supporters, but the former Texas governor should probably think twice about using it in any more appearances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the last several GOP presidential primaries are any indication, nearly every candidate for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination in 2016 will claim to be a follower of Ronald Reagan.\nRick Perry,...", "title": "Why Rick Perry Should Think Twice Before He Makes &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; His Theme Song | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/02/14/why_rick_perry_should_think_twice_before_he_makes_born_in_the_usa_his_theme_song_125604.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/283313_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "If the last several GOP presidential primaries are any indication, nearly every candidate for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination in 2016 will claim to be a follower of Ronald Reagan.\nRick Perry,...", "title": "Why Rick Perry Should Think Twice Before He Makes &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; His Theme Song | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Why Rick Perry Should Think Twice Before He Makes &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; His Theme Song | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Ronald Reagan,Rick Perry,Bruce Springsteen,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Like most Springsteen songs, \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is a lament for the American working class.\nA lot of his music is about the way ordinary Americans yearn to live the American Dream.\nBut \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is also a song about what Springsteen has recently described as the large gap between American reality and the American Dream.\nLike Reagan in 1984, Rick Perry and his staff seem to have no clue about the song\u2019s meaning.\n\u201cBorn in the U.S.A.,\u201d with Max Weinberg\u2019s drum blasts and Springsteen\u2019s rugged voice, is a musical assault on the purveyors of the American dream."}
