Alex Pesek was treated at a hospital in Klamath Falls, Ore., and released.\n\n\u201cWe always thought she was the best of us \u2014 the least judgmental, the most outgoing,\u201d said Cara Pesek of Lincoln, a World-Herald staff writer.\n\n\u201cShe was really funny. She had so many friends. She was outgoing but humble.\u201d\n\nMari, Alex and Cara Pesek did the Bicycle Ride Across Nebraska in 2010. Mari, Alex and sister Anne Pesek Taylor of Salt Lake City bicycled through Montana in 2009.\n\nThis year, Cara, Alex, Mari and Anne spent a weekend together in February at Mari's home.\n\n\u201cWe were all really close. We tried to take a sibling vacation trip together every summer,\u201d Cara Pesek said.\n\nMari Pesek graduated in 2006 from East Butler High School in Brainard, Neb. She was on the 2004-05 state champion cross country team. She graduated in 2010 with a degree in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nWhile at UNL, she was part of an undergraduate research program known as UCARE. She spent spring break one year sifting through piles of cool, damp leaves, hunting for wolf spiders.\n\nIn a 2010 World-Herald interview about the project, Mari Pesek said: \u201cWorking with spiders has taught me that I can work with a lot of different animals. And maybe not the kinds of animals that you think are so cute and fuzzy.\u201d\n\nThe interest in spiders continued after graduation. She kept pet spiders \u2014 tarantulas, wolfs and others, Cara Pesek said.\n\nIn August, Mari Pesek received a master's degree in prairie ecology from the University of Kansas in Lawrence.\n\n\u201cShe was still kind of deciding what she was going to do,\u201d Cara Pesek said. \u201cMari was very ecologically minded. She was very conscious of her place and everything's place in the world.\u201d\n\nBesides her siblings, Mari Pesek is survived by her parents, Tom and Gretchen Pesek of Brainard, and boyfriend Joe Link of Lawrence.\n\nThe rosary will be said at 7 p.m. Monday at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Brainard. A funeral Mass will begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the same church.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Sister's untimely death leaves absence for \"really close\" siblings.", "title": "UNL grad, researcher Mari Pesek, 25, loved the outdoors", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/unl-grad-researcher-mari-pesek-loved-the-outdoors/article_a4052d3e-75c6-5fc3-8843-1ab27b21a33d.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/e8/9e8a92c8-0a31-5435-b897-77320ab18f08/53330d33096d4.image.jpg", "height": 506}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Sister's untimely death leaves absence for \"really close\" siblings.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2f7\"", "article_summary": "She and her brother Alex Pesek of Lincoln had just finished hiking the John Muir Trail in California on Sept. 7.\nAlex Pesek was treated at a hospital in Klamath Falls, Ore., and released.\nThis year, Cara, Alex, Mari and Anne spent a weekend together in February at Mari's home.\nIn August, Mari Pesek received a master's degree in prairie ecology from the University of Kansas in Lawrence.\n\u201cShe was still kind of deciding what she was going to do,\u201d Cara Pesek said."}
