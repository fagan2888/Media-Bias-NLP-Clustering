Verrilli Jr.\n\nIn addition, he said, the nuns would need to send a copy of the certification to an entity that administers their health plan, Christian Brothers Services.\n\nOn Tuesday night, hours before the contraceptive coverage requirements were to take effect, Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration from enforcing them with respect to the nuns and certain other religious groups. The Little Sisters of the Poor operate nursing homes for poor people in the United States and around the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its filing with the court on Friday, the administration said the nuns \u201chave no legal basis to challenge the self-certification requirement or to complain that it involves them in the process of providing contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nIf the nuns sign the certification required by federal rules, the administration said, neither they nor their health plan nor the entity that manages their health plan will be under any legal obligation to provide coverage of birth control.\n\n\u201cWith the stroke of their own pen,\u201d Mr. Verrilli said, the nuns \u201ccan secure for themselves the relief they seek from this court.\u201d Accordingly, he said, the court should lift the stay imposed by Justice Sotomayor.\n\nThe nuns disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe government demands that the Little Sisters of the Poor sign a permission slip for abortion drugs and contraceptives, or pay millions of dollars in fines,\u201d said Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represented the nuns in the lawsuit. \u201cThe sisters believe that doing that violates their faith.\u201d\n\nEric C. Rassbach, a deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund, said the relief offered by the government was not a complete exemption. By signing the form, he said, the nuns would be \u201cdesignating someone else to provide the contraceptive drugs and devices\u201d to which they object.\n\n\u201cIt makes them complicit,\u201d Mr. Rassbach said. The nuns do not want to sign the form because it would \u201cauthorize and designate\u201d the administrators of their health plan, including Express Scripts, to provide contraceptives, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters and other applicants cannot execute the form because they cannot deputize a third party to sin on their behalf,\u201d the nuns said in a reply brief filed Friday six hours after the government filed. The nuns said that they \u201cface ruinous fines for their religious refusal to sign the forms,\u201d and that this threat was a substantial burden on their exercise of religion.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration said Friday that it could not compel Christian Brothers Services to provide contraceptive coverage to employees of the Little Sisters nursing homes. In any event, it said, the Christian Brothers company does not intend to provide such coverage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, the Obama administration said that the Affordable Care Act did not really impose an \u201cemployer mandate.\u201d\n\nThe birth control requirements \u201capply only if an employer offers a group health plan,\u201d the administration said in its brief.\n\n\u201cEmployers, however, are not required to offer group health plans in the first place,\u201d the brief continued. \u201cLarge employers (those with more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees) face a potential tax if they do not provide coverage, but that gives them a choice between two legal options: provide a group health plan or risk payment of the tax.\u201d\n\nMr. Verrilli\u2019s brief said that the certification form would exempt the nuns from any \u201crequirement to furnish or pay for contraceptive coverage (and shield them from any tax liability for not doing so).\u201d In addition, it said, \u201cemployees of the nursing homes they operate will not receive such coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertification would result in the complete denial of coverage for the drugs and devices to which applicants object,\u201d the brief said.\n\nThe nuns unsuccessfully challenged the Obama administration rules in the Federal District Court in Denver, where they operate a nursing home. They are now seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the rules while they pursue their case in the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. The circuit court declined earlier this week to grant such an injunction.\n\nThe Little Sisters\u2019 lawsuit is one of many challenging the contraceptive coverage requirement. Supporters of the requirement said the litigation did not affect most Americans.\n\n\u201cToday, 27 million women have access to birth control without a co-payment under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cThat\u2019s not affected by the Supreme Court reviewing the administrative mechanism that religious groups can use to opt out of covering birth control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140103114220, "twitter": {"description": "The Justice Department said the requirements for birth control coverage did not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on an order of Roman Catholic nuns who challenged them.", "title": "Justices Are Asked to Reject Nuns\u2019 Challenge to Health Law", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-court-to-reject-nuns-health-law-challenge.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002631390"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-court-to-reject-nuns-health-law-challenge.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002631390", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-court-to-reject-nuns-health-law-challenge.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Justices Are Asked to Reject Nuns\u2019 Challenge to Health Law", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 3, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Justice Department", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Nuns,Birth Control and Family Planning,Little Sisters of the Poor,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Roman Catholic Church,Supreme Court (US),Justice Department", "news_keywords": "Nun", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Justice Department said the requirements for birth control coverage did not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on an order of Roman Catholic nuns who challenged them.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The Justice Department said the requirements for birth control coverage did not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on an order of Roman Catholic nuns who challenged them.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-01-31", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Justice Department", "published": "2014-01-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "04contraception", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140131000015, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-court-to-reject-nuns-health-law-challenge.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Justice Department said the requirements for birth control coverage did not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on an order of Roman Catholic nuns who challenged them.", "title": "Justices Are Asked to Reject Nuns\u2019 Challenge to Health Law"}, "pdate": 20140103, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002631390, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Justices Are Asked to Reject Nuns\u2019 Challenge to Health Law", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The Little Sisters of the Poor operate nursing homes for poor people in the United States and around the world.\nThe Little Sisters\u2019 lawsuit is one of many challenging the contraceptive coverage requirement.\nHowever, the Obama administration said Friday that it could not compel Christian Brothers Services to provide contraceptive coverage to employees of the Little Sisters nursing homes.\nIn addition, he said, the nuns would need to send a copy of the certification to an entity that administers their health plan, Christian Brothers Services.\nThe nuns unsuccessfully challenged the Obama administration rules in the Federal District Court in Denver, where they operate a nursing home."}
