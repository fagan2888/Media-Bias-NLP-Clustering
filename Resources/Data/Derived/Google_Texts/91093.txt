Orange Park, FL---The Niceville Eagles are once again in the 7A State Semifinals. Coach John Hicks and his team beating Oakleaf Friday night in the Region Finals, 35-0 the final.

The Eagles have now pitched back to back playoff shutouts, and have not let an opponent score in ten quarters.

The Eagles scored in a variety of ways Friday at Oakleaf. An early 80 yard pass play from Colby Tuthill to Chandler Wilson put them at the Oakleaf 4 yard line. Shi-Kim Coward then carried it in from the 4 for the first score.

In the second quarter, after the Knights punter dropped his knee fielding a snap at his own 6, Tuthill connected with Eli Stove for a two yard touchdown pass. That made it 14-0, a lead Niceville took into the half.

In the third quarter, Stove went 85 yards on an end around to make it 21-0. A Tuthill touchdown pass would later extend that third quarter lead to 28-0.

Then in the 4th, Chase Outzen would take a punt at the Oaklead 45 and carry it in. That capped the scoring.

The Eagles, now 11-2, move on to face Osceola down in the Orlando area next Friday for the right to play in the 7A State Title game.

Niceville hoping for back to back trips to the championship game. They lost to Dwyer in the 2013 title game.
