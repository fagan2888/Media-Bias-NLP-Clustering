Ariel Zambelich for The Wall Street Journal\n\nTuesday marks the first day that Food and Drug Administration rules dictating the amount of gluten that can be contained in food labeled \u201cgluten free\u201d formally take effect.\n\nFor the average person, 20 parts per million may seem like an extreme level of exactitude. But for the some 3 million Americans with the autoimmune disorder celiac disease, even the tiniest amount of gluten proteins\u2014found in wheat, barley and rye\u2014can cause pain.\n\nFor that reason, the FDA started in 2007 drafting the rules governing \u201cgluten free\u201d foods. They went through comments and revisions before being finalized last year at the level of less than 20 parts per million of gluten, with a 1-year grace period for companies to prepare. As of Tuesday, those that don\u2019t comply will be deemed misbranded and subject to regulatory action.\n\nAlready, gluten-free foods have swept grocery shelves over the past few years. More non-celiac consumers have come to believe they have less-severe intolerances to gluten, or have turned to gluten-free foods as a form of dieting, and food makers are catering to them with reformulated gluten-free versions of everything from cereal to chicken nuggets, and by labeling foods that are naturally gluten free to boost sales. Sales of foods labeled gluten-free rose 16% in the year ended Feb. 15th, reaching $23.34 billion, according to Nielsen.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t only the food makers that are trying to tap into demand for gluten-free products. World Centric, a 10-year-old company that makes environmentally friendly paper goods, touts that its paper plates and toilet paper also are gluten free. It says the plates are made from wheatstraw fiber, which comes from the stalks of the wheat plants, and the stalks do not store gluten. \u201cThose are stored in the grains, and our products do not contain gluten or allergens,\u201d its website says, noting that it meets the new FDA standards for gluten-free, which the packaging advertises.\n\nNo, World Centric doesn\u2019t expect people to eat its toilet paper. They\u2019re responding to consumers who believe\u2014and post on message boards for people with celiac disease\u2014that for people highly intolerant of gluten, even coming in contact with the protein on their skin can cause harm. Most medical experts say gluten can\u2019t be absorbed through the skin, but consumers who share self-described horror stories involving paper products with gluten have fueled a sense that it could be dangerous for at least some people to even touch products containing gluten. One website that offers advice on avoiding gluten even lists dish soap as a possible culprit.\n\nThe FDA says it typically doesn\u2019t have the manpower to actively regulate items cups and plates, but it does regulate \u201cfood contact substances,\u201d including packaging and dinnerware, and will act if there is suspicion of harm.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New FDA rules covering food labeled \"gluten free\" are now in effect, and companies wanting to stay out of trouble need to be measuring their gluten levels in parts per million.", "title": "Call Your Food Gluten Free?
