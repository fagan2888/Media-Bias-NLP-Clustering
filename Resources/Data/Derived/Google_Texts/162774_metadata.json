( Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer )\n\nDear Johnnie: I would like to know if the city has a set schedule for the street sweeping service. If I knew the day they were to be in my neighborhood, I would make sure not to park my car on the curb. Thanks for your information. \u2014 Beverly\n\nDear Beverly: The city does have a set schedule for street sweeping \u2014 and it's spring, summer and fall.\n\nI learned from Holly Milne that the city tried out a notification system this spring, with notice given via the Times-Call, the city website and social media \u2014 shame on me for not knowing that already \u2014 and with signs posted along streets 24 hours in advance of sweeping.\n\n\"Results of this trial were mixed, and so at this time it is not clear that pre-notification brings significant benefits to the program - especially considering the expense and time required,\" Milne wrote in an email.\n\nSo, Beverly, the best I can do is direct you to every other bit of information the city has about its street-sweeping program, which can be found at bit.ly/sweepinglongmont. That link includes an explanation of limited public notification.\n\nSend questions to johnnie@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_28605170/johnnie-st-vrain-city-longmont-tried-street-sweeping", "modificationDate": "2015-08-07T20:11:19-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0807/20150807__10TCAJSVw~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-08-09T01:00:00-0600", "description": "Dear Johnnie: I would like to know if the city has a set schedule for the street sweeping service.
