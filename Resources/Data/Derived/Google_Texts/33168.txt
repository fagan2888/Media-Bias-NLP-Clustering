Ben Carson, the retired Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon and conservative activist, may be getting a jump on the rest of the Republican presidential field for 2016 by introducing himself to voters in a video, ABC News and the Washington Times report.

Carson, who has previously expressed an interest in running for president, plans to air a 40-minute video this weekend in 22 states and in Washington, according to the reports.

The video reportedly will tell the story of Carson's rise from his birth to a single mother in Detroit to a nearly-40-year career at Hopkins, where he retired in 2013 as chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He became famous for his work separating conjoined twins.

The video's title: "A Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America."

According to the Washington Times, the video will be produced by conservative commentator Armstrong Williams, Carson's manager and owner of the production company that plans to pay for the air time.

Carson, who is African-American, is known as a staunch opponent of President Obama's Affordable Care Act and an advocate of a flat tax. In February he topped the field in a Baltimore Sun poll that also asked about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

After retiring Carson became a Fox News commentator. Last year he alleged that he became a target of an Internal Revenue Service audit because of his vocal opposition to Obama. Earlier last year, he withdrew as Hopkins' commencement speaker complained about a speech in which he compared gay people to pedophiles. He later apologized for his words but not his views on same-sex marriage.

Carson, 63, is an outspoken social conservative who bases many of his policy positions, such as opposing progresive taxation and favoring spanking as a way to discipline children, on his strict interpretation of the Bible.
