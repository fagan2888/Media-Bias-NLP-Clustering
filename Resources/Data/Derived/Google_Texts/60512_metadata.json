The website then provided information about public and private insurance programs, sorted by zipcode.\n\nElijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight panel, chastised Issa for the threat and for ignoring Park's offer to testify in December.\n\n\"I am personally very concerned that the Chairman's actions may have a direct and negative impact on efforts to fix HealthCare.gov, which would aggravate the problem rather than help solve it,\" Cummings said in a statement.\n\nIssa is a strong critic of the Obama administration. He has launched a number of probes, including one into the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, and a \"Fast and Furious\" investigation into a failed U.S. government sting operation involving gun running.\n\nThe hearing next week could shed light on what role various officials played in developing the site's technology. So far, the project appears to have been spread out among offices and federal contractors without strong oversight.\n\nOther officials due to appear include Steve VanRoekel, chief information officer at the White House and Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, was passed in 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. It requires most Americans to have health insurance beginning Jan. 1 or pay a fine.\n\nRepublicans see the Democratic president's program as a costly expansion of government and fear Obamacare is too complicated and expensive to work.
