That, anyway, is what he told You\u2019re the Boss readers when he commented on a recent post about determining whether a company is subject to the law\u2019s employer mandate. \u201cI can promise we won\u2019t go over 49 employees, so A.C.A. will affect employment, at least by one company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMine.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Hawkins told a different story when I contacted him a few days later to talk about his comment. \u201cNext year,\u201d he said, if he and his partner\u2019s new idea works out, \u201cthat\u2019s when we\u2019ll run into the A.C.A.\u201d He has 21 employees now.\n\nMr. Hawkins and his partner, Jonathan Fishbeck, met after they had both been hit hard by the recession. Mr. Hawkins had been laid off from his job as a salesman, he said, after it had become clear that most of his customers were going under. Mr. Fishbeck was a builder on borrowed time as clients started canceling their contracts. The two became friendly, and Mr. Hawkins urged Mr. Fishbeck to change his company\u2019s name, suggesting BuilderFish. And soon, though Mr. Hawkins knew nothing about construction, they joined forces.\n\nSince 2010, they have been building luxury homes in Washington\u2019s Virginia suburbs. Besides those 21 employees, the company makes use of perhaps 100 or more subcontractors that Mr. Hawkins calls \u201cteammates.\u201d (Lawyers warn that businesses like BuilderFish that rely on subcontractors ought to tread carefully: They could find themselves subject to the mandate \u2014 and liable for penalties, even retroactively \u2014 should the Internal Revenue Service conclude that the subcontractors are actually misclassified employees. \u201cWe are very conscious of the trouble we could get in,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything without our lawyer\u2019s advice on that.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWe have been thinking about and dealing with the Affordable Care Act since we first heard about it,\u201d said Mr. Hawkins, who added that he and his partner have wanted to offer insurance \u201cfrom Day 1. We\u2019ve wanted to insure ourselves.\u201d But when they\u2019ve looked at the math \u2014 first late last year and then again early this year \u2014 and repriced a completed project with and without health insurance, they concluded they could not absorb the overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re already premium priced,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said.\n\nInstead, the company gives employees a lump sum they can use to purchase insurance if they so choose. (Mr. Hawkins would not elaborate on any of the calculations they\u2019ve made to inform their thinking so far on offering health insurance \u2014 he said that nobody at the company could remember the exact figures.) But this arrangement may not last.\n\nMr. Hawkins and Mr. Fishbeck aim to transform BuilderFish from a company that, in addition to designing and building large houses and estates, manages every aspect of the finished property for the new homeowners. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one BuilderFish rep that takes care of everything,\u201d he said, from landscaping and maintenance to hiring household staff. The company has made a considerable investment in developing computer software to help manage the operation.\n\nBut without health insurance, he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t attract the best employees. People are scared to take a chance if they don\u2019t have medical.\u201d For now, though, his advisers have told him to wait. \u201cThey say, \u2018Nothing has changed, don\u2019t do anything. Let others feel the pain while it works itself out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut he continued: \u201cWe are big believers in spending money to make money. So when we get to the point where it will hold back our success, we\u2019ll have to do it. At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to have to shimmy out on that branch, but in the meantime we\u2019re going to try to make do with less than 49 employees.\u201d\n\nMr. Hawkins also said that this conversation had prompted his partner to take a fresh look at offering health insurance now. \u201cWe\u2019re re-examining as a result of your email, so that\u2019s a good thing if we CAN actually afford,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nAll of which raises a question: If Mr. Hawkins knew that his company might be ready to expand beyond 50 employees as soon as next year and if he was willing to reconsider offering health insurance before then, what moved him to leave such a definitive comment on our post? He said it was an expression of his frustration with just how complex the Affordable Care Act is and how the resulting confusion has paralyzed his company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typical government,\u201d said Mr. Hawkins, who claims libertarian leanings but not any particular animosity toward President Obama. \u201cThey\u2019re making it more convoluted by the day. It\u2019s hard to understand.\n\n\u201cMy time is at a premium. I get mad when I am spending effort and brain cells trying to understand something and I\u2019m going backwards. My progress at best has been like a treadmill. I\u2019m making good time and not getting anywhere. I\u2019m educated, and I can figure most things out. I can\u2019t figure this out.\n\n\u201cAnd it makes me feel dumb. And it keeps me from doing what I want to do, which is hire more people and offer them medical \u2014 to take care of them, so they\u2019re not worried about that.\u201d\n\nMr. Hawkins promised to keep us informed. When he does, we\u2019ll update his story.
