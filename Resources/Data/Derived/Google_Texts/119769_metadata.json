We waited around 45 minutes, then heard the name \u201cBergoglio\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d was my first reaction. I looked around in confusion. CNN Rome cameraman Alessandro Gentile shrugged his shoulders, as did producer Livia Borghese. Others around us, with the exception of an older English woman, who must have been an amateur Vaticanista, were equally mystified.\n\nIn the nine months since that night in March, we\u2019ve come to know Jorge Bergoglio, otherwise known as Pope Francis. He keeps us busy almost every day, with his latest pronouncement, his latest gestures, large and small. I have a pile of books about Francis on my desk. The Google news alert I set up months ago for \u201cPope Francis\u201d now fills up my e-mail box, exceeding other alerts for Italy, Rome, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Israel, Iran, etc. I regularly listen to podcasts about Francis on my phone.\n\nFor foreign journalists based in Rome, Pope Francis has in fact been our \u201cperson of the year\u201d long before Time magazine settled on him. He quickly eclipsed the noisy, chaotic game of musical chairs called Italian politics. And Francis has turned out to be a balm for those who for year after year had to cover flamboyant scandal-drenched former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as their like-it-or-not Italian \u201cperson of the year.\u201d\n\nAt home, my lapsed Catholic Italian wife has put Francis\u2019 picture on the wall. Italians are notoriously cynical when it comes to public figures, but ask them about \u201cPapa Francesco\u201d and their reaction is almost invariably positive and effusive.\n\n\u201cHe has a humble heart, he\u2019s great, he\u2019s beautiful,\u201d gushed a giddy middle-aged woman from the Naples area when we asked her Wednesday what she thought of Francis becoming Time\u2019s Person of the Year.\n\nAnd regardless of who wins the title next year, at this rate we can assume, at least here in Rome, Francis will be person of the year for several years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Ben Wedeman, CNN ROME (CNN)\u00a0-- When the white smoke billowed from the chimney in the Sistine Chapel, we ran, along with thousands of others, up the Via della Conciliazione to Saint Peter\u2019s Square to hear the announcement.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Pope Francis is 'person of the year': So what\u2019s new?", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/11/pope-francis-is-person-of-the-year-so-whats-new/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131211144826-time-cover-pope-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Ben Wedeman, CNN\r\n\r\nROME (CNN)\u00a0-- When the white smoke billowed from the chimney in the Sistine Chapel, we ran, along with thousands of others, up the Via della Conciliazione to Saint Peter\u2019s Square to hear the announcement.", "title": "Pope Francis is 'person of the year': So what\u2019s new?"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "catholic church, pope francis, jorge bergoglio, pope, pope francis, rome, time person of the year", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/11/pope-francis-is-person-of-the-year-so-whats-new/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd394f\"", "article_summary": "For foreign journalists based in Rome, Pope Francis has in fact been our \u201cperson of the year\u201d long before Time magazine settled on him.\nIn the nine months since that night in March, we\u2019ve come to know Jorge Bergoglio, otherwise known as Pope Francis.\nAnd regardless of who wins the title next year, at this rate we can assume, at least here in Rome, Francis will be person of the year for several years to come.\nThe Google news alert I set up months ago for \u201cPope Francis\u201d now fills up my e-mail box, exceeding other alerts for Italy, Rome, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Israel, Iran, etc.\nHe keeps us busy almost every day, with his latest pronouncement, his latest gestures, large and small."}
