You never know how hard it is until it registers on the gun. But it felt like I got pretty much all I could into it, and [you] just kind of hope for the best.\u201d\n\nFighting his nerves since he doesn\u2019t practice high-velocity shots, Weber missed the entire net on a 101.8-mph drive with his first attempt. That nullified that try.\n\nWashington Capitals star Alexander Ovechkin \u2014 who stole the show at Friday night\u2019s draft by pleading to be picked last so he would win a new car \u2014 had led the competition with a pair of 101.4-mph drives.\n\nBut then Weber stepped into his final shot to win the event.\n\nHe said it felt strange with the 6-foot-9 Chara \u2014 who holds the record of 108.8 mph set in 2012 \u2014 not participating.\n\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s the guy to beat all the time,\u201d Weber said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the big shot. Honestly, I was nervous because there\u2019s some guys out there that can rip it.\u201d\n\nThe team captained by Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno defeated one led by Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, 25-19. The teams meet in the 60th All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nA capacity crowd roared with laughter, booed former Columbus players such as New York Rangers star Rick Nash, and gave Weber a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cWe had a blast,\u201d Foligno said. \u201cThe boys did awesome. I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to go but we got off to a great start.\u201d\n\nThe other premier event at the skills competition featured Ryan Johansen of the hometown Blue Jackets winning the breakaway challenge.\n\nJohansen pulled Blue Jackets trainer Mike Vogt\u2019s 7-year-old son, Cole, out of the stands to score a goal to the delight of the crowd. In addition, the center endeared himself to Ohio State fans by pulling off his Blue Jackets sweater to reveal a No. 5 Ohio State football jersey \u2014 worn by injured star quarterback Braxton Miller \u2014 on his first shot.\n\nJohansen also employed a star-laden \u201cFlying V\u201d formation to the net on his third and final attempt.\n\n\u201cOn the ice we\u2019re out there goofing around, having fun, making each other laugh while showing our moves and skills \u2014 things we don\u2019t normally do on the ice,\u201d Johansen said. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed meeting these guys off the ice. It\u2019s amazing how similar we all are.\u201d\n\nMoments after Johansen and Cole Vogt scored their tandem goal, Philadelphia\u2019s Jake Voracek did exactly what Johansen did \u2014 except instead of a little boy he grabbed diminutive Calgary rookie Johnny Gaudreau and guided him toward scoring a goal.\n\nThe breakaway event began with St. Louis goalie Brian Elliott turning his back on an opposing player \u2014 Blues teammate Vladimir Tarasenko \u2014 and then taking a selfie of the two as the puck went into the net. The crowd again roared with laughter.\n\nOvechkin, who won the first three of the five times the breakaway has been held, struck out on three baseball swings off high passes from Tarasenko. Patrick Kane, who won in 2012 after donning Clark Kent glasses and a red Superman cape, didn\u2019t compete in the breakaway but had the fastest time in accuracy shooting.\n\nIn the fastest skater event, in which players were paired off and raced around the perimeter of the rink against the clock, Team Foligno went 5-0 \u2014 winning all four races and pocketing an extra point for Tampa Bay\u2019s Jonathan Drouin posting the fastest time of 13.103 seconds.\n\nToronto\u2019s Phil Kessel, who was dealt by Team Toews for Tyler Seguin on Friday in a duplicate of a real 2009 deal between Boston and Toronto, surprised many by edging the Dallas Stars star in the first speed pairing of the event.\n\nIn a matchup of Blackhawks teammates, Kane beat Toews by breaking four plates at the corners of a net almost 3 seconds faster \u2014 in a time of 13.529 \u2014 to push Team Foligno to a 10-1 lead through three events.\n\nThe two close friends shared a laugh later when they met at mid-ice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always competitive with each other in all aspects of the game,\u201d Toews said. \u201cTonight, he got the best of me. I had the chance to take it from him, and it just slipped away.
