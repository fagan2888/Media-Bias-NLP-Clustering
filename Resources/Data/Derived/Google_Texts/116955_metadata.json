A guaranteed supply of oil has bought a guaranteed supply of security. Ignoring autocratic practices and the export of Wahhabi extremism, Washington stubbornly dubs its ally \u201cmoderate.\u201d So tight is the trust thatU.S. special operators dip into Saudi petrodollars as a counterterrorism slush fund without a second thought. In a sea of chaos, goes the refrain, the kingdom is one state that\u2019s stable.\n\nBut is it?\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Now Includes Chemical Weapons\n\nIn fact, Saudi Arabia is no state at all. There are two ways to describe it: as a political enterprise with a clever but ultimately unsustainable business model, or so corrupt as to resemble in its functioning a vertically and horizontally integrated criminal organization. Either way, it can\u2019t last. It\u2019s past time U.S.decision-makers began planning for the collapse of the Saudi kingdom.\n\nIn recent conversations with military and other government personnel, we were startled at how startled they seemed at this prospect. Here\u2019s the analysis they should be working through.\n\nUnderstood one way, the Saudi king isCEO of a family business that converts oil into payoffs that buy political loyalty. They take two forms: cash handouts or commercial concessions for the increasingly numerous scions of the royal clan, and a modicum of public goods and employment opportunities for commoners. The coercive \u201cstick\u201d is supplied by brutal internal security services lavishly equipped with American equipment.\n\nThe U.S. has long counted on the ruling family having bottomless coffers of cash with which to rent loyalty. Even accounting today\u2019s low oil prices, and as Saudi officials step up arms purchases and military adventures in Yemen and elsewhere, Riyadh is hardly running out of funds.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Latest Weapons Sale to Iran Shifts the Balance of Mideast Power\n\nStill, expanded oil production in the face of such low prices\u2014until the Feb. 16 announcement of a Saudi-Russian freeze at very high January levels\u2014may reflect an urgent need for revenue as well as other strategic imperatives. Talk of a Saudi Aramco IPO similarly suggests a need for hard currency.\n\nA political market, moreover, functions according to demand as well as supply. What if the price of loyalty rises?\n\nIt appears that is just what\u2019s happening. King Salman had to spend lavishly to secure the allegiance of the notables who were pledged to the late King Abdullah. Here\u2019s what played out in two other countries when this kind of inflation hit. In South Sudan, an insatiable elite not only diverted the newly minted country\u2019s oil money to private pockets but also kept up their outsized demands when the money ran out, sparking a descent into chaos. The Somali government enjoys generous donor support, but is priced out of a very competitive political market by a host of other buyers\u2014with ideological, security or criminal agendas of their own.\n\nSuch comparisons may be offensive to Saudi leaders, but they are telling. If the loyalty price index keeps rising, the monarchy could face political insolvency.\n\nRelated: Saudi Arabia May Have Picked a Fight It Can\u2019t Win\n\nLooked at another way, the Saudi ruling elite is operating something like a sophisticated criminal enterprise, when populations everywhere are making insistent demands for government accountability. With its political and business elites interwoven in a monopolistic network, quantities of unaccountable cash leaving the country for private investments and lavish purchases abroad, and state functions bent to serve these objectives, Saudi Arabia might be compared to such kleptocracies as Viktor Yanukovich\u2019s Ukraine.\n\nIncreasingly, Saudi citizens are seeing themselves as just that: citizens, not subjects. In countries as diverse as Nigeria, Ukraine, Brazil, Moldova, and Malaysia, people are contesting criminalized government and impunity for public officials\u2014sometimes violently. In more than half a dozen countries in 2015, populations took to the streets to protest corruption. In three of them, heads of state are either threatened or have had to resign. Elsewhere, the same grievances have contributed to the expansion of jihadi movements or criminal organizations posing as Robin Hoods. Russia and China\u2019s external adventurism can at least partially be explained as an effort to re-channel their publics\u2018 dissatisfaction with the quality of governance.\n\nFor the moment, it is largely Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shiite minority that is voicing political demands. But the highly educated Sunni majority, with unprecedented exposure to the outside world, is unlikely to stay satisfied forever with a few favors doled out by geriatric rulers impervious to their input. And then there are the \u201cguest workers.\u201d Saudi officials, like those in other Gulf states, seem to think they can exploit an infinite supply of indigents grateful to work at whatever conditions. But citizens are now heavily outnumbered in their own countries by laborers who may soon begin claiming rights.\n\nFor decades, Riyadh has eased pressure by exporting its dissenters\u2014like Osama bin Laden\u2014fomenting extremism across the Muslim world. But that strategy can backfire: bin Laden\u2019s critique of Saudi corruption has been taken up by others and resonates among many Arabs. And King Salman (who is 80, by the way) does not display the dexterity of his half-brother Abdullah. He\u2019s reached for some of the familiar items in the autocrats\u2019 toolbox: executing dissidents, embarking on foreign wars, and whipping up sectarian rivalries to discredit Saudi Shiite demands and boost nationalist fervor. Each of these has grave risks.\n\nThere are a few ways things could go, as Salman\u2019s brittle grip on power begins cracking.\n\nOne is a factional struggle within the royal family, with the price of allegiance bid up beyond anyone\u2019s ability to pay in cash. Another is foreign war. With Saudi Arabia and Iran already confronting each other by proxy in Yemen and Syria, escalation is too easy. U.S. decision-makers should bear that danger in mind as they keep pressing for regional solutions to regional problems. A third scenario is insurrection\u2014either a non-violent uprising or a jihadi insurgency\u2014a result all too predictable given episodes throughout the region in recent years.\n\nThe U.S. keeps getting caught flat-footed when purportedly solid countries came apart. At the very least, and immediately, rigorous planning exercises should be executed, in which different scenarios and different potential U.S.actions to reduce the codependence and mitigate the risks can be tested. Most likely, and most dangerous, outcomes should be identified, and an energetic red team should shoot holes in the automatic-pilot thinking that has guided Washington policy to date.\n\n\u201cHope is not a policy\u201d is a hackneyed phrase. But choosing not to consider alternatives amounts to the same thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
