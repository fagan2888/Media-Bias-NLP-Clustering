He has Colorado\u2019s best goals-against average (2.49) and save percentage (.922).\n\nThe injury-riddled Avs also called up forward Paul Carey on Monday and forward Borna Rendulic on Tuesday, to round out the fourth line against the Predators. Roy originally said he would go with just 19 available players but the team chose differently and will give Rendulic, 22, his first shot in the NHL.\n\nRendulic played all his hockey in Croatia before this season.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov to miss a couple weeks; Avs call up Borna Rendulic", "title": "Semyon Varlamov to miss a couple weeks; Avs call up Borna Rendulic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/09/semyon-varlamov-to-miss-a-couple-weeks-avs-call-up-borna-rendulic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141206_B4_SP06HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141206_B4_SP06HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-09T12:11:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:28:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3fa\"", "article_summary": "Following the morning skate Tuesday, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said goalie Semyon Varlamov would miss a \u201ccouple weeks\u201d after an MRI detected a \u201cgroin problem\u201d on Monday.\nThe injury-riddled Avs also called up forward Paul Carey on Monday and forward Borna Rendulic on Tuesday, to round out the fourth line against the Predators.\nVarlamov will miss his 10th game with the same ailment Tuesday.\nRoy originally said he would go with just 19 available players but the team chose differently and will give Rendulic, 22, his first shot in the NHL.\nPickard will begin his third stint with the big club, playing in his eighth NHL game."}
