A Kansas woman tasked with helping consumers navigate the health insurance exchanges created under Obamacare has an outstanding warrant for her arrest, raising further questions about the federal government’s preparation for the law’s partial rollout earlier this month.

Rosilyn Wells, a full-time Affordable Care Act navigator in Lawrence, Kan., has an outstanding arrest warrant in neighboring Shawnee County for an unspecified crime, according to a list of wanted locals on the County Sheriff’s website.

The news was first reported by conservative website The Daily Caller, which also claimed Wells was behind on her taxes and was charged in 2007 with writing bad checks.

Wells did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite her alleged record, Wells gained employment as a navigator for the law, a job in which she is responsible for answering questions about the new online government exchanges designed to help provide affordable health insurance options.

That responsibility, however, could provide navigators like Wells with access to the personal financial details of the people they’re tasked with helping — a situation that various state authorities have warned could expose consumers to harm.

According to a House Oversight Committee report dated Sept. 18, a letter signed by the Attorneys General of 13 states said that the “consumer outreach initiatives,” including navigator positions, “‘are a privacy disaster waiting to happen’ because lax screening and supervision means that individuals ‘will have easy means to commit identity theft on consumers seeking enrollment assistance.’”

The news surrounding Wells marks the latest setback for a rollout of the new law that has experienced problems at every turn, including a glitch-filled debut of the government website designed to showcase the new insurance marketplace.
