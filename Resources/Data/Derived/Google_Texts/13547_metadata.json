My goal is to conclude this process no later than June 30.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s contract is set to expire on July 31, 2016. She says she would like to continue her work at the University, as she has many plans in mind for the institution.\n\n\u201cMy goal as president has been and will continue to be working to ensure that the University of Virginia remains one of the nation\u2019s finest institutions of higher education, and to enhance its excellence in teaching, research, patient care and public service,\u201d Sullivan said in an email.\n\nSullivan said she has two issues she would like to primarily focus on leading up to the University\u2019s bicentennial.\n\n\u201cFirst, the Cornerstone Plan, our strategic plan, is a guiding blueprint for our most important initiatives and priorities,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cSecond, because of the generational turnover in our work force, it is critical to recruit and retain the best possible faculty and staff. I believe we are making very good progress on both fronts, but there is still work that needs to be done to realize the important goals ahead for the University.\u201d\n\nFourth-year College student Meg Gould, student member of the Board of Visitors, said the review process for Sullivan\u2019s contract required input from a wide variety of University community members \u2014 including from Sullivan herself.\n\n\u201cThe Board is looking at the broad narrative of what President Sullivan has done or acted upon at the University over the past years,\u201d Gould said in an email. \u201cHer current contract extends until next June, so this contract discussion concerns the amount of time that her presidency will extend beyond that pre-determined date.\u201d\n\nGould said her position allows her to effectively provide an opinion on Sullivan\u2019s evaluation from the perspective of the student body.\n\n\u201cAs the student member, I am involved in the process as any Board member is, having had the opportunity to reach out to many students to gather a more grounded perspective outside of the Boardroom, as well as being fortunate to have the opportunity to voice a student perspective at the table for these discussions,\u201d Gould said.\n\nCurrent Board member Helen Dragas, former rector of the Board, said that while Board members are limited in ability to discuss personnel performance matters such as Sullivan\u2019s reinstatement, there are changes she would like to see made regarding administrative models and policies.\n\n\u201cI have made no secret of the imperative to craft sustainable, innovative and concrete plans that would make a University education available to Virginia\u2019s middle class without breaking a family\u2019s economic back,\u201d Dragas said in an email. \u201cI do not believe the administration\u2019s high tuition/high aid model that taxes middle class families accomplishes this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "fyija7dybln3trsnr4h76aml1s0lfayt-r6cgx8h7vvmo8wfhjd73ow5wqgb4-oz888lno-b6tf9in8ccg-nf0eacfq6m3chl2d7sw9hzdlvvxg7i1ja8hilhvuewa9n", "description": "UVA's premier student-operated independent news organization and Charlottesville's oldest daily newspaper.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"description": "The internal evaluation of University President Teresa Sullivan to determine whether to extend her current contract will likely come to a close on June 30, University Rector George Martin said.", "title": "Sullivan's contract under internal evaluation", "url": "http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2015/05/sullivan-contract-review", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.cav/12191_nssullivanmbronfinp.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cavalierdaily.com", "site": "@cavalierdaily", "card": "summary"}, "poweredby": "SNworks - Solutions by The State News", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13 11:55:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13 11:55:32"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "NEWSSullivan's contract under internal evaluationBoard of Visitors review to be completed in JuneThe internal evaluation of University President Teresa Sullivan to determine whether to extend her current contract will likely come to a close on June 30, University Rector George Martin said.\n\u201cConsistent with good board governance, the evaluation of the University President is a continuous, ongoing process,\u201d Martin said in an email.\nMy goal is to conclude this process no later than June 30.\u201dSullivan\u2019s contract is set to expire on July 31, 2016.\n\u201cHer current contract extends until next June, so this contract discussion concerns the amount of time that her presidency will extend beyond that pre-determined date.\u201dGould said her position allows her to effectively provide an opinion on Sullivan\u2019s evaluation from the perspective of the student body.\nCurrent Board member Helen Dragas, former rector of the Board, said that while Board members are limited in ability to discuss personnel performance matters such as Sullivan\u2019s reinstatement, there are changes she would like to see made regarding administrative models and policies."}
