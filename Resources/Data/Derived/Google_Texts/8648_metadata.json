The most recent news was less bad, but still not very good: \u201cChange in Kansas\u2019s uninsured rate lags other states,\u201d the nonprofit Kansas Health Institute news service reported on Aug. 11.\n\nNone of these headlines were incorrect, and the accompanying articles often made important points\u2014for example, that Kansas officials\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid, as the law envisioned, has limited the gains in the insured rate. But this grim picture of Kansas as a unique negative outlier is just one way to look at the story. In fact, the numbers deserve another look\u2014and while it\u2019s important to note that we don\u2019t have the whole story yet, it\u2019s possible that the state\u2019s uninsured rate has been improving more significantly than press coverage has indicated.\n\nThe discussion about Kansas\u2019 uninsured rate in the Obamacare era dates to the spring of 2014, when Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a Tea Party Republican from the state\u2019s 1st District, asserted that more Kansans were uninsured after the ACA took effect than before. The Washington Post, several local outlets, and CJR all soon debunked Huelskamp\u2019s claim. But that summer, a report from the Gallup Healthways survey, the source for much of the media coverage about uninsured rates in the state, seemed to confirm it. In its midyear survey, Gallup found that the state\u2019s uninsured rate had risen a shocking five percentage points since 2013\u2014from 12.5 percent to 17.6 percent. This unexpected result didn\u2019t quite create a firestorm of media attention, but it still drew more press coverage than any other recent piece of news about Kansas\u2019 uninsured.\n\nSix months later, Gallup released its full-year results for 2014, showing a 14.4 percent uninsured rate in Kansas. This result drew less coverage\u2014and what coverage there was emphasized the increase over 2013, rather than the decline from the midyear figure.\n\nThen, on Aug. 10, Gallup released the 2015 midyear results, showing that Kansas\u2019 uninsured rate had hit a new low in the survey of 11.3 percent\u2014a startling decline from the mid-2014 figure that drew a wave of coverage. This seems like good news, but I could find hardly any mention of the finding in the state\u2019s media, except for a report from the KHI news service, which focused not on the sharp turnaround from 2014 but the modest decline from 2013.\n\nComparing the new results to 2013 makes sense, because that\u2019s the year before the insurance exchanges set up by the law opened for business. But it also raises questions for Kansas, where that year was something of an anomaly in Gallup\u2019s findings: lower than results for the four preceding years, which ranged from 14.1 to 16.2 percent, and the following year, 2014, when it was 14.4 percent. As Dan Witters of Gallup Healthways told CJR last year, this could be one explanation for the magnitude of the apparent spike in the midyear 2014 result\u2014the 2013 number might have too low to begin with. If that\u2019s the case, and the true baseline was higher, then the latest finding, of an 11.3 percent uninsured rate, would represent a more substantial decline.\n\nOf course, that finding might be off to some degree, too. Still, as Witters points out, we have more to go on than just the last six months. Though Gallup doesn\u2019t release results just for the latter six months of the year, if the 2014 findings went from 17.6 percent at mid-year to 14.4 percent by the end of the year, then the figure for the last six months of the year must have been \u201cin the low 11s,\u201d Witters says. Thus we now have a full year\u2019s sample showing a result not much above 11 percent.\n\nAnd Gallup isn\u2019t the only survey showing a recent decline. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Health Interview Survey release from June shows the Kansas uninsured rate all the way down at 9 percent for 2014, after having been at 12.7 percent in 2013, 12.9 percent in 2012, and 15.2 percent in 2011. I haven\u2019t seen any media coverage of this poll result.\n\nIf accurate, the latest findings on Kansas from Gallup and the CDC do seem to track with what is happening in other states. As Gallup has found, in states like Kansas that have not expanded Medicaid or set up state exchanges, insurance rolls did not grow as quickly or as dramatically as in states that did take those steps\u2014but they have grown nonetheless. \u201cThe states that did both got out of the gates a lot faster than the states that didn\u2019t,\u201d Witters says. \u201cThat trend has now leveled off; the rate of decline is now the same for both groups. Kansas is kind of a good illustration of that.\u201d He added: \u201cWhatever we were picking up in the beginning of 2014, that\u2019s now in the rearview mirror.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019ve looked at some of the data here from an angle that highlights a potential decline in the state\u2019s uninsured rate\u2014a counterpoint to press coverage that has often come from the opposite perspective. Meanwhile, at least one expert observer is counseling caution. \u201cWith Gallup, the amount of change in the numbers is within the margin of error,\u201d KHI senior analyst Scott Brunner wrote in an email. (The margin of error for the 2015 midyear result, Witters says, was 2.5 percentage points.) Brunner said he couldn\u2019t speak to the CDC survey without knowing the sample size for Kansas. (I posed this question and others about the survey to the CDC, but was told that the survey expert was out of town.)\n\nBut, Brunner promised, more data is on the way. \u201cWhat we are waiting for is the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey results in September,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThose are the sources we have relied on for our estimates. The sample size in Kansas is large enough to make clear comparisons over time.\u201d\n\nWhen that data comes out, it won\u2019t tell us everything we want to know about the current moment: the ACS operates on a lag, so the soon-to-be-released figure will be for 2014. Still, it may tell us a lot about what happened in Kansas after the Affordable Care Act went into full effect. Whether the number is up, down, or flat, here\u2019s hoping reporters in the state are paying attention.\n\nLove news about local news?
