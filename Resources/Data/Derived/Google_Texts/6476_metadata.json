She said she didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s boisterous and bullying approach.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:34 p.m.\n\nJust a few hours are left for Idaho Republicans to cast their ballots for who they would like to see as their party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe polls close at 8 p.m. local time. Because the northern half of the state is in the Pacific time zone and the southern half is in the Mountain time zone, election workers won\u2019t start counting votes until 9 p.m. Mountain.\n\nFifteen counties still count at least some of their paper ballots by hand. Ada County \u2014 Idaho\u2019s most populated county \u2014 is using new optical scan equipment for counting the votes, which officials hope will speed up the process.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:50 p.m.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Idaho website contains wording copied from a 2012 Boise State Public Radio story with no attribution.\n\nAs first reported by Idaho Reports, the radio station\u2019s story contains information on where and how to vote. It also quotes then-Idaho Republican Party executive director Jonathan Park and Ada County Chief Deputy Clerk Phil McGrane.\n\nPeter Morrill, the radio station\u2019s interim general manager, says no one from the Trump campaign requested permission to use the story.\n\n\u201cWe would have denied their request if they asked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a four year old story. We are very concerned about people looking at that story that does not reflect today\u2019s election changes.\u201d\n\nHe has reached out to the campaign through the Idaho Republican Party to remove the plagiarized copy immediately.\n\nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:28 p.m.\n\nVeronica Alotta, a nurse from the Boise region, doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act is working and fears the health care industry is controlled by pharmaceutical and insurance companies. She wants a president who will change that.\n\n\u201cI think what matters to me is something different right now, so my choice is going to be with Donald Trump,\u201d Alotta said while she waited at a local polling site.\n\nAlotta and members of her extended family are all middle class, Alotta said, and they are frustrated because they feel like they don\u2019t have a voice.\n\n\u201cYou can serve God or you can serve money, and most people in this country are serving money,\u201d she said.\n\nThat makes Trump appealing, Alotta said, because he\u2019s paying his own way and she doesn\u2019t want someone who is bought.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:53 p.m.\n\nSome voters in Idaho\u2019s GOP presidential primary are already facing long lines at the polls.\n\nElection workers at one site in Garden City \u2014 near the state\u2019s capitol of Boise \u2014 said they had people waiting in line when the doors opened at 8 a.m. Another polling station in Nampa had to call in extra workers to help after more voters than expected showed up to cast their ballots.\n\nThe primary is closed to everyone except for registered members of the Republican party. Idaho residents can register as Republican at the polls, however, right until they close at 8 p.m.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThousands of Idaho Republicans are expected to head to the polls Tuesday to take part in the state\u2019s GOP presidential primary.\n\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are competing for Idaho\u2019s 32 delegates. Mississippi also is holding its primaries Tuesday, while Hawaii will have its GOP presidential caucuses.\n\nIdaho has far fewer delegates than states like Texas, which boasts 155. But it plays a bigger role in the GOP presidential selection this year because state lawmakers bumped up the primary from May to March.\n\nIdaho\u2019s Republican primary is open only to GOP-registered voters.\n\nThe Constitution Party also holds its primary Tuesday. Like the GOP event, Idahoans must be registered member of the Constitution Party to participate.\n\nThe Idaho Democrats will caucus March 22.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Idaho\u2019s Republican presidential primary (all times Mountain Standard Time):", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Post Register", "description": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Idaho\u2019s Republican presidential primary (all times Mountain Standard Time):", "title": "The Latest: Closing time near in Idaho GOP primary", "url": "http://www.postregister.com/articles/featured-news/2016/03/08/latest-closing-time-near-idaho-gop-primary", "image": "http://www.postregister.com/sites/default/files/field/image/849482_web1_849482-72de391f819a4aa58be100926d6bd1d9.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-08T20:33:28-07:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-08T20:33:28-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T20:33:28-07:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Idaho\u2019s Republican presidential primary (all times Mountain Standard Time):8:11 p.m.\nSome voters in Idaho\u2019s GOP presidential primary are already facing long lines at the polls.\nIdaho\u2019s Republican primary is open only to GOP-registered voters.\nMississippi also is holding its primaries Tuesday, while Hawaii will have its GOP presidential caucuses.\n\u2014\u2014\u20142:50 p.m.Donald Trump\u2019s Idaho website contains wording copied from a 2012 Boise State Public Radio story with no attribution."}
