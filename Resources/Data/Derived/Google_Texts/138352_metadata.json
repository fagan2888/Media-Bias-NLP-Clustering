They claim their novel start-up can better meet the new consumer expectations and behaviors within the insurance industry. If correct, their venture could disrupt the post-Obamacare insurance world.\n\nGame-changing Health Insurance Company?\n\nThe Gen Y trio is made up of Josh Kushner, Kevin Namezi, and Mario Schlosser. They recently launched Oscar Health Insurance, based in New York. Kushner is the founder of the tech investment firm Thrive Capital. Kevin Nazemi, Oscar\u2019s president, is a former director of healthcare for Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT). Mario Schlosser is a former McKinsey & Company computer scientist.\n\n\u201cWe understand technology, data, and design,\u201d stated Kushner in a recent story published in Business Week.\n\nVision of Consumer-centered, Technology-based Platform\n\nOscar will be different from longstanding entities in the health insurance industry. The strategy at Oscar is to use technology and data to create a more consumer-oriented healthcare company. Telemedicine, transparency, design, functionality and capabilities to support price comparison also play a big part in Oscar\u2019s innovative model for health insurance. The company hopes to redesign health insurance so that a consumer\u2019s first impulse will be to seek out his or her insurer, even before contacting his or her doctor.\n\nThe inspiration for Oscar came from the founders\u2019 real-world frustrations with existing healthcare services, noted Forbes in a recent story. Kushner was frustrated when he had to wade through confusing coverage options for his employees at Thrive Capital.\n\nIn a similar fashion, Schlosser experienced lack of user-friendly healthcare services when dealing with the finances associated with the birth of his two children. \u201cAmazon [NASDQ: AMZN] and Target [NYSE: TGT] knew when Mario\u2019s wife was having a baby,\u201d exclaimed Kushner at a recent breakfast presentation, according to a story published by Crain\u2019s New York.\u201d[B]ut his health insurance company didn\u2019t know until three months after [the birth of their child].\n\n\u201cThe existing players don\u2019t care about satisfying the customer,\u201d stated Kushner in the New York Times coverage of the story. \u201cWe want consumers to feel like they have a doctor in the family.\u201d\n\nOpportunity to Add New Players in Individual Insurance Marketplace\n\nThe health insurance exchanges formed under Obamacare allow new players with new ideas to compete directly with established health insurance industry titans. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act was an opportunity to sell something different than the usual consumer products offered to individuals,\u201d stated Kushner at a recent media event, reported a story at Fastcompany.com.\n\nAccording to Oscar\u2019s Namezi, building a health insurance company from scratch that is customized expressly for the individual market has its advantages. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing group plans, 99% of your focus is on the needs of human resources and brokers,\u201d he observed in a story published at Businessweek.\n\nBig Data\u2014and Knowing How to Use It\u2014Is Key to Oscar\u2019s Approach\n\nOscar\u2019s operation and consumer focus is data-driven. The young, tech-savvy entrepreneurs tracked and analyzed years of medical claims data, Forbes reported. They used the information to help assess how technology and telemedicine could provide better care and patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cBig data is interesting only if you can light up consumer experiences that point you to the type of doctor that you\u2019re looking for, the type of care that you\u2019re looking for, or give you the context for what the care might cost relative to your specific plan,\u201d noted Nazemi.\n\nAdditional Oscar features include:\n\ndoctors on call 24/7 to talk with patients online or on the telephone through the telemedicine company, TeleDoc;\n\nability to check prices for procedures ahead of time;\n\nthree, free in-person doctor visits;\n\nfree generic drugs; and\n\nsymptoms and treatment options database with price estimates.\n\nWell-known Investors Lend Credibility to Oscar\u2019s Platform Concept\n\nTo fund Oscar, Kushner, Namezi and Schlosser raised $45 million in venture capital last year, according to a story published by Nightly Business Report. They added another $30 million in January.\n\nInvestors included Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ: JAVA) co-founder Vinod Khosla and Founders Fund\u2019s Peter Thiel. \u201cI think\u2026 people see the potential of a company coming into an industry that has had a history of giants, that are slow moving in what they do,\u201d stated Nazemi.\n\nFor now, Oscar sells health insurance plans in New York\u2019s nine southern counties. Its network includes 82 out of the 85 hospitals in its service area. In addition to the telehealth provider TeleDoc, it also contracts directly with physician groups.\n\nOscar Enrolling Beneficiaries through Health Insurance Exchange\n\nThrough the end of last year, Oscar had captured 2% of new enrollments on the health insurance exchange, according to Crain\u2019s. Nazemi revealed that enrollment numbers are in the tens of thousands. The average age of its members is 42. They boast an enviable 90% bill payment rate. Some other health insurance carriers have complained that as many as 30% of new members have not paid their bills.\n\nThis e-briefing is noteworthy for pathologists and clinical laboratory managers for two reasons. First, it is evidence that technology platforms will likely continue to bring sweeping changes to healthcare delivery. Secondly, it signals that Gen X and Gen Y are ready to use sophisticated technology-based solutions to challenge traditional industry models.\n\n\u2014Pamela Scherer McLeod\n\nRelated Information:\n\nWith An Eight-Figure Run Rate, Oscar Doubles Down on Health Insurance Through $30M In New Funding\n\nOscar touts its startup approach to insurance\n\nOscar Is A Health Insurance Startup For Digital Natives\n\nJoshua Kushner Has Quietly Amassed 25 Employees And $40 Million To Shake Up Health Care with A Startup, Oscar\n\nWhy Tech Guys Think They Can Sell Health Insurance\n\nVenture-backed Oscar off to a good start under Affordable Care Act\n\nOscar, a New Health Insurer, Raise $30 Million", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, generation y, health insurance, josh kushner, kevin namezi mario schlosser, oscar health insurance, thrive capital, microsoft corp, nasdaq: msft, mckinsey & company, business week, telemedicine, forbes, amazon, nasdq: amzn, target, nyse: tgt, crain\u2019s new york, new york times, affordable care act, fast company, sun microsystems, nasdaq: java, vinod khosla, founders fund, peter thiel, teledoc,affordable care act,amazon,business week,clinical laboratory,crain\u2019s new york,fast company,forbes,founders fund,generation y,health insurance,josh kushner,kevin namezi mario schlosser,mckinsey & company,medical laboratory,microsoft corp,nasdaq: java,nasdaq: msft,nasdq: amzn,new york times,nyse: tgt,oscar health insurance,peter thiel,sun microsystems,target,teledoc,telemedicine,thrive capital,vinod khosla,digital pathology,instruments & equipment,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology", "description": "Three Generation Y entrepreneurs are ready to take on traditional health insurers with their own innovative health insurance company.
