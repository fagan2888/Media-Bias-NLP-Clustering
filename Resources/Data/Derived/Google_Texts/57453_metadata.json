Some are doing so because there are studies that find spending time away from the office and taking more frequent breaks actually increases productivity.\n\nThere also is a cost associated with keeping track of every employee\u2019s vacation time, how much has been taken and how much remains for the year. There also is the cost at some companies of paying people for unused vacation time.\n\nThese companies seem unconcerned about employees violating the policy and taking too much vacation.\n\n\u201cYou just treat people like professionals and like adults, and 99% of the time they\u2019ll act that way,\u201d Mike Southern, the head of human resources at software firm PatientKeeper, told The Boston Globe.\n\nOn its\u2019 website, Netflix explains that they opted to offer employees \u201climitless vacation time\u201d after an employee pointed out that the company doesn\u2019t track hours worked per day or per week, so why track vacation days per year?\n\nThe post on the Netflix website continues, \u201cWe should focus on what people get done, not on how many days worked. Just as we don\u2019t have a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday policy, we don\u2019t need a vacation policy. There is also no clothing policy at Netflix, but no one comes to work naked. Lesson: You don\u2019t need policies for everything.\u201d\n\nHaving unlimited vacation time also allows employees \u2013 many of whom only have two weeks at many companies \u2013 to ease the strain in the second half of the year when many have already used up vacation time for the kids\u2019 spring break, long weekends during the summer and doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nHowever, an editorial in the Christian Science Monitor points out that the benefits of \u201climitless vacation\u201d might not be what they seem. The editorial pointed out that in some competitive environments, having no mandated vacation means that some will never take a vacation.\n\nSome employees will also be concerned that those who take less or even no vacation will be seen more favorably by management. Some companies have combatted those fears by offering incentives to take vacations. For example, Evernote offers $1,000 to any employee who takes a full week off to go on a vacation out of town (no \u201cstaycations\u201d). HubSpot has an informal, \u201ctwo weeks to infinity\u201d vacation policy.\n\nAn article in Slate also points out that the companies offering unlimited vacation are giving to the option to employees they are confident won\u2019t take the time off. David DeLong, a workplace consultant, told the Boston Globe that many of the people at companies with \u201climitless vacation\u201d time are those with A-type personalities who won\u2019t take the time off.\n\n\u201cThe paradox is people who are successful and driven enough to land jobs in these companies are likely to be overly responsible and hard working, so that they\u2019re less likely to take the vacation even though it\u2019s there,\u201d DeLong said.\n\nHe has a good point. Forbes recently reported that a survey from Harris Interactive of over 2,500 adults working in major U.S. cities found 57% of salaried workers don\u2019t take all of their vacation time. And that is in a country where employers have no mandate to provide a minimum amount of vacation days. Most United States companies offer an average of just two vacation weeks per year. In contrast, companies in France, Italy, Germany and Brazil must provide workers 35 to 40 days off a year.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many companies are adopting a new policy that seemed unthinkable not that long ago \u2013 allowing employees to take an unlimited amount of time for vacation.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "Many companies are adopting a new policy that seemed unthinkable not that long ago \u2013 allowing employees to take an unlimited amount of time for vacation.", "title": "More Companies Offering \u201cLimitless Vacation\u201d Time - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/more-companies-offering-limitless-vacation-time", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bigstock-Yacht-Sailing-against-sunset-41827807-300x198.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "business, lifestyle, culture,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce067\"", "article_summary": "Just as we don\u2019t have a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday policy, we don\u2019t need a vacation policy.\nMost United States companies offer an average of just two vacation weeks per year.\nAn article in Slate also points out that the companies offering unlimited vacation are giving to the option to employees they are confident won\u2019t take the time off.\nAnd that is in a country where employers have no mandate to provide a minimum amount of vacation days.\nOn its\u2019 website, Netflix explains that they opted to offer employees \u201climitless vacation time\u201d after an employee pointed out that the company doesn\u2019t track hours worked per day or per week, so why track vacation days per year?"}
