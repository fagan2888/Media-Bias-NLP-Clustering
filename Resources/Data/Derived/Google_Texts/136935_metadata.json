Cupp 011514 [CNN]\n\nCNN host S.E. Cupp appeared to get more than she bargained for on Wednesday when she pushed back against former Labor Secretary Robert Reich\u2019s contention that the minimum wage be raised.\n\n\u201cYou would suggest that we force employers to raise wages, force union participation, raise taxes on the top job creators, and force employers to cut off hiring at 50 employees to avoid Obamacare mandates,\u201d Cupp told Reich. \u201cHow is that a job recipe for job creation?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not forcing,\u201d Reich replied, leading Cupp to shoot back, \u201cYou want to raise the minimum wage, which would force [employers] to raise wages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a minimum wage in this country since 1935,\u201d Reich responded. \u201cRaising the minimum wage is good for the country. It puts more money in the pockets of people. Sixty-five percent of Americans want to raise the minimum wage. Most minimum-wage workers these days are not teenagers; they are breadwinners. If you help them, you are helping the economy overall. And a lot of employers will benefit from a higher minimum wage.\u201d\n\nReich went on to argue that a minimum wage comparable to pay in 1968 after adjusting for inflation would be $10.40, and $15 an hour after adjusting for \u201cproductivity improvements.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill forcing employers to raise wages,\u201d Cupp said. But instead of taking on Reich\u2019s points, she pitched to former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R), who suggested that employers\u2019 advice should be prioritized over that of economists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a consistent answer from those folks about what they want,\u201d Pawlenty said. \u201cThey basically say to government, \u2018Do things to encourage me, not discourage me. Make the load lighter, not heavier.\u2019 That includes things like taxation, like energy policy, like healthcare policy and more. But they\u2019re basically saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do things to make my life more difficult, more expensive, more bureaucratic, more inefficient.\u201d\n\nReich then reminded Pawlenty that, during his tenure with then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, the country added 22 million net new jobs.\n\n\u201cOne thing that we heard from businesses again and again and again was, \u2018We create jobs when there is enough demand. When consumers have money in their pockets, when you have a growing middle class,'\u201d Reich said. \u201cThat\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\nPawlenty later pointed out that he had signed a minimum wage increase in 2008, to $7.75 an hour, 50 cents more than the federal standard.\n\n\u201cAnd it actually did have a positive effect on Minnesota,\u201d Reich said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re gonna have a minimum wage, I think reasonable periodic increases in it are okay,\u201d Pawlenty responded. \u201cBut jumping from where we are now to a quote, \u2018living wage\u2019 that\u2019s over $10 an hour would be quite a shock to the system.\u201d\n\nWatch the discussion, as aired on CNN on Wednesday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/S.E.-Cupp-011514-CNN-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "WATCH: S.E.
