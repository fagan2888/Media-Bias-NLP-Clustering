As a concert photographer, he\u2019s had the opportunity to see a lot of live acts, but none were as emotionally elevating and close to his heart as NIN. Terminally ill and bound to his bed under hospice care, Youssef got exactly what he needed in his final months of life, through a FaceTime call from NIN's lead singer, Trent Reznor, while on stage at one of the band\u2019s most recent performances.\n\nYoussef was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer in Feb. 2011, and has been fighting for his life ever since. He even chronicled his tough road on his OC Weekly blog, Last Shot. Between cancer updates and stories from his freelance photography work, which he performed while managing his cancer treatments with his oncologist, Youssef took time to document how NIN has helped him through his diagnosis, both through their music and in person.\n\nIn a blog post from Aug., he informs his readers about a \u201cwish\u201d the band was granting him by allowing the photog to sit in on rehearsals for their 2013 tour. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Reznor spent an entire week having lunch with Youssef, who could only describe the entire experience as \u201csurreal.\u201d The once-in-a-lifetime opportunity only fueled Youssef\u2019s excitement to see NIN live, but that would prove difficult, because he found out his condition had taken a turn for the worse.\n\n\u201cThis is the most difficult column I will ever write,\u201d Youssef wrote on Sept. 26. \u201cAlthough it wasn't easy admitting to everyone that I had Stage IV colon cancer in my first column, I now have more important and difficult news to convey to all my friends and colleagues. Unfortunately, the new clinical trial medication did not improve my condition as my most recent CT scan showed my disease has worsened.\u201d\n\nWhen Reznor learned that one of his biggest fans and personal friends would not be able to attend the band\u2019s Nov. 16 show in Las Vegas, it didn\u2019t sit well with the NIN frontman. So he decided to give Youssef a call \u2014 on stage, during the band\u2019s set, and in front of a packed crowd at Las Vegas\u2019 Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. What happened next has to be seen to be believed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nin, trent, reznor, facetime, andrew, youssef, colon, cancer, terminally ill", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The lead singer of Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor, FaceTimed a terminally ill fan during a performance at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.", "title": "NIN's Trent Reznor Facetimes Terminally Ill Fan While On Stage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/trent-reznor-nin-frontman-facetimes-terminally-ill-fan-while-stage-las-vegas-video-263390", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/21/trent-reznor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The lead singer of Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor, FaceTimed a terminally ill fan during a performance at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.", "title": "NIN's Trent Reznor Facetimes Terminally Ill Fan While On Stage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/trent-reznor-nin-frontman-facetimes-terminally-ill-fan-while-stage-las-vegas-video-263390", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/21/trent-reznor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/21/trent-reznor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-21T10:50:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T10:50:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The lead singer of Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor, FaceTimed a terminally ill fan during a performance at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel & Casino."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd97\"", "article_summary": "Youssef was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer in Feb. 2011, and has been fighting for his life ever since.\nTo say photojournalist Andrew Youssef, 38, is a fan of the rock band Nine Inch Nails would be an understatement.\nSo he decided to give Youssef a call \u2014 on stage, during the band\u2019s set, and in front of a packed crowd at Las Vegas\u2019 Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.\nAs a concert photographer, he\u2019s had the opportunity to see a lot of live acts, but none were as emotionally elevating and close to his heart as NIN.\n\u201cThis is the most difficult column I will ever write,\u201d Youssef wrote on Sept. 26."}
