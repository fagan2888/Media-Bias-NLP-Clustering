Fees are now 1.4 percent of premiums and typically passed on by insurance companies to consumers. Staff said in a presentation to the board ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting that the exchange also was seeking federal Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nThe board was considering fee increases up to 4.5 percent of premiums. For a family paying $1,000 a month in premiums for example, administrative costs that now are $14 could go up to $45.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado staff studied the finances of four other states with exchange enrollments similar to Colorado\u2019s 150,000 and determined they were able to generate at least $12 million more in revenue through either higher reimbursement fees, Medicaid reimbursement, or both.\n\nConnect for Health spokesman Luke Clarke said he knew of state-based exchanges charging administrative fees up to 3.5 percent. And he said some exchanges get money from the state or reimbursement from Medicaid for helping applicants sign up for public insurance, while Colorado now gets funds from neither of those sources.\n\nOn Medicaid, Clarke said Connect for Health was working with the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and the federal government\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on meeting requirements for reimbursement.\n\nAdam Fox, spokesman for the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which lobbies on health care policy on behalf of consumers, said when the marketplace was formed, it was hard to predict what level of administrative fees would be right. Colorado\u2019s fees are among the lowest in the country, he said.\n\nInsurance providers want to see the fees before submitting their rate plans to the exchange, which they must do at the end of the month. Neil Waldron, chief marketing officer for Rocky Mountain Health Plans, which serves 200,000 members, said choosing the right figure on fees was a matter for the Connect for Health Board, but \u201cwe need to make that decision as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nColorado has avoided problems associated with other state exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. But a limited December state audit report said more than $30 million in payments and contracts lacked proper documentation or procedural controls. Lawmakers have called for broader reviews.\n\nLINK: Connect For Health Colorado\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
