The State of Ohio, several universities and a southwestern Ohio county are suing the federal government. Why?

They say that the fee charged to employers to bail out insurance companies participating in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is an unconstitutional tax on government.

Under ObamaCare, every employer must pay a fee that goes into a reinsurance fund used to bail out insurance companies that lose money on the ACA. The fee is even charged to state and local government employers, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer:

(T)he ACA “Transitional Reinsurance Program” was not funded by the people participating in the ACA’s new insurance marketplace … (r)ather, the fee had to be paid by … the people already providing insurance to their workers. That included state and local governments and public universities.

Ohio’s Attorney General, Mike DeWine, told the Plain Dealer this fee is a tax by one government entity on another. He told the newspaper that it’s unconstitutional, so they want it stopped and peoples’ money returned to them:

The lawsuit says that the “tax” violates “important federalism protections” in the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment, which helps define the relationship between the federal and governments, the related anti-commandeering doctrine, and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.

The so-called “tax” is called a “fee” by the Obama administration. According to Reuters:

“The reinsurance program helps keep premiums affordable from year to year, according to HHS.”

The fact remains that state government, universities and counties have had to pay millions of dollars already.

Insurance companies negotiated the reinsurance deal with the administration — including the President and his top aide Valerie Jarrett — to ensure they wouldn’t lose money on ObamaCare. They were able to negotiate a more than one trillion dollar bailout over the next decade.

Ohio has already joined a different lawsuit against ObamaCare having to do with taxpayer subsidies for people living in states that have no insurance exchanges. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear that case in March.
