The foundation\u2019s goal is to serve as a safety net and remove financial barriers so patients can access (and stay on) their much-needed medications.The organization\u2019s case managers can help patients with treatments for almost 60 disease states, including colorectal, metastatic breast, metastatic prostate, ovarian, thyroid, and non-small cell lung cancers.PAN Foundation\u2019s President and CEO Dan Klein told CURE that the accomplishments he is most proud of are the number of patients they have served, as well as the trust and reliability they established with donors to sustain the level of assistance the foundation provides.Klein said he couldn\u2019t pick just one PAN Foundation recipient who has stuck out in his mind as especially memorable.\u201cEach year, we receive hundreds of wonderful letters from patients sharing their stories and expressing their gratitude,\u201d Klein says. \u201cThey all stand out in their own way.\u201dOne example on the PAN Foundation website, however, is Mark, who has hepatitis C. He said he was prescribed three medications, one of which would offer a dramatic increase in his likelihood of being cured. The foundation stepped in to assist him with copayments, which allowed him to take the drug therapy.\u201cI give PAN credit for allowing me an 80 percent chance of being cured instead of a 47 percent chance of being cured,\u201d Mark says.Mark is one of many patients the PAN Foundation has served. Since 2004, the foundation has provided more than 500,000 underinsured patients with nearly $1 billion in financial assistance.Over the years, Klein said he has seen the foundation evolve to incorporate more disease funds that the organization operates, more patients served and more copayment support provided.\u201cWe also have become more and more integral in providing a safety net for patients with high out-of-pocket costs,\u201d Klein says. \u201cAnd we have developed more streamlined technology to help patients apply for assistance and for providers to receive reimbursements.\u201dKlein said what is most fulfilling about his role as president and CEO is the chance to work with a \u201cgreat group of like-minded staff and donors who are committed to helping patients get access to critical therapies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "cancer,share your story,cure today", "og": {"type": "Article", "image": "https://curemagazine.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_image/Share_Story_1200x600_FB.jpg", "site_name": "Cure Today", "description": "Your stories help us achieve our mission of combining science and humanity to make cancer understandable. | Cure Today"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://curemagazine.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_image/Share_Story_1200x600_FB.jpg", "site": "@cure_magazine", "card": "summary", "description": "Your stories help us achieve our mission of combining science and humanity to make cancer understandable. | Cure Today"}, "description": "Your stories help us achieve our mission of combining science and humanity to make cancer understandable."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf260\"", "article_summary": "The foundation stepped in to assist him with copayments, which allowed him to take the drug therapy.\u201cI give PAN credit for allowing me an 80 percent chance of being cured instead of a 47 percent chance of being cured,\u201d Mark says.Mark is one of many patients the PAN Foundation has served.\n\u201cThey all stand out in their own way.\u201dOne example on the PAN Foundation website, however, is Mark, who has hepatitis C.
