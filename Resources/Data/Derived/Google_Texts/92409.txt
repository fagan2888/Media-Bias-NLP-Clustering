GILZE-RIJEN AIR BASE, the Netherlands--Investigators probing the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 have concluded that a sophisticated, Russian-made antiaircraft missile struck the Boeing Co. 777 jetliner, causing it to break apart in midair.

The Buk missile was fired from eastern Ukraine, Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board said, as the agency that leads the crash investigation published its final report into the crash that killed all 298 people on board.

It is the first time those involved in the probe have publicly endorsed the long-held view such a missile was used to shoot down the passenger plane.

Accident investigators also concluded that the Ukrainian government should have closed the airspace over the embattled east where the country’s armed forces were battling separatists. Joustra said there were sufficient indications commercial flights were at risk after several military planes had been shot down prior to the Malaysia Airlines flight being struck.

The crash investigators weren’t assigning blame for who fired the missile. Further forensic analysis would be required to determine the exact launch location within a 320-square-kilometer (124-square-mile) area, Joustra, said, adding that such efforts lay outside the scope of the crash probe.
