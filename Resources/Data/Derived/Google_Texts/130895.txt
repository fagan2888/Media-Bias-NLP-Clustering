Tommy Chong was today’s #OneLuckyGuy on Fox’s Outnumbered show. But those of us who care more about getting health insurance than the latest old videos of Jonathan Gruber talking about how the law was passed are the real lucky ones.

First, the four Fox hosts tried to get Chong to knock the glitches in the HealthCare.gov rollout. He replied, “My thing about the whole ObamaCare is that it’s better than Bush’s ObamaCare.”

One of the hosts asked, “What was Bush’s ObamaCare?”

Chong said, “He never had one.”

There was a nervous titter from one host and silence from the rest.

Tantaros brought up Gruber and his claim that “stupid Americans” were misled in order to pass the Affordable Care Act.

Chong’s reply: “To me, it’s just another attack on ObamaCare from another angle. Sounds like Benghazi all over again.”

Later, Tantaros tried to argue that Gruber’s old comments represent “an attack on the American people for how quote stupid we are.”

Chong said, “You have to define what stupidity means, you know. If you are opposing universal health care based on rumors of lies then that it is a stupid way to be.”

That shut them up.
