She serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and Budget Committee.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama sold his failing healthcare law to Congress and the American people, he made a series of promises.\n\nFor example, \u201cIf you like your healthcare plan you can keep it\u201d (wrong) and, \u201cwe will start by reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family\u201d (nope) or, \u201cfederal funds are not used for abortion services\u201d (psych!).\n\nBut the misleading rhetoric did not end there.\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2009, President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to discuss his proposed health reforms and offered this whopper:\n\n\u201cThere are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants. This too is false. The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.\u201d\n\nAt this point, you may remember that a particular friend and colleague of mine posited, in so many words, that the president wasn\u2019t exactly telling the truth. Six years later, that famous charge against President Obama has proven all too correct.\n\nConservatives have long had reason to question Obamacare\u2019s potential benefits to illegal immigrants. In 2014, Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell publicly advocated for extending the law\u2019s coverage to so-called DREAMers \u2013 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.\n\nMore recently, when the state of California floated a bill allowing illegal immigrants to purchase Obamacare coverage on the state exchanges, the White House was noticeably silent. The legislation was later scaled back to instead allow undocumented children access to the state\u2019s Medicaid program (still a direct result of Obamacare\u2019s passage, as California has participated in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion).\n\nNow, in the clearest sign of Obamacare\u2019s illicit coverage of illegal immigrants to date, a bombshell report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee found that the healthcare law doled out an estimated $750 million in taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies to some 500,000 people of unverified immigration status.\n\nHere\u2019s the real problem: this money has already gone out the door. So now the Obama administration has set up a pay-and-chase cycle where they must attempt to recoup taxpayer dollars after they\u2019ve been spent \u2013 and the government does a notoriously poor job of getting that money back.\n\nLast week, I demanded answers on this report in separate Ways and Means Committee hearings with both HHS Secretary Burwell and Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew. Interestingly, Secretary Burwell did not deny the report\u2019s accuracy, instead deflecting to assurances that \u201cwe follow the statutory guidelines\u201d (Hint: they\u2019re not working).\n\nSimilarly, when I asked Secretary Lew how much of this wasted money the government expected to regain, he stuck to script; replying with \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d\n\nI am preparing a letter with detailed questions to these Obama administration officials so that we can hold responsible parties accountable for ensuring this grave mistake is not repeated. But we can\u2019t stop there.\n\nConservatives have warned all along that Obamacare was vulnerable to this kind of fraud and abuse. To that end, I have carried a bill for nearly three years called the No Subsidies Without Verification Act.\n\nMy legislation would require proper verification \u2013 including income status and citizenship status \u2013 to be completed before Obamacare subsidies are disbursed; something that should have been done all along.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a bipartisan majority in the House passed the first iteration of my bill back in 2013. The Obama administration issued a veto threat, saying the legislation was \u201cunnecessary\u201d because \u201cthe Secretary of Health and Human Services has already put in place an effective and efficient system for verification of eligibility for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions.\u201d\n\nHere we are, $750 million later; maybe they\u2019d like to give my idea a second look.\n\nThe simple fact is this: Ensuring that Obamacare customers are truly eligible for taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies is not a partisan issue, it\u2019s just commonsense. That is why I reintroduced this bill and will continue to fight for its enactment.\n\nIn light of this latest misuse of taxpayer dollars, Congress must pass the No Subsidies Without Verification Act without delay and put the ball in the President\u2019s court. As President Obama looks to seal a political legacy in the remaining months of his term, finally honoring one of the core promises of his signature law would be a good place to start.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
