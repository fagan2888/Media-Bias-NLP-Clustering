I\u2019m not as hungry these days. I know what they\u2019re serving at the buffet. And with exceptions (to whom I\u2019ll always be grateful), the truth is that the general shapes, musks and choreography of the whole shebang are similar enough that I no longer feel I\u2019m missing out if I\u2019m not putting out. It\u2019s a switch for someone who used to be just a smidge compulsive to find that waiting is not only fine\u2014it\u2019s fun.\n\nI had no idea. I thought I was pretty worldly but I didn\u2019t know what every goody-goody from the Virgin Mary to the Jonas Brothers knows: that the removal of a hand and a firm \u201cstop it,\u201d can create enough sexual tension to power a series of small cities. It\u2019s the difference between an artful striptease and being flashed. Both are good, but one just offers you more anticipation.\n\nHolding out for a just-right time can lead to epic moments. What if, for example, instead of revealing his paternity to Luke Skywalker when he did, Darth Vader had texted him the information earlier in the film? A classic moment lost and another example of how much timing matters.\n\nI thought it would feel awkward, at my age, to start saying things like \u201cWait,\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s enough for now,\u201d much the same way one feels ridiculous practicing a foreign language, but in truth I feel the opposite: I feel certain, centered, even a little smug about sticking to my guns. I feel the way you feel when you don\u2019t eat the second Twinkie.\n\nMostly what I like is savoring the intimacy. To put it in travel terms, you can take a plane and get where you want to go quickly, but once in a while, when you\u2019re really lucky, you can take a long, meandering road trip and stop at every stand, local attraction or view spot and really get to know the lay of the land. And if you decide you don\u2019t like where you\u2019re going, it\u2019s a lot easier to turn around than if you took an airplane.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research suggests the key to a great sex life is quality not quantity -- and that means occasionally holding out", "author": "Liz Langley", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research suggests the key to a great sex life is quality not quantity -- and that means occasionally holding out", "title": "One unexpected way to amp up your sexual satisfaction", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/23/one_unexpected_way_to_amp_up_your_sexual_satisfaction_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_158010224.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests the key to a great sex life is quality not quantity -- and that means occasionally holding out", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_158010224.jpg", "title": "One unexpected way to amp up your sexual satisfaction", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "One unexpected way to amp up your sexual satisfaction", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb75c\"", "article_summary": "And if you decide you don\u2019t like where you\u2019re going, it\u2019s a lot easier to turn around than if you took an airplane.\nI feel the way you feel when you don\u2019t eat the second Twinkie.\nIt\u2019s a switch for someone who used to be just a smidge compulsive to find that waiting is not only fine\u2014it\u2019s fun.\nAnd with exceptions (to whom I\u2019ll always be grateful), the truth is that the general shapes, musks and choreography of the whole shebang are similar enough that I no longer feel I\u2019m missing out if I\u2019m not putting out.\nWhat if, for example, instead of revealing his paternity to Luke Skywalker when he did, Darth Vader had texted him the information earlier in the film?"}
