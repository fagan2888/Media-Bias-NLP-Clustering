New York, NY---Freeport track and field star Gabe Moore can add the distinction of being a national champion to his ever growing list of accomplishments.

Competing in the New Balance Nationals Indoor at The Armory in NYC , Moore took home the title in the Pentathlon, one year after finishing in third.

The events consisted of hurdles, shot put, long jump, high jump, and the 1,000 meters.

For Gabe, it's an achievement that means a great deal.

"Being able to win nationals and consider myself number one in the nation for sure, it's solidified now," said Moore. "It feels awesome to know that I'm on top of the game"

Now an indoor national champion, Gabe says nothing's changed, he's keeping his same hungry yet humble mindset as he looks forward to improving as a decathlete, going up against the best of the best in individual events specialists, while also striving to be at his peak for the state finals for the outdoor track season.
