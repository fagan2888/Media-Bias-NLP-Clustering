The company expected a revenue bump, and instead, they got a revenue hit,\" said Billy Bostick, the court-appointed receiver overseeing the cooperative's operations. \"That was a big part of it. There were other things.\"\n\nThe co-op was already bleeding cash.\n\nLouisiana Health had lost more than $28 million by the end of 2014, its first year of providing coverage, according to records filed with the state Department of Insurance.
