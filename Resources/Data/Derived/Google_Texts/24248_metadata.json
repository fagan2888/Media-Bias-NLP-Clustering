They watch the polls like ordinary Americans follow the box scores in baseball \u2013 and they don\u2019t like what they see. To them, the data says the Democrats are still in a position to control the U.S. Senate after the November elections.\n\nWhat they forget, however, is that data is a tool, something to be used in analysis that is not in and of itself determinant of outcomes. Unless, after studying it, people act in such a way as to make the data a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nOf particular interest are the attitudes of campaign consultants, the collection of technicians who advise on everything from the overall theme to the color of the yard signs. As a group they are easy to bash and are frequently the subject of criticism from party activists and policy wonks because they are considered to lack a vision, have an overall aversion to addressing ideological differences and are unwilling to take risks. And if they, as has been suggested numerous times over the course of the 2014 campaign, are advising the candidate for whom they work to cast every issue in \u201cpale pastels\u201d rather than the \u201cbold colors\u201d President Ronald Reagan famously suggested conservatives employ, then they are guilty of malpractice. Elections are about forcing choices and explaining why changes in personnel matter, and this cannot be done with any great success without explaining why differences rather than similarities matter.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nIt is not enough, therefore, to simply be the anti-Obama or to tie opposing Democrats to the president\u2019s coattails. Sure, as the polls clearly show, Obama\u2019s a drag on the party overall, but that does not mean he is the only issue on which the electorate will be voting in November. The GOP candidates must be \u201cfor\u201d something. It\u2019s the only way for them to win; even in 2010, when the Republicans retook the House, governorships and state legislative chambers by big numbers, they were by and large unanimously \u201cfor\u201d the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nThe party has yet to coalesce around a set of issues \u2013 or even one \u2013 over which the election can be nationalized. Even so, they have managed to all but wrest four Senate seats away from the Democrats \u2013 Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas and West Virginia \u2013 just because of the general national environment and local issues. There are other states where they are on the cusp of victory \u2013 North Carolina, New Hampshire, Iowa, Virginia, Alaska, Louisiana and Colorado \u2013 but where there is still work to be done. In those states, the candidates are still introducing themselves to the electorate, making it possible for people to vote for them. Once you have gained the general confidence of the electorate as someone who is up to the task at hand, then you can begin to force the choice. Election Day may be just over a month and a half away, but the challenger candidates in competitive races still have to be visible, still have to meet people, still have to press the flesh and prove they have what it takes.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on the Democratic Party]\n\nThis lesson is not lost on vulnerable Democrats like Louisiana\u2019s Mary Landrieu \u2013 who chose assisting a 20-something doing a handstand on a beer keg to help reestablish her \u201cdown home\u201d bona fides \u2013 or Virginia\u2019s Mark Warner, who has been reintroducing himself to voters with TV spots focusing a lot on the four years he spent as governor just after the turn of the century. They understand the voters have to know you before they will vote for you \u2013 although Landrieu trying to show she\u2019s still \u201ca good ole\u2019 girl\u201d and Warner\u2019s trying to remind people that for an invisible senator, he was a good governor, seem odd choices on which to base a fall campaign.\n\nIf the GOP candidates have a plan to close strong, to finish the campaign by explaining the contrast in visions between the two candidates (or three in the case of Louisiana) after first having established in the minds of the voters who they are, then a lot of incumbents are going to fall in November. If the Republicans plan to remain little more than the opposition to Obama, they are still likely to take the Senate, though not by as much.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "peter-roff/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "The GOP Needs to Campaign on Issues in 2014, Not Just Against Obama", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "If the GOP wants to win big in the Senate, it needs to be for something, not just against the president.", "title": "Make 2014 About More Than Obama", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/09/22/the-gop-needs-to-campaign-on-issues-in-2014-not-just-against-obama", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f9/39/d06a33884c8db2b86b8df4c26d65/140922-scottbrown-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The GOP Needs to Campaign on Issues in 2014, Not Just Against Obama", "description": "If the GOP wants to win big in the Senate, it needs to be for something, not just against the president.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,politics,Republican Party,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "If the GOP wants to win big in the Senate, it needs to be for something, not just against the president."}, "article_summary": "To them, the data says the Democrats are still in a position to control the U.S. Senate after the November elections.\nThe party has yet to coalesce around a set of issues \u2013 or even one \u2013 over which the election can be nationalized.\nUnless, after studying it, people act in such a way as to make the data a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIf the Republicans plan to remain little more than the opposition to Obama, they are still likely to take the Senate, though not by as much.\nThey watch the polls like ordinary Americans follow the box scores in baseball \u2013 and they don\u2019t like what they see."}
