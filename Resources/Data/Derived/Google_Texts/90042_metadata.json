Since the law passed, Moyers said, Republicans have \u201cstalked it like Jack The Ripper.\u201d\n\nMoyers began by looking at the Republican members of Congress who demanded an apology from those responsible for the problems with the HealthCare.gov website. But once they got contrition from Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Moyers said, \u201cthe apology didn\u2019t squelch the partisan tirades or quench the Republican thirst for revenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to also expect at least a tiny bit of remorse, just a morsel of apology from Republicans?\u201d Moyers asked. This led Moyers to his \u201cJack The Ripper\u201d analogy, saying the GOP has \u201cstalked\u201d Obamacare \u201cin the states, through the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, which\u2013uh-oh\u2013ruled it constitutional. In last year\u2019s election, when they lost again. But quit? Never. For Republicans, this has become their Alamo.\u201d\n\nMoyers explained that the Obama Administration \u201cnaively\u201d figured that Republican-run states would gladly accept federal funds to set up their own insurance exchanges and expand Medicare. \u201cRepublicans, it seems, have their principles,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd health care for poor people is not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe host resisted the urge to say \u201cI told you so\u201d after suggesting several years back that a public option would have been more effective that the \u201cRube Goldberg device\u201d that is Obamacare.\n\nWatch video below, via PBS:\n\n[h/t Raw Story]\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Friday's edition of Moyers & Company, host Bill Moyers delivered a devastating take down of the Republican Party's systematic efforts to dismantle President", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-02-at-10.12.59-AM.png", "title": "PBS\u2019 Bill Moyers: GOP \u2018Stalked\u2019 Obamacare Like \u2018Jack The Ripper\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Friday's edition of Moyers & Company, host Bill Moyers delivered a devastating take down of the Republican Party's systematic efforts to dismantle President Obama's Affordable Care Act.
