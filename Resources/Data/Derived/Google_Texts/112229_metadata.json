It was fronted by Ben Carson, who starred in a video denouncing Obamacare and told viewers, \"If you want to hold Washington accountable and truly save American health care, join me and sign our petition today.\" Needless to say, when you called the toll-free number, it turned out that Carson wanted more than just your John Hancock. He also wanted your Benjamins:\n\nWhen Juanita McMillon saw his name, she was eager to get out her checkbook. \u201cI think he is sincere, and I think he is honest, and I think he is exactly what we need,\u201d said McMillon, 80, from the small town of De Kalb in northeast Texas. She gave $350....American Legacy raised close to $6 million in 2014 \u2014 and spent nearly all of it paying the consultants and firms that raised the money. Just 2% was donated to Republican candidates and committees, financial reports show. \u201cI\u2019m really careful who I give money to, but I guess I did not read it close enough,\u201d McMillon said, adding that she had never heard of American Legacy. \u201cI prefer to give money to individuals, and I assumed, I guess, that Dr. Carson was getting my money.\u201d Though American Legacy didn\u2019t raise much money for Obamacare-hating Republicans, it was a success at something else \u2014 finding people willing to give to Carson....When Carson entered the race, the campaign tapped those donors again. Donnell gave another $250 to the campaign, and McMillon another $450. Of the more than 4,000 donors to American Legacy, more than 25% also ended up giving to the Carson campaign, a Los Angeles Times analysis showed.\n\nThis is good reporting, but so far there's nothing all that new here. Conservatives have turned grifting into a high art, and Carson is just the flavor of the month. What makes this piece great is the response from Doug Watts, Carson's campaign spokesman:\n\nWatts defended the American Legacy effort and offered assurance to donors. \u201cI would say to those people, you did give to Dr. Carson,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThey participated in the building of a list\u201d of donors for the campaign.\n\nBooyah! By giving money to Carson's anti-Obamacare campaign, you identified yourself as a soft touch who would give Carson even more money later on. And that's a big help. Of course, these elderly donors thought they were helping Carson fight Obamacare, because, you know, that's what Carson actually said. But what's the difference? Tomayto, tomahto.\n\nAnyway, read the whole thing if you've got the stomach for it.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/11/ben-carson-and-conservative-grift-machine", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Ben Carson and the conservative grift machine"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ben Carson and the conservative grift machine", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/11/ben-carson-and-conservative-grift-machine", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Needless to say, when you called the toll-free number, it turned out that Carson wanted more than just your John Hancock.\n\u201cI would say to those people, you did give to Dr. Carson,\u201d Watts said.\nOf course, these elderly donors thought they were helping Carson fight Obamacare, because, you know, that's what Carson actually said.\nOf the more than 4,000 donors to American Legacy, more than 25% also ended up giving to the Carson campaign, a Los Angeles Times analysis showed.\nIn the LA Times today Joseph Tanfani and Maloy Moore have a great piece about the American Legacy PAC and its 2014 Save Our Healthcare campaign."}
