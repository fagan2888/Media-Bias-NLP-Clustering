The study authors hope that shining light on the relationship between impulsivity and food addiction may equip doctors with better ways to handle patients struggling with obesity, as well as to better understand the psychological issues behind over-eating.\n\n\u201cThe notion of food addiction is a very new one, and one that has generated a lot of interest,\u201d James MacKillop, the study\u2019s principal investigator and associate professor of psychology in UGA\u2019s Frankling College of Arts and Sciences, said in a press release. \u201cMy lab generally studies alcohol, nicotine and other forms of drug addiction, but we think it\u2019s possible to think about impulsivity, food addiction and obesity using some of the same techniques.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the researchers used the Yale Food Addiction Scale and the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale to measure the participants\u2019 levels of food addiction and impulsivity. They then compared these results to the participants\u2019 body mass index (BMI) in an attempt to determine obesity. \u201cOur study shows that impulsive behavior was not necessarily associated with obesity, but impulsive behaviors can lead to food addiction,\u201d MacKillop said in the press release.\n\nAnother study published this week shed light on food addiction among women, and found that middle-aged women were the most likely to be addicted to eating. About 8 percent of females between the ages of 45 and 62 were food addicts, the study stated. They were measured by the Yale Food Addiction Scale, which requires participants to answer statements like, \u201cI find myself continuing to consume certain foods even though I am no longer hungry.\u201d What isn't surprising is the type of food such \"addicts\" gravitated towards \u2014 \u201chyper-palatable\u201d munchies that are fatty and full of sugar and salt. These foods were more likely to trigger the transmission of dopamine, which is a \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical also linked to drug addiction.\n\nMacKillop and his team from the University of Georgia hope their study will help people struggling with obesity and food addiction better cope with their habits and to make changes. \u201cModern neuroscience has helped us understand how substances like drugs and alcohol co-opt areas of the brain that evolved to release dopamine and create a sense of happiness or satisfaction,\u201d MacKillop said in the press release. \u201cAnd now we realize that certain types of food also hijack these brain circuits and lay the foundation for compulsive eating habits that are similar to drug addiction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "impulsive, compulsive eating, food addiction, obese", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study found that people with impulsive personalities are more likely to be food addicts.", "title": "People With Impulsive Personalities Are More Likely To Be Addicted To Eating", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/people-impulsive-personalities-are-more-likely-be-obese-addicted-eating-267915", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/donut.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study found that people with impulsive personalities are more likely to be food addicts.", "title": "People With Impulsive Personalities Are More Likely To Be Addicted To Eating", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/people-impulsive-personalities-are-more-likely-be-obese-addicted-eating-267915", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/donut.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/donut.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-25T19:48:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T20:14:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study found that people with impulsive personalities are more likely to be food addicts."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf169\"", "article_summary": "Another study published this week shed light on food addiction among women, and found that middle-aged women were the most likely to be addicted to eating.\n\u201cOur study shows that impulsive behavior was not necessarily associated with obesity, but impulsive behaviors can lead to food addiction,\u201d MacKillop said in the press release.\nResearch out of the University of Georgia and published in Appetite found that people who were impulsive were more likely to develop compulsive eating patterns, and thus also to be obese.\nThe notion may not be too far-fetched to begin with, but scientists now think that people with impulsive personalities may be more likely to struggle with addiction \u2014 whether to drugs, alcohol, or even food.\nFood addicts tend to over-eat when it comes to foods high in fat, salt, and sugar; they are more likely to trigger dopamine."}
