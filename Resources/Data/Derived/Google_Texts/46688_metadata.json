Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). (Screenshot: YouTube/NBC News)\n\n(CNSNews.com) -- While explaining his proposal for a Medicare-for-all program during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he helped write the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, and make it a \"better piece of legislation,\" but the fact is that \"29 million people still have no health insurance.\"\n\n\"I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act,\" said Sanders at the debate held in Charleston, S.C. \"I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation.\"\n\n\"I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance,\" said the senator. \"We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.\"\n\nSanders continued, \"And here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.\"\n\n\"That's the vision we need to take,\" he said.\n\nSanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, is an Independent in the U.S. Senate who caucuses with the Democrats. He is battling Secretary Hillary Clinton and former Gov. Martin O'Malley for the Democratic nomination for president.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Sen.
