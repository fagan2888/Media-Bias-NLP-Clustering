The Bears (3-5) fell behind 45-7 early in the second half and lost for the fourth time in five games.\n\nThe Bears came to town after a tumultuous week that began with a 27-14 home loss to the Miami Dolphins. Afterward, wide receiver Brandon Marshall was heard screaming in an emotional locker room. Coach Marc Trestman and quarterback Jay Cutler downplayed the postgame scene during the week.\n\nWhatever happened, it didn\u2019t help the Bears play better.\n\nBrady completed 30 of 35 passes for 354 yards. He threw three scoring passes to Rob Gronkowski and one each to Tim Wright and Brandon LaFell.\n\nDefensive end Rob Ninkovich scored with 55 seconds left in the first half on a 15-yard return of Cutler\u2019s fumble, the Patriots third touchdown in 57 seconds.\n\nSince losing to the Bears 46-10 in the Super Bowl ending the 1985 season, the Patriots are 7-1 against them.\n\nAfter a slow start this season, Brady has thrown for 1,268 yards, 14 touchdowns and no interceptions in the last four games. Sunday\u2019s performance was the sixth of his career in which he\u2019s thrown for at least five scores, including the playoffs. His 148.4 passer rating was the eighth best of his career.\n\nChicago was 3-1 on the road and had hope after last weekend\u2019s implosion. So imagine how the coming week will be after the blowout.\n\nOn their first five possessions, the Patriots scored on a 6-yard pass to Gronkowski, a 23-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski, and passes of 1 yard to Wright, 2 yards to Gronkowski and 9 yards to LaFell.\n\nThe defense got into the act when Darrelle Revis intercepted Cutler\u2019s desperation pass on the last play of the first half. Then the Patriots started the second half with an 80-play drive capped by Brady\u2019s 46-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski.\n\nGronkowski had nine catches for 146 yards before leaving midway through the third quarter with dehydration, and LaFell had 11 receptions for 124 yards.\n\nCutler finished with 20 completions in 30 attempts for 227 yards, three touchdowns and one interception.\n\nThe rout was in sharp contrast to the Patriots previous game, a 27-25 win over the lowly New York Jets secured when Nick Folk\u2019s 58-yard field goal attempt was blocked on the last play on Oct. 16.\n\nWith extra time to prepare after that Thursday night win, the Patriots were ready. Their first two offensive plays were 19-yard gains on a pass to LaFell and a run by Jonas Gray.\n\nThe Bears punted on their first three series before Cutler\u2019s 25-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte made it 17-7. Cutler also threw a 20-yarder to Martellus Bennett that cut the lead to 45-14.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tom Brady throws 5 TDs, Patriots rout Bears", "title": "Tom Brady throws 5 TDs, Patriots rout Bears", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/26/tom-brady-throws-5-tds-patriots-rout-bears/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__457891834p1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__457891834p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-26T14:40:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:38:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Bears punted on their first three series before Cutler\u2019s 25-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte made it 17-7.\nThen the Patriots started the second half with an 80-play drive capped by Brady\u2019s 46-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski.\nThe Bears (3-5) fell behind 45-7 early in the second half and lost for the fourth time in five games.\nSince losing to the Bears 46-10 in the Super Bowl ending the 1985 season, the Patriots are 7-1 against them.\nThe Bears came to town after a tumultuous week that began with a 27-14 home loss to the Miami Dolphins."}
