This year, experts say many of the same issues persist, and language remains their biggest obstacle.\n\n\u201cEven in the second enrollment cycle, Asian Americans (AAs) and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) continue to face enrollment barriers to the ACA,\u201d said Isha Weerasinghe, Senior Policy Analyst at Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), \u201cWith 32% of AAs being Limited English Proficient, and 29% of Pacific Islanders speaking a language other than English at home, the need for in-language resources and assistance is great. Additionally, some AAs and NHPIs have low health literacy, and some may not be aware of how immigration verification can affect one\u2019s coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the first enrollment, we had NO support or resources in terms of bilingual navigator assistance for the Asian-American community,\u201d says Dr. Tsu-Yin Wu, Director of Michigan\u2019s only AHJ member Healthy Asian Americans Project (HAAP). But this year, she received a federal grant to hire additional help, and is hiring bilingual navigators who speak Mandarin/Cantonese, Bengali, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Hindi, and Gujarati.\n\nSome of the challenges faced during the first Open Enrollment Period\u2014such as lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate materials, insufficient and unequal distribution of resources, low health literacy, and immigration-related concerns\u2014persist, but the learned experiences, a new best practices guide, and a new multilingual glossary help considerably as the second Open Enrollment period begins.\n\nStill, organizations warn that it's not just language translation that's needed.\n\n\u201cWe know that many Asian Americans immigrated from health care systems very different from the U.S.,\u201d said Wu. \u201cTherefore, insurance terminology makes no sense to them, for example, co-pay, deductible, et cetera...Low health literacy means we have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obamacare open enrollment starts Saturday 0:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts say language remains the biggest barrier for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders attempting to enroll in the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/language-barriers-persist-affordable-care-act-enrollment-n252646", "type": "article", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_47/776836/aca_pic_phil_2_57e0b33769ce64864ce32faf04a35086.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Experts say language remains the biggest barrier for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders attempting to enroll in the Affordable Care Act."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Experts say language remains the biggest barrier for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders attempting to enroll in the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "NBCAsianAmerica", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_47/776836/aca_pic_phil_2_57e0b33769ce64864ce32faf04a35086.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Language Barriers Persist in Affordable Care Act Enrollment - NBC News", "site": "NBCAsianAmerica", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-25", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/language-barriers-persist-affordable-care-act-enrollment-n252646", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Asian America"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ab4\"", "article_summary": "It took 70 community groups working across 22 states in 41 languages to help 600,00 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) navigate the first open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act in 2014.\n\u201cWe know that many Asian Americans immigrated from health care systems very different from the U.S.,\u201d said Wu.\nThis year, experts say many of the same issues persist, and language remains their biggest obstacle.\n\u201cTherefore, insurance terminology makes no sense to them, for example, co-pay, deductible, et cetera...Low health literacy means we have a long way to go.\u201dPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Obamacare open enrollment starts Saturday 0:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogIN-DEPTH\nStill, organizations warn that it's not just language translation that's needed."}
