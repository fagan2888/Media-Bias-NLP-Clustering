The management shake-up at Solera National Bancorp continues as John Carmichael was fired as CEO and president, and replaced by the board with former chief financial officer Robert Fenton, according to a regulatory filing Friday.

Senior vice president Andrew Seaton also resigned his post with Solera, the holding company for Solera National Bank in Lakewood.

The filing said Carmichael was fired “for cause” on July 14, and Fenton was named the following day.

Fenton had been the bank’s CFO and executive vice president from its inception in September 2007 until he was let go last March. He rallied behind the scenes with board member Michael Quagliano in a heated proxy battle to wrestle for control of the bankcorp’s board.

To firm his position, Fenton purchased stock options available to him from prior grants that gave him the second-most shares held by an individual. Several investment groups hold more, according to SEC filings.

The proxy fight, during which Carmichael openly criticized Quagliano and the other members of his slate, ended last month when the sitting board stepped down, and Quagliano took charge.

Carmichael offered several deals for a compromise solution, each failing.

Fenton will be paid $120,000 per year.

Quagliano, Fenton and Carmichael did not immediately respond to efforts to contact them.
