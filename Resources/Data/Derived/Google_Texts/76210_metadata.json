Probiotics found in foods can allow more good microorganisms to enter your system and keep your gut well-balanced and smooth, replenishing the live cultures already there.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not necessary to eat probiotic-filled foods to keep your gut bacteria in line, there\u2019s no doubt that it can certainly help them do their job better. According to the Cleveland Clinic, eating probiotics in food helps lower the number of bad, inflammatory bacteria in your digestive system and thus prevent illness; it also assists in stabilizing the balance between good and bad bacteria especially after you\u2019ve taken antibiotics and have cleared out most good bacteria. Some research has even found that probiotics might improve mental health and fight depression.\n\nYou can always take probiotic supplements \u2014 but since they don\u2019t have to be approved by the FDA, some of their claims may not be entirely true. We\u2019d recommend picking out the best foods with probiotics instead.
