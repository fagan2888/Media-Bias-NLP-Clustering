For trusts and estates, the 3.8 percent surtax is imposed on the excess of adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest trust/estate income tax bracket begins, or undistributed net investment income (NII), whichever is less.\n\nSo it\u2019s really hard to avoid paying the tax one way or another. Who might bump up against the Medicare surtax? For 2014, the highest tax bracket is reached when a trust or estate reaches $12,150. Obviously, that\u2019s not a very high number, so the surtax applies to an awful lot of trusts and estates.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tom Nawrocki", "description": "Complex trusts should consider the Medicare surtax issue as an opportunity to extend a bypass trust to all descendants.", "og": {"url": "http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2014/07/02/the-medicare-surtax-is-it-avoidable", "image": "http://media.lifehealthpro.com/lifehealthpro/article/2014/07/02/06-19-14-feature-life-nawrocki.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Complex trusts should consider the Medicare surtax issue as an opportunity to extend a bypass trust to all descendants.", "title": "The Medicare surtax: Is it avoidable?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Complex trusts should consider the Medicare surtax issue as an opportunity to extend a bypass trust to all descendants.", "creator": "@LifeHealthPro", "image": {"src": "http://media.lifehealthpro.com/lifehealthpro/article/2014/07/02/06-19-14-feature-life-nawrocki-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "title": "The Medicare surtax: Is it avoidable?", "site": "@LifeHealthPro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-02", "keywords": "Life Planning Strategies, Medicare, estate planning, bypass trust, Medicare surtax", "sailthru.tags": "lifehealthpro, article, 53b47bfb140ba01863962b40, Features, Life Planning Strategies, Medicare,surtax,Medicare surtax,kiddie tax,bypass trust,estate planning", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.lifehealthpro.com/lifehealthpro/article/2014/07/02/06-19-14-feature-life-nawrocki.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6c6\"", "article_summary": "Complex trusts should consider the Medicare surtax issue as an opportunity to extend a bypass trust to all descendants.\nWho might bump up against the Medicare surtax?\nOne of the most annoying parts of the latest round of estate tax changes is the 3.8 percent Medicare surtax, enacted as part of the Affordable are Act (or ObamaCare) and taking effect last year.\nObviously, that\u2019s not a very high number, so the surtax applies to an awful lot of trusts and estates.\nFor 2014, the highest tax bracket is reached when a trust or estate reaches $12,150."}
