To give you an idea of what the atmosphere is like, in the typical courtroom there is one table for the plaintiff and one for the defendant and not much else is needed.\n\nHowever, since this case involves several parties and legal teams the use of additional tables and even the jury box was necessary. Thirteen individuals were seated on the MCSO side and nine were on the ACLU side. When court started with a sidebar there were 11 attorneys huddled around Judge Murray Snow, making it look like a bunch of reporters surrounding a quarterback after a game.\n\nAlthough there were little to no fireworks in the courtroom (in fact, I caught someone over on the MCSO side falling asleep numerous times with his mouth wide open), important information did come out in the questioning.\n\nSheridan admitted to significant knowledge of the connection and interaction between Dennis Montgomery and MCSO and also admitted he did not turn over the 1,459 identification cards when he discovered them. Yes, he was aware of Snow\u2019s February order instructing the office to do just that.\n\nThe initial questioning focused on the Seattle investigation and confidential informant Dennis Montgomery. ACLU attorney Cecilia Wong was relentless in her questioning of Sheridan and his knowledge of MCSO\u2019s interaction with, and financial support of, Montgomery.\n\nIt was made clear that Sheridan had reviewed information provided by Montgomery, had discussed the credibility of his work with others in MCSO and even approved Montgomery\u2019s expenditures.\n\nInterestingly, there was significant discussion about Sheridan\u2019s suspicions that Montgomery had obtained documents and information illegally and, despite these suspicions, MCSO continued to pay Montgomery into 2015.\n\nIt also came out that Sheridan was aware that a four-bedroom house was being rented in Seattle with one bedroom devoted to the housing of expensive computer equipment. Was this the place where the elusive 50 or so hard drives came from, that were not turned over? Possibly.\n\nThe most interesting questioning came right before lunch when Sheridan admitted that although he was aware of the court\u2019s February 2015 order to turn over documents such as the IDs, he did not inform the court monitor of their existence or turn them over.\n\nSheridan explained that in July of this year he was informed by Capt. Steve Bailey that Sgt. Jonathan Knapp had turned in 1,459 identification cards to the property department that he had collected over several years.\n\nThis concerned Sheridan because a policy had recently been issued regarding the handling of identification cards and he knew the court, the court monitor and the plaintiffs would take the issue very seriously.\n\nAt that time he decided to confer with MCSO\u2019s attorney, Michelle Iafrate, about what to do. Because of this, his attorney will likely take her place on the stand shortly.\n\nAlthough some things are still confusing, what is clear is that this hearing will not end anytime soon. There are too many twists and turns and tangents in this case and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are not going to let sleeping dogs lie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was on the stand again Friday in the civil contempt hearing against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the department.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was on the stand again Friday in the civil contempt hearing against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the department.", "title": "MCSO chief deputy retakes stand in Arpaio hearing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/27/2776/277673.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-27T09:35:41+00:00", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/660938/legally-speaking-mcso-chief-deputy-retakes-stand-in-contempt-hearing-that-could-last-a-while/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was on the stand again Friday in the civil contempt hearing against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the department.", "title": "MCSO chief deputy retakes stand in Arpaio hearing", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/27/2776/277673.jpg", "creator": "@ktar923", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "General", "published_time": "2015-09-25T14:15:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-27T09:35:41+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6ce\"", "article_summary": "Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was on the stand again Friday in the civil contempt hearing against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the department.\nJonathan Knapp had turned in 1,459 identification cards to the property department that he had collected over several years.\nAlthough some things are still confusing, what is clear is that this hearing will not end anytime soon.\nSheridan admitted to significant knowledge of the connection and interaction between Dennis Montgomery and MCSO and also admitted he did not turn over the 1,459 identification cards when he discovered them.\nThirteen individuals were seated on the MCSO side and nine were on the ACLU side."}
