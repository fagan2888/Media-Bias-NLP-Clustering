Atheists say, \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d And not just atheist luminaries such as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher. I refer to the several hundred hostile responses from atheists to my previous AlterNet piece, in which I cited the most exhaustive and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism ever conducted.\n\nAccording to the Suicide Terrorism Database at Flinders University in Australia, which accounts for all suicide bombings committed in the Middle East between 1981 and 2006, it is politics, not religious fanaticism, that leads to terrorists blowing themselves up. The study shows that:\n\n\u201c\u2026though religion can play a vital role in the recruitment and motivation of potential future suicide bombers, their real driving-force is a cocktail of motivations including politics, humiliation, revenge, retaliation and altruism. The configuration of these motivations is related to the specific circumstances of the political conflict behind the rise of suicide attacks in different countries.\u201d\n\nThe findings of the Flinders University study are supported by the research conducted at the University of Chicago\u2019s Project on Security and Terrorism, which was partly funded by the Defense Department\u2019s Threat Reduction Agency. The authors, Robert A. Pape and James K. Feldman, examined more than 2,200 suicide attacks across the world from 1980 to present. Their research reveals that more than 90 percent of suicide attacks are directed at an occupying force. Of the 524 suicide terrorists carried out in the past 30 years, more than half of the attackers were secular. Let that rock your worldview.\n\nMore than 95 percent of all suicide attacks have a strategic goal in common\u2014to compel an occupying force to withdraw from territory the terrorists prize. From Lebanon to Sri Lanka to the West Bank to Chechnya, the central goal of every suicide terrorist campaign has been to resist military occupation by a democracy. Pape, who is also the author of Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism, rejects outright the view that Islam is the root of the problem. \u201cRather, the taproot is American military policy.\u201d The notion that Islamic fundamentalism is bent on world domination is \u201cpure fantasy,\u201d he argues, warning that an attempt by the West to force Muslim societies to transform \u201cis likely to dramatically increase the threat we face.\u201d\n\nThis evidence is not good enough for atheists. \u201cIslam IS a major problem,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cMuslims for the most part aren\u2019t but Islam is. It is filled with violence and hate and intolerance that is very easily gulped down by poverty stricken illiterate folks and political leaders with nefarious aspirations that are rooted in psychopathy and sociopath tendencies.\u201d\n\nTo continue to believe that Islam is the root of Middle Eastern terrorism is to willfully ignore the best available science and reason, much the same way that Christian fundamentalists maintain the belief that the earth is less than 7,000 years old. As a nation, we are unable to deal intelligently with real and complex problems when much of the population clings to superstition, false logic, unreason, and dangerous ideas.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been great in large part because it respects understanding and discussion of important ideas and concepts, and because it is free to change course. Intelligent decisions require putting all the facts before us and considering new approaches, \u201cPape writes. He adds that, \u201cthe first step is recognizing that occupations in the Muslim world don\u2019t make Americans any safer\u2014in fact, they are at the heart of the problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why terrorist attacks so often cause non-believers to abandon reason, science and evidence to blame religion", "title": "Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and atheists\u2019 ugly Islamophobia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why terrorist attacks so often cause non-believers to abandon reason, science and evidence to blame religion", "title": "Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and atheists\u2019 ugly Islamophobia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/richard_dawkins_sam_harris_and_atheists_ugly_islamophobia_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/richard_dawkins2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why terrorist attacks so often cause non-believers to abandon reason, science and evidence to blame religion", "title": "Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and atheists\u2019 ugly Islamophobia", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/richard_dawkins2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "CJ Werleman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Islam, Islamophobia, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd928d\"", "article_summary": "Atheists say, \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit!\u201d And not just atheist luminaries such as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher.\nOf the 524 suicide terrorists carried out in the past 30 years, more than half of the attackers were secular.\nTopics: AlterNet, Islam, Islamophobia, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetScience says more than 95 percent of terrorist attacks are motivated by politics and revenge.\nTheir research reveals that more than 90 percent of suicide attacks are directed at an occupying force.\nI refer to the several hundred hostile responses from atheists to my previous AlterNet piece, in which I cited the most exhaustive and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism ever conducted."}
