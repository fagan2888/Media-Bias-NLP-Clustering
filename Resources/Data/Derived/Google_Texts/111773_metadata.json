Claire McCaskill (D-MO) questioned former Valeant CFO Howard Schiller about the company\u2019s February 2015 decision to increase the price per vial of Isuprel, a drug used to treat cardiac arrest, from $215 to $1,346. That same month, Valeant boosted the price of the Nitropress, a blood pressure medicine, from $257 to $805 per vial.\n\nLast month, Hillary Clinton called out Turing for boosting the cost of Daraprim, an older drug used to treat infections, from $13.50 to $750 a pill. Donald Trump called the company\u2019s 32-year-old CEO, Martin Shkreli, a \u201cspoiled brat.\u201d\n\nNow the eye-popping markups in the price of both old and new drugs is drawing intense interest from federal and state prosecutors. The controversy is turning into a perfect storm for the drug industry, with both politicians and state and federal prosecutors demanding justification for their drug pricing policies.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happened is that some of these companies \u2026 in a remarkable feat of poor political timing stuck their heads way, way out of the foxhole and raised prices seemingly unaware that we\u2019re in the midst of a presidential election where there\u2019s a lot more sensitivity about all of these things,\u201d Joseph Antos, a health care specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Drug Company Profits Soar as Taxpayers Foot the Bill\n\n\u201cAnd if you would like to be made a subject of an investigation, this would be a great year to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nFew have done more to arouse public and government hostility to the pharmaceutical industry than Shkreli, a cocky former Wall Street hedge fund manager who purchased Turing and then jacked up the price of Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent after acquiring the rights from Impax Laboratory. Shkreli, who once worked as an intern for TV personality Jim Cramer, exuded arrogance and a healthy disregard for the well-being of sick Americans in numerous tweets on social media and appearances on television.\n\nShkreli ultimately announced that his firm would reduce the price of Daraprim, but without saying by how much. Roughly three weeks after making the promise under pressure from Clinton, Shkreli told Business Insider this week that it wasn\u2019t clear when he would lower the drug and that he wasn\u2019t paying attention to requests by government officials for more information about the drug\u2019s price.\n\nThis week, the New York Attorney General\u2019s office said in a statement to the New York Times that it had launched an investigation into Turing\u2019s operations. However, the probe wasn\u2019t necessarily about price gouging per se \u2013 which is legal under current law \u2013 but for possible anti-trust violations that discouraged competitors from making a generic version of the drug. \u201cWhile competition might ordinarily be expected to deter such a massive price increase,\u201d antitrust bureau chief Eric J. Stock said in its letter to Turing, \u201cit appears that Turing may have taken steps to prevent that competition from arising.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wonder Drugs Blow a $1 Billion Hole in VA\u2019s Budget\n\n\u201cTuring completely undercut the image of the industry as public spirited, and changed the political equation,\u201d said John Rother of the National Coalition on Health Care. \u201cNow there is little effort to defend abusive pricing like that, so [it] opened the door for federal action.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday that Valeant had received two federal subpoenas seeking information on its pricing, distribution and patient support practices in which the company sometimes helps patients make their copayments. The subpoenas were issued by the United States attorney\u2019s offices in Manhattan and Massachusetts.\n\nValeant said in a statement that it was reviewing the subpoenas and \u201cintends to cooperate with the investigations.\u201d Valeant sent a letter to McCaskill on Wednesday, noting that it had spent $544 million on patient assistance last year and anticipated spending $630 million this year.\n\nMcCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Senate Aging Committee, complained yesterday that Valeant CEO Michael Pearson \u201crepeatedly failed to answer questions\u201d about his company\u2019s dramatic hike in the price of lifesaving drugs.\n\nRelated: Cash-Strapped VA May Start Rationing Some Treatments\n\n\u201cIt appears obvious to me that Valeant has been anything but responsive or transparent \u2014 it refused to take any action until served with federal subpoenas, and is still refusing to provide answers to many of the questions I\u2019ve asked,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to continuing my investigation of drug pricing and plan to further explore Valeant\u2019s inadequate response.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal and state prosecutors delivered an unmistakable shot across the bow", "title": "The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Feds-Finally-Make-Move-Soaring-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03232012_Blue_Pills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Feds-Finally-Make-Move-Soaring-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03232012_Blue_Pills_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal and state prosecutors delivered an unmistakable shot across the bow", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b6b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI look forward to continuing my investigation of drug pricing and plan to further explore Valeant\u2019s inadequate response.\u201d\nThe controversy is turning into a perfect storm for the drug industry, with both politicians and state and federal prosecutors demanding justification for their drug pricing policies.\nThat same month, Valeant boosted the price of the Nitropress, a blood pressure medicine, from $257 to $805 per vial.\nLast month, Hillary Clinton called out Turing for boosting the cost of Daraprim, an older drug used to treat infections, from $13.50 to $750 a pill.\nFederal and state prosecutors delivered an unmistakable shot across the bow of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry this week amid mounting concern that soaring drug prices are posing risks to the health of many Americans and blowing a hole in the budgets of federal and state health care programs."}
