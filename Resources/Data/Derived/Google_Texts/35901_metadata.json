That\u2019s the take-away from Betsy Craig, CEO and founder of MenuTrinfo, one of the nation\u2019s leading consulting firms for menu nutrition certification. \u201cUltimately, menu labeling will have a positive impact on the restaurant business,\u201d says Craig, whose company is one of only five in the nation offering nutritional consulting to restaurants. \u201cWhether that restaurant consists of one location or 150, this mandate offers the opportunity to create more exacting measurements on recipes and operational processes. By following recipes more closely, restaurants can maintain and keep down food costs\u2014which is not to say this new government-imposed regulation won\u2019t be a tough way to keep discipline.\u201d\n\nAfter several years of political wrangling and industry-wide debate, the FDA recently posted its final rule for nutritional labeling in chain restaurants. Stand-alone restaurants won\u2019t be impacted by the rule. Those covered under the mandate, set to go into effect in 2016, are chains with 20 or more locations, doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items. The rule, which is an offshoot of the Affordable Health Care Act, requires covered restaurant companies to list calorie information for standard menu items on menus and menu boards and to offer succinct statements about suggested daily caloric intake. Other nutritional information\u2014total calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars and protein\u2014will have to be made available in writing on request.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association (NRA) has been a clear voice in this debate, advocating for restaurant operators. A recent NRA website post stated, \u201cMenu labeling has the potential to improve our nation\u2019s health by allowing guests to make informed choices about the foods that are appropriate for their diet.\u201d But the NRA also warned, \u201cInaccurate or unreliable information could compromise consumer trust in menu labeling and hurt brand loyalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis mandate should help franchises follow processes and recipes. The kitchen will have to follow recipes precisely, or it will open the operation to all kinds of craziness. When the recipe calls for \u00bd cup of sugar or salt, it means \u00bd cup, no more or less.\u201d\n\n\u2014Betsy Craig, MenuTrinfo\n\nWiggle Room for Pizzerias\n\nDue to the sheer number of possible toppings and topping combinations for whole pizzas, the final rule gives pizzeria operators a little bit of wiggle room. Operators can list calories by the slice but have to state how many slices each whole pizza contains. They can also list a range of calories for different pizzas, allowing for the multitude of toppings customers may ask for.\n\nAlthough the FDA is giving restaurants until the end of 2015 to implement the rule, some proactive companies are already gathering their numbers. That includes Atlanta-based pizza chain Mellow Mushroom (mellowmushroom.com), which bills itself as the \u201coriginator of classic Southern pizza born in the free-wheeling hippie culture of the 1970s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people come in, they do care about what they\u2019re eating but not primarily from a caloric point of view,\u201d explains James Knight, general manager of the chain\u2019s Broad Street location in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to ask what our pizza is made of or, if they\u2019re vegan, to ask questions related to those concerns. They\u2019re not stressed about whether our food is high in calories, but whether it\u2019s organic.\u201d\n\nKnight says he doesn\u2019t know if the new calorie listing mandate will impact sales, but he adds that the ruling won\u2019t affect Mellow Mushroom\u2019s tight quality control and recipe discipline.\n\nCraig\u2019s company is the official nutritional consultant for the National Pizzeria Council, chaired by executives from some of the top brand names in the industry, including CiCi\u2019s Pizza (cicispizza.com) and Rosati\u2019s Pizza (rosatispizza.com) in Chicago. Craig believes the FDA rule will help pizzeria operators improve quality control and potentially hold down food costs. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, this mandate should help franchises follow processes and recipes,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kitchen will have to follow recipes precisely, or it will open the operation to all kinds of craziness. This is a corporation\u2019s basic function\u2014to streamline and standardize\u2014and this works only if you\u2019re dealing with specifics in procedures and processes. When the recipe calls for \u00bd cup of sugar or salt, it means \u00bd cup, no more or less.\u201d\n\nBut the ruling doesn\u2019t foreshadow the end of creativity in an inherently creative endeavor, Craig adds. \u201cI\u2019m Italian, and my favorite dishes aren\u2019t made from a cookbook,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the FDA\u2019s regulation allows for special, off-the-menu opportunities to change recipes and experiment. You can still offer those 30-day specials and be creative. In the final analysis, pizza is one of those foods that\u2019s a signature item. People come out for an indulgence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think nutritional labeling will hurt sales, but I can\u2019t be sure until it\u2019s implemented. The numbers will look kind of big [to customers], and some eyes might be opened.\u201d\n\n\u2014James Knight, Mellow Mushroom\n\nThe Effect On Mom-and-Pops\n\nSo what about the typical mom-and-pop pizzeria that\u2019s not affected by the ruling? Craig advises everyone in the restaurant business to be aware that increased nutrition transparency is a trend that won\u2019t go away. Smaller independent operators should embrace the spirit of the ruling and look for ways to make nutrition information a marketing advantage, she notes. \u201cThe national health statistics propelling these changes are very real and alarming. Two-thirds of the country is overweight. Menu nutrition data is simply information, and customers will decide for themselves how to use it. We\u2019ve done labeling with packaged goods for 20 years, and it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s here to stay. The foodservice industry will be better off if it tries to understand how to make the requirement into a positive. For people like me, who eat out constantly, this labeling will provide a service.\u201d\n\nThe rule may be good for the consumer, but there will be a learning curve for restaurants, Craig admits. \u201cThis transition is not going to be smooth or easy. However much time operators have allotted to gather the nutrition data and post it, you can be sure it will take twice that much time to get the job done. For restaurants that haven\u2019t even started down this path yet, I have a deep concern. They need to get someone to help them with the process. Restaurant owners are not trained nutritionists.\u201d\n\nLooming speed bumps aside, Craig believes the FDA\u2019s final rule is an improvement over previous versions\u2014especially for the pizza industry. \u201cNow we have specific language in the rule,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil this latest version, the FDA was not being specific. One pizza restaurant might label a serving size as a square, while another might include the whole pizza, so you\u2019re talking about the difference between 1,600 or 200 calories. We finally arrived at a definition of a serving meaningful to the common person. We\u2019re calling it a \u2018discrete serving unit,\u2019 and it describes what the portion looks like when you pick up a piece of pizza. Now we know what to do.\u201d\n\nFor pizzeria managers like Knight, however, that course of action seems a little less clear. \u201cI don\u2019t think nutritional labeling will hurt sales, but I can\u2019t be sure until it\u2019s implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cThe numbers will look kind of big [to customers], and some eyes might be opened.\u201d\n\nAndy Knef is PMQ\u2019s associate editor.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Pizza, pizzeria, PMQ, Betsy Craig, MenuTrinfo, Mellow Mushroom, nutritional labeling, menu labeling, FDA", "description": "Only time will tell how new rules for nutritional menu labeling will impact the pizza restaurant business.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda98b\"", "article_summary": "Only time will tell how new rules for nutritional menu labeling will impact the pizza restaurant business.\nThe National Restaurant Association (NRA) has been a clear voice in this debate, advocating for restaurant operators.\nBy Andy KnefAccording to the NRA, nutritional menu labeling can play a role in improving the nation\u2019s overall health, but restaurant operators worry about how it will affect their bottom lines.\nThe FDA\u2019s new menu labeling requirements could help pizzerias control costs, but will they also hurt sales?\nNutritional labeling requirements for pizza restaurant menus will challenge operators\u2019 bottom lines, but they could end up having a beneficial effect, too."}
