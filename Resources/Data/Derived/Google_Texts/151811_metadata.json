After about four years of playing baseball, Moore is returning to football and joining the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nMoore was an all-state selection in baseball and football in high school. His old coaches were the ones who spread the word about a potential return to football to universities in the area. Moore visited Georgia, Georgia Tech, Alabama and North Carolina State.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a whirlwind for the first 10 days there after he got released,\u201d Mark Crews, Moore\u2019s high school coach, told the Gwinnett Daily Post. \u201cHe kind of repeated the recruiting process that usually takes months in a week or so.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround time was quite remarkable.\n\n\u201cI had no idea I\u2019d have the opportunity to play football at places like that,\u201d Moore told the newspaper. \u201cI forgot baseball easily that first week, visiting all these campuses. Within the first week, I knew I was going to play college football even if I had another baseball opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhy did he choose Georgia? Location. Location. Location.\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s close to home,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my baseball career playing far away from home, and it was tough for me, tough for my parents, my friends, my brothers. They couldn\u2019t come see me. Georgia\u2019s close to my house so I can drive home when I want. My parents can be at every game. My dad being a Georgia alum and my brother being at the University of Georgia. I know it\u2019s something they\u2019re excited for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After about four years of playing baseball in the Boston Red Sox organization, Nick Moore is returning to football and joining the Georgia Bulldogs.", "og": {"site_name": "Today's \"U\"", "description": "After about four years of playing baseball in the Boston Red Sox organization, Nick Moore is returning to football and joining the Georgia Bulldogs.", "title": "Released Red Sox Prospect Joins Georgia Football - Today's U", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://frsports-bucket-0001.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/06/21205326/357120826280_GCL_Red_Sox_at_GCL_Tigers.jpg", "height": 667}, "updated_time": "2015-07-09T16:33:23+00:00", "url": "http://www.todaysu.com/u-news/released-red-sox-prospect-joins-georgia-bulldogs-football/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Within two days of his release from the Boston Red Sox organization, Nick Moore found himself a new home in a new sport.
