Sioux Falls, SD

Hundreds of residents from the Sioux Falls community gather for a yearly tradition today.

The 39th annual Goodwill of the Great Plains Community Thanksgiving Dinner provides a traditional harvest meal with all the trimmings. The dinner is aimed to help those who may not have a place to go for thanksgiving. For many who attend the event every year the dinner goes beyond a hot meal.

"Each year that we have it we have more and more people show up. But it's a great time for fellowship also, the food is wonderful but the fellowship is even better,‚Äù Betty Durfee with Great Plains Goodwill said.

The community dinner expects to feed over a thousand people every year.
