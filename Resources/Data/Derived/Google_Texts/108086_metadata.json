As a result, none of them faces well-funded challengers this fall.\n\n\"Redistricting made the two Democratic seats safer, and it pretty much left the rest of the state open to Republicans,'' said George Connor, head of the political science department at Missouri State University in Springfield. As a result, he added, the only real congressional contests are intra-party affairs in the August primaries.\n\nIn the St. Louis area, the comfortable congressional incumbents include U.S. Reps. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, in the 1st District; Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, in the 2nd District; and Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth, in the 3rd District.\n\nAll have opponents on the Nov. 4 ballot. But most of those rivals have raised little money and have been largely invisible on the campaign trail.\n\nLieber cites campaign-finance limits in bid against Wagner\n\nThe most notable exception is in the 2nd District, where Democrat Arthur Lieber is making another shot at the 2nd District, this time against Wagner, who first won the seat in 2012.\n\nThe GOP-leaning district includes much of west and south St. Louis County and part of St. Charles County. Lieber first sought the seat in a 2010 bid against then- U.S. Rep. Republican Todd Akin, R-Wildwood.\n\nLieber\u2019s campaign is distributing yard signs this week and trying to get Wagner to agree to a debate.\n\nBut even Lieber acknowledges the long odds he faces in challenging Wagner, who\u2019s swiftly becoming a Republican star on Capitol Hill \u2013 and has at least $1.4 million in the bank, as of her last campaign report with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nLieber hasn\u2019t had to file any FEC reports because he\u2019s raised and spent less than $5,000. But he says he will file a report in a couple weeks that will show donations of about $35,000.\n\nLieber says one of his key issues is poverty: \u201cFerguson is the price we pay for not dealing with this issue.\u201d\n\nHe is also concerned about campaign-finance reform. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we can have real change in the country when people holding those offices are beholden to big monied interests,\u201d Lieber said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be that way.\u201d\n\nWagner's spokesman Patrick Howell says she\u2019s primarily focusing on fiscal issues, jobs and fighting sex trafficking.\n\nWagner is highlighting her efforts to protect 13,000 area jobs tied to Boeing\u2019s production of the F-18 Growler aircraft, and her opposition to various parts of President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda \u2013 including the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which she believes are too costly and limit the public\u2019s choices.\n\nWagner also emphasizes that she supported 350 bills that passed the GOP-controlled House but have been blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cShe\u2019s running for re-election because the job isn\u2019t done,\u2019\u2019 her spokesman said.\n\nWagner has attracted national attention with her congressional proposals to attack sex trafficking, which she believes has particularly put children and women in danger.\n\nBesides Lieber, Wagner also faces Libertarian Bill Slantz.\n\nWagner appears to feel confident enough about her own re-election that she\u2019s also campaigning for other Republicans this fall, most of them in the St. Louis area.\n\nHer favored candidates include Rick Stream, the GOP nominee for St. Louis County executive, as well as Republican state Senate candidates Jay Ashcroft in the 24th District in west St. Louis County and Paul Wieland in Jefferson County\u2019s 22nd District.\n\nWagner also is assisting at least six Republicans running for the Missouri House, her spokesman said, and trying to beef up the Republican infrastructure in her congressional district.\n\nClay confident in 1st District\n\nIn the 1st District, U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., reports seeing little of his rivals: Republican Daniel Elder and Libertarian Robb Cunningham.\n\nClay\u2019s district primarily includes the city of St. Louis, north St. Louis County and parts of south and west St. Louis County.\n\nClay\u2019s campaign spokesman, his sister Michelle Clay, said that he\u2019s focusing on a number of key groups, including the elderly, religious organizations and labor.\n\nThe congressman \u201cis continuing to deliver his energetic, progressive campaign message that focuses on jobs, education, health care, housing and defending the right to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nMichelle Clay added, \u201cHe is also demanding that House Republicans, who have presided over the least productive Congress in history, finally allow a vote on raising the minimum wage, comprehensive immigration reform, equal pay for equal work, investing in our infrastructure to create jobs, and extending emergency unemployment benefits.\u201d\n\nLike Wagner, Clay \u2013 in office since 2001 -- also is confident enough about his own re-election chances that he\u2019s planning \u201cto go on the campaign trail to help both House and Senate candidates in close races,\u2019\u2019 his sister said.\n\nThe congressman's last campaign report showed him with $274,833 in the bank.\n\nIn 3rd District, focus on economy\n\nMissouri\u2019s sprawling 3rd District runs from Jefferson County to west of Jefferson City. It also includes western St. Charles County.\n\nRepublican Luetkemeyer, a farmer and businessman, has been in Congress since 2008. He originally represented the state\u2019s 9th congressional district, but it was revamped into the 3rd District when Missouri lost a district after the 2010 census.\n\nHis last campaign report showed the congressman with almost $1 million in the bank.\n\nLuetkemeyer says he\u2019s been traveling around the district to promote his message of \u201clow taxes, limited government and a strong military.\u201d\n\nHe also points to his work on river issues, particularly those affecting the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Luetkemeyer sits on the port commisision dealing with the Mississippi River.\n\nMany of the district residents that he\u2019s met have made clear, he said, \u201cthey want an economy that\u2019s back on track.\u201d They\u2019re also concerned about health-care costs, and the Affordable Care Act, which Luetkemeyer opposed.\n\nIn any case, Luetkemeyer says he hasn\u2019t seen his opponents on the Nov. 4 ballot: Democrat Courtney Denton and Libertarian Steven Hedrick.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Missouri voters will make decisions this fall on who will fill all eight of the state\u2019s congressional districts.
