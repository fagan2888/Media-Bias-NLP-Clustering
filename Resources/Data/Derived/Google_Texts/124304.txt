On “The O’Reilly Factor” Wednesday evening, host Bill O’Reilly provided a final take on Tuesday’s Republican debate, noting that Trump “dominated” it, while the likes of Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Ben Carson did little to stop their “descent in the polls.”

He also returned to the conversation about Trump he had with conservative icon Charles Krauthammer after the debate. “Charles believes the man is unqualified to be president and says some of Trump’s statements are ‘nonsensical.’ I see it differently.”

“Donald Trump understands the anger sweeping America and is tapping into that,” he continued. “He is not concerned that much with policy — he is running on emotion. His strategy has been brilliant, but if you take what he says literally, he can be a frightening guy.”

“I see many of his statements as over-the-top rhetoric, designed to get him votes, not necessarily written-in-stone policy pronouncements,” O’Reilly said. “Talking Points does not endorse candidates, does not root, does not promote.”

After reminding his audience that — solely for the purpose of being able to make this very statement — O’Reilly is “a registered independent,” he said that he “watches all powerful people and holds them to account. Trump has brought politics center-stage by sheer force of personality and that is a good thing. Whether or not he would be a good president is quite something else — that is for you to decide.”
