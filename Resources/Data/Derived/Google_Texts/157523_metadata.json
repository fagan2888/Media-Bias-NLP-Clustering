Nevada the latest to scrap exchange\n\nNevada has become the latest state to scrap its crippled Obamacare exchange and join the federal HealthCare.gov for at least a year.\n\nThe Silver State, which had seemed to start strong last October before smashing into a wall of technical problems, is the only state with a Republican governor that ran its own health insurance exchange in 2014. Gov. Brian Sandoval had argued that it was important for his state to steer its own exchange, even though he opposed Obamacare.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the Nevada exchange board decided Tuesday that its effort couldn\u2019t be salvaged in time for the 2015 enrollment season that starts in November. Nevada becomes the fourth state to admit its enrollment system, which cost tens of millions of dollars, is beyond repair and move to replace it with a substantially new one.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nThe board of the exchange, known as Nevada Health Link, voted unanimously to end its relationship with Xerox, the vendor that had received a $75 million contract to build the online enrollment portal. Instead, it will fold into HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many broken promises from Xerox on how they\u2019re going to fix it that at some point it just becomes not credible,\u201d said Marie Martin Kerr, a member of the board appointed by Sandoval.\n\nBoard members left the door open to retaking control of Nevada\u2019s exchange after 2015 but emphasized that they can lean on HealthCare.gov as long as they choose.\n\nUnder Sandoval, a popular GOP governor seen as having possible national aspirations, Nevada opted for both the state exchange and expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoth were political risks because Obamacare is so toxic for Republicans. Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston said the exchange\u2019s implosion could haunt Sandoval.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that he\u2019s the guy who decided to erect the exchange and it\u2019s an unmitigated, expensive disaster, it\u2019s an issue he will have to deal with in any future run,\u201d Ralston said. \u201cCould it hurt him being considered for veep, if that ever were to seriously happen? Perhaps. He\u2019s just lucky the Democrats didn\u2019t have a real candidate against him this year.\u201d\n\nSandoval blames the contractor.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the board was placed in this position because Xerox has failed to perform its contractual duties. The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange Board is statutorily charged with deciding the future of Nevada Health Link. The board made the best decision it could under these difficult circumstances,\u201d Sandoval\u2019s press secretary, Tyler Klimas, said in an email.\n\nTwo other GOP governors \u2014 New Mexico\u2019s Susana Martinez and Idaho\u2019s Butch Otter \u2014 tried to get state exchanges up in 2014 but the exchanges weren\u2019t ready in time and deferred to HealthCare.gov. They\u2019re now working to get exchanges running in 2015. Michigan\u2019s Rick Snyder also backed the state exchange but his GOP-majority Legislature rebuffed him.\n\nThirty-six states, mostly led by Republicans, relied on the federal exchange for enrollment, and that number appears likely to rise in 2015. Massachusetts and Oregon, both Democratic states that enthusiastically embraced the health law, have taken steps toward joining HealthCare.gov. Maryland has scrapped its system but is trying to adapt a version of Connecticut\u2019s successful exchange.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said that he supports any solution that would repair his state\u2019s crippled insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cWhatever the governor and the Legislature wants, I support,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\nNevada initially set out to enroll 118,000 people by March 31, but severe tech problems forced state officials in January to slash the projection to 50,000. The exchange spewed out inaccurate information to people signing up, including incorrect subsidy amounts for low-income people. As of May 10, just 35,000 had officially enrolled.\n\nXerox pleaded with the exchange board Tuesday to give it another chance, promising to fix the system quickly. Sandoval had said earlier this year that he had gotten a personal assurance from the company\u2019s CEO that it would get done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being very aggressive with Xerox to ensure it is doing what it has to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold Xerox\u2019s feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nBut the Nevada exchange board lost patience with the company and decided to move on.\n\n\u201cI have no appetite for that at all,\u201d said Lynn Etkins, vice chairwoman of the board, when discussing the prospect of keeping Xerox. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a smart move for the board. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a smart move for Nevada.\u201d\n\nHealth insurers, too, pressured the board to fire Xerox and join the federal system.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is time to make a change,\u201d the Nevada Association of Health Plans wrote in a letter to the board.\n\nBoard members were primarily concerned that moving to the federal exchange would scramble the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which has been relying on the state-run system to steer people to the proper programs. That one-stop option is not available on the federal system.\n\nNevada officials met with senior Obama administration health officials in Washington last week and were encouraged to consider transferring control to the feds. Those who attended the meeting said CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner stressed that Nevada had little time to make a decision and said June 30 would be the firm deadline to decide whether to join HealthCare.gov.\n\nJoining HealthCare.gov was among a range of options considered by the board, including continuing with Xerox, hiring a new contractor or borrowing another state\u2019s technology to try to rebuild the system.\n\nLike Nevada, Oregon and Massachusetts took steps to join the federal exchange in recent weeks. Maryland, too, scrapped its system but opted to borrow Connecticut\u2019s technology to salvage a state-run system. It\u2019s unclear if the Obama administration will approve that decision.\n\nNevada officials also considered adopting another state\u2019s system, but some board members raised concerns about its cost.\n\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It will join HealthCare.gov, the federal system, for at least a year.", "title": "Nevada the latest to scrap exchange", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/nevada-end-obamacare-exchange-healthcare-brian-sandoval-106897.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/26/140226_healthcaregov_obamacare_website5_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,States,Health Care,HealthCare.Gov,Nevada", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It will join HealthCare.gov, the federal system, for at least a year.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecc1\"", "article_summary": "Nevada the latest to scrap exchangeNevada has become the latest state to scrap its crippled Obamacare exchange and join the federal HealthCare.gov for at least a year.\nThe Silver State Health Insurance Exchange Board is statutorily charged with deciding the future of Nevada Health Link.\nStory Continued BelowBut the Nevada exchange board decided Tuesday that its effort couldn\u2019t be salvaged in time for the 2015 enrollment season that starts in November.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold Xerox\u2019s feet to the fire.\u201dBut the Nevada exchange board lost patience with the company and decided to move on.\nLike Nevada, Oregon and Massachusetts took steps to join the federal exchange in recent weeks."}
