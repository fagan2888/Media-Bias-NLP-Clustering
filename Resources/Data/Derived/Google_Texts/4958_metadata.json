If the challenge to the law is upheld, after a short while they may not have to worry about complying with it anymore.\n\nBut nobody should go floating off on a cloud of dreamy happiness at the thought of the ACA going poof. Gutting it could very well crash the insurance markets in the three dozen states that didn\u2019t set up exchanges \u2014 not a happy prospect for an economy that, regardless of the booming stock markets, is hardly scoring robust growth as it is.\n\nSome views on the ACA are, of course, extreme. Since the law is so often bashed, allow me to even the scales just a bit.\n\nJust the other day, the new Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson was on TV saying that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing to happen in this nation since slavery.\u201d It was actually a clip from 2013, but let\u2019s assume his feelings haven\u2019t changed. Indeed, last year he specified that the ACA is worse than 9/11, calling the latter \u201can isolated incident.\u201d\n\nAn editorial shortly after that in Outside the Beltway captured my feeling about that: \u201cRegardless of what one\u2019s opinion about the Affordable Care Act might be, anyone asserting that it is worse than a terrorist attack that killed 3,000 people and set the nation on a course toward more than a decade of war, new restrictions on civil liberties, torture, drone attacks, and NSA spying all authorized by sitting Presidents, and all the security restrictions we must now deal with on a daily basis, is quite simply a fool.\u201d\n\nHeavyweight Fight\n\nIn April I attended a half-day health-care conference in New York City called the Sun Life Wake Up Summit, hosted by Sun Life Financial. Sun Life scored a coup with one session\u2019s speakers. On the left was Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor Jonathan Gruber, who was heavily involved in creating the ACA (and also in writing the look-alike Massachusetts Health Connector health-care reform law launched when Mitt Romney was governor of the commonwealth). On the right was Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute and arguably the most ardent Obamacare opponent walking the Earth.\n\nActually they were on the left and right only figuratively. They were interviewed separately by Bloomberg reporter Shannon Pettypiece, and they appeared on stage together for a brief Q&A session, but they did not debate face to face. What a shame, but also a good thing, I suppose. We might have witnessed some actual spontaneous combustion.\n\nGruber, up first, was asked how the ACA is doing so far. \u201cIt\u2019s still early, but it\u2019s doing pretty well,\u201d he said. He noted that 14 million previously uninsured Americans, about 30% of the total uninsured, are now covered; that there\u2019s no evidence of major disruption to the insurance market; and that there\u2019s also no evidence of large companies dropping employer-sponsored coverage.\n\n\u201cMost importantly,\u201d he said, \u201cwe fixed a broken nongroup insurance market. America was the only nation in the developed world where you could be denied insurance or have your insurance dropped because you became sick. That\u2019s sort of not the idea of insurance.\u201d\n\nFor 2014, Gruber said, non-group premiums in the federal exchange came in about 15% below what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had projected; and this year grew only 2% to 4%, compared with a 10% to 12% growth trend before the law. He added that over the five years since the law was passed the government\u2019s price tag for the law is about 20% below what the CBO had initially estimated.\n\nThen he was asked about the case before the Supreme Court, called King v. Burwell. At the heart of the case are several passages in the law mentioning subsidies being available in states that established an exchange, versus language elsewhere in the law stating that the government would establish an exchange for use in states that did not do so. The government contends that the latter was intended to make subsidies available in every state to people who met income tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like asking the framers of the Constitution [what they were thinking],\u201d Gruber said. \u201cAll the framers of this law are alive. No one who ever worked on this law has said it means what the plaintiffs in this case say it means.\u201d\n\nAsked what would happen if the Supreme Court sides with the plaintiffs, he suggested that it would be far-fetched to think that Congress would intervene to salvage the ACA, given how many people in the two chambers were elected while opposing it, or that states would then set up their own exchanges.\n\nGruber said, \u201cI do know that there are now consensus estimates from two independent sources, the Urban Institute and the Rand Corporation, which suggest that if this case goes in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, 8 to 10 million Americans will lose health insurance \u2026 and as a result premiums in the non-group market will go up by 35 to 50%.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the ACA as a three-legged stool, with the insurance-market reforms made possible by the individual mandate, which in turn is made possible by the subsidies. \u201cWhy would Congress write a law which sets up all this mechanism, and deny a leg of the stool which would cause it to collapse?\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps, the Bloomberg reporter offered, it was to encourage states to set up their own exchanges?\n\n\u201cYou would have thought if that was the case,\u201d Gruber replied, \u201cthat there would be something in the record to indicate that and that states would have known it. If this was set up that way, it was very poorly designed, because no states knew it was part of the plan.\u201d\n\nOn the Other Hand\n\nThen it was Cannon\u2019s turn. Gruber had said that a fair evaluation of the ACA should rest not on anecdotes but rather on aggregate results. Not to be deterred, Cannon began by illustrating Obamacare\u2019s ills via an anecdote about Kevin Pace, a teacher at a community college in Virginia that cut employees\u2019 hours so that it would not be subject to the ACA\u2019s employer mandate to provide affordable health insurance to everyone working 30 or more hours a week. In the process, $8,000 was sliced out of Pace\u2019s income, according to Cannon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an unintended consequence that occurs with mandates like this,\u201d said Cannon. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough when those unintended consequences are awful. But what happened here is that the IRS did not have the authority to impose those penalties\u201d (i.e., the tax penalties collected under the employer mandate and the individual mandate).\n\nIn the Supreme Court case, he said, \u201cThe facts and the law are 100% on the plaintiffs\u2019 side. The government doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\u201d He then got in a good line: \u201cWhich means that the challengers\u2019 odds of winning in court are about 20%.\u201d\n\nHe explained that \u201cbecause the courts are so deferential to the government in cases like this, when you take on the government you\u2019re betting against the casino. The case wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far if there were anything on the government\u2019s side that supported the IRS\u2019s interpretation of the statute.\u201d\n\nCongress, he insisted, cannot command states to implement federal programs. \u201cThe Supreme Court has said it can only create incentives for states to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an incentive: you create an exchange, and your residents get these subsidies.\u201d\n\nThe interviewer asked Cannon about the millions of people who will lose health insurance if the court challenge succeeds, and about a projection by the George Washington University School of Public Health that one result could be 10,000 preventable deaths per year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the evidence to show that there is some sort of clear connection between giving people health insurance subsidies and saving lives,\u201d he stated.\n\nAnd, he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything awful that happens after a ruling for the challengers in King v. Burwell, it\u2019s because that is the ACA. The court will be saying, anything bad that happens is the fault of the ACA itself.\u201d\n\nCannon further said that \u201csubsidies don\u2019t reduce the cost of anything \u2014 they shift it, in this case from the premium payer to the taxpayer. For the average federal exchange enrollee who\u2019s receiving a subsidy, it covers 72% of the premium cost. So if those subsidies disappear, people won\u2019t just see 28% of the cost of their ACA coverage, they\u2019ll see 100% \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing, because it means we\u2019re making the costs of this law more transparent to people.\u201d\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhatever you think about the Affordable Care Act, you can hitch your wagon to a brilliant expert as your standard bearer. But while the Supreme Court justices may be political creatures, they must be somewhat happy they don\u2019t have to arbitrate between the likes of Gruber and Cannon. All they have to do is interpret the wording of the statute and decide whether the IRS exceeded its authority.\n\nFor my part, I hope the challenge to the ACA fails. My apologies to the CFOs lined up on the other side. As a society we have a moral obligation to make sure, to the extent possible, that good health is a function of more than personal wealth. That\u2019s more important than a tiny morsel of profit margin.\n\nCan you accept Cannon\u2019s take that subsidies allowing low-income folks to buy health insurance don\u2019t prevent deaths? Or the notion that it\u2019s great for 8 million Americans\u2019 insurance to be sacrificed so that he can score a rhetorical point?\n\nCase closed \u2014 in six or seven weeks.", "article_metadata": {"date": 20150508, "description": "The Supreme Court wields the power to make it happen, but if you are wishing for Obamacare's death, but be careful about what you wish for.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Will You Be Happy if Obamacare Goes Poof?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2015\\/05\\/will-happy-obamacare-goes-poof\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-08 11:16:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-08 13:00:22\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":395063,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"ACA\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Cato Institute\",\"employer mandate\",\"federal subsidies\"],\"categories\":[\"Corporate Finance\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/05\\/Jonathan-Gruber.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The Supreme Court wields the power to make it happen, but if you are wishing for Obamacare's death, but be careful about what you wish for.", "title": "Will You Be Happy if Obamacare Goes Poof?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/05/Jonathan-Gruber.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-08T13:00:22+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/05/will-happy-obamacare-goes-poof/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The Supreme Court wields the power to make it happen, but if you are wishing for Obamacare's death, but be careful about what you wish for.", "title": "Will You Be Happy if Obamacare Goes Poof?", "creator": "@cfo", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Will You Be Happy if Obamacare Goes Poof?", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "Sun Life Financial", "published_time": "2015-05-08T11:16:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T13:00:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aca, affordable care act, cato institute, employer mandate, federal subsidies, individual mandate, insurance exchanges, irs, jonathan gruber, king v. burwell, michael cannon, sun life financial"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court wields the power to make it happen, but be careful about what you wish for.\nBut while the Supreme Court justices may be political creatures, they must be somewhat happy they don\u2019t have to arbitrate between the likes of Gruber and Cannon.\nIn the Supreme Court case, he said, \u201cThe facts and the law are 100% on the plaintiffs\u2019 side.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the evidence to show that there is some sort of clear connection between giving people health insurance subsidies and saving lives,\u201d he stated.\nCan you accept Cannon\u2019s take that subsidies allowing low-income folks to buy health insurance don\u2019t prevent deaths?"}
