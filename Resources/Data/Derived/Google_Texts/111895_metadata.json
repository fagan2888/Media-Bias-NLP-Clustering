It remains to be seen how many troops and how much hardware Russian President Vladimir Putin will pull out of the conflict-ravaged country, especially as Russia intends to maintain its air base in Latakia and a naval base at Tartus.\n\nEven without a strong Russian military presence, Putin will continue to provide weapons to and financially support Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s cash-strapped regime. The Russians will be able to resume airstrikes any time, according to reports.\n\nTwo terrorist groups look to be the big winners out of the current situation: Jabat al-Nusra, which has links to al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nPerhaps more damaging to America\u2019s strategic position both in the region and globally, other nations now see Russia as an equal to the United States.\n\nThe silver lining over the course of the past two weeks surely has been the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas in Syria. Approximately 150,000 civilians living in besieged areas have been able to gain access to life-saving medications, food, and support, according to reports.\n\nThe Cease-Fire\n\nThe talks in Geneva hinge on the fragile cease-fire in Syria holding. Who is a terrorist and who is not a terrorist is an important distinction for the shaky truce in Syria.\n\nThe cease-fire has been supported by all major parties, including the Assad regime and the High Negotiations Committee, which includes some 97 opposition groups that agreed to halt the violence for a minimum of two weeks.\n\nThe deal does not include terrorist groups\u2014or, as Putin puts it, \u201cISIS, Jabat al-Nusra, and \u2018other terrorist organizations.\u2019\u201d\n\nAssad has had the support of Iranian ground forces, Hezbollah, and Russia as the Syrian dictator continued to target groups he rightly or wrongly defines as terrorists to suit his own strategic interests.\n\nAssad views any group fighting the regime as terrorists. While ISIS holds delineated territory, making targeted airstrikes straightforward, many other relatively moderate opposition groups operate near areas held by Jabat al-Nusra.\n\nThe current situation in Syria favors the terrorists. Many smaller ISIS-allied groups and Jabat al-Nusra fighters likely will take cover and operate behind civilians\u2014the very population to whom the cessation of hostilities is meant to bring humanitarian relief.\n\nMap: IHS Conflict Monitor\n\nViolations on Both Sides\n\nOpposition media outlets and rebel militia spokesmen aren\u2019t the only groups claiming violations by the Assad regime or Russia. International media, including CNN, have reported instances of attacks across the country.\n\nOne family\u2019s home in rebel-held Aleppo was demolished by an airstrike about 30 hours after the cease-fire went into effect. The most deadly attack on civilians in Aleppo came March 11, after an air raid killed seven civilians, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.\n\nTo collect evidence of the violations, a civilian advocacy group, the Syrian Campaign, created a crowdsourcing mechanism to monitor the cease-fire.\n\nAnother volunteer search-and-rescue humanitarian group operating in local communities throughout Syria collects images and videos and aggregates casualty and attack data through on-the-ground sources, including the \u201cwhite helmets\u201d of Syria Civil Defense.\n\nThe High Negotiations Committee, the main group representing the opposition to the Assad regime, also submitted an official letter to the United Nations outlining what it alleges to be violations of the agreement.\n\nTrends in the South\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently indicated his concerns about potential Syrian peace agreements that empower Iran and Lebanon to attack Israel through their expanded position in Syria.\n\nOver the course of the five-year civil war, Assad has had to rely increasingly on his Iranian friends for weapons, ground troops, and money. Recent regime gains in opposition-held areas in southern Syria near the Israeli border include a key strategic supply route through Sheikh Miskeen in Daraa province. These gains were in fact so significant that Israel sent an envoy to Russia to try to win a halt to its air campaign along the southern front.\n\nJust to the east, Jordan shares equal concern over the balance of power in southern Syria. With an increase in the Assad regime\u2019s fighting that likely targets Western-backed forces and not the al-Nusra Front, ISIS affiliates, or potential terrorist sleeper cells, the possibility of a power vacuum that would greatly benefit ISIS is troubling to security officials in Jordan.\n\nWestern-backed rebel groups currently control all border checkpoints along the Syria-Jordan border. However, if these groups continue to fall into disarray under pressure from attacks by the regime, Iranian forces, and Russian airstrikes, they easily could fall into the hands of extremist factions.\n\nFor Jordanian security officials, this is a deeply concerning scenario.\n\nAccording to reports, the Russian intervention in the South dramatically shifted the dynamics, ultimately strengthening extremists and weakening the moderates. Even if a lull in fighting comes, these scenarios ultimately could take place.\n\nLike Israel, Jordan sent a high-level military delegation to Moscow to convince the Russians to halt airstrikes in the South. That diplomatic mission is believed to have largely failed in securing any binding assurances from Putin.\n\nJordan, unlike Turkey, largely has gone untouched by ISIS terrorism. But fear is increasing that ISIS attacks eventually could take place if the southern front is not delicately controlled.\n\nTo get an idea of how #Russia interprets scope of upcoming ceasefire, see this map.

Last week, Jordanian security officials killed seven ISIS-linked terrorists in a raid in Irbid. Jordan\u2019s second most populous city, Irbid is about nine miles from the Syrian border.\n\nAs the negotiating sides in Geneva wear down the peace process through red line pronouncements\u2014\u201cAssad must go\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cAssad must stay\u201d \u2014the biggest loser is likely to be what\u2019s left of the Western-backed opposition to Assad.\n\nIn the days leading up to the cease-fire, the Assad regime dramatically increased airstrikes, attempting to grab as much territory as possible. This tactic may or may not have been successful, but the slow erosion of opposition positions under the guise of the regime\u2019s \u201ctargeting terrorists\u201d ultimately will strengthen Assad\u2019s negotiating and strategic position in both Geneva and Syria.\n\nAl-Nusra\u2019s recent defeat in northern Syria of the U.S.-backed moderate opposition militia, the Free Syrian Army\u2019s Division 13, indicates the opposition\u2019s weakened positions and greater strategic losses since the cease-fire.\n\nBut what does an agreement or political solution to the crisis in Syria mean without the destruction and elimination of ISIS?\n\nIf Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias, if not the Russians, continue to help the Assad regime wipe out the moderate opposition, ISIS terrorist attacks\u2014such as those in Damascus last month killing 140\u2014will increase in frequency and severity.\n\nRebel losses likely will lead to power vacuums in areas such as Daraa in the south, creating an opportunity for ISIS or al-Qaeda to destabilize Jordan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It remains to be seen how many forces Russia will withdraw from conflict-torn Syria, especially as it intends to maintain an air base and a naval base.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It remains to be seen how many forces Russia will withdraw from conflict-torn Syria, especially as it intends to maintain an air base and a naval base.", "title": "As Russia Withdraws, Who Are Real Winners in Syria?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160311_SyriaCeasefire_Florance.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-15T23:27:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QYFyaG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It remains to be seen how many forces Russia will withdraw from conflict-torn Syria, especially as it intends to maintain an air base and a naval base.", "title": "As Russia Withdraws, Who Are Real Winners in Syria?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160311_SyriaCeasefire_Florance.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2016-03-15T10:05:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T23:27:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "syria, russia syria, ISIS, al-qaeda, Bashar Assad, Hezbollah, syria cease-fire, israel, jordan, Jabat al-Nusra"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1542\"", "article_summary": "In the days leading up to the cease-fire, the Assad regime dramatically increased airstrikes, attempting to grab as much territory as possible.\nTwo terrorist groups look to be the big winners out of the current situation: Jabat al-Nusra, which has links to al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State, or ISIS.\nMap: IHS Conflict MonitorViolations on Both SidesOpposition media outlets and rebel militia spokesmen aren\u2019t the only groups claiming violations by the Assad regime or Russia.\nWhile ISIS holds delineated territory, making targeted airstrikes straightforward, many other relatively moderate opposition groups operate near areas held by Jabat al-Nusra.\nWho is a terrorist and who is not a terrorist is an important distinction for the shaky truce in Syria."}
