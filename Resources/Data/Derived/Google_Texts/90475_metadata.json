CNN \u2014 which became a national punchline for its non-stop non-coverage of non-developments in the case of a missing Malaysian airliner \u2014 hasn\u2019t decided yet whether an attack that left four Americans dead and spurred accusations President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately misled the American public for political gain is worthy of its attention.\n\nAnd Zucker doesn\u2019t care what anyone else in the cable news business thinks about it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be shamed into it by others who have political beliefs that want to try to have temper tantrums to shame other news organizations into covering something,\u201d Zucker told a reporter for the \u201cnewspaper of record.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s of real news value, we\u2019ll cover it.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cothers,\u201d he\u2019s talking about Fox News, of course, which has led coverage of the Benghazi attack and the machinations that led the White House to blame the attack on spontaneous demonstrations over an anti-Muslim video rather than the planned operation it\u2019s now known to have been.\n\nBen Carson riles up Whoopi with welfare truth;\n\nhas conservatives cheering on \u2018The View\u2019\n\nBut his accusation that Fox coverage is determined by its political opposition to the Obama administration is risible, since it\u2019s a projection of the way the mainstream media\u2019s liberal politics have coddled the first black president since even before he was elected. And if President Obama has his way, that\u2019s going to continue with non-coverage of the Benghazi investigation and more blind-eye reporting on the disaster that is Obamacare.\n\nAt a fundraiser Monday night, the president made the marching orders clear, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201c[The] debate we\u2019re having right now is about, what, Benghazi? Obamacare?\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd it becomes this endless loop. It\u2019s not serious. It\u2019s not speaking to the real concerns that people have.\u201d\n\nHe meant it\u2019s not speaking to the real concerns Democrats have about losing control of the Senate for Obama\u2019s last two years in office.\n\nAnd that means it\u2019s not likely to make it to the top of coverage for CNN, the New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media that\u2019s been carrying Obama\u2019s water since 2008.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really the shame of it.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "No one can tell CNN what the news is.
