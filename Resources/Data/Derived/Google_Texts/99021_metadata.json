It concludes that California will need an estimated 8,243 additional primary care physicians by 2030, or an increase of 32 percent of its current workforce.\n\nThe authors identify key barriers that undermine primary care recruitment, such as the growing cost of health training and associated student debt combined with concerns about primary care compensation. It also suggests strategies on how to overcome these barriers.\n\nCurious about the actual state of affairs, I spoke with Laurence Baker, PhD, professor of health research and policy, about the Horizon 2030 report and California\u2019s primary care shortage.\n\nWhy are primary care physicians so important? What happens if we don\u2019t have enough?\n\nWe know primary care has a lot to offer. Research shows that primary care physicians often manage patients in ways that are both less expensive and higher quality \u2014 particularly for patients with complex chronic conditions where primary care physicians can often be more responsive to the complexities of individual patients. Having enough primary care physicians is key to getting our health-care system where it needs to be. If we end up without enough, it\u2019ll be harder to achieve our goals of lowering cost and improving quality. Unfortunately, it\u2019s becoming clear that we aren\u2019t sufficiently staffed up for primary care, especially as health-care reforms like the Affordable Care Act result in more people with access to preventative care and basic health coverage.\n\nHow can we significantly increase the number of primary care professionals in California?\n\nI think we\u2019ll need multi-dimensional approaches that involve governmental policies, actions by private insurance companies, adaptations in medical education and probably more. Over time a shortage in primary care needs to be partly remedied by new physicians training in primary care. So policy can play a role to do things to help make primary care attractive, like ensuring good pay for primary care physicians, since we\u2019ve often had skewed payment methodologies that favor specialties. Expanding training capacity in medical schools could also help. But we also need actions that can help sooner than that, so other things will be needed. We should be expanding nurse practitioner or physician assistant programs, exploring whether incentives like targeted primary care loan forgiveness programs can help, and looking at ways to get people already in medicine to expand their primary care work.\n\nHow accurate are these types of estimates on a future workforce?\n\nI think estimating the future workforce is a difficult thing to do with a lot of precision. Any time you make these kinds of estimates, you have the difficult job of guessing what medicine will look like tomorrow, and medicine is always evolving. In this case, though, while I think one can always question the exact numbers, the overall situation in which we find ourselves is pretty clear. The bottom line is that we haven\u2019t invested enough in primary care.\n\nPreviously: Clickwell Care: An online primary care program designed to meet the needs of young patients and Spotting stellar primary care practices, Stanford study identifies 10 practices that lead to excellence\n\nPhoto by Stethoscopes", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "laurence baker,primary care,news home,stanford medicine", "og": {"image": "http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1178px-Doctors_stethoscope_1.jpg"}, "description": "Curious about the actual state of affairs, I spoke with Laurence Baker, PhD, professor of health research and policy, about the Horizon 2030 report and", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Over time a shortage in primary care needs to be partly remedied by new physicians training in primary care.\nShareAs I waited for my routine checkup recently, I read a report on the critical shortage of primary care physicians in California \u2013 ironic reading material for my primary care physician\u2019s waiting room.\nThe report, titled \u201cHorizon 2030: Meeting California\u2019s Primary Care Workforce Needs,\u201d was recently released by the California Primary Care Association.\nThe authors identify key barriers that undermine primary care recruitment, such as the growing cost of health training and associated student debt combined with concerns about primary care compensation.\nSo policy can play a role to do things to help make primary care attractive, like ensuring good pay for primary care physicians, since we\u2019ve often had skewed payment methodologies that favor specialties."}
