This true story\u2019s power comes from knowing it happened and changed the course of history. It is as improbable as life can be, with a tragic personal twist.\n\nTuring leads a small team in a huge night-and-day effort, racing to break the German Enigma code. The time is World War Two. The place is Bletchley Park, a fine country house the British government has provided to spur the project along.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the NSA]\n\nThe stakes were as high as they can be. The Germans were winning the fight in the air and on the high seas. Perplexed and stumped for two years, Turing realizes they can\u2019t break the complex code without some little slip or clue from the German military operators. The British government, all the way up to Winston Churchill, is pressing for answers. Much depends on breaking Enigma with their own invention, a machine called Christopher.\n\nJust why Turing names the machine Christopher opens a story arc back to the eccentric genius\u2019s past. Turing\u2019s first love as a schoolboy was named Christopher, a kind, bright boy who loved him back. They were \u201cinseparable,\u201d as the headmaster said.\n\nTo be a homosexual in that era was, in a way, to be doomed in a glass prison. It was against the law, meaning that gay men like Turing relied on keeping secrets and breaking codes in their private lives.\n\nRichard Chamberlain, the English actor, told the New York Times in a recent interview, \u201cWhen you grow up in the \u201830s, \u201840s and \u201850s being gay, it not only ain\u2019t easy, it\u2019s just impossible ... I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Alan Turing's Struggles in 'The Imitation Game' Teach Us About Suffering", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "'The Imitation Game' reminds us of the power of personal stories to promote empathy for those who suffer injustice.", "title": "Breaking Codes, Breaking Silences", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-stiehm/2014/12/02/alan-turings-struggles-in-the-imitation-game-teach-us-about-suffering", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e8/dfb777925d23eafe2fe1f0e8edaf00/media:bebf5c7ea35c47c6af5722c65457363c2014HollywoodFilmAwards-Arrivals.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'The Imitation Game' reminds us of the power of personal stories to promote empathy for those who suffer injustice.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Alan Turing's Struggles in 'The Imitation Game' Teach Us About Suffering"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jamie Stiehm,World War II,espionage,University of Virginia,homosexuality,Ferguson, Missouri,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "'The Imitation Game' reminds us of the power of personal stories to promote empathy for those who suffer injustice."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaaee\"", "article_summary": "Turing leads a small team in a huge night-and-day effort, racing to break the German Enigma code.\nBenedict Cumberbatch is the lead actor, playing the British mathematician Alan Turing, in a brilliant ensemble of dramatic talent, including Keira Knightley.\n\"The Imitation Game\" is the saddest story told at the box office all year.\nIt was against the law, meaning that gay men like Turing relied on keeping secrets and breaking codes in their private lives.\nJust why Turing names the machine Christopher opens a story arc back to the eccentric genius\u2019s past."}
