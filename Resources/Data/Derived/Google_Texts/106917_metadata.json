Right now as it is, they\u2019re short-handed in the evening shift. They\u2019re working hard. How are you going to have the full support of the nurses? It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t raise the rates. The revenues for these services at Maluhia and Leahi come from Medicare and Medicaid, and since the government fixes those rates and we\u2019re not allowed to charge anything more than what the government rate is, that\u2019s the only income besides the state funds that we have and yet the expenses continue to go up,\u201d said Dr. Linda Rosen, HHSC CEO.\n\n\u201cOur goals are to stabilize our staffing levels and operate with reduced admissions,\u201d said Derek Akiyoshi, HHSC CEO, Oahu Region. \u201cSocial workers and nursing will plan and minimize the impact with room changes. We\u2019ll listen and do our best to communicate with you and we will provide support.\u201d\n\nThe reduction also calls for the downsizing of one skilled nursing wing, or 38 beds, per facility (76 reduced beds total) and a halt on accepting new patients.\n\nHealthcare officials say their goal is to keep patients in place for as long as possible without having to transfer them to alternate care settings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dozens showed up with questions and concerns over the 15-percent reduction in staff slated to take effect in November.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411526747", "og": {"site_name": "KHON2", "description": "Dozens showed up with questions and concerns over the 15-percent reduction in staff slated to take effect in November.", "title": "Forum addresses questions, concerns over cuts at Leahi Hospital, Maluhia", "url": "http://khon2.com/2015/07/10/forum-addresses-questions-concerns-over-cuts-at-leahi-hospital-maluhia/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/leahi-hospital.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dozens showed up with questions and concerns over the 15-percent reduction in staff slated to take effect in November.", "title": "Forum addresses questions, concerns over cuts at Leahi Hospital, Maluhia", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/leahi-hospital.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@khonnews", "site": "khonnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Working for Hawaii - Hawaii News, Weather, and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.khon", "fb": {"pages": 66874361378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khon2.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b26093ebd87004d2709601aeb29b2013?s=16", "application-name": "KHON2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/khon2news", "published_time": "2015-07-11T03:59:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T04:50:38+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "F8HhCy2NOcu_QvRKzZJGqFMMgASTuCT3_KKw72WqXWw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Leahi HospitalRelated Coverage Dozens of positions at Leahi Hospital, Maluhia will be cut later this yearA public meeting was held Friday to address impending layoffs at both Leahi Hospital and Maluhia nursing home.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re going to have to lay off all these people, these nurses who have been doing a good job with the patients,\u201d said Gladys Fujioka, whose mother resides at Leahi Hospital.\nDozens showed up with questions and concerns over the 15-percent reduction in staff slated to take effect in November.\n\u201cOur goals are to stabilize our staffing levels and operate with reduced admissions,\u201d said Derek Akiyoshi, HHSC CEO, Oahu Region.\nHealthcare officials say their goal is to keep patients in place for as long as possible without having to transfer them to alternate care settings."}
