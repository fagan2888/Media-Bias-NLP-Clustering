Labor Day is over and we\u2019re just getting the itch to shop \u2026 maybe. After all, what\u2019s in it for us?\n\nAs a postmenopausal fashion expert and the former fashion director of two major women\u2019s magazines, I attend the runway circus known as Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week (the next one begins Thursday in New York City).\n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Runway shows are about editors hooking up with advertisers (for financial partnerships), stylists hooking up celeb clients with designers (for freebies), designers hooking up with backers (so they can keep going), and buyers struggling to revive a sick industry that has become too costly, too extreme, too big. No one is truly interested in the 50-plus woman except big-name luxury designers we can\u2019t afford. So here we are, the moneyed superhero consumers with our changing bodies, lifestyle, tastes and needs. No wonder we buy more shoes and bags than clothes. Take fall 2013. We\u2019re skipping: punk and military (again), needle-toe single-sole stilettos (obviously), leather leggings, giant cable sweaters, anything plaid (all fattening), big-shoulder coats and long mid-calf skirts (been there, done that), capes and oversized clutches (impractical). Which leaves five items calling our name. Here\u2019s what may be worth it:\n\nA LADYLIKE LEATHER-ISH SKIRT. Designers love leather for its edge, and so do we, but rising prices have forced more faux leather and wax-coated leather-like fabrics into the mix. OK with us. A knee-length skirt in a pencil, knife-pleated or a A-line style is a good buy. It\u2019s refined but confident. I bet FLOTUS Michelle O shows up in one of these this fall.\n\nZara gold metallic pencil ($139, zara.com/us, ref #2969/245) or Zara coated polyester/viscose pleated skirt ($79.90, zara.com/us, ref #6861/244)\n\nA REAL PAIR OF PANTS. We live in jeans and leggings, but a fresh pair of tailored pants adds instant polish for work and evenings out. To step it up and add warmth, buy one or more pair of narrow ankle-cropped pants. They look great with a long T, a sweater or turtleneck (new again, so dig them out!). Or, for a fresh pantsuit alternative, wear them with an untucked blouse or shirt under a blazer. The bonus is that they work with both flats and low heels. Go for gray, red or pink instead of black this season.\n\nJ. Crew Cafe Capri in wool ($128, jcrew.com) in pink or gray or J. Crew Eaton Boy Trouser in Bi-Stretch Wool ($148, jcrew.com) in graphite or red\n\nTHE NEW PRACTICAL (BUT FUN) SHOES. Shoe shopping is where we get our fix. Now we don\u2019t have to give up comfort for style.If you love flats, choose low ankle-cropped boots, updated loafers, pointy-toe flats (more shoe-like than ballet versions) and lace-up oxfords. For a little lift, choose ankle-cropped booties with substantial cone, block or wedge heels. Look for metallics, animal prints, suede and leather combos, color-blocking, buckles and chains for extra bite!\n\nVince Camuto Velino booties ($129, zappos.com), Nine West Riguma wedge booties ($129, zappos.com), Nine West nude patent pointy-toe flats ($69, zappos.com) or Coach Mara Slip-Ons ($198, zappos.com)\n\nTHE MIXED MEDIA SWEATER. We have enough cardigans and V-necks to last forever, but we like the combo of feeling cozy and looking cool. This fall a big store and retail website trend is the bi-textured sweater cut slim and sleek, slightly relaxed in an A-shape, or shorter in front longer in back with a droptail hem for coverage. The leather-wool combos have the most appeal and won\u2019t be a one-season buy.\n\nBailey 44 Software Faux Leather-Paneled Sweater ($191, saksfifthavenue.com) or J. Crew Merino Leather-Pocket Sweater ($158, jcrew.com)\n\nTHE CHIC MAN-TAILORED TOPCOAT. This is really where the menswear trend makes sense for us. Get a topcoat in skin-boosting camel or ivory or (all hues are big trends within a trend) and use your layering skills to style-up warmth. It\u2019ll look new with those jeans, your cropped pants, and with dresses or skirts.\n\nAsos Knee-Length Overcoat ($143.45, asos.com/us) in camel, Lauren Ralph Lauren Belted Wool Blend Wrap Coat ($340, nordstrom.com) in white or Theory \u201cElizabeth\u201d Wool Blend Coat ($675, nordstrom.com)\n\nAnd don\u2019t give up: Shop flash sales online as the season rolls out for discounts!\n\nFor more beauty and style tips for women 50-plus, see my book The Wardrobe Wakeup, Your Guide to Looking Fabulous at Any Age by Lois Joy Johnson ($16.29, Amazon.com)\n\nPhoto Credits: Runway photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Michael Kors; Zara Metallic Skirt; J Crew Cafe Capri in Wool; Nine West Pointed Toe Flats; J Crew Merino Leather Pocket Sweater; Asos Knee Length Coat.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Fashion is in big trouble.
