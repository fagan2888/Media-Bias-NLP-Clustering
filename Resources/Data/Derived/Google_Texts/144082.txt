Talented singer Shawnee has loaded up her YouTube channel in recent months as anticipation builds for the release of her first EP, Let It Burn. Shawnee's musical roots are on full display in these soulful rock jams -- this is a young artist who grew up on Melissa Etheridge, rocked many a bar with Zeppelin and AC/DC covers, and even performed for a few years as a Shania Twain impersonator. A previous song, "Mirror Me," saw airplay on Canada's MuchMusic, and Shawnee has toured across Canada with Roxette and Glass Tiger.

Don't be confused by the name, though -- Shawnee is Mohawk, the daughter of author Lynne Sherry McLean, a band member of Six Nations of the Grand River. Here are "You Don't Know Me" and "Burn Baby":
