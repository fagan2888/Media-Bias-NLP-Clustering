Marco Rubio was all over the airwaves Wednesday blasting the Obama administration\u2019s momentous move to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.\n\nThe U.S. will establish an embassy in Havana and ease some restrictions on travel and money transfers to the island nation some 230 miles from Miami. The administration will also expand some banking and trade ties, allowing telecommunications companies to build out the necessary infrastructure to provide Internet and other services.\n\nWhile the U.S. embargo against Cuba remains for now \u2014 it\u2019s been in place since 1960 and only Congress can lift it \u2014 President Obama also said he looks forward to engaging lawmakers in a debate about ending those commercial and economic restrictions. \u201cI believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked,\u201d Obama said in a speech announcing the policy changes. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new approach.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cuba Trade Easing \u2014 Good News for Cigar Aficionados\n\nAt least in part, Obama is betting that freer markets (and even increased Internet access) will translate to a freer people in Cuba. In other words, he\u2019s betting, in some ways, on the power of U.S. business. \u201cI believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage, and that increased commerce is good for Americans and for Cubans,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio, among numerous others, sharply disagrees with Obama\u2019s move. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement initiating a dramatic change in U.S. policy toward Cuba is just the latest in a long line of failed attempts by President Obama to appease rogue regimes at all cost,\u201d the senator said in a statement. Rubio said Obama had gained far too little in the way of binding concessions and changes from the Castro regime.\n\nRelated: Boehner Calls Obama\u2019s Cuba Deal a \u2018Mindless Concession\u2019\n\nThe senator went well beyond Obama in his critique, and he painted a very different picture of business. \u201cWhile business interests seeking to line their pockets, aided by the editorial page of The New York Times, have begun a significant campaign to paper over the facts about the regime in Havana, the reality is clear. Cuba, like Syria, Iran, and Sudan, remains a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d he said in his statement. (Obama said he\u2019s instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to review Cuba\u2019s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.)\n\nRubio explained his opposition to lifting the embargo against Cuba \u2014 and expanded on his criticism of American businesses \u2014 in an appearance on CNBC Wednesday morning (and remember as you read these comments that they\u2019re coming from a sitting Republican senator):\n\n\u201cRaul Castro is old. He\u2019s going to die one day. Fidel Castro is already halfway out the door. And they\u2019re going to have to have some level of transition. And what they\u2019re seeking is as much economic growth as possible within the confines of the existing system of government so that it survives permanently moving forward, so that American companies become invested in the status quo in Cuba and then come to Washington and lobby for us not to do anything political.\n\n\u201cLook, last week when we took up a bill advocating on behalf of democracy protestors in Hong Kong, my office got calls from American companies asking us not to do that, and the reason why they didn\u2019t want us to do that is because they have business deals in China and they care more about their bottom line in China than they do about freedom and democracy. So that\u2019s why the Castro regime wants the sanctions lifted, so they can create an economy that they control completely to line their pockets, but also to maintain permanent political control forever on the island. They want us to accept their system of government as a valid system of government, and that\u2019s what the president is doing today.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that the U.S. embargo \u2014 without broader global cooperation \u2014 has also failed to squeeze out the Castro regime, and some argue that it has instead given Cuban leaders an easy scapegoat for the country\u2019s economic weakness. \u201cIndeed, by enabling the island\u2019s rulers to present themselves as the victims of hegemonic bullying, it has shored up support for Cuba abroad and given an excuse for totalitarianism at home,\u201d The Economist said in April in calling for an end to the embargo and suggesting that Obama take some of the very steps he announced today.\n\nRelated: Florida\u2019s Cuban Americans Rejoice at U.S. Policy Overhaul\n\nU.S. politics, especially in south Florida, have allowed the embargo to stay in place for all these decades, whether it was effective or not. Those political calculations have now changed as a new generation of Cuban-Americans comes of voting age. Rubio insisted, though, that his criticism is rooted in principle and not in politics. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if the polls say that 99 percent of people in Florida want to lift the embargo, I would still be for [keeping] it because my goal is freedom and democracy in Cuba,\u201d he said on CNBC.\n\nBoth sides insist they want to promote freedom, but their comments today show they\u2019ve staked out very different positions on how economic incentives should be used to do it \u2014 and the role of business in pushing what Obama called \u201cAmerica\u2019s values.\u201d In the meantime, the opportunity for American companies is clearly appealing.
