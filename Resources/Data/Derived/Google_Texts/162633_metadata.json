Others shake their heads and wonder: Come again why the Houston Texans waived Holliday?\n\nSince the Broncos picked up Holliday in October of last season, he has made five returns for touchdowns in 14 games. His latest was an 81-yard punt return for a touchdown that clinched the Broncos\u2019 41-23 victory against the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any goals as far as how many to get this year. I just try to take one back every week, help my team out,\u201d Holliday said.\n\nGiants punter Steve Weatherford was hitting them low all day. In the fourth quarter, Holliday fielded a punt on the bounce, then took off, running past a couple tacklers, stepping out of a couple more.\n\n\u201cThe key was I waved my guy off and he jumped to the side as soon as the ball bounced,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cThen I saw the hole open, and I hit it.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos have gone 13-0 in the regular season since they claimed Holliday. They are 0-1 in the playoffs, a loss in which Holliday had two of his scoring returns.\n\nClady, Ihenacho injured. The Broncos suffered two significant injuries in the game against the Giants. Strong safety Duke Ihenacho walked out of the locker room with a boot around his badly sprained right ankle. Left tackle Ryan Clady hobbled badly on his wrapped left foot.\n\nMontee bounces back. Montee Ball couldn\u2019t blame anyone else for his first-quarter fumble inside the Giants\u2019 5-yard line that ruined a terrific opening drive by Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning. And he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMy eyes got real big,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt was perfectly blocked. I was going in, and I let my teammates down. That\u2019s the worst feeling. Today I did some good things in the passing game, but there\u2019s no excuse for putting the ball on the ground.\u201d\n\nBall wasn\u2019t benched. He came back and made two catches for 27 yards, although he gained only 16 yards on 12 carries.\n\n\u201cThey had faith in me, and I\u2019m truly, truly grateful for that,\u201d he said.\n\nManning meets Tripucka\u2019s sons. At the Broncos\u2019 team hotel Saturday, quarterback Peyton Manning met with Kelly, T.K. and Mark Tripucka, three of Frank Tripucka\u2019s six sons.\n\nFrank Tripucka died Thursday at 85. He was the Broncos\u2019 first starting quarterback in 1960 and the first Broncos player whose number \u2014 18 \u2014 was retired.\n\nWhen Manning signed with the Broncos in March 2012, Frank Tripucka humbly agreed to surrender his number 18.\n\n\u201cI was explaining to them that in our quarterback room we have a picture of their father,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to wear his number, and it was a good meeting, and they said their dad would have been proud.\u201d\n\nFrank Tripucka\u2019s wake was held Sunday as the Broncos were playing the Giants a short drive away. His funeral will be Monday. Billy Thompson, the team\u2019s director of community outreach, will attend the service.\n\nManning joins 60,000-yard club. Manning logged his 60,000th passing yard Sunday. Only he, Brett Favre and Dan Marino have reached the mark, and Manning did it faster than any. He has 60,256 career yards.\n\nTrevathan rebounds after Week 1 fumble . After committing a boneheaded fumble against Baltimore, linebacker Danny Trevathan finished Sunday\u2019s game with a team-best 10 tackles along with Denver\u2019s only sack.\n\nGiants honor Bill Parcells. The Giants honored Bill Parcells at halftime by giving the former coach his Hall of Fame ring. Parcells, whose first head coaching job was at the Air Force Academy, won two titles coaching the Giants and owns the franchise\u2019s best winning percentage (.611) in the Super Bowl era.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Trindon Holliday picks up fifth TD kick return since joining Broncos", "title": "Trindon Holliday picks up fifth TD kick return since joining Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/trindon-holliday-picks-up-fifth-td-kick-return-since-joining-broncos/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__trindon-hollidayp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__trindon-hollidayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T00:43:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:35:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Every time Trindon Holliday returns a punt or kickoff for a score, the Broncos rejoice.\nSince the Broncos picked up Holliday in October of last season, he has made five returns for touchdowns in 14 games.\nHe was the Broncos\u2019 first starting quarterback in 1960 and the first Broncos player whose number \u2014 18 \u2014 was retired.\nHis latest was an 81-yard punt return for a touchdown that clinched the Broncos\u2019 41-23 victory against the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\u201cThe key was I waved my guy off and he jumped to the side as soon as the ball bounced,\u201d Holliday said."}
