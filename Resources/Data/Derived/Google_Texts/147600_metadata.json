This fall, the College of Charleston has added surfing to its for-credit classes. Instruction will be from 1-4 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays starting Sept. 1.\n\nGnarly, dude.\n\nThe College of Charleston has added a surfing course to its fall line-up of classes.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that we didn\u2019t offer it,\u201d said Tom Carroll, a senior instructor in the Department of Health and Human Performance.\n\nThe course requires dedication. \u201cIt\u2019s not recess. There are standards,\u201d said Carroll, who directs the college\u2019s physical education activity program.\n\nThe surfing class filled up quickly during spring registration. It blends instruction, exercise, camaraderie and service. Students will volunteer for a community activity such as a beach clean-up as they learn lessons in conservation.\n\n\u201cThe surfing part is the hook. It\u2019s an avenue to meet and support the goals of the college,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nThe class of 18 students will meet twice weekly at Folly Beach. Those who complete the course earn two credit hours.\n\nFolly City Council recently approved a request from College of Charleston grad Kai Dilling to teach the surfing course. Dilling is among the most experienced and respected local surf instructors, officials said.\n\nSurfing lessons are increasingly popular at Folly. Council gets many requests from people who want to use the beach for that purpose. The island is considered the top surfing spot in the area.\n\nSurfing has long been a favorite at the college.\n\n\u201cFor generations, surfing-minded students have arrived at the College of Charleston with one eye on their grades and the other on The Washout, the legendary surf break about 20 minutes from campus on Folly Beach,\u201d the college says at its website.\n\nThe college has a surf club that has won competitions in Florida and California.\n\nFlorida Institute of Technology made news this month when The Associated Press reported that it was offering a surfing-focused science class.\n\nUniversity of California campuses at Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and San Diego have surfing classes, according to the website Surfline, which lists no East Coast schools that offer the same.\n\nSurfing is among dozens of physical education courses students can take at College of Charleston for credit toward their degree. The offerings include kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, golf, sailing and basketball.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Surf\u2019s up this fall at College of Charleston, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, College of Charleston,physical education,Surfing", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Gnarly, dude.", "title": "Surf\u2019s up this fall at College of Charleston", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529664/surf-x2019-s-up-this-fall-at-college-of-charleston", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529664/AR/0/AR-150529664.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529664/AR/0/AR-150529664.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gnarly, dude.", "title": "Surf\u2019s up this fall at College of Charleston", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529664/AR/0/AR-150529664.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529664}}, "keywords": "Surf\u2019s up this fall at College of Charleston , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, College of Charleston,physical education,Surfing", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T11:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T19:04:00Z", "author": "Prentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Gnarly, dude."}, "article_summary": "The College of Charleston has added a surfing course to its fall line-up of classes.\nThis fall, the College of Charleston has added surfing to its for-credit classes.\nFolly City Council recently approved a request from College of Charleston grad Kai Dilling to teach the surfing course.\nSurfing is among dozens of physical education courses students can take at College of Charleston for credit toward their degree.\nIt\u2019s an avenue to meet and support the goals of the college,\u201d Carroll said."}
