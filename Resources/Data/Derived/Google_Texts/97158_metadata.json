Thankfully, Americans were horrified by the video and lawmakers from across the country said they would do everything they could to defund the abortion giant.\n\nIn fact, on July 15th , Speaker John Boehner said that committees in the House of Representatives would look into the grisly video.\n\nIn a statement he said, \u201cNothing is more precious than life, especially an unborn child. When anyone diminishes an unborn child, we are all hurt, irreversibly so. When an organization monetizes an unborn child \u2013 and with the cavalier attitude portrayed in this horrific video \u2013 we must all act. As a start, I have asked our relevant committees to look into this matter. I am also calling on President Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to denounce, and stop, these gruesome practices.\u201d\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must Investigate Planned Parenthood for Selling Aborted Baby Parts\n\nAdditionally, some presidential candidates, including Bobby Jindal, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush called on Congress to investigate Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion business and halt funding immediately. Now Dr. Ben Carson has done the same and has even started an online petition .\n\nHere\u2019s his petition:\n\n\u201cI, like many of you, was sickened when I saw the video of Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood secretly video taped discussing selling aborted babyparts. I was more than sickened, I was enraged. ( Click link to view the film .) Congress must act NOW! Please sign my petition to Congress demanding that they stop all public funds to Planned Parenthood. I spent my whole life caring for children. What I see in this video is barbaric. Congress must ACT! We the undersigned insist that our tax dollars not be used in any way with Planned Parenthood in light of their Baby Organ Harvesting Programs. Please act immediately to stop the transfer of federal dollars to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThen, on Twitter, Dr. Carson asked his followers to support him in his efforts to expose and help defund Planned Parenthood. View some of his tweets below.\n\n#PlannedParenthood and their enablers must be stopped from these barbaric practices. #HealInspireRevive \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) July 14, 2015\n\nI\u2019m urging #Congress to eliminate every last dime of #PlannedParenthood funding!
