And for more than a year, Republicans have done virtually nothing on the issue \u2014 despite intense pressure from activists, business groups, and the nation\u2019s changing demographics.\n\nAnd although there are a variety of reasons for inaction, one Republican lawmaker recently offered a frank acknowledgement that for many House Republicans, there\u2019s one issue at play that\u2019s not often discussed: race.\n\n\u201cPart of it, I think \u2014 and I hate to say this, because these are my people \u2014 but I hate to say it, but it\u2019s racial,\u201d said the Southern Republican lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIf you go to town halls people say things like, \u2018These people have different cultural customs than we do.\u2019 And that\u2019s code for race.\u201d\n\nThere are a range of policy reasons for opposing plans to liberalize immigration or to regularize undocumented immigrants in the country, ones revolving around law-and-order concerns and the labor market. But that perceived thread of xenophobia, occasionally expressed bluntly on the fringes of the Republican Party and on the talk radio airwaves, has driven many Hispanic voters away from a Republican leadership that courts them avidly. And some Republicans who back an immigration overhaul, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and one of the Republican Party\u2019s most vocal champions of a pathway to citizenship, acknowledge that race remains a reality in the immigration debate.\n\n\u201cThere will always be people [who have] different reasons for opposing the change. We have a history in this country of demagoguery when it comes [to immigration]. You know, \u2018Irish Need Not Apply.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing new going on today that\u2019s gone on before. This isn\u2019t the first time that there\u2019s been some ugliness around the issue of immigration,\u201d Graham said.\n\nBut Graham said despite that legacy, voters, including strong majorities of Republican primary voters, are lining up behind the idea of citizenship.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get: When you ask primary voters in a poll would support a pathway to citizenship where you have to learn English, pay a fine and go to the back of the line, it\u2019s 60% in South Carolina,\u201d Graham said. \u201cNationally, it\u2019s over 70% \u2026 it seems through polling, if nothing else, that the Republican Party gets it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some racist people, certainly,\u201d said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and advocate for immigration reform. \u201cBut I want to think it\u2019s a minority and that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to decide the immigration debate.\u201d\n\nGraham agreed, but said he is puzzled by the resistance to moving on new immigration laws in the House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea, I have no idea. I can\u2019t explain it. I think maybe it\u2019s a fear of a primary,\u201d Graham said when asked what makes his colleagues so hesitant on the issue.\n\nWith Republicans meeting in Cambridge, Md., this week to discuss, among other things, recommendations for a set of immigration policy bills, House Republicans\u2019 reluctance to touch the issue is a major facing Republicans.\n\n\u201cPart of it is the fact that most of our districts are more worried about a primary opponent instead of a general opponent. Immigration is a thing you get primaried over \u2026 nobody is afraid of the pro-reform forces. They are afraid of the anti-reform forces,\u201d the operative said.\n\nIt\u2019s confusing for Republicans when in conservative states like South Carolina, Graham said, changes to immigration policy are met with much less public skepticism than perhaps many assume.\n\n\u201cWe have a tourism economy where we need workers [and] we have an agricultural economy. I think \u2026 the employers in South Carolina make a compelling case that we need workers,\u201d Graham said.\n\nUnlike abortion, Obamacare, the deficit, or federal spending, there\u2019s no organized, well-funded opposition: There are no media campaigns of note or lobbying blitzes on Capitol Hill. In short, Republicans feel pressure without any formal outside group really applying it.\n\nInstead, Republican lawmakers and operatives alike also said that while fiscal issues have been driven by large, national groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action, Republican reluctance to tackle immigration reform is much more a bottom-up phenomenon.\n\nOpposition to any form of citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States has long been an article of faith for Republican voters, much like opposition to any changes to Social Security are for Democrats. Immigration is now a third-rail issue in the GOP.\n\nTalk radio, particularly regional and small-market talkers, have also kept up the pressure, Republicans said, explaining that the airwaves back home are constantly filled with talk of \u201camnesty\u201d that makes backing new laws difficult.\n\nThose factors, combined with the brutal beating Republicans took during the 2007 immigration reform push, means many lawmakers \u2014 even those who weren\u2019t in Congress at the time \u2014 are leery of the issue.\n\n\u201cI think it is an issue that left a scar. Even though opposing organizations are not as organized, are not as vocal this time around, people [still] see it [as] \u2026 a political time bomb,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nAnd then there are the pragmatic Republicans in Boehner\u2019s conference, who argue turning to immigration will distract from the party\u2019s focus on Obamacare and insist sticking to that is the better political play for the party in 2014.\n\nThat argument doesn\u2019t hold much sway with advocates for new immigration laws. \u201cI understand the desire to not distract from Obamacare. But I\u2019m a Republican who believes we can do both. We have the momentum now,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a Republican strategist who has worked with bipartisan immigration advocacy groups.\n\nFor Walsh and other similarly minded Republicans, the greatest frustration has been what they view as the outsized influence of the small cadre of Republicans in the House, talk radio hosts and activists who they say have paralyzed the party.\n\nRepublicans are \u201clistening to a loud minority \u2026 [but] those who oppose this haven\u2019t been challenged to say, \u2018What\u2019s their plan?\u2019\u201d Walsh said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to get away with yelling about part one while ignoring part two\u201d of the political equation, he added.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2956967, "userid": 315300}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"I hate to say this, because these are my people \u2014 but I hate to say it, but it's racial,\" says a Republican congressman...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
