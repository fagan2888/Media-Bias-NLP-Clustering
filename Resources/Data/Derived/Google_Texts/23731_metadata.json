Mitch McConnell to a cartoon turtle, and a House member who never votes in primaries. This is why Cornyn is polling above 60 percent, despite having a half dozen challengers.\n\nLet's meet some of them!\n\nChris Mapp\n\nCurrent occupation: Boat salesman\n\nPolling at: 3 percent\n\nEarlier this month, the Dallas Morning News declined to endorse Mapp, probably in part due to his lack of experience in politics. But also because he talked to them.\n\nMapp, 53, told this editorial board that ranchers should be allowed to shoot on sight anyone illegally crossing the border on to their land, referred to such people as \u201cwetbacks,\u201d and called the president a \u201csocialist son of a bitch.\u201d\n\nThis was while he was seeking endorsement. If you were not aware, the term \"wetback\" is a racial slur against Mexicans. He later explained that using the term is as \"normal as breathing air in South Texas.\"\n\nHe also clarified his positions on his campaign website, as the Dallas Observer noted. He's not anti-immigrant, he just wants \"good citizens.\"\n\nThe term good citizen means earning your own way, paying taxes, No entitlements, No food stamps, NO FREE HEATH CARE, NO HAVING NUMEROUS NEW BORNS TO COLLECT MORE WELFARE, no free housing, no obama phones, and no right to vote for the first three years. \u2026 What that means to Americans who were born here is, \"GET OFF YOUR DEAD ASS AND GET TO WORK!\"\n\nEmphasis in the original.\n\nUpdate: The headline here says it all. \"GOPer Doubles Down On 'Wetbacks' But Backpedals On 'Shoot On Sight'.\"\n\nDwayne Stovall\n\nCurrent occupation: Bridge construction\n\nPolling at: 5 percent\n\nStovall made this ad, ostensibly meant as a direct message to Cornyn.\n\nAs a U.S. Senator from Texas, you vote for Texas. You don't stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare. You don't enslave its children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt. And you certainly don't do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle.\n\nThen his dog chimes in: \"I like turtle soup.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, he is up 2 points on the guy who wants to murder people crossing the border illegally.\n\nSteve Stockman\n\nCurrent occupation: Member of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nPolling at: 16 percent\n\nWe've been following the weird, lazy Stockman campaign for months. He has done few if any campaign appearances, hasn't raised any money, and suddenly and without announcement took off for the Middle East and Europe for a week. He's filed lawsuits against Cornyn, Photoshopped an image of Cornyn with Obama, denied stories about a past arrest that he'd admitted openly for years, and accused a reporter of lying who obviously wasn't.\n\nAnd now we toss two more logs onto the fire.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News reports that Stockman, who continues to apparently believe that he can beat Cornyn if the race goes to a run-off (triggered if no one gets 50 percent of the vote), hasn't voted in any primary elections himself in a decade. Not even for his alleged political hero Ted Cruz in 2010.\n\nStockman hasn\u2019t voted in a Republican primary in Texas since 2004, according to the conservative Washington Examiner. That would mean Stockman didn\u2019t even vote for himself in the 2012 primary. That\u2019s not something you see every day in politics.\n\nBut at least Stockman appears to be finally actually campaigning in Texas. Slate's Dave Weigel, who spent last week tracking the races in the state, reported on Monday that an obviously pro-Stockman mailer had been sent to some voters in the state. But instead of being a regular piece of campaign mail, it looks like a newspaper.\n\nIt outlines all of the ways in which Cornyn is bad, including a scorecard comparing Stockman and Cornyn, and then has a number of questionable headlines about Stockman's legislative accomplishments. Did you know that a Stockman bill overturned Roe v. Wade? Well, it did.\n\nStockman's camp denies that it's behind the newspaper, perhaps because if it were it would be walking pretty close to the edge on campaign finance laws. The paper is called The Conservative News, and claims to be \"a print version of the online Conservative News, available for download at CenterForTheAmericanFuture.com.\" And sure enough, it is. So far, only one issue of the paper is available at the site. It is the one for Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The people challenging Sen.
