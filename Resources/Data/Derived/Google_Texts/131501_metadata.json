Last month, the VHA began allowing individual physician assistants (PA) and their collaborating physicians to determine how much autonomy the PA should have.\n\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists said allowing nurse anesthetists to work unsupervised would decrease quality of care, and that physicians are better equipped to handle emergencies. The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists countered by arguing that physicians were only interested in protecting their jobs, citing studies that showed no difference in patient outcomes when comparing anesthesia administered by physicians and nurse anesthetists. The organization also claimed that allowing nurse anesthetists to work independently is a more cost-effective care model, according to the WSJ.\n\nThe disagreement reflects a scope-of-practice debate happening across the country as PAs and NPs take on more responsibilities to help make up for the nationwide physician shortage.\n\nPhysicians and nurses perceive their primary care roles and skills differently, as well as the effects of expanded NP roles on cost and care quality, according to a survey of 972 clinicians published last May in the New England Journal of Medicine, FierceHealthcare previously reported. More than 66 percent of surveyed physicians agreed that doctors provide a \"higher quality of examination and consultation\" than NPs, while more than three-quarters of the surveyed NPs disagreed. Moreover, 77 percent of NPs reported their expanded role would reduce costs, while only 31.1 percent of doctors expect costs savings from expanded NP roles.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the WSJ article (log in or subscription required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSuccessful nurse-led initiatives, HHS grants bolster calls for expanded nurse role\n\nPoll: Americans support greater access to NP care\n\nConsumers show willingness to embrace expanded nurse role\n\nNurses with advanced degrees more likely to land jobs after graduation\n\nStruggle continues over expanded role for nurses\n\nNurses with advanced degrees more likely to land jobs after graduation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors around the country are voicing concerns about the\u00a0Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) proposal to let nurses with advanced training practice without physician supervision, while nurses are applauding the move,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Doctors around the country are voicing concerns about the\u00a0Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) proposal to let nurses with advanced training practice without physician supervision, while nurses are applauding the move,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0report.", "title": "Docs, nurses debate VHA's proposed scope-of-practice measure", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/docs-nurses-debate-vhas-proposed-scope-practice-measure/2014-01-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Association of Nurse Anesthetists,Care Delivery,clinical-nurse specialists,HR & Workforce Management,Nurse Anesthetists,nurse practitioners,Patient Care & Outcomes,patients outcomes,Physician Assistants,physician shortage advance-practice registered nurses,scope-of-practice,team-based care,Veterans Health Administration (VHA)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The organization also claimed that allowing nurse anesthetists to work independently is a more cost-effective care model, according to the WSJ.\nThe American Association of Nurse Anesthetists countered by arguing that physicians were only interested in protecting their jobs, citing studies that showed no difference in patient outcomes when comparing anesthesia administered by physicians and nurse anesthetists.\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists said allowing nurse anesthetists to work unsupervised would decrease quality of care, and that physicians are better equipped to handle emergencies.\nThe disagreement reflects a scope-of-practice debate happening across the country as PAs and NPs take on more responsibilities to help make up for the nationwide physician shortage.\nMoreover, 77 percent of NPs reported their expanded role would reduce costs, while only 31.1 percent of doctors expect costs savings from expanded NP roles."}
