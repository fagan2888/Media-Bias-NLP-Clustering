Arsenal-Backed Accella Makes Another Add-On in Quadrant Spray Foam

The company previously bought Burtin Polymer, RDT Manufacturing and Premium Spray

Accella Performance Materials, backed by Arsenal Capital Partners, has purchased Quadrant Chemical Corp.’s spray foam division for an undisclosed amount.

The McKinney, Texas-based target provides spray foam services for residential homes, architects as well as contractors. John Televantos, the co-head of Arsenal’s industrial group says the acquisition will make Accella “even stronger by leveraging the combined technology, manufacturing and customer support across the group.” Arsenal bought Accella in 2012 when it was known as Dash Multi-Corp. For more on Arsenal’s interest in the industrials and coatings sector, see our Q&A with Televantos.

Accella has made a handful of acquisitions under Arsenal’s ownership. In 2015, the company purchased spray foam producer Premium Spray Products; around the same time, Accella bought Burtin Polymer Labs and Coating and Foam Solutions. Also in 2015, Accella acquired IPS Poylmer Systems; and in 2014, the company bought flatproofing systems maker Zeus Tyrefill Systems along with granules manufacturer RDT Manufacturing LLC.

A rise in construction continues to drive deals in the sector. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, overall construction spending in the U.S. totaled $1.1 billion in January, on a seasonally adjusted basis, up 10.4 percent from one year earlier.

Some other recent deals include: Advent-backed Distribution International Inc.’s acquisition of insulation distributor 3i Supply Co.; Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) is buying roofing materials manufacturer InterWrap; and the Tom Pritzker and Gigi Pritzker Pucker families are acquiring structural fame maker Lithko Contracting.
