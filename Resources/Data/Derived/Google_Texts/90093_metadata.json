Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) asked Wiedefeld at the hearing.\n\nWiedefeld, who testified with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board Chairman Jack Evans and two federal officials, plans to introduce a plan to Congress in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cOur current approach to dealing with these issues, lurching from crisis to crisis, is not working and we need a plan going forward to come at these issues more holistically,\u201d Wiedefeld told the panel. \u201cWe are working to prepare that plan and will present it to you and the public in the next four to six weeks.\u201d\n\nLawmakers of both parties praised Wiedefeld\u2019s unprecedented decision to shutter Metro for an entire day last month for emergency repairs. But Rep. Gerry Connolly, whose district covers parts of Northern Virginia, warned against the enactment of a longer-term shutdown.\n\n\u201cI support the general manager\u2019s decision on the one-day closure,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said in his opening statement. \u201cAlthough I caution against prolonged closures in the future.\u201d\n\nLawmakers poured cold water on Evans\u2019 request for $300 million in federal funds per year to fix Metro, which would double the federal funding level for the last five years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of money available,\u201d Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.), said at the hearing. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is leadership, we don\u2019t have management.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats are pressing for Congress to approve another $150 million in funds for Metro in fiscal year 2017, Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) said Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to the federal funding increase, Evans called for the establishment of a regional funding source at the hearing.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to act now, and fail to adopt a regional funding source for Metro that produces $1 billion per year and fail to secure a federal contribution on the operating side of $300 million per year, Metro will remain a system that\u2019s maybe safe, somewhat reliable, and mediocre instead of the world class system that the National Capital region deserves,\u201d Evans said in his opening statement.\n\nMetro is the second-busiest subway system in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Lawmakers on Wednesday grilled local transit and federal officials for the state of the District of Columbia's beleaguered Metro system, and urged the system\u2019s new General Manager Paul Wiedefeld to undergo a major reorganization as quickly as possible.", "title": "Lawmakers Want Details on Plans for DC Metro Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1620, "identifier": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WMATA-senators-2.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-04-13T17:10:25-04:00", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/13/dc-metro-house-oversight-hearing-pail-wiedefeld-jack-evans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers on Wednesday grilled local transit and federal officials for the state of the District of Columbia's beleaguered Metro system, and urged the system\u2019s new General Manager Paul Wiedefeld to undergo a major reorganization as quickly as possible.", "creator": "@JonTReid", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WMATA-senators-2.jpg", "title": "Lawmakers Want Details on Plans for DC Metro Fix", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Congress", "published_time": "2016-04-13T17:00:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T17:10:25-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the federal funding increase, Evans called for the establishment of a regional funding source at the hearing.\nAt a joint hearing of two House Oversight subcommittees, lawmakers said they have confidence in Wiedefeld, who took office on Nov. 30, but want him to tell Congress how he plans to fix the system.\nLawmakers on Wednesday grilled local transit and federal officials for the state of the District of Columbia\u2019s beleaguered Metro system, and urged the system\u2019s new General Manager Paul Wiedefeld to undergo a major reorganization as quickly as possible.\nWiedefeld, who testified with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board Chairman Jack Evans and two federal officials, plans to introduce a plan to Congress in the coming weeks.\n\u201cAlthough I caution against prolonged closures in the future.\u201dLawmakers poured cold water on Evans\u2019 request for $300 million in federal funds per year to fix Metro, which would double the federal funding level for the last five years."}
