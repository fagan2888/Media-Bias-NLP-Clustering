Callejo was 90 years old.\n\nShe had battled cancer three times but it returned again to her brain.\n\n\u201cShe was larger than life,\u201d said her nephew John David Gonzales, who was at the family home in the Lakewood area when his aunt died. \u201cIt was amazing over the course of this to see the positive energy she mustered.\u201d\n\nBut her fourth bout with brain cancer was particularly difficult. Callejo tried radiation again, but had become weak. Three weeks ago, her nephew said she suffered two seizures. \u201cThe tumors weakened her. After three consecutive bouts of cancer, she was tired.\u201d\n\nCatholic services are pending.\n\nCallejo leaves behind her husband Bill, no children, her two sisters Connie Gonzales and Lily Velasquez, 12 nieces and nephews and robust body of advocacy in courtrooms, government chambers and the streets.\n\nCallejo\u2019s crusades ranged from protests over the police shooting of a 12-year-old Mexican-American boy in 1973, to city council redistricting in the late 1980s, to private strategizing over harsh immigration policies in Farmers Branch in 2006. As a nine-year-old in Millett, Texas, she translated for her father Felix Botello who went to complain to school authorities about the treatment of Mexican-American children in that south Texas town. The sweep of her influence was such some simply called her La Madrina, the godmother. But she herself liked to call herself a \u201cmillionaire militant.\u201d\n\nIn a 2006 address at a huge rally to protest harsh immigration policies, Callejo told the crowd, \u201cIn my family, it was un-American to not protest.\u201d\n\nAnd so she did, even in a wheelchair in 2010 in another downtown Dallas protest against federal immigration policies. By then, her thick trademark bun was gone. She wore a brown wig\u2014a sign of her fight against colon and breast cancer.\n\nBrain cancer hit in 2012. In September 2012, she had two tumors more than an inch in size in the left hemisphere of her brain. She pulled through the Houston surgery and poured herself into rehabilitation.\n\nSome seven months later in April 2013, Adelfa Callejo was wheeled into an elementary school that bore her name. It was the dedication of the new Adelfa Botello Callejo Elementary School in Pleasant Grove.\n\n\u201cOnly through education will we make the world a better place than we found it,\u201d she told the crowd of 200 as she stood up from her wheelchair with the assistance of a nephew.\n\nMany told her how well she looked, dressed in a black pantsuit with a pink blouse and a trademark flower in the jacket lapel.\n\nCheerleaders called the \u201ccyclones\u201d performed for her. Liz Cedillo-Pereira, a Dallas attorney who considered Adelfa Callejo her mentor, joked their name was so appropriate.\n\nCedillo-Pereira said she would often give other Latina attorneys this advice: \u201cIf you are a Latina lawyer in Dallas, you had to meet Mrs. Callejo and be blessed by her.\u201d\n\nLike Cedillo-Pereira, Marcos Ronquillo considered Callejo a \u201csurrogate mother.\u201d\n\nRonquillo, now 60, was a law partner in the early 80s at the Callejo firm. Callejo was proud of both her law degree and her wealth, built up through the investments of her husband, who also holds a law degree, he said.\n\nWhen Callejo graduated from SMU law school, after several years of night school, she couldn\u2019t find employment, Ronquillo said.\n\n\u201cShe could only get a job after law school as a legal secretary,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a Mexican-American woman with a law degree from SMU.\u201d\n\nThat was why Callejo went into private practice, he said.\n\nCallejo was the first Hispanic woman to graduate from law school at Southern Methodist University in 1961 at the age of 37. She was one of only three women to graduate that year. She earned her undergraduate degree at SMU, as well.\n\nShe considered her law degree an essential weapon in fighting injustice, she once said. She spoke fast and forceful as though perpetually in court and well-caffeinated.\n\nUntil her September 2012 surgery, she practiced law at her low-key office with d\u00e9cor of another era and large oil portrait of herself in the foyer, just a few feet from the buzz of Central Expressway. She was paying office visits by the summer of 2013.\n\nHer blunt advocacy remains her legacy, her friends said.\n\n\u201cShe leaves a huge void,\u201d said Jesse Diaz, a real estate agent in the low-income area of Pleasant Grove.\n\nOver the years, Diaz said, with Callejo in the room, tense negotiations would become more efficient and respectful.\n\n\u201cWith us men, we could cuss and get in each other\u2019s face but with her we had to respect her. She could control us.\u201d\n\nWithout her, the Latino community loses muscle, said Diaz and others.\n\n\u201cShe brought about a lot of change in Dallas,\u201d said Diana Flores, a trustee on the Dallas County Community College District who saw Callejo through fights with the Dallas ISD, the Dallas police department and over immigration issues.\n\nCallejo had been a millionaire for many decades, was proud of her money and more than once told friends, \u201cEl dinero no habla. El dinero grita.\u201d Money doesn\u2019t talk. Money screams.\n\nFor Callejo, it screamed independence. It meant she could speak out without fear of retaliation, she said.\n\nShe also gave away some of the money. A decade ago, she and her husband Bill committed $1 million to SMU\u2019s Dedman School of Law, for example.\n\n\u201cThe Dallas community will never replace her,\u201d Ronquillo said.\n\nHere\u2019s an interview with Callejo, conducted by email after her brain surgery in 2012.\n\nMore to come.\n\nHear Callejo\u2019s speech at a Mega March on Immigration in Dallas, from KERA News.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAxL2RhbGxhcy1hdHRvcm5leS1hbmQtY2l2aWwtcmlnaHRzLWFjdGl2aXN0LWFkZWxmYS1jYWxsZWpvLTkwLWRpZXMuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "DIANNE SOL\u00cdS", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Adelfa Botello Callejo, a Dallas lawyer whose long-storied activism began as her immigrant father\u2019s interpreter, died early this morning from a brain tumor.
