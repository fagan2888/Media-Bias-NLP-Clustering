Des Moines, IA

A Des Moines teenager involved in a violent carjacking has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for his role.



17-year-old Lashaun Murray was sentenced Thursday to two 25-year prison sentences, to be served one after the other.



Prosecutors say Murray and two other teens accosted several drivers in Des Moines in February 2013 in an attempt to steal a car. The last victim, Michael Wasike, was severely beaten and suffered permanent brain damage.



In June, 17-year-old Terrance Cheeks was sentenced to 50 years and 18-year-old Kenneth Barry was sentenced to 20 years in prison for their roles.
