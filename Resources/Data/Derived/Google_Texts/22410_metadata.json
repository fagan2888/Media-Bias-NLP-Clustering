Matt Anderson will in a few months take on one more operation: amputation of his leg below the knee.\n\nAnderson \u2013 who was injured in Afghanistan after stepping on a land mine \u2013 admitted that he still harbors some hesitation about that ultimate surgery. After all, he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t really super glue that thing back on.\u201d\n\nBut after participating this week in the George W. Bush Institute\u2019s Warrior Open, a golf tournament for wounded veterans, Anderson said he was at peace with the decision. He said he couldn\u2019t help but be amazed at what some of the competitors \u2013 amputees and otherwise \u2013 were able to do.\n\nThat included retired Army Cpl. Chad Pfeifer, who won his third straight Warrior Open on Saturday while using a prosthesis on his right leg.\n\n\u201cYou see them still as high-end athletes, and it\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Anderson, 30, who currently wears a heavy brace on his leg. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019s most comforting to me.\u201d\n\nThe Warrior Open, held at Las Colinas Country Club, wrapped up Saturday in familiar fashion. Pfeifer, who hails from Goodyear, Ariz., cruised to victory at four over par for the tournament, nine strokes ahead of the field.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t the only winner.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush gave out a new award this year to the golfers who scored the most below their official handicap. Anderson, who finished second overall at 13 over, and retired Army Staff Sgt. Ben Dellinger, who shot 17 over, tied for the honor.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always take down Chad,\u201d said Anderson, who lives in Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\nBush said he was proud to \u201cto honor some of our nation\u2019s finest citizens.\u201d And while the former president focused on the tournament\u2019s competition, he nodded at the \u201cnoble cause\u201d of the Bush Institute\u2019s broader outreach to veterans.\n\n\u201c[It's] a cause that honors not only courage and sacrifice, but a cause which I hope calls citizens in America to always honor our vets and to help our vets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bush Institute\u2019s military service initiative is working on several research-based efforts to help veterans and military families.\n\nThere\u2019s a pilot program \u2013 featuring input from businesses, academics and military leaders \u2013 to find ways to get veterans jobs. There\u2019s a project to review all veterans-related research from the last five years and to predict what issues might arise in the next five years.\n\nAnd there\u2019s an ambitious effort to develop ways to measure the effectiveness of the many charities that support veterans.\n\nRetired Army Col. Miguel Howe, director of the Bush Institute\u2019s military service initiative, said he hopes to host an inaugural policy conference early next year. But until then, he said he and others are working to develop the \u201cnotion of community\u201d around the nation\u2019s veterans.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a government problem or a veterans issue,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a national responsibility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA5L2J1c2gtaW5zdGl0dXRlcy13YXJyaW9yLW9wZW4td3JhcHMtdXAtd2l0aC1hLXRocmVlLXRpbWUtY2hhbXAuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tom Benning", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "IRVING \u2013 After undergoing nearly 25 surgeries on his right leg, Army Capt.
