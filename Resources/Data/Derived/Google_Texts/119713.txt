The HHS Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) and the American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) have announced the 2015 Healthy Aging Summit, which will take place July 27-28, 2015 in Washington, DC. Summit co-sponsors are now soliciting abstracts for oral and poster presentations addressing healthy aging on a range of topics, which may be of interest to some in the HIV community.

Abstracts are invited for presentations in one of four tracks, including Health and Health Care in which Summit organizers envision presentations on issues including:

Sexual health including HIV & STIs, risk factors, management, and prevention

Culturally competent care for minority populations including LGBTQ populations, non-English speaking populations, and others.

Abstracts are due by February 2, 2015. Read more about the tracks and instructions on submitting abstracts on summit website.

The Summit organizers are seeking broad participation and will explore the state of the science on healthy aging; highlight evidence-based practices that are working in communities; identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled; promote the role of prevention and preventive services in improving the quality of life in later years; and mobilize action to improve the delivery of care for those aging in place or in transition.

White House Conference on Aging Announces Regional Meetings

In a blog post earlier this month, Ms. Cecilia Muñoz, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House’s Domestic Policy Council, announced a series of regional forums “to engage older Americans, their families, caregivers, advocates, community leaders, and experts on aging on the key issues affecting older Americans. These forums are designed to help provide input and ideas for the upcoming 2015 White House Conference on Aging.” The regional forums will take place between February and May in Tampa, Phoenix, Seattle, Cleveland, and Boston.
