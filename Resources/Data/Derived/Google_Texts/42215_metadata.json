Brian Sigman said the girl and the 29-year-old man were playing with the BB gun when it went off.\n\n\"They were kind of turning it on each other,\" Sigman said. \"They were just shooting air out of it. Apparently they was a BB that had gotten into the barrel.\"\n\nThe BB lodged by the girl's nose. EMS took her to a nearby hospital to have it removed. Her current condition is unknown.\n\nNo names were released.\n\nSigman said it's too early in the investigation to say whether any charges will be filed in the case.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A seven-year-old Wichita girl was rushed to the hospital late Sunday morning after her babysitter accidentally shot her in the face with a BB gun.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "A seven-year-old Wichita girl was rushed to the hospital late Sunday morning after her babysitter accidentally shot her in the face with a BB gun.", "title": "Police: Babysitter accidentally shoots girl, 7, with BB gun", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Girl-7-hurt-in-accidental-BB-gun-shooting-310512431.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DBA/918/DBA918A6FE7F4C69850A9AE7AB2C606C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/36A/218/36A218F63A9945BBB0F37B0A98FA73F5.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A seven-year-old Wichita girl was rushed to the hospital late Sunday morning after her babysitter accidentally shot her in the face with a BB gun.", "title": "Police: Babysitter accidentally shoots girl, 7, with BB gun", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Girl-7-hurt-in-accidental-BB-gun-shooting-310512431.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/bb+gun+shooting4.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Police: Babysitter accidentally shoots girl, 7, with BB gun", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Police Babysitter accidentally shoots girl, 7"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9d0\"", "article_summary": "A seven-year-old Wichita girl was rushed to the hospital late Sunday morning after her babysitter accidentally shot her in the face with a BB gun.\nBrian Sigman said the girl and the 29-year-old man were playing with the BB gun when it went off.\nThe incident happened around 11 a.m. in the 2200 block of East Maywood, near 55th Street South and Hydraulic.\nSigman said it's too early in the investigation to say whether any charges will be filed in the case.\nApparently they was a BB that had gotten into the barrel.\""}
