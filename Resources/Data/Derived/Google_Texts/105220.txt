Sky Ridge Medical Center chief Maureen Tarrant has been named president and CEO of Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center and Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children. She begins work Aug. 4.

Tarrant is taking over after the resignation of Mimi Roberson, who was part of the HCA HealthOne team for 22 years, 15 of those years at Presbyterian/St. Luke’s and Rocky Mountain.

Tarrant has led Sky Ridge since it opened in 2003. On her watch, the hospital has received top rankings in professional and consumer assessments of patient care and satisfaction, a hospital news release said. The hospital opened a dedicated spine and joint center, as well as centers devoted to oncology, cardiology, orthopedics, stroke, breast-cancer care, bariatric and general surgery.

“Over the past 11 years, I have been fortunate to work with an extraordinary team of health care professionals and an exemplary medical staff at Sky Ridge,” Tarrant said. “I look forward to bringing this same passion for growth, clinical excellence, economic development and community involvement to my new position.”
