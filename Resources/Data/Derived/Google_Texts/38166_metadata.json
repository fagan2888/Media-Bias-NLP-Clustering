The confiscation of souvenirs and tweezers, the removal of jackets and shoes and, in my mother\u2019s case, a full body scan thanks to two metal hips are all expected annoyances that come with the price of a plane ticket.\n\nSecurity hassles are understandable, but is it wrong to expect the experience with an airline should be somewhat more pleasant? Even an ultra low-cost airline?\n\nLast summer, I took a Frontier flight from Denver to Santa Barbara to visit friends. I was not prepared for my carry-on to cost more than a checked bag and neither was the family of five who was hit with $200 in carry-on bag fees at the gate. The family had chosen Frontier because of ads touting, \u201cFares as low as $29 one way! Book now!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting, but often not worth the trouble.\n\nIt was upsetting to witness that mother\u2019s distress as she coughed up the extra dough. I\u2019m sure it was no fun for the employees who had to enforce that shakedown. I certainly felt bamboozled, and swore not to fly Frontier again, despite the cute animals on the plane tails.\n\nOnce on board, flight attendants pushed the Frontier Airlines MasterCard, waving applications and the promise of 40,000 bonus miles \u2014 if we were approved and spent $500 within 90 days, plus a $69 annual fee. I passed.\n\nThen there was last Friday. I had broken my own vow and booked three tickets on Frontier from Denver to Phoenix so my mom and I could take my son to his first out-of-state baseball tournament. I figured we could tolerate 105 minutes without snacks and drinks, and I planned to only check bags.\n\nWe arrived at DIA in the dark, already checked in online, just needing to check bags and get through security. Curbside wasn\u2019t available. Inside, we joined a gargantuan line.\n\nBy the time it was our turn, there was no chance of making our flight. We had directed to another line to change our tickets.\n\n\u201cDid you just get here?\u201d the employee at the next counter asked accusingly. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve been in line more than an hour,\u201d I said. There were no seats available to Phoenix from anywhere for three days. I saw my son\u2019s chin drop and the tears begin to flow.\n\nI checked Southwest, United and Delta on my phone. Sold out. \u201cIt\u2019s spring break,\u201d she scolded. So we took an alternate route, booking a flight to San Diego \u2014 for another $693, with plans to rent a car and drive to Phoenix. We speed-walked to join the crowd at security, followed by a sprint to the farthest gate in concourse A, where we walked directly onto the plane and buckled up.\n\nI paid $1.99 for a cup of coffee.\n\nIn San Diego, the Alamo rep told us there would be a $200 drop fee to leave the rental car in Phoenix. Out of kindness, his manager reduced the charge to $120.\n\nSix hours later, we checked into our hotel. Providentially, a rainstorm had delayed the start of Nathan\u2019s game by an hour.\n\nThe game itself was a blur of relief and exhaustion. I\u2019d like to say his team, the Dirty Dozen, won, but the kids from California prevailed.\n\nThe rest of the weekend, we cheered on Nathan\u2019s team under sunny skies. The boys had the time of their lives playing baseball and swimming in the hotel pools together, sharing priceless memories \u2014 at nearly $900 more than I had bargained for.\n\nKristen Kidd is a freelance writer in Highlands Ranch.
