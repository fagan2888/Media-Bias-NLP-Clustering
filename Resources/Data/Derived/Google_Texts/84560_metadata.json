We hope today\u2019s announcement that enzalutamide is now licensed for use in this way means we can finally see it appraised to become routinely available on the NHS.\n\n\u2018Enzalutamide was already being made available to some patients pre-chemotherapy before receiving its licence.\n\n'This has been via the Cancer Drugs Fund in England and the Peer Approved Clinical System in Scotland.\n\n\u2018This early access means that there is now real-world evidence of the drug\u2019s effectiveness, leaving Nice and the Scottish Medicines Consortium with no excuse but to get on with the process of making it more widely available.\n\nA doctor at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured) said the drug was cost-effective because it improved quality of life, reduced the need for palliative radiotherapy and GP visits, and cut down emergency hospital care\n\n\u2018We also hope that the fact that men have been accessing pre chemotherapy enzalutamide before it received its licence heralds a much needed step change in how a drug\u2019s effectiveness is established, so that we have a faster, more effective appraisal process in the future.\u2019\n\nSandy Tyndale-Biscoe, honorary chairman of Tackle the charity, said \u2018It is great to have such a treatment for prostate cancer patients with advanced disease, where treatment choices are so limited.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Prostate,cancer,drug,used,earlier,cut,progress,disease", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2864817/Prostate-cancer-drug-used-earlier-cut-progress-disease.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "A drug for men with advanced prostate cancer has been licensed for use earlier in the disease \u2013 delaying the need for chemotherapy.
