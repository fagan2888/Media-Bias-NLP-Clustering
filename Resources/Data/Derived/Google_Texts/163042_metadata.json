The right demanded that the Obama administration deny Khattala a civilian trial and ship him to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Holder ignored the Republicans\u2019 demands, and this week, Khattala was arraigned \u2013 in open court, in a routine legal proceeding, just as the American justice system is supposed to operate\n\nFive years ago, the debate over whether terrorists should be prosecuted in criminal courts was so contentious that it made its chief advocate, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., a political liability. Republicans argued that F.B.I. interrogation was not suited to wartime intelligence-gathering. By extension, civilian courtrooms were no place for terrorists, who did not deserve the same rights as common criminals. But as Mr. Holder prepares to leave office, his success in reversing the Bush administration\u2019s emphasis on trying terrorism suspects in secret prisons or at offshore military tribunals may be one of his most significant achievements. While he did not end the debate \u2013 each new arrest brings fresh statements of disapproval from critics \u2013 the Justice Department can now point to a string of courtroom victories that his liberal supporters, as well as many law enforcement officials, believe has reshaped the government\u2019s approach to prosecuting terrorism. \u201cHistory will remember these years as the time when we resolved one of the most contentious debates in the post-9/11 era: about whether our legal system was equipped to handle national security cases,\u201d Mr. Holder said recently in a written response to questions about the issue.\n\nThis is one of the A.G.\u2019s most important successes, and it\u2019s also one of the areas in which Republicans were completely wrong \u2013 whether they\u2019re prepared to admit that or not.\n\nRemember, when Holder started trying terrorist suspects in civilian U.S. courts \u2013 the way nearly every president\u2019s administration has for all of American history \u2013 the right was absolutely convinced this was a disaster of epic proportions. Such trials would not only create a national-security nightmare, Republicans said, but it would create a platform for lunatics to spread their twisted, hateful message. Worse still, conservatives insisted, are courts are so unprepared for these trials that acquittals would inevitable.\n\nNone of this turned out to be true. The American criminal-justice system is perfectly well equipped to indict, arraign, try, convict, and imprison terrorists. Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nApuzzo\u2019s New York Times piece concluded with this quote from Holder: \u201cWe have shown, time and again, that upholding the rule of law is not inconsistent with safeguarding our national security. We have honed an approach to apprehending, questioning and convicting terrorism suspects that I think will serve as a blueprint for years to come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-puts-things-right-terrorist-trials", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Holder puts things right on terrorist trials", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-puts-things-right-terrorist-trials", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/453905056_3.jpg?itok=KM5exiqs", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-puts-things-right-terrorist-trials", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/453905056_3.jpg?itok=bujd-_xN", "height": 553}, "title": "Holder puts things right on terrorist trials", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-23T17:01:28-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Holder puts things right on terrorist trials", "tags": "counter-terrorism,criminal-justice,eric-holder,federal-courts,federal-judiciary,national-security,society,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "10/23/2014 17:01:28 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/holder-puts-things-right-terrorist-trials"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Republican predictions about our court system were about as accurate as their predictions about the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "National Security, Criminal Justice, Society, Counter-Terrorism, Eric Holder, Federal Courts, Federal Judiciary"}, "article_summary": "But Matt Apuzzo this week highlighted an aspect of Holder\u2019s work that\u2019s every bit as important: shifting terrorism trials back to American courts.\nWe have honed an approach to apprehending, questioning and convicting terrorism suspects that I think will serve as a blueprint for years to come.\u201d\nThe news peg, of course, is Ahmed Abu Khattala, the suspected terrorist accused of launching the 2012 Benghazi attack.\nThe right demanded that the Obama administration deny Khattala a civilian trial and ship him to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nWorse still, conservatives insisted, are courts are so unprepared for these trials that acquittals would inevitable."}
