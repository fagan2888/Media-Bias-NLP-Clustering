But that didn't exactly pan out.. POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney and Isaac Arnsdorf report, \u201cOver nine years of operation, Angels of the OR generated less than $150,000 for patient care and helped 34 patients cover portions of their medical bills, according to its tax forms. Carson had said he wanted to raise as much as $20 million in seed money, but the charity collected less than $1 million from donations and celebrity-studded events \u2014 like a private benefit headlined by Kenny Rogers and the 2003 film premiere of 'Stuck on You,' in which Carson made a cameo appearance \u2026 Angels of the OR spent $1.03 million during its life span, and at least 53 percent of its funds went to salaries and fund-raising costs, according to POLITICO\u2019s review of its records. The charity shut down in 2013 when Carson stepped down as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\u201d Their story: http://politico.pro/1NOGdcB\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTURING CUTS DRUG PRICE \u2026 TO A POINT \u2014 Amid fierce criticism for jacking up the price of an old AIDS medication, CEO Martin Shkreli saidhe would lower the price of the drug, daraprim. Now, Turing Pharmaceuticals appears to be doing that \u2014 to an extent. The company said it would cut the price by up to 50 percent for hospitals \u2014 bringing the price to as low as $375 per pill. But as Pro\u2019s Sarah Karlin points out,that still represents a 2,500 percent hike over the original $13.50 price. Also, the company wouldn\u2019t specify how many hospitals will get that full 50 percent discount, saying pricing will be based on the volume of drugs used.

Judge William Orrick said Daleiden is trying to \u201chide the ball\" instead of complying with his orders to hand over information. He\u2019s told Daleiden to release the names of people from the fake tissue company portrayed in the videos who had attended the abortion federation's meeting. But Daleiden's lawyers say that disclosing names would violate the Center for Medical Progress's First Amendment right to freedom of association.

The nonprofit plan\u2019s former public policy director, Michael Johnson, argued in a blog post that the insurer should refund that money to its customers because they were charged too much. Stephen Shivinsky, Blue Shield\u2019s VP for corporate communications, argues that the system worked exactly as intended, noting that they were essentially pricing in the dark during the first year of exchange operations. \u201cWe set competitive rates and returned the $107 million so that it would support those plans with sicker enrollees,\u201d Shivinsky wrote in an email. \u201cClaims to the contrary are spurious.\u201d Johnson has been waging a public campaign against Blue Shield since March, questioning whether it deserves tax-exempt status. Earlier this month, the insurer sued Johnson and accused him of disclosing confidential company information.\n\nCOMING NEXT WEEK: SENATE GOP HUDDLES ON OBAMACARE REPEAL \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to talk Obamacare repeal with his GOP Senate colleagues when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.

This new Urban Institute study says yes - though the analysis did not look at all 50 states. Researchers analyzed final approved rates for 2016 and found a 4.3 percent increase in the average premium of the lowest-cost silver plan across 20 states and the District of Columbia from last year. According to the study, the average premium of the lowest-cost silver plan increased by less than 5 percent in five states. It increased between 5 and 10 percent in five states and increased by more than 10 percent in four states. The study:http://rwjf.ws/1OeEkuv\n\nICYMI -WILL MENTAL HEALTH FALL VICTIM TO GUNS? Stop me if you think you\u2019ve heard this one before. An attempt at reforming the mental health system in response to a spate of gun violence and mass shootings may once again get injected into a poisonous political fight over guns. A bipartisan bill is gaining momentum in the Senate, with the HELP committee likely to take it up early next year. But the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, has been working behind the scenes to drum up support for his own mental health legislation \u2014 apart from the bipartisan initiative sponsored by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Ct) and Bill Cassidy (R- La.) Cornyn\u2019s bill is blessed by the National Rifle Association \u2014 and Cornyn told POLITICO he believes his bill will become the \"engine that pulls the train.\u201d He expects a Judiciary Committee hearing in January. Cornyn\u2019s push is creating a wedge in the bipartisan coalition that had been pushing to keep mental health clearly separate from any legislation touching on the politically volatile issue of guns.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
