The CDC estimates that about 83,494 people die from Alzheimer's every year in the U.S., but new research suggests the real number may be five times higher.\n\nAccording to the research, which will be published in the print issue of Neurology, \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias are under-reported on death certificates and medical records,\u201d Bryan D. James, an author of the study and a researcher at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said in a press release. \u201cDeath certificates often list the immediate cause of death, such as pneumonia, rather than listing dementia as an underlying cause.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Alzheimer\u2019s is considered the 6th most likely disease to kill you in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Heart disease and cancer take the first two spots. The CDC bases its list on what is reported in death certificates, and states that for every 100,000 people in the U.S., 27 die from Alzheimer\u2019s. However, death certificates usually only list one cause of death; Alzheimer's is often the underlying disease that can lead to pneumonia or other illnesses, which may explain why it's under-reported. Alzheimer\u2019s is the most common form of dementia and causes impaired memory, language, and reasoning skills in adults typically over the age of 60. However, Alzheimer\u2019s is difficult to diagnose: it\u2019s only when the person dies and is autopsied that it can truly be confirmed.\n\nThere is no cure for the disease, but treatment and therapy are available. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle that involves physical activity and mental exercises can actually improve symptoms, though it doesn't stop the disease. The Alzheimer's Association states on its website that the disease is \"the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent it, cure it or even slow its progression.\"\n\nThe authors of the study reviewed 2,566 people who were ages 65 or older, with an average age of 78, and who received annual dementia tests. After an average of eight years, 1,090 of the participants died. There were 559 people who didn\u2019t have dementia at the beginning of the study who ultimately developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease; on average, people with Alzheimer\u2019s died about four years after they were diagnosed.\n\nAccording to James, the study revealed that there were some 503,400 deaths from Alzheimer\u2019s in the U.S. in 2010, among people over the age of 75. This number is five to six times higher than the one reported by the CDC: 83,494.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer's Association, the number of people living with the disease is going to increase significantly in the next several years. James believes that finding a better way to track the number of deaths that are caused inherently by Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia \u2014 rather than a corresponding illness like pneumonia \u2014 is \u201cimportant for raising public awareness and identifying research priorities regarding this epidemic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, dementia, mental health, cdc", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study points out that the number of deaths caused by Alzheimer's disease is largely under-reported; the CDC's estimate may be far below the reality.", "title": "Alzheimer\u2019s Death Rate 5 Times Higher Than Reported", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alzheimers-death-rate-5-times-higher-reported-may-be-fatal-heart-disease-or-cancer-270619", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/05/elderly-couple.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study points out that the number of deaths caused by Alzheimer's disease is largely under-reported; the CDC's estimate may be far below the reality.", "title": "Alzheimer\u2019s Death Rate 5 Times Higher Than Reported", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alzheimers-death-rate-5-times-higher-reported-may-be-fatal-heart-disease-or-cancer-270619", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/05/elderly-couple.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/05/elderly-couple.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-05T16:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T16:02:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study points out that the number of deaths caused by Alzheimer's disease is largely under-reported; the CDC's estimate may be far below the reality."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda382\"", "article_summary": "However, death certificates usually only list one cause of death; Alzheimer's is often the underlying disease that can lead to pneumonia or other illnesses, which may explain why it's under-reported.\nThe CDC bases its list on what is reported in death certificates, and states that for every 100,000 people in the U.S., 27 die from Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe CDC estimates that about 83,494 people die from Alzheimer's every year in the U.S., but new research suggests the real number may be five times higher.\nAccording to the Alzheimer's Association, the number of people living with the disease is going to increase significantly in the next several years.\nThere were 559 people who didn\u2019t have dementia at the beginning of the study who ultimately developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease; on average, people with Alzheimer\u2019s died about four years after they were diagnosed."}
