My first love is electronic music and then going to top 40 pop and hip-hop and weird pre-jazz records and taking from each of those and figuring out what was missing, what I wanted to hear in it,\" she says. \"I think that's what people my age do.\"\n\nWhat people Lorde's age also do is to resist the hype machine.\n\nHer manager Scott Maclachlan's primary role is saying no. He told a music industry conference before the ARIA Awards in Sydney last year that her tender age dictated a \"less is more\" approach.\n\nThey agreed to license Royals to a Samsung television campaign to build her presence in territories where her music was brewing but the restrictions on her schedule ruled out personal appearances or tours for the time being.\n\nEveryone wanted Lorde and they wanted her now but management was not allowing anyone to burn out a teenager.\n\n\"I signed her when she was 12 and it took almost four years to get it right. If I was working at a UK or US record company I'm not sure we could have done that,\" Maclachlan said.\n\nAnother key ingredient in her musical melting pot is the emotional quotient of her songs and the intelligence of her lyrics.\n\n\"If I didn't write about things that mattered to me, there would be no point.\n\n\"I think there is a lot of emotion in music right now but pop music may be lacking it. That's why I stand out in that field because I'm not singing 'I'll take you higher'.\"\n\nThe level-headed pop star who asks Taylor Swift for advice on dealing with fame and attended her private birthday party in Melbourne last December is equal parts excited and pragmatic about her Grammy prospects.\n\n\"It would be super awesome to win a Grammy, I mean it would probably be the craziest thing that will ever happen to me if it happens, but it definitely won't cheapen or make less anything I've achieved,\" she told themusic.com.au\n\nShe isn't the only artist flying the flag from this part of the world at the Grammys.\n\nPerth rockers Tame Impala will be competitive in the Best Alternative Music Album with Lonerism while independent Melbourne buzz band Hiatus Kaiyote is a shock inclusion in the\n\nBest R & B Performance gong for their song Nakamarra featuring Q-Tip.\n\nOld Grammy hand Keith Urban figures in the Best Country Duo/Group Performance category for Highway Don't Care, his collaboration with Taylor Swift and Tim McGraw.\n\nLorde returns to Australia this week to join the Laneway Festival.\n\nThe Grammy Awards are broadcast from noon on Fox 8.\n\nThe Laneway Festivals kicks off at the RNA Showgrounds, Brisbane on Friday.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "IF the pop culture planets align, a musical phenomenon will sweep the world each year.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"url": "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/kiwi-teen-superstar-lorde-joins-the-worlds-biggest-artists-at-the-grammys/story-e6frfn2r-1226810406756", "site_name": "NewsComAu", "type": "article", "description": "IF the pop culture planets align, a musical phenomenon will sweep the world each year.", "title": "Kiwi teen superstar Lorde joins the world's biggest artists at the Grammys"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226810406756, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "music industry, music industry conference, musical melting pot, National Music Writer, disbelieving industry cynics, Community Arts Centre, Sydney College, RNA Showgrounds, musical phenomenon, post-millennial teenager, young songwriters, pop culture planets, ,Port Adelaide,South Australia,Australia, ,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia, ,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia, ,,,United States of America, Sydney College of The Arts, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Harts Mill, Fox, Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, Q-Tip, Tame Impala, debut single, television campaign, hype machine, Festivals kicks, weird pre-jazz records, Esplanade Park, key ingredient, rapid rise, pop music, ,Los Angeles,California,United States of America, ,,,New Zealand, ,,,Australia, Keith Urban, Scott Maclachlan, Joel Little, Tim McGraw, Ryan Lewis, Kathy McCabe", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Jan 26 17:06:07 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Jan 26 17:06:07 EST 2014", "author": "Kathy McCabe National Music Writer"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\"I think there is a lot of emotion in music right now but pop music may be lacking it.\nThe Grammy Awards are broadcast from noon on Fox 8.\nIn the past five years, the music industry got lucky with a raft of seemingly overnight sensations - Lady Gaga, Adele, Justin Bieber, One Direction, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, Gotye, Psy and now Lorde.\nLorde and Little hit pop paydirt with Royals because it was the embodiment of a generation's attitude to music.\nHe told a music industry conference before the ARIA Awards in Sydney last year that her tender age dictated a \"less is more\" approach."}
