When they arrived, they found a man who appeared to have been shot.\n\nThe man was pronounced dead at the scene. The victim's family has identified him as Jeremy Saldana.\n\nSaldana's stepdaughter Marissa Reynolds says it all started with an argument between the two men about the suspect going to the neighborhood park.\n\n\"My stepdad came over from the park so that the guy that shot my dad wouldn't shoot up kids at the park,\" said Reynolds.\n\nReynolds tells KAKE News the suspect was making threats and wearing a peculiar outfit.\n\n\"He was armed with a bullet proof vest on,\" she said.\n\nThat argument turned physical on Reynolds' front lawn between the two men who had never met before last night.\n\nReynolds says her mother used to be married to Saldana, and the suspect is her mom's current boyfriend.\n\n\"The shooter pulled out a gun and shot my dad three times,\" said Reynolds. \"I ran to his body to try to give him CPR, but it didn't work.\"\n\nSaldana died from the gunshot wounds.\n\n\"Why did you have to kill an unarmed man when he did nothing wrong,\" said Reynolds.\n\nThe shooter stayed at the scene until police arrived. He was arrested in connection to the shooting.\n\n\"He didn't say anything,\" said Reynolds. \"He didn't even try to run.\"\n\nSelana's kids are fighting back emotions as they start a memorial by laying bricks where the father of twelve died.\n\n\"He was funny, he was kind, everybody who met him really loved him,\" said Reynolds. \"He never did wrong to anybody.\"\n\nThe suspect's name has not been released. Great Bend police say the homicide investigation is ongoing.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A man died from a shooting in Great Bend on Friday night and a suspect has been arrested.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "A man died from a shooting in Great Bend on Friday night and a suspect has been arrested.", "title": "UPDATE: Man killed, suspect arrested in Great Bend shooting", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-dead-1-arrested-in-Great-Bend-shooting-326974841.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B24/BC2/B24BC28ECDE442DA94245EDB0BBF70A3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/802/348/8023482AB4B34EADB5DC2B1E1EC79AE7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A man died from a shooting in Great Bend on Friday night and a suspect has been arrested.", "title": "UPDATE: Man killed, suspect arrested in Great Bend shooting", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-dead-1-arrested-in-Great-Bend-shooting-326974841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/great+bend+shooting2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Man killed, suspect arrested in Great Bend shooting", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Man killed, suspect arrested in Great Bend"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9430\"", "article_summary": "A man was killed in a shooting Friday night in Great Bend and a suspect has been arrested.\nIt happened in the 2400 block of Williams Street around 8:40 p.m. Great Bend Police officers were responding to a call of a shooting.\nGreat Bend police say the homicide investigation is ongoing.\n\"Why did you have to kill an unarmed man when he did nothing wrong,\" said Reynolds.\nSaldana's stepdaughter Marissa Reynolds says it all started with an argument between the two men about the suspect going to the neighborhood park."}
