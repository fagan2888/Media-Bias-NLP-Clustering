HOLYOKE -- Parents must provide proof of insurance to get dental services for children such as examinations during Holyoke Health Center's "Dental Adventure" events Feb. 17 and 18, an official said Tuesday (Feb. 10).

The center at 230 Maple St. is marking National Children's Dental Health Month with activities that include a scavenger hunt, oral health education, dental-themed crafts and other programs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days at the facility.

"The health center will be providing full-service pediatric dental including oral exams, X-Rays/imaging, sealants, and fluoride treatments," said Bronwyn Murphy, center development associate.

"Yes, participants will need proof of insurance in order to get the dental services. However all dental activities, games and crafts are absolutely free. Upon receiving their insurance we will also check their dental history, and then decide which services are needed," Murphy said in an email.

"If dental exams are not needed, we will also be offering fluoride treatments, which will be free of charge," she said.

Center staff will discuss oral health education, dental exams and creative oral health crafts with parents and children.

The center opened a Pediatric Dental Wing that features 13 dental chairs for children in September 2013 with a federal Affordable Care Act grant of nearly $2 million.

The American Dental Association sponsors National Children's Dental Health Month in February to raise awareness about the importance of oral health, its website said.
