Reid becomes the 27th Senate Democrat to formally endorse the Iran deal, and Obama needs just 34 votes in the Senate to sustain a veto of a resolution of disapproval that is expected in Congress next month.\n\nNo Republicans are expected to vote in favor of the nuclear deal. But in recent days, key Democrats have come out in favor of the agreement \u2013 including red-state Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Jewish lawmakers such as Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Reid said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that there would be enough Democratic support to sustain any veto from Obama. His counterpart in the House \u2013 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California \u2013 has confidently predicted that Obama\u2019s veto won\u2019t be overridden.\n\nStill, the nuclear agreement has divided key Democrats, including Reid\u2019s top two deputies. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois has been one of the most aggressive supporters of the nuclear agreement in Congress, but the third-ranking Senate Democrat \u2013 Chuck Schumer of New York, Reid\u2019s presumptive successor once the Nevada Democrat retires after 2016 \u2013 is opposed.\n\nThe fourth-ranking Senate Democrat, Patty Murray of Washington, has not made public her position, though she is expected to back the agreement. Also undecided and in question is House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat.\n\nAside from Schumer, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey \u2013 a frequent critic of the Obama administration\u2019s policies on Iran \u2013 is the only other Senate Democrat on record opposing the deal.\n\nThe international pact has drawn opposition from those who fear that Iran will still be able to build a nuclear bomb, as well as those who are afraid the lifting of sanctions against Iran will increase its ability to fund international terrorism. In both cases, the fear is that Israel will be the target.\n\nIn his statement, Reid made a forceful case for protecting the nuclear agreement, which he argued was the \u201cbest path\u201d to halting Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. He dismissed arguments from opponents of the Iran deal that the Obama administration should go back and try to secure a better deal, calling that notion \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, this is a good agreement on the merits, imposing the toughest inspections and verification regime in history, and a diplomatic solution is certainly less costly in American blood and treasure than any possible military option,\u201d Reid said. \u201cSecond, if the Senate rejects this agreement, the international community will not support an attempt to secure another and they will not support the sanctions regime.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose are hard facts. Whether we like it or not, the current sanctions regime depends on other countries.\u201d\n\nThough the deal\u2019s backers are focused on preventing Capitol Hill from getting to the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto, some congressional aides following the process believe it\u2019s possible that there are enough Senate Democratic votes in favor of the deal to prevent a resolution of disapproval of reaching 60 votes \u2013 which would halt the measure before it gets to Obama for his veto.\n\nDavid Cohen contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His support moves the Obama administration nearer to a veto-proof support.", "title": "Harry Reid: I will back Iran deal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/harry-reid-i-will-back-iran-deal-121648.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/23/150813_harry_reid_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Barack Obama,Foreign Policy,Senate,Chuck Schumer,Iran,Diplomacy,Harry Reid,Iran Deal,Robert Menendez", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His support moves the Obama administration nearer to a veto-proof support.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35ff\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran just won the backing of the Senate\u2019s top Democrat.\nNo Republicans are expected to vote in favor of the nuclear deal.\nReid becomes the 27th Senate Democrat to formally endorse the Iran deal, and Obama needs just 34 votes in the Senate to sustain a veto of a resolution of disapproval that is expected in Congress next month.\nIn his statement, Reid made a forceful case for protecting the nuclear agreement, which he argued was the \u201cbest path\u201d to halting Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\nThe backing from the Senate\u2019s most powerful Democrat adds even more momentum on Capitol Hill to protect the nuclear agreement."}
