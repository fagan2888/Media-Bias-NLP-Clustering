The report, which credits five authors, said these \u201cexcessive\u201d rules have restricted job creation, leading to high unemployment rates among young adults.\n\nCurrently, 18- to 29-year-olds face an unemployment rate of 8 percent compared to 3.7 percent for Americans over 29.\n\nThe strain for young Americans to secure a job has excluded many from the workforce, the report found, leading to an all-time low labor force participation rate of 71 percent among 18- to 29-year-olds. More than 1.8 million young adults have given up looking for a job altogether.\n\nShrunken job opportunities also spiked poverty levels among millennials, the report said. In 1979, only 8 percent of the baby boom generation was living in poverty. Fast-forward to 2013, and that number has doubled to 16 percent among millennials.\n\n\u201cThese negative trends are caused by years of government intervention disrupting economic growth in countless parts of our lives,\u201d the authors of the report wrote.\n\nThe authors also fault the government\u2019s reach in the nation\u2019s higher education system for skyrocketing levels of student debt.\n\nWhile young Americans are graduating college at a national high, college tuition has increased by over 500 percent since 1985, \u201crising significantly faster than the cost of health care, gasoline, shelter and food,\u201d the study found.\n\nThis has left nearly 70 percent of the graduating class of 2014 with student loan debt averaging at nearly $30,000 per borrower.\n\nThe report blames these \u201ceconomic hardships\u201d for driving millennials to marry later than ever before and causing the lowest level of homeownership on record among Americans under 35 years old.\n\n\u201cAs government continues to grow, young Americans are beginning to believe the American dream is dead,\u201d the authors wrote:\n\nTo reverse this trend, we need to reduce excessive government regulations that stop job creation. We need to simplify the tax code so millennials can start new businesses without Uncle Sam intervening.\n\nGeneration Opportunity, part of a network of organizations begun by entrepreneurs Charles and David Koch, was founded in 2011 as a grassroots outreach group to involve young Americans in policy debates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the first time in U.S. history, a younger generation may be left worse off than the one preceding it, Generation Opportunity reports.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For the first time in U.S. history, a younger generation may be left worse off than the one preceding it, Generation Opportunity reports.", "title": "Nearly Half of Millennials Say the American Dream Is Dead", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160112_Millennials_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-15T16:38:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TTC77v"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For the first time in U.S. history, a younger generation may be left worse off than the one preceding it, Generation Opportunity reports.", "title": "Nearly Half of Millennials Say the American Dream Is Dead", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160112_Millennials_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2016-01-14T16:05:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T16:38:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Generation Opportunity, millennials, American Dream, State of the Millennial Report, economic growth, limited government, economy, jobs, unemployment, income"}, "article_summary": "These barriers have left nearly half\u201448 percent\u2014of millennials convinced that the American dream is dead, the report\u2019s authors wrote, referencing a recent Harvard study.\n\u201cAs government continues to grow, young Americans are beginning to believe the American dream is dead,\u201d the authors wrote:To reverse this trend, we need to reduce excessive government regulations that stop job creation.\nGeneration Opportunity, part of a network of organizations begun by entrepreneurs Charles and David Koch, was founded in 2011 as a grassroots outreach group to involve young Americans in policy debates.\nBelief in the American Dream among millennials is dimming as the nation\u2019s largest generation continues to face steep socioeconomic barriers despite overall economic recovery, according to a new report.\nThis has left nearly 70 percent of the graduating class of 2014 with student loan debt averaging at nearly $30,000 per borrower."}
