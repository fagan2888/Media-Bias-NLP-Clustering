Marlin Stutzman's ad in the GOP Senate primary race accuses Rep. Todd Young of being bought by party leaders. (Photo: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY)\n\nThe ad: Rep. Marlin Stutzman is running as the Republican Senate candidate who stands up to Democrats and his own party leaders. In an attack ad released about two weeks before the May 3 primary, Stutzman accuses GOP Rep. Todd Young of having been bought by special interests and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nThe ad shows a Young action figure being manufactured at \u201cMcConnell Industries\u201d and put into a box stamped \u201cSellout Politicians\u201d and \u201cDoes What He\u2019s Told! Just Push Button.\u201d\n\nThe narrator says special interests and McConnell have spent $1 million to buy Young a promotion to the Senate. The narrator also charges Young with having voted to raise the debt limit over $2 trillion and voted to fund \u201cObamacare and Obama\u2019s amnesty plan.\u201d\n\nAnalysis: McConnell is officially neutral in Indiana\u2019s Senate primary. But two independent groups led by his former top aide are spending nearly $1 million on ads praising Young or attacking Stutzman. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending $1 million on ads praising Young.\n\nRob Engstrom, the national political director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has called Stutzman hypocritical for initially seeking the group\u2019s endorsement, and then criticizing the chamber when he didn\u2019t get it.\n\nAlso, Young\u2019s campaign notes that members of House Republican leadership have helped Stutzman raise campaign funds in the past.\n\nYoung voted in 2011 and 2013 for budget deals that increased the legal limit on how much debt the government can hold. But Stutzman voted for the the same 2011 deficit reduction and debt limit plan, which included increasing the debt ceiling by $900 billion.\n\nBoth Young and Stutzman have voted multiple times to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. Stutzman\u2019s charge that Young voted to fund Obamacare refers to budget bills criticized by the conservative Heritage Action for America for not blocking all funding for the landmark 2010 health care law. But Stutzman, like Young, voted in 2015 for a budget blueprint that would\u2019ve scrapped part \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStutzman\u2019s claim that Young voted for Obama\u2019s \u201camnesty plan\u201d refers to Young\u2019s 2015 vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Young had supported language in the bill to bar the administration from spending money to carry out Obama\u2019s executive actions to provide work permits and protection from deportation for more than 4 million undocumented immigrants. But when that language was blocked by the Senate, Young continued to support the underlying bill, saying he wasn\u2019t willing to risk shutting down the Department of Homeland Security \u201cto make a political point about a distinctly different issue.\u201d\n\nTruth Squad: Stretching the Truth (Photo: Illustration)\n\nConclusion: Stutzman\u2019s ad is correct that Young is getting substantial help from the Chamber of Commerce and from groups with ties to McConnell. But Stutzman would have welcomed the business group\u2019s backing, and has a record of both fighting with \u2014 and receiving help from \u2014 House GOP leaders.\n\nThe Young votes the ad criticizes don\u2019t tell the full story of either Young\u2019s \u2014 or Stutzman\u2019s \u2014 voting records. There\u2019s not much difference between the two Republicans\u2019 views on the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration and the debt limit. But there are differences in the extent to which the candidates are willing to engage in budget showdowns \u2014 including shutting down parts of the government \u2014 over those issues.\n\nOverall rating: Stretching the truth.\n\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com or on Twitter: @mgroppe.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1We8YHk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ad doesn't tell the full story of Rep.
