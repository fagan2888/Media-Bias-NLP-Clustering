The Super Bowl is just a week away and according to a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, roughly 1-in-5 (21 percent) sports fans say they perform some ritual before or while watching their favorite team.

The survey also said, “The majority (66 percent) of rituals center around wearing team jerseys or clothing with the team’s colors. Asked to explain their rituals in their own words, some fans admitted to getting creative in their apparel choice: One fan reports wearing “a dirty pair of underwear ... over my pants and then I put my jersey on.”

Ritual or not, next Sunday is going to be an exciting day for Denver and Seattle fans. Here are a few pics of fans who already have their gameday “uniform” ready to go.
