The challenge has been a Republican Party that has become increasingly ideological and extreme, and I think that\u2019s reflected in the current presidential race.\u201d\n\nObama acknowledged the challenge posed by Republican Party opposition, saying his administration overcame much of it by expanding Pell grants, transferring student loan programs from banks, avoiding an economic crisis with the largest recovery package in U.S. history and passing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPhoto by Brayden Donnelly Dan Corey (left), editor-in-chief of The Daily Targum, and Mike Pavlichko, broadcast administrator for WRSU-FM Rutgers Radio, record the Targum's exclusive phone interview with President Barack Obama. Audio: The Daily Targum Interviews President Obama\n\nAudio by Dan Corey The Daily Targum conducted a 15-minute phone interview with President Barack Obama less than one week before he is set to speak at Rutgers University's 250th anniversary commencement.\n\nStill, the President feels optimistic about the future of the Republican Party following the general election this November.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of good people out there who are Republicans who don\u2019t recognize the direction that the party is taking,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sense is that there will be a corrective at some point, perhaps after this next presidential election.\u201d\n\nAmong registered Republican voters, 66 percent say that life in America today is worse than it was 50 years ago \u201cfor people like them,\" according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nObama said combatting low voter turnout would help solve Americans' dissatisfaction.\n\nThe United States should follow the lead of other developed nations by holding elections on weekend days or national holidays, Obama said. Doing so would facilitate greater voter participation and thus create a federal government more representative of the American electorate.\n\n\u201cThe single most dramatic political change that could occur in this country \u2014 and the best way for us to relieve the frustrations that people feel around the political process \u2014 would be if we had greater participation that was more reflective of the day-to-day concerns that people have,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cPeople who vote and elect representatives who share their views end up determining the agenda \u2014 and that is not just at the presidential level,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to move an agenda forward, you\u2019ve got to make sure that your views and voice are heard at every level of government.\u201d\n\nObama said \u201cmore needs to be done\u201d to improve the lives of struggling Americans. Step one is with education.\n\nThe Obama Administration has made efforts toward making a college education more affordable, but the President said people should understand the nation\u2019s place in the global economy.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we also recognize this is a big country, and there\u2019s very rarely a single set of silver bullets out there that would immediately solve all of these problems,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re part of an interconnected global economy now, and there\u2019s no going back from that.\u201d\n\nObama, who took office in 2009 \u2014 in the wake of the 2008 stock market crash \u2014 said many of his recovery policies will improve economic conditions for struggling Americans several years down the road.\n\n\u201cWe have to make incremental changes where we can, and every once in a while you\u2019ll get a breakthrough and make the kind of big changes that are necessary,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat consensus building is important because that\u2019s historically how change has happened in America.\u201d\n\nSmall changes can make large-scale change easier to accomplish, Obama said, proposing laws to close corporate tax loopholes.\n\nInvestment in easy access to education is also important, Obama said. The first step is accepting that young people need more than a high school diploma.\n\n\u201cIf we \u2026 make sure that we\u2019re investing in the kinds of things that make an economy grow, if we ensure that we\u2019ve got a healthcare system that is affordable and accessible for all people, then I\u2019m confident that America\u2019s best days are still ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nPolicymakers should continue to collaborate with institutions to reduce the costs that colleges and universities incur.\n\nThe President said his proposal for two free years of community college would be a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cLifelong learning is increasingly what\u2019s going to be necessary to be competitive in this dynamic economy \u2014 and that it\u2019s got to be affordable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have situations where young people are loaded up with $50,000, $75,000 or $100,000 worth of debt coming out of school.\u201d\n\nEven though the U.S. has its flaws, Obama said Americans should remember that their country has resources to be taken advantage of.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not a cause for complacency,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just tells us that when we put our shoulder behind the wheel and we\u2019re focused, that we can get things done.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the full transcript of The Daily Targum\u2019s exclusive interview with President Obama.\n\nDan Corey is the editor-in-chief of The Daily Targum.
