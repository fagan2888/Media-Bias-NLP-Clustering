Several hundred people filled the auditorium to hear Clinton's speech.

Clinton called this trip her inaugural visit to Maine since she launched her campaign back in April.

The former secretary of state was disrupted by a handful of protesters. They stood with signs that both support Clinton's presidential campaign and oppose the construction of the Keystone Pipeline.

Clinton asked them to move to the back of the crowd and they did.

In her speech, she hit the big Democratic points: strengthening organized labor, defending the Affordable Care Act, and protecting the rights of same-sex couples.

Clinton came to Maine to attend a fundraiser in Cape Elizabeth and to try to shore up support in non-early-voting states like Maine.

"Thank you for coming today but now I really need you to volunteer, to be part of the organization we're putting together in Maine, to talk to more friends and colleagues," Clinton told the crowd.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Jim Webb of Virginia, and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig are also campaigning for the Democratic nomination.
