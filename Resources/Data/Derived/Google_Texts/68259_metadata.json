And beyond that, you know, it\u2019s well-known that it\u2019s very difficult to get indictments against police. And we also know the history of failure to indict or failure to convict people who are guilty of offenses against African-Americans \u2014 African-American citizens.\n\nAnd so it was difficult to hear the previous guest, Mr. Carter, kind of ramble through that bureaucratic double-speak and say that the video attempts to show something, but we don\u2019t know what the grand jury experienced. We all have eyes, and we know that the person used a maneuver that is banned by the NYPD and that it culminated in this person\u2019s death.\n\nAnd no one said that the grand jury was supposed to have convicted Mr. Pantaleo for this. They simply said, was there enough evidence so there\u2019s a trial warranted? And to say that that didn\u2019t warrant a trial is a miscarriage of justice.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, let me\u2026\n\nJELANI COBB: So, I don\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t just say that.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Let me ask Candace McCoy about the idea of intent. That\u2019s one of the questions that has come up here, whether the police officer intended to commit \u2014 to create \u2014 to murder or to kill the suspect, whether that is a valid reason for the grand jury to decide not to indict.\n\nCANDACE MCCOY, The Graduate Center, John Jay College, City University of New York: That\u2019s right, Gwen.\n\nWe are talking about intent. We\u2019re talking about what is in the officer\u2019s mind. If you\u2019re going to convict somebody of manslaughter, you have to show that the person intended or at least recklessly allowed a death to take place.\n\nIn this case \u2014 and, of course, the grand jury standard is probable cause, more probable than not that this is the case \u2014 probably not. In fact, the officer himself said, I didn\u2019t intend this. I didn\u2019t intend him to die.\n\nWhat we have here is a really terrible mistake and probably negligence, but that\u2019s a civil lawsuit, and not a criminal prosecution.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Let me ask Jelani Cobb to respond to that. But, also, I want to ask you to respond to this idea that the mayor put forward today about retraining the police force and whether that will have some sort of effect.\n\nJELANI COBB: Well, I mean, here\u2019s the difficulty.\n\nPeople have known since Anthony Baez, certainly, if not known before then, and it\u2019s the plain logical deduction that if you cut off someone\u2019s air supply, it tends to culminate in a fatality, or at least this is a possibility. And so to say that this is just a simple mistake, there were four or five officers atop Mr. Garner.\n\nAnd so, what exactly would qualify? That\u2019s what I was wondering. If we could just be clear about the parameters, what exactly is law enforcement not allowed to do when\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: So does training speak to that?\n\nJELANI COBB: Well, I\u2019m not sure that it does, because the issue is not simply retraining.\n\nIf people are retrained, as this maneuver was already banned, but they don\u2019t follow the training, and there\u2019s no consequences for failure to follow the training, then we have accomplished nothing.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Let me ask Candace McCoy to weigh in on that.\n\nCANDACE MCCOY: Yes.\n\nLet\u2019s remember that there was a medical examiner report here, and the medical examiner of the city of New York took very careful note of what had happened. There are two parts of that report. And we seem to be forgetting the second part.\n\nThe first was that there had been pressure and compression on Mr. Garner\u2019s throat. Whether it was a chokehold or some other kind of hold, I think is basically immaterial. It was a bad thing.\n\nSecondly \u2014 and this is what people are forgetting \u2014 is that there was compression on his stomach. This is a classic case of what is known as positional asphyxia. Your viewers in Los Angeles will remember in the late \u201990s, there was a series of cases in which overweight people, many of them with asthma problems, were killed when they were arrested by police and in the bad tactics.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s bad tactics. They need retrained \u2014 but \u2014 but this is not a crime.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, there\u2019s a lot of conversation going on now, the Cleveland Police Department, the report that they used excessive force, the value of body cameras as part of the conversation, federal civil rights investigations.\n\nDoes this kind of scrutiny, the protests we see tonight, Jelani Cobb, do you think that can change what happens or alter what happens next, and should it?\n\nJELANI COBB: I mean, it should.\n\nIt\u2019s possibly the only hope that we have. When people have no recourse, they take to the streets in protest, when the system doesn\u2019t actually provide them with justice. And that\u2019s the only hope people have, that by organizing, they can create enough pressure to force institutions to not behave in the way that they typically would.\n\nGWEN IFILL: OK.\n\nJELANI COBB: And\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: One chance for a brief response from Candace McCoy.\n\nSorry.\n\nCANDACE MCCOY: I agree. I agree completely with Professor Cobb.\n\nI think that we have to change our focus from criminal prosecution. One more body behind bars is not going to work. But he is right. There are systematic changes that we have to look at here. And we can do that.\n\nGWEN IFILL: OK.\n\nCandace McCoy of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and Jelani Cobb of the University of Connecticut, thank you both.\n\nJELANI COBB: Thank you.\n\nCANDACE MCCOY: A pleasure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For a broader look at how the Eric Garner case and the intersection of race and justice are resonating with Americans, Gwen Ifill gets perspectives from Candace McCoy of City University of New York and Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker.", "pubdate": 20141204, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "For a broader look at how the Eric Garner case and the intersection of race and justice are resonating with Americans, Gwen Ifill gets perspectives from Candace McCoy of City University of New York and Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker.", "title": "Will outrage for grand jury verdicts trigger systemic changes?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/459936152.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/will-outrage-garner-ferguson-grand-jury-verdicts-trigger-systemic-changes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "For a broader look at how the Eric Garner case and the intersection of race and justice are resonating with Americans, Gwen Ifill gets perspectives from Candace McCoy of City University of New York and Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker.", "title": "Will outrage for grand jury verdicts trigger systemic changes?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/459936152.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "eric garner, ferguson, justice, New York, race"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39e3\"", "article_summary": "JELANI COBB: Well, I\u2019m not sure that it does, because the issue is not simply retraining.\nWas the grand jury\u2019s conclusion a surprise to you, Jelani Cobb?\nGWEN IFILL: Let me ask Jelani Cobb to respond to that.\nJELANI COBB: Thank you.\nJELANI COBB, The New Yorker: No, it wasn\u2019t."}
