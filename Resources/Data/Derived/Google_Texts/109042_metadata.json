Ghostbusters 3 will reportedly start production next year with a new director at the helm.\n\nIvan Reitman, who directed the first two Ghostbusters movies, has stated he will not be directing the third film in the wake of Harold Ramis\u2018 death. Ramis is Reitman\u2019s co-writer and close friend who played Dr. Egon Spengler in the first two Ghostbusters movies.\n\nReitman has also admitted that he was never completely sure of his involvement in the project and that the death of Ramis only heightened his decision to decline as director. He was thinking of just producing the film instead of directing it, and told Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal that he could help them find a \u201creally good director\u201d. Reitman is currently working on a short list so they can start filming by the beginning of 2015.\n\nBill Murray, who played the parapsychologist Peter Venkman in the previous films, also declined involvement. Since then, the screenplay has gone through several changes. Reitman says that there\u2019s a new draft that the production studio is very excited about, and it\u2019s written by him, screenwriter Etan Cohen, and Dan Aykroyd, who was one of the original co-writers and who played Ray Stantz in the earlier films. In contrast to Murray, Aykroyd has always expressed his enthusiasm for the sequel.\n\nHollywood is abuzz with conjectures of who the new director could be, and one of the names that is being heard more loudly than the others is that of Barry Sonnenfeld. Sonnenfeld has experienced working with Cohen and has the Men in Black franchise under his belt. The way he injected MIB with both humor and fright seems to be a good fit for the Ghostbusters.\n\nAnother thing for fans to fantasize about is the cast. Who will take over the roles of ghost hunters Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Raymond Stantz, and Winston Zeddmore? Will Slimer be present to play tricks? How about the sassy assistant Janine Melnitz? It would be interesting to find out which young actors will be chosen to wear those Proton packs and wield those Neutrino wands\u2014and to see how the particle accelerators will look like in 2015.\n\nReitman shares that the third Ghostbusters movie will feature the original cast \u201cin a very minor role\u201d and says that he is determined to keep the spirit of the original film in the reboot.\n\nImage via YouTube", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ghostbusters fans have been kept waiting long enough for the film's third sequel, and it seems that they will finally get to watch Peter Venkman and Co. in a", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ghostbusters fans have been kept waiting long enough for the film\u2019s third sequel, and it seems that they will finally get to watch Peter Venkman and Co. in a", "title": "Ghostbusters 3 To Film In 2015, Waiting For New Director", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1178739/ghostbusters-3-to-film-in-2015-waiting-for-new-director/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ghostbusters-31.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-20T01:02:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T02:18:01+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ghostbusters-31.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-03-20T01:02:04+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bill muray,dan akroyd,ghostbusters 3,movies", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ghostbusters-31.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ghostbusters fans have been kept waiting long enough for the film\u2019s third sequel, and it seems that they will finally get to watch Peter Venkman and Co. in a"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ea2\"", "article_summary": "Who will take over the roles of ghost hunters Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Raymond Stantz, and Winston Zeddmore?\nIvan Reitman, who directed the first two Ghostbusters movies, has stated he will not be directing the third film in the wake of Harold Ramis\u2018 death.\nGhostbusters 3 will reportedly start production next year with a new director at the helm.\nRamis is Reitman\u2019s co-writer and close friend who played Dr. Egon Spengler in the first two Ghostbusters movies.\nGhostbusters fans have been kept waiting long enough for the film\u2019s third sequel, and it seems that they will finally get to watch Peter Venkman and Co. in a couple of years\u2019 time."}
