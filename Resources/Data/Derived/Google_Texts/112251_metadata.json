After reviewing the records, Judge Howard Manning released them, but allowed much of the information to be redacted to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe autopsy report will remain sealed, Manning ruled, along with three non-testimonial identification applications and orders from people the judge said \u201care not presently parties to this proceeding and investigation.\u201d\n\nThe new information does little to answer the family\u2019s questions, said Hedgepeth\u2019s father, Roland Hedgepeth.\n\nRELATED: Family Pushes for Answers in Mysterious Death of Native Student\n\n\u201cIf anything, it raises more questions,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cThere was nothing released that brings any closure for the family.\u201d\n\nHedgepeth, 19, was found dead September 7, 2012, in her bedroom in an off-campus apartment complex. Authorities have not disclosed how she was killed or released the identity of any possible suspects. No one has been arrested or charged for her murder, but police did say they believe the crime was not random and the suspect likely knew her.\n\nFour months after the murder, in January 2013, police released a profile of their suspect, based on an FBI analysis and DNA evidence left in the apartment by an unidentified man. Since then, police have been mum.\n\nRELATED: DNA Evidence Provides Break in Native Student\u2019s Murder Case\n\nThe newly released information provides insights into Hedgepeth\u2019s last moments and what may have happened that night.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere,\u201d Hedgepeth\u2019s roommate, Karena Rosario, told a 911 dispatcher, according to the audio recording released July 2. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\n\nPolice have stated that Hedgepeth and Rosario went to a local nightclub, The Thrill, the night before Hedgepeth was killed. She was last known to be alive at 3 a.m., and was found dead about eight hours later.\n\nRosario placed the 911 call at 11:01 a.m. on September 7. She told the dispatcher Hedgepth was unconscious and cold, and that she believed someone had been in the apartment.\n\nWhen asked if Hedgepeth was breathing, Rosario said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe search warrants cover Hedgepeth\u2019s apartment, a second apartment in the complex, Hedgepeth\u2019s bank accounts, laptop computers and Facebook accounts belonging to Hedgepeth and Rosario, and a Facebook account belonging to an unidentified person. Bedding, clothes, paperwork and other items were taken from Hedgepeth\u2019s apartment and the second apartment, the warrants state. However, the list of items taken was partially redacted.\n\nThe warrants also cover a 1997 Honda Accord and a Nissan Altima owned by Hedgepeth\u2019s mother. The warrant for the Accord shows that analysts took evidence from the back seat and the driver\u2019s side door frame.\n\nRoland Hedgepeth said the family was not aware a second vehicle was searched.\n\n\u201cThe search warrants let us know there was another person of interest early on in the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the second anniversary of Hedgepeth\u2019s death approaching, the family is frustrated at the lack of an arrest, or information that reveals exactly what happened, Roland Hedgepeth said.\n\n\u201cOverall, the records raised more questions, and the police still won\u2019t answer any of them,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to call the Chapel Hill Police Department tip line at 919-614-6363 or Crime Stoppers at 919-942-7515 or email information to crimetips@townofchapelhill.org.
