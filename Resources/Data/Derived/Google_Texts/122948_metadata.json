Those things include savoring a sunset, listening to music, talking to a friend, and other pleasurable life experiences.\n\nIn other words, speed eating is messing with our attention spans.\n\nResearchers from the University of Toronto found that just \u201cthinking about fast food increases [the] preference for time-saving\u201d products and experiences.\n\n\u201cFast food allows people to fill their stomachs as quickly as possible and move on to other things,\u201d said Julian House, Sanford E. DeVoe and Chen-Bo Zhong in their study, \u201cToo Impatient to Smell the Roses: Exposure to Fast Food Impedes Happiness,\u201d published in Social Psychological and Personality Science. \u201cIt represents a culture that emphasizes time, efficiency and immediate gratification.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Obesity Will Kill More of Us Than We Thought\n\nSure, \u201cspeed can be efficient,\u201d said the researchers \u2013 for example, when rushing to work for a meeting or when trying to make it to your kid\u2019s dance recital or ball game on time. Yet all too often, \u201cthe goal of saving time will be activated with exposure to fast food regardless of whether time is a relevant factor\u201d or not.\n\nThe researchers noted that as people obtain more time-saving technologies today, they become more \u2013 and not less \u2013 impatient. We have a need for speed. Whether fast food created this situation or is one more result of an increasingly impatient and type-A culture in America is harder to discern. But what\u2019s clear is that we\u2019re all moving faster than ever before in an instant-gratification culture, where speed is not just rewarded but practically required for success \u2013 and that food is only one small part of the equation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Why do so many Americans keep scarfing down fast food when we know it\u2019s", "title": "Why Fast Food Is Making Us More Impatient", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/14/Why-Fast-Food-Making-Us-More-Impatient", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03242011_mcd_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/14/Why-Fast-Food-Making-Us-More-Impatient", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03242011_mcd_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Why do so many Americans keep scarfing down fast food when we know it\u2019s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3eb8\"", "article_summary": "Why do so many Americans keep scarfing down fast food when we know it\u2019s so bad for us?\nWhether fast food created this situation or is one more result of an increasingly impatient and type-A culture in America is harder to discern.\nYet all too often, \u201cthe goal of saving time will be activated with exposure to fast food regardless of whether time is a relevant factor\u201d or not.\nResearchers from the University of Toronto found that just \u201cthinking about fast food increases [the] preference for time-saving\u201d products and experiences.\nRelated: 10 Forbidden Foods We Can\u2019t ResistFast food is not only harming us physically, it\u2019s making us impatient about things that have little or nothing to do with food, according to a recent study."}
