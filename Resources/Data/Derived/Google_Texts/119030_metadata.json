Because the program is from several years ago, it may be a few days before we have a response as we discuss this program with current and former staff to gather information,\u201d said Paul Eagle, CRS director of communications.\n\nIt could not be determined whether \u201cMy Changing Body\u201d is still being administered in Rwanda, Africa\u2019s most densely populated nation, or whether the curriculum has been implemented elsewhere.\n\nThe Lepanto Institute report said the curriculum \u2014 which was taught to Rwandans ages 10 to 14 \u2014 is \u201ccompletely incompatible with Catholic moral teaching\u201d on such things as masturbation, condom use and contraceptives.\n\nCatholic teaching says masturbation is \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d and \u201cintrinsically disordered,\u201d Mr. Hichborn told The Washington Times.\n\nBut in \u201cMy Changing Body,\u201d the word \u201cmasturbation\u201d is used in a positive fashion 48 times, according to the Lepanto report, which is based on a review of the second edition of the curriculum. Moreover, \u201ca group exercise for boys called \u2018My Body Feels Good\u2019 [is] selling masturbation as \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018not harmful.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe report also objects to how the curriculum discusses \u201cintimate details on the mechanics\u201d of sexual intercourse; the use of contraceptives, including condoms, the \u201cmorning-after pill\u201d and sterilization; and the issue of \u201csexual identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeterosexual, gay, lesbian and bisexual youth can all experience same-gender sexual attraction and/or activity around puberty,\u201d according to \u201cMy Changing Body.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch behavior, including sexual play with same-gender peers, crushes on same-gender adults, or sexual fantasies about same-gender people are normal for preteens and young teens, and are not necessarily related to sexual orientation,\u201d the curriculum said. However, \u201cyoung adolescents who are experiencing sexual attraction to and romantic feelings for someone of their own gender need support so they can clarify their feelings and accept their sexuality.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s recommended resources include the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States and youth websites such as Go Ask Alice at Columbia University, I Wanna Know at the American Social Health Association and Sex, Etc. at Rutgers University.\n\nThe Lepanto report said Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Reproductive Health paid CRS and the international Catholic charity Caritas, which operates out of dioceses in Rwanda, to implement the program with \u201cvery young adolescents\u201d in 2009 and 2010.\n\nRequested responses from IRH were not immediately available, however, in October IRH said the \u201cMy Changing Body\u201d curriculum was available online in English, French, Spanish and Kinyarwanda, the official language of Rwanda.\n\nCatholic Relief Services has rebuffed earlier criticisms from groups such as American Life League, where Mr. Hichborn served for eight years.\n\nIn an April 2014 statement, CRS spokesman Jim Stipe said the group is \u201ca pro-life organization dedicated to preserving the sacredness and dignity of human life from conception to natural death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are resolute in our commitment to the Church and its teaching,\u201d Mr. Stipe said, adding that while corrective comments given in the spirit of Christian charity are welcome, \u201cunrelenting attacks are not helpful.\u201d\n\nHe said CRS \u201cworks with groups that do not share our Catholic values,\u201d but does not participate in programs that \u201crun contrary to Church teachings\u201d and seeks advice from USCCB on questionable practices and policies.\n\nIn a 2013 statement, the USCCB said that people publicly criticizing CRS \u201cdo not speak for the Catholic Church,\u201d and Catholic faithful should consult the CRS website for clarification before endorsing any critiques.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 group added that it has thoroughly investigated allegations about CRS adherence to Church teaching and its identity as a Catholic institution, and \u201cwe wish to assure the Catholic faithful that CRS fully and faithfully adheres to Church teaching in fulfilling its mission of mercy.\u201d\n\nCRS does not distribute contraceptives, upholds pro-life teachings in its work and uses a \u201ccareful vetting system\u201d to ensure its activities and partnerships with other groups or governments do not violate Catholic teaching, the USCCB said in 2013.\n\nThe \u201cMy Changing Body\u201d curriculum, which says it relied on the work of abortion rights groups and their allies in sex education, \u201cshould have been untouchable to Catholics to begin with,\u201d said Mr. Hichborn, adding that the resources the curriculum listed did not include \u201ca single sexually conservative organization on that list at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia nonprofit research group is blowing the
