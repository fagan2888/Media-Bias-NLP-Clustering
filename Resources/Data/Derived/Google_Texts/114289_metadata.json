Two have been released, and three \u2013 Anthony Gorham, 29; Kisha Gorham, 39; and a 14-year-old juvenile who is also in the same family \u2013 remained hospitalized Saturday.\n\nNeither Harrison nor State Fair officials would comment on their injuries.\n\nOperator arrested in State Fair ride incident\n\n\"It makes me mad to think that anybody would put people's safety in danger like they have, and I'm not mad, I'm furious,\" State Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said. \"I can't hardly stand it, and that's where my patience runs thin.\"\n\nTutterrow is a four-year employee of Family Attractions Company, an independent ride contractor out of Valdosta, Ga., that was hired by Powers Great American Midways to provide the Vortex at this year's fair.\n\nThe Vortex is the only ride the company has at the fair.\n\nTroxler said he was confident in the safety of the fair's other rides but that fair officials would probably thoroughly examine the ride policy to determine if any changes should be made for next year.\n\n\"I think this is an isolated incident,\" he said. \"I remain confident that Powers Great American is a great, great carnival operator.\"\n\nJoyce Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for Family Attractions, said in a statement Sunday that the company has \"an excellent equipment safety record and has never before experienced an incident with any of its rides like this one.\"\n\nWRAL News, however, discovered that it has had three unspecified injury accidents in Georgia, and federal records show company transport trucks had safety issues at a rate well above the national average.\n\nAccording to a description of the Vortex, the main arm is hydraulically lifted to a 30-degree angle, and the V-shaped center of the ride starts rotating while car arms on each side spin, twirl and flip passengers upside down.\n\nThe Vortex ride was shut down and won't restart before the fair ends Sunday night, fair spokesman Brian Long said.\n\nPeople on the midway Saturday night were stunned to learn of the arrest.\n\n\"It's shocking because you would think they would be more careful with things like that because people's lives could be at risk,\" said Kia Owens of Fayetteville.\n\n\"Our kids really enjoy riding these rides and it makes me very uncomfortable to know that someone is doing something that's very unsafe,\" said fair-goer Pam Owens.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-10-26 19:25:00", "description": "The investigation into Thursday's ride accident at the N.C.
