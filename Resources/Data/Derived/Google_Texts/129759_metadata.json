New enrollment dropped to 72,968 from Dec. 16 to Jan. 11, according to the state.\n\nLee said he expected a slowdown during the holidays, and the exchange had stopped advertising for that period. Ads resumed airing Jan. 5.\n\nState officials also reported that 466,778 people have joined Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program for low-income people, since Nov. 15. That's in addition to the 2.2 million who had already enrolled in 2014 as part of the health-law expansion.\n\nMedi-Cal enrollment is open year-round.\n\nIn addition to handling enrollment, California is preparing to send tax notices starting Jan. 20 to about 1 million consumers who received federal premium subsidies last year.\n\nConsumers may have to repay some portion of that government assistance as part of their 2014 tax return if their income was higher than what they estimated during enrollment.\n\nThis will be the first time the Affordable Care Act affects tax season for millions of Americans nationwide and officials are bracing for the inevitable questions and confusion.\n\nCovered California said it has increased its service-center staff to handle a late surge of enrollment and answer questions related to subsidies and taxes.\n\nPeople who were uninsured last year also face penalties for the first time when filing their 2014 taxes.\n\nLee estimated that 1 million Californians may be subject to a penalty for lacking health insurance.\n\nPeople can seek exemptions to the federal fines because of financial hardship or other reasons.\n\nFor the 2014 tax year, the penalty is $95 per adult or 1% of modified adjusted gross income, whichever is higher. Those penalties increase for 2015 to $325 per adult or 2% of income.\n\n\"How many are subject to the penalty depends on how many seek exemptions,\" Lee said. \"Until we go through that process we won't know.\"\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New Obamacare enrollments in California top 217,000", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's health insurance exchange said 217,146 people have newly signed up for Obamacare coverage after nearly two months of open enrollment.", "title": "New Obamacare enrollments in California top 217,000", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20150113-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b5580b/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20150113", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Affordable care act, obamacare, covered california", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82525448", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-13", "Description": "California's health insurance exchange said 217,146 people have newly signed up for Obamacare coverage after nearly two months of open enrollment.
