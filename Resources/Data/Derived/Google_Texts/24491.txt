The fall youth sports season is getting ready to start and Saturday local young athletes got the chance to learn from one of the area's best.

Daniel Davidson, a former MLB pitcher who also played at Mosley, Gulf Coast, and Florida State, is back home in Southport.

Davidson coaches his son's tee ball team and spent his Saturday at the Southport Ballpark.

He taught a throwing and pitching clinic for more than 50 kids from ages 6-13.

"I thought they did a pretty good job," explained Davidson. "I thought a lot of them that listened and listened well. I hope they take it to their practices and their baseball season this year so that they are able to keep throwing consistently and then, if they do pitch, they are able to throw strikes consistently."
