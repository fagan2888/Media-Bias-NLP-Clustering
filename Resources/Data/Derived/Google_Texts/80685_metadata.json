The $612 billion measure sets spending limits for all Defense Department programs and initiatives for the coming fiscal year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT In a statement, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said the massive authorization bill \u201cfails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities\u201d and instead uses the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, commonly known as the war fund, \u201cin ways that leaders of both parties have made clear are inappropriate.\u201d\n\nUnder a 2011 budget deal, the ceiling on defense spending is set at $523 billion.\n\nThe 2016 NDAA keeps that ceiling but beefs up the war fund to $96 billion to provide the Pentagon with more breathing room and to appease defense hawks.\n\nThe administration also opposes the policy blueprint because it places further restrictions on President Obama\u2019s ability to transfer detainees from the U.S. prison facility in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAs a candidate, Obama vowed to shutter the facility before he left office, and at the end of last year, he accelerated his efforts, angering Capitol Hill Republicans. \u201cThe restrictions contained in this bill are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy,\u201d according to the OMB.\n\nIn addition, the NDAA, which was approved in a 60-2 vote earlier this month by the House Armed Services Committee, rejects many of the cost-cutting measures proposed in the president\u2019s budget, such as a new round of base closures.\n\n\u201cIt also includes non-germane provisions, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act, that have nothing to do with national defense,\u201d the OMB notes, referring to the fierce debate over placing the greater sage-grouse on the Interior Department\u2019s list.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "OMB said the bill \"fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities.\"", "description": "OMB said the bill \"fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "OMB said the bill \"fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities.\"", "title": "White House threatens to veto House defense measure", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241865-white-house-threatens-to-veto-house-defense-measure", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/whitehouse_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241865-white-house-threatens-to-veto-house-defense-measure", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-12T20:29-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-12T20:29:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241865-white-house-threatens-to-veto-house-defense-measure", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "OMB said the bill \"fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "White House threatens to veto House defense measure"}, "dcterms.title": "White House threatens to veto House defense measure"}, "article_summary": "The White House has threatened to veto the House draft of the annual defense policy bill.\nThe House is set to vote this week on the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\nThe $612 billion measure sets spending limits for all Defense Department programs and initiatives for the coming fiscal year.\n\u201cIt also includes non-germane provisions, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act, that have nothing to do with national defense,\u201d the OMB notes, referring to the fierce debate over placing the greater sage-grouse on the Interior Department\u2019s list.\nThe 2016 NDAA keeps that ceiling but beefs up the war fund to $96 billion to provide the Pentagon with more breathing room and to appease defense hawks."}
