She already had six children.\n\nSuleman has been charged with failing to disclose nearly $30,000 in income she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actressduring the first six months of last year, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said.\n\n\u201cWhile applying for public aid, the mother of 14 children allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos,\u201d Lacey said in a news release.\n\nSuleman is charged with one count of aid by misrepresentation and two counts of perjury by false application for aid, reports Paresh Dave at the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Suleman said she wants to build a business that would help pay for food, shelter and college expenses for her children.\n\nRegardless of how good a mother Suleman may be, she was unbelievably irresponsible for choosing to have so many children without sustainable financial means to take care of them.\n\n\u201cThe public backlash against Suleman is easy to understand,\u201d wrote Karin Klein in an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt feels like an insult to parents who carefully weigh how much time and financial support they can give their children when deciding how many to have. It feels like an injustice to people who engage in responsible decision-making so that they try to avoid being a burden on society.\u201d\n\nBut Klein goes on to write: \u201cSuleman herself may be deserving of nothing, but her children didn\u2019t create any of this mess. They need to be fed, and while this might rile our taxpaying sensibilities to the core, it\u2019s society\u2019s job to make sure that innocent children are fed.\u201d\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nDoes Suleman\u2019s choice to have children she can\u2019t afford insult you? Send your responses to colorofmoney@washpost.com. Put \u201cCelebrity Cash\u201d in the subject. Be sure to include your full name, city and state.\n\nLet\u2019s Chat\n\nToday, at noon ET, join me for a live online discussion.\n\nMy guest today is Beverly Harzog, author of \u201cConfessions of a Credit Junkie: Everything You Need to Know to Avoid the Mistakes I Made.\u201d Harzog\u2019s book was the December pick for the Color of Money Book Club.\n\nI\u2019ll also be available to answer your questions if you\u2019ve been participating in the 21-day financial fast, which started Monday. You can learn more about the fast here.\n\nOverpaid, Underpaid\n\nWhat would you say are the most overpaid or underpaid jobs in the United States?\n\nWell, when people were polled they thought financial managers were overpaid. About 77 percent of people think financial managers, with a mean income of $123,260 a year, earn too much, according to a Business Insider/Survey Monkey Audience survey.\n\nNot surprisingly, people also thought company chief executives, financial analysts and lawyers were overpaid.\n\nAlmost 90 percent of those surveyed thought agricultural workers, with a mean income of $21,920 a year, were underpaid. Among the other workers who survey participants thought didn\u2019t get paid enough: child-care workers, cooks, restaurant servers, firefighters and high school teachers.\n\nSo, does your opinion matter?\n\n\u201cPoliticians can promote equality through policies like a higher minimum wage,\u201d Andy Kiersz, Mke Nudelman and Gus Lubin write for Business Insider.\n\nAnd companies \u201cmight consider raising wages themselves to build goodwill and a stronger workforce\u201d the writers contend.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\nFar fewer young adults have signed up on the new health care exchanges than the government has said will be needed to make the economics of the health care law work, reports The Washington Post\u2019s Amy Goldstein and Sandhya Somashekhar.\n\nTwenty-four percent of the nearly 2.2 million people who enrolled in the marketplaces through the end of December are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to a progress report on the exchanges released on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe figures mean that the proportion of young adults is lagging behind what both government and outside health policy analysts have said will be required for the exchanges to remain stable. Analyses have concluded that, to prevent health plans\u2019 premiums from rising and some insurers from potentially dropping out, roughly two in five Americans in the plans should be young adults,\u201d Goldstein and Somashekhar write.\n\nAdministration officials are ramping up their efforts to reach young adults and get them enrolled. There\u2019s still time to get coverage. Open enrollment doesn\u2019t end until March 31.\n\nFinancial New Year\u2019s Resolutions\n\nFor last week\u2019s Color of Money Question, I asked: \u201cHow do you plan to keep any resolutions you made to become a better money manager for your personal finances in 2014?\u201d\n\nHere are some responses from Facebook:\n\nClassic Daphne C. Blue of Buffalo, N.Y., wrote: \u201cNot buy unnecessary things like more shoes/purses. Put a down payment on a house\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch what I spend and try using cash I got,\u201d wrote Gia Saunders of the District. \u201c[I got] $60 out of the bank for this week and I still have some left. I find that cash is better.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing cash, saving the receipts and write every expenditure in my notebook,\u201d added Adrienne TheChef Washington.\n\nTia Lewis contributed to this report.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20071, or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
