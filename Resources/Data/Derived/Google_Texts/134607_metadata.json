Early Steps providers reported a 5 percent increase in enrollment and a 6.5 percent increase in referrals last year, according to the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council.\n\nThat's consistent with a report the Department of Health provided to the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this month. According to DOH, the number of referrals to Early Steps increased from just under 43,000 in fiscal year 2012-2013 to nearly 48,000 in fiscal year 2014-2015.\n\n\"I don't think it's a temporary blip,\" said Sue Ventura, the chief executive officer of Easter Seals Florida. \"I think the need is there.\"\n\nThe growing demand contributed to a flap last winter when the health department, citing a budget shortfall, cut 13 full-time positions --- nearly all of the staff --- from the Early Steps central program office. Since then, Gardiner and Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, have monitored the program.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Health's chief operating officer, Jennifer Tschetter, told Garcia's panel that her agency \"is confident about its ability to stay within its appropriation this year for the Early Steps program.\"\n\nChildren's advocates now are hoping that more money for Early Steps will bring a change to the program's eligibility requirements, which were tightened in 2010.\n\n\"There are more children that fall into at-risk categories,\" Ventura said. \"They used to be included in the eligibility criteria, but the criteria were changed. With more money, we could expand the criteria.\"\n\nGardiner \"wants to make sure that level of funding is adequate going forward,\" Senate spokeswoman Katie Betta wrote in an email. \"He wants to take a deeper look at identification --- how are these children being identified? Who gets served and how are we serving them? Are they being served effectively? What are the metrics so we know year over year how they are doing? He wants to make sure the funding is purchasing effective services for the right people at a time when it is going to make the most difference.\"\n\nIronically, advocates say, one reason for the growing demand for Early Steps was the very threat to its funding last winter. The attention on the program caused more families to learn that the services were available.\n\n\"Sometimes misfortune and crisis bring certain issues to the forefront, and everybody talks about them,\" said Diana Ragbeer, director of public policy at the Miami-based Children's Trust. \"All of the discussion last session did brand Early Steps. A lot of people kept asking, 'What's Early Steps? What is that?'\"\n\nBut now, she said, Gardiner and Garcia are leading a more unified effort.\n\n\"Everybody is trying to work together on a long-term plan of improved efficiencies and making sure that children get all they need,\" Ragbeer said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Led by Senate President Andy Gardiner, the 2016 Legislature will consider another increase in funding for Early Steps, which serves infants and toddlers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/senate-president-eyes-early-intervention-childhood-disabilities", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201412/Gardiner2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Led by Senate President Andy Gardiner, the 2016 Legislature will consider another increase in funding for Early Steps, which serves infants and toddlers", "title": "Senate President Eyes Early Intervention In Childhood Disabilities"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Margie Menzel of the News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 768, "dc": {"title": "Senate President Eyes Early Intervention In Childhood Disabilities"}, "nid": 12376, "datePublished": "2015-10-20", "story_id": 450218148, "keywords": "Early Steps, developmental delays, developmental disabilities, demand for services, Florida Department of Health, Florida Legislature", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Early Steps providers reported a 5 percent increase in enrollment and a 6.5 percent increase in referrals last year, according to the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council.\nThat's consistent with a report the Department of Health provided to the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this month.\nChildren's advocates now are hoping that more money for Early Steps will bring a change to the program's eligibility requirements, which were tightened in 2010.\nAccording to DOH, the number of referrals to Early Steps increased from just under 43,000 in fiscal year 2012-2013 to nearly 48,000 in fiscal year 2014-2015.\n\"I will be asking my committees to take a look at early intervention and Early Steps, specifically on, 'Are we capturing all the children that could be identified as having a need?\"\""}
