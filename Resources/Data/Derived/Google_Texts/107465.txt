The Senate on Tuesday voted 97-0 to adopt an amendment to include a collection of lands and waters bills, to the wide-ranging energy bill back on the Senate floor.

The measure, offered by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), includes 30 different provisions such as those that would ensure public lands and national forests are accessible for hunting, fishing and recreational shooting; correct federal survey errors and adjust boundaries; and increase renewable hydropower projects and keep some existing projects online, Murkowski said on the Senate floor.

“A broad package, a package that is balanced and a packaged that just continues to add to the good in the overall energy bill,” Murkowski said in describing the amendment.

The Senate is scheduled to vote on seven more amendments today for S.2012.
