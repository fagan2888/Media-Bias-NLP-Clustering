PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Al Franken, a strong supporter of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, said Thursday that it\u2019s too early to extend enrollment deadlines or delay insurance mandates despite ongoing problems with the federal exchange.\n\nSpeaking to the media after meeting in St. Paul with medical device company officials, the Minnesota Democrat said ongoing technical problems with the federal health insurance website are \u201cinexcusable.\u201d But Franken said he thinks they\u2019re getting better.\n\n\u201cHopefully the federal website will improve,\u201d Franken said. He said the health insurance exchange in Massachusetts, which was an inspiration for the federal site, initially prompted multiple visits by struggling users when it debuted \u2014 but has since helped extend coverage to 99 percent of state residents.\n\nIn recent days, several of Franken\u2019s fellow U.S. Senate Democrats have asked the Obama administration to extend a March 31 deadline for enrollment in insurance under the new law. That would likely also force a delay in the law\u2019s individual mandate, the provision by which Americans face tax penalties if they don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nSens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, David Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina advocated an extension. Like Franken, both Pryor and Hagan are up for re-election next year and are likely to be judged by voters for the success or failure of the law at that point.\n\nFranken wasn\u2019t ready to join their chorus, though he didn\u2019t rule out eventual delay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how long this takes to get fixed and how much improved this is,\u201d Franken said. \u201cI\u2019d be open to that if this continues, of course, but my understanding is this is improving every day.\u201d\n\nFranken said he\u2019s pleased with the progress so far of Minnesota\u2019s health insurance exchange, which is being run by the state.\n\nFranken continued to call for the repeal of a tax on medical device makers that is helping to fund Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. A number of Minnesota\u2019s members of Congress, from both parties, have pushed to repeal the tax; Minnesota\u2019s medical device industry is the nation\u2019s largest per capita in the country.\n\nThe tax is estimated to raise $30 billion in revenue for the health overhaul, but Franken said he believed money to replace that could be found as part of a larger congressional budget deal.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
