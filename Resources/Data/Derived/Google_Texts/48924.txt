The Krewe of Muses remain Carnival's high fashion, but the Knights of Chaos offer also provide riposte on the route on Thursday (Feb. 27) night. Along with several floats once used by the Knights of Momus, the 14-year-old krewe keeps the tradition of satire alive on St. Charles. Take an early look at some of this year's floats:

This year, the krewe is going to hell. Floats put current topics from marijuana legalization to Obamacare to global warming through their persecution of parody.

Bobby Jindal is characterized as an "ambitious little devil, playing the siren's song of Republican hopes for 2016 and beyond," according to a descrption of the floats from the krewe.

"There's a conservative in every basket this year as the demons fiddle in Washington. Can Bobby charm the snakes to come out and get their heads chopped off," the description reads.

As for marijuana, the krewe's float is taking the evil upward for a change with "High as Hell."

The krewe lampoons President Barack Obama and this year's two Super Bowl teams.

"Those NFL player concissions just got a little easier to bear," the descrption says.

New Orleans also gets held up to the farcical flames with a float theme that proclaims, "the roads to hell are everywhere in New Orleans."

"Tourists are special prey, as tow trucks and premium boots await at the end of the journey. Will the construction ever end? Only Boh Bros. knows for sure," the description says.
