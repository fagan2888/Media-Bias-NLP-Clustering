Amid the high-profile epic battles, including the recent clashes following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, there have been smaller, under-the-radar ones, too \u2014 often appearing to touch only tangentially on actual guns.\n\nIndeed, the NRA doesn\u2019t pick its battles: It fights every single one, according to Professor Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York in Cortland and author of \u201cThe Politics of Gun Control.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of their political strategy is to look for any issue, any time, any place, any moment where they can exert some political pressure,\u201d Spitzer said, \u201cbecause the larger strategy is to be aggressive and always be on the offensive.\u201d\n\nLast fall, the gun rights group joined the American Civil Liberties Union in expressing alarm over the government\u2019s domestic surveillance program, saying that the National Security Agency\u2019s massive data collection was an affront to the First Amendment and a de facto \u2014 and possibly illegal \u2014 gun registry kept by the government.\n\nIn the case of the ivory ban, Spitzer said, the NRA sees it as \u201canother instance of government extending its long, intrusive hand into law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nThe NRA argues that banning the sale of ivory could prevent gun owners from selling firearms ornamented with ivory. The ban, the group says, would render many collections of firearms valueless. Antiques dealers, as well as musicians with instruments decorated with the material, also oppose the ban, which could go into effect in June.\n\nThe way the NRA sees it, any issue could serve as a slippery slope that leads to further government curbs on guns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The advocacy group has launched political fights that extend onto environmental and health care battlefields", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/12/nra-ivory-poaching.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/4/12/nra-ivory-poaching/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.nra_041014.1397305138527.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "The advocacy group has launched political fights that extend onto environmental and health care battlefields", "title": "NRA gunning for more than just right to bear arms"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/4/12/nra-ivory-poaching/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.nra_041014.1397305138527.jpg", "description": "The advocacy group has launched political fights that extend onto environmental and health care battlefields", "card": "summary", "title": "NRA gunning for more than just right to bear arms"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Gun Violence, Gun Laws, U.S., NRA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0811\"", "article_summary": "The way the NRA sees it, any issue could serve as a slippery slope that leads to further government curbs on guns.\nWhen it comes to defending gun rights, no issue is seemingly too obscure for the NRA \u2014 not even the ivory trade.\nIn the case of the ivory ban, Spitzer said, the NRA sees it as \u201canother instance of government extending its long, intrusive hand into law-abiding citizens.\u201dThe NRA argues that banning the sale of ivory could prevent gun owners from selling firearms ornamented with ivory.\nWhile the NRA said it agreed with the goal of ending endangered elephant poaching, it warned that something far more important was at stake: \u201cThis is another attempt by this anti-gun administration to ban firearms,\u201d the organization asserted in an alert.\nWhen the Obama administration announced plans to halt the domestic sale of most elephant ivory, the National Rifle Association urged its members to mobilize against the ban."}
