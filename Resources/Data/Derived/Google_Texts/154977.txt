If you love LeBron James but you hate Obamacare, you might have some conflicting thoughts about the NBA star's latest endeavor.

President Barack Obama reached out to LeBron for assistance in promoting the Affordable Care Act and the veteran Miami Heat forward was glad to help.

James is now featured in an advertisement in which he encourages everyone to enroll before the end of April, March 31, which is said to be the deadline for enrollment.

"Any way I can help the president, that's pretty cool," James said earlier in the week, according to Ethan Skolnick for Bleacher Report.

James said in the video that he hopes his voice is able to help people become more knowledgeable about the new healthcare.

"It's almost like car insurance," James said. "You want to put yourself in a position where-you hope you never get into an accident-but if you do, you want to be secure. And I think a lot of young adults and African-Americans as well are afraid because they are not even educated about it."

LeBron did not seem to be fazed when asked about how he felt advocating for something that has been so controversial.

"I mean, I can't worry about that," James said. "Especially who I am. I mean, I know that everything that I do is going to be bigger than what it should be or blown out of proportion. But what I believe in and the people that I support is what it's all about. So I can sleep comfortably at night."
