Could it be because of what he\u2019s done in the White House? As you get a refresher on the national nightmare that has been Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, keep in mind that the biggest difficulty in compiling it was limiting it to just 50 examples of corruption, dishonesty, and incompetence.\n\n1) Because of Obama\u2019s policies since he became President, 11,472,000 Americans have left the work force.\n\n2) \u201cFewer Americans are at work today than in April 2000, even though the population since then has grown by 31 million.\u201d \u2014 Mortimer Zuckerman\n\n3) The number of Americans on welfare has hit record highs.\n\n4) A record 20% of Americans were on food stamps in 2013.\n\n5) The almost 11 million Americans getting disability payments is now approaching the population of Cuba\n\n6) Our nation lost its AAA credit rating because Obama is spending so much money.\n\n7) Not only was Cash for Clunkers a wasteful government program that \u201ccost $1.4 million for every job it created and did little to reduce carbon emissions,\u201d destroying the \u201cclunkers\u201d helped dramatically jack up the cost of used cars for the rest of the country.\n\n8) After BP had a huge oil spill in the Gulf, Obama not only bungled the clean-up process, he slowed oil production from other companies that had done nothing wrong which led to higher oil prices.\n\n9) Obama has helped drive up the cost of gas by blocking the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n10) When he was running for office in 2008, Obama claimed that, \u201cUnder my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\u201d He lied.\n\n11) Through 2013, the Obama Administration had imposed new regulations on businesses that cost 46 billion dollars a year.\n\n12) Taxpayers lost 25 billion dollars on Obama\u2019s bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. Chrysler isn\u2019t even an American company any more. It\u2019s now owned by an Italian company, Fiat.\n\n13) When he was running for office, Obama called Bush \u201cunpatriotic\u201d for adding so much to the debt and promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. Yet, the national debt is up 7 trillion dollars since Obama became President. That\u2019s more debt than all U.S. Presidents from George Washington through Bill Clinton combined.\n\n14) Obama\u2019s administration gave guns to Mexican cartels that were used to murder hundreds of Mexicans and border agent Brian Terry. The Obama Administration has refused to cooperate with the investigation or hold anyone accountable for that illegal behavior.\n\n15) The NSA has spied on Americans under Obama.\n\n16) Under Obama, the CIA spied on the Senate.\n\n17) Obama\u2019s campaign contributors at Solyndra were handed 535 million dollars of taxpayer money that the Obama Administration knew they would never be able to pay back before they gave it to them.\n\n18) The IRS targeted Obama\u2019s political enemies including Christian groups, pro-Israel groups, and most prominently, Tea Party groups. The Obama Administration has refused to cooperate with the investigation or hold anyone accountable for the illegal behavior.\n\n19) Numerous donors to Mitt Romney were audited by the IRS after giving him large contributions.\n\n20) When the EPA and IRS were asked to provide emails requested by Congress as part of an investigation into their illegal activities, they\u2019ve claimed over and over again to have lost the information because of \u201chard drive crashes.\u201d Given that it\u2019s quite easy to back up a hard drive and that they\u2019re required by law to retain that information, it seems likely that they\u2019re habitually destroying evidence to hide their illegal activities.\n\n21) Veterans received poor health care and even died because of the incompetence and cover-ups of Obama\u2019s VA.\n\n22) Even Barney Frank admits Barack Obama shamelessly lied to the American people to get Obamacare passed \u2013 and lie, he did. He promised that Americans could keep their insurance plans, that they could keep their doctors, and that Obamacare would save the average family $2500 per year. Not only were all of those lies, Obama knew they were lies when he made those promises.\n\n23) Barack Obama has broken the law repeatedly by making at least 23 unilateral changes to Obamacare.\n\n24) Obama has been illegally trying to force Christians to pay for abortifacients via Obamacare.\n\n25) Obamacare has been a disaster that cost millions their insurance and sent health care costs spiraling into the stratosphere.\n\n26) Obama is taking 700 billion dollars out of Medicare to put into Obamacare.\n\n27) The website portion of Obamacare, healthcare.gov, was a non-functional disaster for months when it rolled out and Obama claimed he was completely unaware that there was anything wrong with it.\n\n28) Instead of calming people down, Obama helped to turn Americans against each other racially be inserting himself into the Trayvon Martin case.\n\n29) Obama created so much racial animosity by attacking the police when they had done nothing wrong in the Henry Louis Gates case that he had to have a ridiculous \u201cbeer summit\u201d to try to undo the damage.\n\n30) The Department of Justice failed to pursue a voter intimidation case against members of the New Black Panthers because they were black and liberal. Former DOJ official J. Christian Adams quit over the case and \u201caccused his former employer of instructing attorneys in the civil rights division to ignore cases that involve black defendants and white victims.\u201d\n\n31) George W. Bush quit playing golf in 2003 because he didn\u2019t want the mother of some fallen soldier to see the Commander-in-Chief out playing golf. He also said he thought playing golf during a war sent the wrong signal to the American people. Through June of 2014, Obama was up to 177 rounds and is on pace to play twice as much in his second term as his first term.\n\n32) Obama chose tax cheat Tim Geithner to be his Secretary of the Treasury and then has had the audacity to spend his whole presidency pushing for higher taxes.\n\n33) After promising to unite America when he was running for office in 2008, Obama has been the most hyper-partisan President in decades.\n\n34) Despite the fact that Barack Obama claimed to believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman when he was running for President in 2008, his Department of Justice asked states attorney general to refuse to defend their states\u2019 bans on gay marriage in court.\n\n35) The Department of Justice has worked overtime to help increase voter fraud by fighting against voter ID. This is despite the fact that you need ID to buy alcohol, drive a car, fly on a plane or even to use Obamacare.\n\n36) He\u2019s the reason why countless Americans have been groped, molested and harassed by the TSA, even though agents never caught a terrorist sticking their hand down anyone\u2019s pants.\n\n37) He\u2019s responsible for the dumbing down of our education system with Common Core.\n\n38) We first landed on the moon in 1969, but because of Obama, we\u2019re no longer even capable of going into space.\n\n39) His servile bowing to other world leaders is embarrassing and un-American.\n\n40) Barack Obama engaged in an illegal war in Libya without the permission of Congress that helped turn that country into an unstable basket case run by radical Islamists. How bad is it? America, Libyans and the rest of the world were better off with Muammar Gaddafi in charge. That\u2019s how bad it is.\n\n41) Radical Islamist Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan \u201cdescribed himself as mujahedeen\u201d and yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he murdered 13 of his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood. The Obama Administration labeled that as \"workplace violence\" rather than admitting there was a terrorist attack on his watch.\n\n42) He released 5 Taliban terrorists In exchange for deserter Bowe Bergdahl.\n\n43) Americans died at Benghazi because Obama\u2019s administration didn\u2019t take their repeated requests for additional security seriously.\n\n44) Russia annexed Crimea while Obama did nothing of consequence to discourage it from invading. That\u2019s not a surprise for a President who is fond of throwing out \u201cred lines\u201d that don\u2019t mean anything.\n\n45) Obama\u2019s premature pull-out in Iraq and foolish refusal to get a status of forces agreement in Iraq left the country vulnerable and led to the terrorists in ISIS taking over a large portion of that country.\n\n46) Barack Obama unilaterally implemented the DREAM Act that Congress didn\u2019t pass and illegally handed out work permits to illegal aliens.\n\n47) Obama is threatening to bypass Congress and simply \u201clegalize\u201d millions more of illegal immigrants even though it\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional and it hurts the American people and will further encourage even more illegal aliens to surge across the border.\n\n48) The fence on our southern border was supposed to be completed by 2009. The Obama Administration has made it clear that it doesn\u2019t intend to finish it during his presidency.\n\n49) Barack Obama is deliberately creating a crisis on the southern border by refusing to deport illegal aliens crossing into our country.\n\n50) For all practical purposes, Barack Obama has already unilaterally implemented amnesty in America because \u201cat least 99.92% of illegal immigrants and visa overstays without known crimes on their records\u201d aren\u2019t being deported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why would anyone dislike Barack Obama?
