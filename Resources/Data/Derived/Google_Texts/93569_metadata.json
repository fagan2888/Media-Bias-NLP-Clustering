Dutton Ave., a space currently occupied by Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County. The purchase price of the building is set at about $3.2 million, and it will cost an additional $3 million to design, renovate and equip the facility, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only just now starting to work on planning for how we will use that space\u201d with placement of exam rooms, dental rooms and other medical offices, Brockman said.\n\nThe facility will be the first health centers clinic with primary care, dental and mental health services housed in a single building. Its largest clinic, the 40,000-square-foot Vista Family Health Center in northeast Santa Rosa, has no dental clinic. The health centers system has a dedicated dental clinic on North Dutton Avenue, not far from where the new clinic will be located.\n\nWith 45,000 patients, Community Health Centers is the county\u2019s largest federally qualified health center system. Along with other local health centers, the operation has grown rapidly over the years, adding a number of clinics on both sides of the Highway 101 corridor.\n\nThat growth is owed largely to large amounts of federal funding aimed at expanding the nation\u2019s primary care infrastructure for low-income residents. A federally qualified health center receives a beefed-up reimbursement from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nObama\u2019s Affordable Care Act greatly expanded the number of patients covered by Medicaid and targeted billions of dollars for federally qualified health centers across the country, including many community clinics on the North Coast.\n\n\u201cHealth centers are expanding and becoming an even greater part of the health system across California,\u201d said Suzie Shupe, CEO of the Redwood Community Health Coalition, a consortium of Northern California health centers in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Yolo counties.\n\nShupe said the growth of local health centers is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see so many people covered across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom primary care to specialty care to hospitals, everybody is seeing an impact in how people are able to access care.\u201d\n\nShupe said that as health centers continue to add patients and consequently grow in size, these systems also will need to look at ways to provide more specialty care beyond the primary care setting.\n\nLaurie Lynn Hogan, a spokeswoman for Community Health Centers, said the entire system has begun integrating mental health services at its existing dental center on North Dutton Avenue. It\u2019s a pilot program in which a mental health worker sees kids and adults with severe anxiety about dental work at the dental center prior to their appointments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Santa Rosa Community Health Centers is planning to build a $6\u00a0million medical", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The 24,000-square-foot facility would offer dental, mental health and primary care medical services under one roof.", "title": "Santa Rosa Community Health Centers to build $6 million clinic", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4931164-181/santa-rosa-community-health-centers", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=jiyVLt9jlnLkQTrxv8QGss$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYu8DPvH5l3CA24RTDMxc$iBWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-12-17T17:53:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Santa Rosa Community Health Centers is planning to build a $6 million medical clinic in west Santa Rosa by summer of 2017, the 10th health center for the rapidly growing health care provider.\n\u201cHealth centers are expanding and becoming an even greater part of the health system across California,\u201d said Suzie Shupe, CEO of the Redwood Community Health Coalition, a consortium of Northern California health centers in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Yolo counties.\nWith 45,000 patients, Community Health Centers is the county\u2019s largest federally qualified health center system.\nThe facility will be the first health centers clinic with primary care, dental and mental health services housed in a single building.\nIts largest clinic, the 40,000-square-foot Vista Family Health Center in northeast Santa Rosa, has no dental clinic."}
