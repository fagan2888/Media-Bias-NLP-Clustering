That appeal was heard on August 20 and 21 in a packed courtroom in Whitehorse, Yukon. The crowd overflowed into a second room, where the proceedings were livestreamed.\n\nThe remote region is at the forefront of a battle that First Nations have been waging over control of their traditional lands since the Yukon government overrode a plan to protect 80 percent of the pristine, majestic region, about the size of Scotland.\n\nThe Peel River Watershed Planning Commission, formed in 2004 and based on an earlier Umbrella Final Agreement with Yukon First Nations, released its report in 2011 with recommendations to protect 80 percent of the Peel watershed from mining and development. In a surprise move in 2014, the Yukon government ignored the commission and issued a new plan, which was developed without public input and only protects 29 percent of the watershed.\n\nThe Nacho Nyak Dun First Nation, the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation, the Yukon Conservation Society, and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society sued the government, asking that the commission\u2019s plan be reinstated. In December 2014, the Yukon Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision agreeing with the plaintiffs, saying the government had failed to respect the terms of a consultation process.\n\nRELATED: Peel Watershed: Yukon Judge Sides With First Nations in Historic Ruling\n\nThe Peel appeal has been met with ceremony and protests. A pep rally on August 12 attracted many, including virtually all seven elected opposition party members. A Water Ceremony on the steps of the courthouse at noon of the first hearing day attracted more than 250 people despite pouring rain. A Peel Barbeque held that evening drew more than 300 people.\n\nThe burning question for plaintiffs is: Why is the Yukon government, in which the Yukon Party holds 12 of the 19 legislative seats, trying to overturn the recommendations of a commission that the government itself set up (the Yukon Party has held a majority since 2002) and for which they selected commissioners?\n\nIt all boils down to an interpretation of the umbrella final agreement, CBC News noted on August 19. The government\u2019s argument is that its last-minute intervention is necessary in order to better balance conservation with development, CBC News said.\n\n\u201cThrough this appeal, the government is seeking clarity that the democratically elected Yukon government retains the authority to make final decisions on public lands,\u201d the government said in a statement.\n\nYukon\u2019s government did not respond to Indian Country Today Media Network\u2019s requests for an interview. But Premier Darrell Posloski has made his pro-mining position clear.\n\n\u201cI'm excited about the opportunities out there for the mining industry,\u201d he said earlier this year to Mining.com. \u201cOur goal is to be the number one mining location.\u201d\n\nThe stakes in the Peel case are enormous.\n\n\u201cThis is precedent-setting because it supports, at law, that final land claim agreements supercede territorial legislation,\u201d Dene National Chief Bill Erasmus said after the December ruling.\n\nRELATED: Indigenous Leaders Applaud Peel Watershed Court Ruling as Precedent-Setting\n\nThe final ruling is expected in three to six months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The court fight continues to protect the pristine Peel Watershed from possible mining development.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/26/court-fight-continues-preserve-pristine-peel-watershed-yukon-161498", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/peel_watershed-courtesy.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Court Fight Continues to Preserve Pristine Peel Watershed in Yukon"}, "abstract": "The court fight continues to protect the pristine Peel Watershed from possible mining development.", "dc": {"title": "Court Fight Continues to Preserve Pristine Peel Watershed in Yukon"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/26/court-fight-continues-preserve-pristine-peel-watershed-yukon-161498", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-08-26T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Court Fight Continues to Preserve Pristine Peel Watershed in Yukon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c0e\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Indigenous Leaders Applaud Peel Watershed Court Ruling as Precedent-SettingThe final ruling is expected in three to six months.\nRELATED: Peel Watershed: Yukon Judge Sides With First Nations in Historic RulingThe Peel appeal has been met with ceremony and protests.\nThe government is appealing a court ruling that mandated consultation with First Nations over the controversial plan.\nThe Peel River Watershed Planning Commission, formed in 2004 and based on an earlier Umbrella Final Agreement with Yukon First Nations, released its report in 2011 with recommendations to protect 80 percent of the Peel watershed from mining and development.\n\u201cOur goal is to be the number one mining location.\u201dThe stakes in the Peel case are enormous."}
