Henry Waxman.\n\nNext June, the Supreme Court will rule on King v. Burwell, determining whether the Affordable Care Act restricts subsidies to state-run exchanges alone. A ruling against the Obama administration, which argues that the ACA\u2019s requirement that subsidies go to exchanges \u201cestablished by the state\u201d should include the federal website, would cut off subsidies and skyrocket rates for all HealthCare.gov\u2019s customers.\n\nDemocratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a report Tuesday of the total amount of premium subsidies that would be eliminated if the Obama administration loses its case. Waxman, the ranking member on the committee, says taxpayers could save as much as $65 billion in subsidy payments by 2016 \u2014 markedly higher than previous estimates.\n\n\u201cThe law\u2019s opponents are continuing a series of legal challenges to undermine it,\u201d Waxman said in a statement. \u201cIf the law\u2019s opponents succeed, they will deprive Americans of $65 billion in tax credits, making it more difficult for millions of middle class families to have the health insurance coverage they need.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 report suggests that the Supreme Court was wrong to decide to take the case, citing an editorial from The New Republic calling the argument that the subsidies are restricted to state-run exchanges \u201clegally laughable.\u201d Although King v. Burwell has made it to the Supreme Court, the administration remains adamant that it\u2019s of little consequence.\n\nThe reasoning behind restricting subsidies to state exchanges alone, according to Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, was to pressure states into building their own exchanges. Gruber, of course, has since disavowed his previous comments explaining that side of the case and supports the Obama administration\u2019s position. (RELATED: Obamacare Architect Claims Subsidy Comments Were Just A Speak-O)\n\nWaxman has vocally supported the Obama administration\u2019s position as well, but the report is a warning that if the Supreme Court does rule in the favor of the plaintiffs, implementing the health-care law as written will be extraordinarily difficult for states and the administration alike.\n\nWhile states could move to build their own exchanges, that will likely take years and hundreds of millions of taxpayer funding to accomplish. Thirty-six states currently use HealthCare.gov.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Getting nervous already?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Supreme Court's decision about the legality of Obamacare subsidies in some states could put $65 billion in premium subsidies at risk, according to a report from Democratic Rep.
