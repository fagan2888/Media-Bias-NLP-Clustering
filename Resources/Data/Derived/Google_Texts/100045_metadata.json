In Tennessee, that figure was $20.1 billion, or 7.2 percent, of the state\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nIn addition to spending, physicians are also job creators, with each supporting, on average, more than 10 jobs \u2014 including his or her own.\n\nAt the time of the study, Tennessee had slightly more than 14,000 physicians, and demand is projected to grow nationally by 18 percent through 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could cause a ripple effect of job creation as the healthcare industry continues to grow.\n\nThis growth in demand as the population ages, coupled with significant changes in reimbursements to health care providers under the Affordable Care Act, is changing how many physicians practice.\n\nFederal health care reform provides incentives for the creation of accountable care organizations, which consist of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, who coordinate care to their Medicare patients. Twenty-four percent of physicians reported participating in ACOs in the AMA report versus just 3 percent in 2011. An additional 10 percent of doctors say they plan to join this year.\n\nThese and other changes driven by the Affordable Care Act create more paperwork and expectations, doctors say. These demands are leading more doctors to opt to be employees of a larger organization, rather than running their own practice, according to the AMA.\n\nThe Business Journal\u2019s list of Knoxville-area physician groups offers examples of several different management structures.\n\nUniversity Physicians Associates, the group that counts the largest number of physicians on the list, is classified as an independent physician association. Its physicians remain in private practices, but the association takes care of many administrative duties and business operations. UPA has 674 staff \u2014 485 of which are physicians \u2014 at 150 East Tennessee locations.\n\nSummit Medical Group, an independent group ranked second on the list, in 2010 created an ACO subsidiary, Summit Health Solutions. Summit employs more than 1,300 staff members, 214 of whom are physicians, in a 12-county area.\n\nCovenant Medical Group at No. 3 is the largest hospital-affiliated group, employing 758 people, more than 100 of which are physicians.\n\nKnoxville-based TeamHealth provides yet another employment option for physicians.\n\nOriginally founded to provide emergency department administrative and staffing services, TeamHealth is currently one of the nation\u2019s largest providers of hospital-based clinical outsourcing and provides emergency medicine, hospital medicine, anesthesia, urgent care, and pediatric staffing and management services.\n\nIn the Knoxville area it employs more than 1,600 people and has 9,800 affiliated healthcare professionals nationwide. The company has completed 13 acquisitions in the past two years.\n\nFor the Business Journal\u2019s rankings of Knoxville area hospitals and physician groups, visit knoxvillebookoflists.com.\n\nShelley Kimel is a staff writer for the Business Journal.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Business of medicine changing fast", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/business/journal/business-of-medicine-changing-fast-ep-581554387-354339221.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/closer_7599678_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 277}, "type": "article", "description": "Doctors make a visible impact every day via the patients they treat, but their economic impact, while less obvious, also provides broader benefits to their communities.", "title": "Business of medicine changing fast"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/closer_7599678_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Doctors make a visible impact every day via the patients they treat, but their economic impact, while less obvious, also provides broader benefits to their communities.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Business of medicine changing fast"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This growth in demand as the population ages, coupled with significant changes in reimbursements to health care providers under the Affordable Care Act, is changing how many physicians practice.\nSummit Medical Group, an independent group ranked second on the list, in 2010 created an ACO subsidiary, Summit Health Solutions.\nFederal health care reform provides incentives for the creation of accountable care organizations, which consist of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, who coordinate care to their Medicare patients.\nCovenant Medical Group at No.\nIts physicians remain in private practices, but the association takes care of many administrative duties and business operations."}
