If Jurgen Gramckow has been vilified as he claims, his black hat is revealed in the vanity plate on his Chevy SUV.

“Best Sod,” it says.

Gramckow grows sod in lush, irrigated rows that once consumed 2,000 acres, much of it south of Oxnard. He sells it across Southern California, though less than he once did with that high-water production mark now reduced to 500 acres.

The 39-year-old Southland Sod Farms he started with his father ranks among the biggest in the state and along with nearby Pacific Sod dominated Ventura County’s turfgrass market for decades.

He contends a bull’s-eye has been painted on the industry’s backside because of the drought, more so because of the rebates and campaigns encouraging homeowners to pull out squares of perfect green.

“This is truly a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water,” said Gramckow, contending replace-your-lawn efforts cost far too much and end up saving little water. “I feel like we’re being unfairly scapegoated. It’s simply not even going to make a dent.”

Green giants

In 1960, a California tomato and sugar beet farmer named Toby Grether reflected on a sod industry developing in the Midwest and East.

“He said, ‘You know what? That might work here,’” said Gramckow, whose father, Werner, worked as a bookkeeper for Grether.

Grether’s Cal Turf was the first sod producer in the state, marking Ventura County as a grassy birthplace. The industry boomed with two of its SoCal giants, Pacific Sod and Southland Sod, headquartered within miles of each other on Hueneme Road.

A heady heyday included the greening of residential neighborhoods across Southern California. More than 100 million square feet of Marathon Sod, produced by Gramckow’s company, was sold per year.

Both farms have cut back. Pacific Sod leases out land to other farmers. Southland Sod has diversified, using computers and scales to measure how much water is needed by raspberries potted in ground-up coconut fibers.

Gramckow said the biggest trigger for the reduction was a residential construction market that went south in 2008. The drought has pushed the company to pull back more.

Earl Slack, senior vice president of farming operations for Pacific Sod, offered little comment, except to say it’s too soon to measure the impact of the drought.

Outsiders say orders for sod have plummeted.

“I just had one this week,” said Ken Kramer, owner of Pacific Coast Landscape in Oxnard. “It’s the first one in probably three months.”

Changing culture

When Gov. Jerry Brown announced mandatory 25 percent water reductions on April 1, he said the state would partner with local governments in removing lawns. The target is 50 million square feet.

Until recently, residents in much of Ventura County could walk away with $3 for every square foot of lawn removed via rebates offered by the Metropolitan Water District and one of its member agencies, Calleguas Municipal Water District. Now the rebate is $2.

The city of Ventura plans to roll out rebates of a similar amount sometime this summer.

“We’re changing the market and culture,” said Eric Bergh, manager of resources for Calleguas. He said the goal isn’t to remove grass everywhere but to replace it in places where its only role is eye candy.

“This is all about water supply,” he said. “We’re recovering some of that water that is just being used in ... nonfunctional turf.”

But the rebates make some growers of green see red.

Dan Gibson owns Valley Sod Farms, which produces sod in locations including land outside the Ventura County border east of Piru. He said he can accept a decline in demand that happens without interference.

“I object to the government injecting itself into the market and affecting our livelihood by doing so,” he said.

It’s a battle in which both sides turn to calculators.

Converting landscape can help an average Ventura homeowner reduce a household’s water usage by 35 percent, said Joe McDermott, assistant general manager for Ventura Water.

Gramckow offered up formulas that suggest eliminating all landscaping in all California’s cities would save only 9 percent of its total water.

Paying publicly funded rebates reaching $3.75 per square foot in some areas means removing lawns is far more expensive than creating desalination programs or recycling municipal water, Gramckow said.

“I think it’s a tremendous waste of money,” he said.

Setting priorities

Tony Emmert, deputy general manager of the United Water Conservation District, sees both sides. He said sod growers attract more criticism than they deserve.

He also said the highest priority for water is basic human need. Second is production of food and what he called essential industries.

“Probably lowest on the scale is the aesthetic use of water,” Emmert said. “If you have to cut back somewhere, that’s where you cut back first.”

Sod supporters say grass serves as a natural coolant. Take it away and there are consequences, said Jim Baird, turfgrass specialist at UC Riverside.

“Our cities are going to heat up and we have to cool them,” Baird said, citing the elements used to create energy. “What does it take to cool them? It takes water.”

Baird and other academicians offer other solutions. Teach people they can cut way back on how much they water sod. Push grasses like Bermuda, zoysia and buffalograss that use far less water but tend to brown in the winter.

Gramckow grows zoysia and Bermuda but in small quantities.

“People haven’t wanted to buy them,” he said. “We grow what people buy. The reason they don’t buy them is they don’t stay green year-round.”

He thinks the future of sod in Southern California may not be as green as its past. But he predicts people will come back to turfgrass in time; the industry will survive.

“Turf’s never going away because that’s where kids and dogs go play,” he said.

Baird of UC Riverside is hopeful too. As he offered his optimism, he cited the weather forecast.

“I hope it rains,” he said. “ ... This is a bad drought.”
