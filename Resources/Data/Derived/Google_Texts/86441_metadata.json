Lea Olivier, 87, suffers from arthritis and has been using medical marijuana to help ease her joint pain. But she also lives in federally-subsidized low-income housing, meaning the federal government has its say over state laws when it comes to the residents' use of drugs. After a compliance officer, who was inspecting the residence, smelled pot, Olivier was given the boot and told to find alternate housing, even though she technically lives in a state that allows recreational and medicinal use of marijuana. \u201cA compliance officer said they smelled pot coming from my residence,\u201d Olivier told the Cortez Journal. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was even me. I\u2019ve used it before to ease arthritis pain.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Cortez Journal reports that \u201c[s]ome residents are finding out the hard way that there is a glaring discrepancy between Colorado\u2019s liberal marijuana laws and the federal government\u2019s outright ban on the substance.\u201d It has become confusing for residents in federal housing who believe it\u2019s okay to use marijuana since Amendment 64 began rolling out in January 2014. But the housing authority states that it has to comply with federal regulations \u201cor we lose our subsidies for people who need housing assistance,\u201d Terri Wheeler, executive director of Housing Authority of Montezuma County, said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just federal housing that becomes a problem for Colorado state residents \u2014 it\u2019s also other federally owned facilities that outlaw marijuana, from national forests and parks to airports and monuments \u2014 that confuse many state residents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of their petty demands,\u201d Olivier told the Cortez Journal. \u201cNow I have to use pain pills, which I don\u2019t like to do.\u201d\n\nMedical marijuana has been shown to treat various pains, aches, diseases, and disorders \u2014 from severe seizures to tension headaches. But not enough research has been done to solidify evidence, mostly because it\u2019s nearly impossible for scientists to jump through hoops to legally obtain the drug in order to study it. So it\u2019s often difficult for sick people to make a case against the government, despite the fact that medical marijuana brings them or their children significant relief.\n\nOlivier isn\u2019t the first to complain about the federal ban on medical marijuana and probably won\u2019t be the last. Others who suffer from cancer or other ailments nationwide have been battling the federal regulations, often in court. One Iowa cancer patient, suffering from the pain of chemotherapy and a rare form of cancer that attacks the blood vessels, was placed on trial for growing marijuana in his home.\n\nOther states are beginning to take baby steps forward. New York state, for example, recently signed into effect the \u201cCompassionate Care Act\u201d which bans marijuana smoking but mandates individual dosing of medical cannabis for patients who need it. In addition, Illinois recently allowed medical marijuana to be used for children with severe seizure disorders.\n\nOlivier, like other sick patients who just need a bit of weed to ease their pain, however, will get back up regardless of federal obstacles. \u201cI\u2019ll live in a tent, or my car if I have to,\u201d Olivier told the Journal. \u201cI\u2019ve got 10 days to move, but when I get knocked down I get back up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana, colorado weed, federal marijuana laws", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Colorado residents who live in federally subsidized housing are finding out the hard way that federal laws regarding marijuana are quite different from their state\u2019s \u201cAmsterdam of the West\u201d viewpoint.", "title": "87-Year-Old Gets Kicked Out Of Her House For Using Medical Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-eviction-87-year-old-colorado-women-arthritis-gets-kicked-out-federal-297738", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colorado residents who live in federally subsidized housing are finding out the hard way that federal laws regarding marijuana are quite different from their state\u2019s \u201cAmsterdam of the West\u201d viewpoint.", "title": "87-Year-Old Gets Kicked Out Of Her House For Using Medical Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-eviction-87-year-old-colorado-women-arthritis-gets-kicked-out-federal-297738", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/12/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-08-12T15:03:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-12T16:59:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Colorado residents who live in federally subsidized housing are finding out the hard way that federal laws regarding marijuana are quite different from their state\u2019s \u201cAmsterdam of the West\u201d viewpoint."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7b1\"", "article_summary": "Lea Olivier, 87, suffers from arthritis and has been using medical marijuana to help ease her joint pain.\nIn addition, Illinois recently allowed medical marijuana to be used for children with severe seizure disorders.\nDespite Colorado's legalization of marijuana, and to the chagrin of many residents, people living in federal housing must comply with the federal government's prohibition.\nOlivier isn\u2019t the first to complain about the federal ban on medical marijuana and probably won\u2019t be the last.\nSo it\u2019s often difficult for sick people to make a case against the government, despite the fact that medical marijuana brings them or their children significant relief."}
