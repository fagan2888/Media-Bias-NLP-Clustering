It\u2019s simply irresponsible to spend beyond our means as the national debt soars closer to $19 trillion,\u201d said FreedomWorks about the GOP leadership\u2019s spend-a-palooza.\n\nThe silver lining in the bill is that it kept the language preventing the Obama administration from using taxpayer funds to bail out insurers that are losing money because of ObamaCare. Still, the only way to fully relieve Americans of the burden of ObamaCare is to repeal it, and we hope the House will act on the reconciliation bill that has already passed the Senate when they return in January.\n\nThe importance of this ban on using the so-called \u201crisk corridors\u201d to prop up ObamaCare cannot be overstated. \u201cWhy should American taxpayers be bailing out insurance companies, many of whom cooperated with, conspired with alongside the Obama administration to get Obamacare passed?\u201d asked Senator Marco Rubio, who put the ban in place, asked during a Breitbart News interview in November. \u201cAnd now they want to come with their lobbyists and basically force the American taxpayer to put money into a fund that bails them out for having lost money on the Obamacare exchanges.\u201d\n\nMarc A. Thiessen at the Washington Post credits Rubio\u2019s measure with \u201cquietly killing ObamaCare,\u201d a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that held bailouts down to only 13 percent of what Obama\u2019s cronies in the insurance industry wanted. Thiessen figures the lack of bailout money played a role in causing over half of the ObamaCare co-ops to fold up, and cites various other news sources describing Rubio\u2019s measure as the most effective blow struck against ObamaCare.\n\nNote to all mainstream-media reporters: it is sheer journalistic malpractice to report on Rubio\u2019s measure without explaining that the only reason it\u2019s killing ObamaCare is that ObamaCare was an utter fraud from Day One. Obama never said taxpayers were going to fork over billions of dollars to keep insurance companies in business, on top of the exorbitant premiums they\u2019re paying for virtually useless plans with absurd out-of-pocket expenses. On the contrary, he said his scheme would be budget-neutral, would save the average American over $2,000 per year, and would be such an attractive option that it was essentially voluntary \u2013 you know, \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan, no one will take it away from you, period.\u201d\n\nThe American people should never, under any circumstances, allow ObamaCare\u2019s failure to be hidden inside the bubbling soup of general taxation and out-of-control spending\u2026 which the omnibus bill is a splendid example of.\n\nOn the down side, Republicans did foolishly allow the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d to be delayed for two years, along with similar delays in the medical device tax and Health Insurance Tax. Forbes describes the latter as \u201can ObamaCare tax that increases the cost of health insurance for struggling workers and families,\u201d crediting the delay with saving consumers between $514 and $719 per year in premiums.\n\nDelaying these taxes was foolish \u2013 not a single Republican should be lifting a finger to keep ObamaCare alive. Full repeal should be the one and only \u201cdeal\u201d put on the table, until Democrats take it. Meanwhile, the American people should be reminded every day that they\u2019re only paying higher premiums because the Democrat Party swindled them.\n\nDelaying the Cadillac Tax was a particularly bad move for Republicans, because it eases the ObamaCare pain on a vital Democrat constituency, Big Labor. The Hill describes labor unions as one of the big \u201cwinners\u201d in the omnibus bill\u2026 entirely because the Cadillac Tax was delayed. Unions will, of course, fail to reward the GOP in any significant way for giving them a carve-out from the failed health care scheme they supported.\n\nPolitico mentions that Republicans are calling the delay of these three taxes \u201ca major victory against ObamaCare,\u201d and we should \u201cexpect to hear them continuing to argue that they had bipartisan support for suspending major financing for the health law, and that this could be a building block to taking down other parts of the law.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like something most Republicans would say, because it demonstrates perfect ignorance of the way politics actually works. The longer ObamaCare is left alive, the deeper it will burrow itself into the fabric of politics and the economy, becoming indestructible no matter how obvious its failure grows.\n\nDelaying its taxes will only help Democrats slip through another election without suffering the voter blowback they deserve \u2013 it would have been quite amusing to hear them campaign by railing against Republicans for refusing to lift the idiotic taxes Democrats insisted on imposing, largely because they needed to scam the Congressional Budget Office into seeing the Affordable Care Act as more-or-less budget neutral.\n\nInstead, the Democrats get two more years of rhetoric, instead of the fiscal pain that could rally vast popular support for repeal. As long as ObamaCare\u2019s losers are kept sedated, intimidated out of complaining with left-wing accusations of \u201cselfishness,\u201d and ignored by the media, it will be unnecessarily difficult to marshal the political energy needed for real change. Republicans apparently learned nothing from watching Democrats exaggerate the problems of pre-ObamaCare health insurance to scrape up enough support for their dead-of-night passage of the partially unwritten Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Democrats were able to soak taxpayers to keep the ObamaCare disaster floating, they'd do it in a hot second.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "If Democrats were able to soak taxpayers to keep the ObamaCare disaster floating, they'd do it in a hot second.", "title": "ObamaCare Bailouts Blocked In Omnibus Bill, Cadillac Tax Delayed - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/anti-ObamaCare-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/17/obamacare-bailouts-blocked-omnibus-bill-cadillac-tax-delayed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Democrats were able to soak taxpayers to keep the ObamaCare disaster floating, they'd do it in a hot second.", "title": "ObamaCare Bailouts Blocked In Omnibus Bill, Cadillac Tax Delayed - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/anti-ObamaCare-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, bailouts, Cadillac Tax, Marco Rubio, obamacare, omnibus, risk corridor, tax,Big Government,ObamaCare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "tax", "published_time": "2015-12-17T07:58:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Hill describes labor unions as one of the big \u201cwinners\u201d in the omnibus bill\u2026 entirely because the Cadillac Tax was delayed.\nOn the down side, Republicans did foolishly allow the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d to be delayed for two years, along with similar delays in the medical device tax and Health Insurance Tax.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cLet\u2019s be clear here, the omnibus bill blows past the spending caps put in place by Congress in 2011 and will lead to more debt for Americans.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe revolting $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Republicans dumped on their astonished voters has one \u2013 possibly only one \u2013 bright spot: the bailout corridors for ObamaCare remain blocked.\nDelaying the Cadillac Tax was a particularly bad move for Republicans, because it eases the ObamaCare pain on a vital Democrat constituency, Big Labor."}
