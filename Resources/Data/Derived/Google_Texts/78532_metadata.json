With players looking visibly upset, coach Mike Krzyzewski then announced to the crowd that the scrimmage would not be finished out of respect to George and his family.\n\nBLOG: Reactions to Paul George\u2019s injury\n\n\u201cThis is a first for us in USA Basketball, to have something like this take place,\u201d USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation for our entire organization, the coaches, the players. Very, very emotional. There\u2019s no way the game could have gone on under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe White team led George\u2019s Blue team 81-71.\n\n\u201cWe got all the players together, Jerry addressed them and then I did. Very emotional setting,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cThere\u2019s a brotherhood in the NBA and to me at moments like this family or brotherhood shows its heart, it shows its depth, and that\u2019s what I thought our players showed during that time.\u201d\n\nGeorge was considered a lock to make the final 12-man roster for the World Cup of Basketball that starts later this month in Spain.\n\n\u201cThanks everybody for the love and support,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ll be ok and be back better than ever!!! Love y\u2019all!!\u201d\n\nThe Americans planned to reduce the 20-play pool to 14 or 15 players Saturday, but put off those plans after George\u2019s injury.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s on hold right and it should be,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cIt would be so inappropriate for us to talk about anything else when there\u2019s a serious injury like this.\u201d\n\nThe defending champion U.S. team had already been weakened by player losses. Forwards Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge and NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard had all pulled out in recent weeks.\n\nKrzyzewski and Colangelo refused to discuss the roster after the game, saying they didn\u2019t even know when they would make roster reductions.\n\n\u201cAs an organization, we\u2019re just going to let a little bit of time go by here before we address anything like rosters, all that stuff,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cIt seems so unimportant in the big scheme of things when you have something like this take place. It puts things in perspective.\u201d\n\nGeorge would have been a candidate to start for the Americans alongside Kevin Durant. The two, along with Harden, spent the week playing in 1-on-1 competitions after practice, pushing one another while building chemistry leading up to Friday night\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun, just getting to know Paul,\u201d Durant said after practice on Thursday. \u201cOf course I know James, but it\u2019s competing against them.\u201d\n\nOnly Colangelo and Krzyzewski spoke after the exhibition.\n\nGeorge led the Pacers to the best record in the Eastern Conference before they were eliminated by Miami in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the injury sustained by Paul George in Friday night\u2019s Team USA game in Las Vegas and we are obviously greatly concerned,\u201d Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement. \u201cAt this time our thoughts and prayers are with Paul. We are still gathering details and will have an updated statement Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe Americans have to be down to 12 players before they open the tournament on Aug. 30. They are scheduled to take the next week off before reconvening in Chicago for their next practice on Aug. 14.\n\nPlayers throughout the NBA posted their concerns and wishes on Twitter, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement that read: \u201cIt was difficult to watch the injury that Paul George sustained tonight while representing his country. The thoughts and prayers of all of us at the NBA are with Paul and his family.\u201d\n\nSome NBA executives have long been concerned about injuries to players during summer competitions. Pau Gasol, then playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, broke his foot while leading Spain to the 2006 world title, and Manu Ginobili injured his ankle while playing for Argentina in the 2008 Olympics. He is sitting out the World Cup while recovering from a stress fracture in his right leg.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen anywhere, a lot of things happen,\u201d said Krzyzewski, who was coaching Duke against Louisville when the Cardinals\u2019 Kevin Ware broke his leg during the 2013 NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cTonight it happened during a basketball game. We need to take care of that. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll happen again and again and again; it means that it happened right now. And we need to take care of right now appropriately and then move on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paul George suffers serious leg injury in US exhibition", "title": "Paul George suffers serious leg injury in US exhibition", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/01/paul-george-suffers-serious-leg-injury-in-us-exhibition/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140801_090951_paul-george.jpg", "height": 390}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140801_090951_paul-george.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-01T21:11:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:33:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Indiana Pacers All-Star Paul George suffered a gruesome right leg injury late in the U.S. national team\u2019s intrasquad scrimmage Friday night.\n\u201cWe are aware of the injury sustained by Paul George in Friday night\u2019s Team USA game in Las Vegas and we are obviously greatly concerned,\u201d Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement.\n\u201cOf course I know James, but it\u2019s competing against them.\u201dOnly Colangelo and Krzyzewski spoke after the exhibition.\nThere\u2019s no way the game could have gone on under the circumstances.\u201dThe White team led George\u2019s Blue team 81-71.\n!\u201dThe Americans planned to reduce the 20-play pool to 14 or 15 players Saturday, but put off those plans after George\u2019s injury."}
