Nobody's showing you the value of why you're doing this and why it's so impactful on the world,\" she said, according to Wired. \"We want to show you that you have incredible heroes who already do this work.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Google executive now occupies high-profile job overseeing male-dominated industry", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/06/11c488e0-7458-4f12-874c-4cad9ec56763/thumbnail/1200x630/f7230db195a0caf07ed873666f5f062c/117714272.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Former Google executive now occupies high-profile job overseeing male-dominated industry", "title": "Meet new U.S. technology czar Megan Smith"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Google executive now occupies high-profile job overseeing male-dominated industry", "title": "Meet new U.S. technology czar Megan Smith", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/06/11c488e0-7458-4f12-874c-4cad9ec56763/thumbnail/1200x630/f7230db195a0caf07ed873666f5f062c/117714272.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/new-u-s-technology-czar-megan-smith-marks-victory-for-women/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe100c\"", "article_summary": "Smith told the magazine in an interview this summer that females aren't drawn to the technology sector because they don't have many fitting role models.\nPresident Obama announced the appointment of Google executive Megan Smith as the U.S. chief technology officer this week, marking the first time the relatively new position has been occupied by a woman.\n\"Megan has spent her career leading talented teams and taking cutting-edge technology and innovation initiatives from concept to design to deployment,\" the president said Thursday.\nAt Google, Smith also spearheaded efforts to bring more women into the technology sector, and some industry watchers are already hailing her appointment as a victory for women in a sector that can often be male-dominated.\nSmith was most recently the vice president of the Google[X] \"moonshot lab,\" and before that, she spent nine years as the company's vice president for new business development."}
