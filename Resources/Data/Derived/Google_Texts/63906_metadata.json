Sure, now that it\u2019s considered a day of \u201cfederal observance\u201d\u009d you\u2019ll find government schools around the country including it in their lesson plans. But these discussions generally focus on \u201cConstitution Trivia\u201d instead of what\u2019s really important. While it may be good to educate our young on how many years a Senator serves, or how Supreme Court justices are appointed, it\u2019s not enough. Seriously lacking in the public discourse is the actual purpose of the Constitution \u2013 its underlying principles.\n\nWhen the Constitution was being considered for ratification, there was strong opposition from famous American figures that included George Mason and Patrick Henry. One major reason for this was a fear of too much power. The founding generation spent their lives toiling under a tyranny \u2013 a government without limits. But, when the Constitution was written, it was done to codify in law that the powers of government would be limited to those which had been delegated to it \u2013 and nothing more.\n\nThe entire system was created under the principle of popular sovereignty \u2013 that \u2018We the People of the Several States\u2019 created the government, and all powers not delegated to it, were retained.\n\nBut that\u2019s not something you\u2019re likely to hear from politicians in Washington DC, political pundits, schools, or just about anywhere else. It\u2019s generally not in their interest, either. If politicians and their backers were promoting such ideas as originalism and limited government,\u009d they\u2019d never be able to convince you that they have the power to tell you what kind of health care plan you\u2019ll be getting, how big your toilet can be, what kind of plants you\u2019re allowed to grow, whether or not you\u2019ll be able to defend your family, whom you can buy and sell from, and even when you must send your children to die for them.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThroughout history, even kings and queens have often failed to survive such acts of hubris; but, in \u201cfree\u201d America, the major parties that produce all the presidents continue to receive approval through tens of millions of votes. And where has that gotten people?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at some major issues.\n\nIf you were opposed to war in the Bush administration, you\u2019ve still got wars and threats of more wars under Obama.\n\nIf you were opposed to national health care under Clinton, you got a massive expansion of government health care under George Bush, which laid the groundwork for an even bigger expansion under Obama.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t like the federal government passing the Patriot Act without even reading it, you\u2019re still getting the same failure to read today.\n\nOn the other hand, if you liked the Bush surveillance programs, you\u2019ve gotta love the ones that Obama has given you!\n\nNo matter what side of the political aisle you sit on, the federal government is not your friend. It\u2019s not a friend to the Constitution, and it\u2019s certainly no friend to your liberty. For years and years, people have yelled \u201cvote the bums out!\u201d \u201cCall Congress now!\u201d \u201cMarch on DC!\u201d But, in the long run, little to none of this actually works.\n\nIf you oppose this national health care plan, they\u2019ll give you that one. If you oppose today\u2019s spying program, they\u2019ll create a different one tomorrow. If you oppose one war, you\u2019ll get another one.\n\nDecade in and decade out, the government keeps growing, and your liberty keeps shrinking. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the person in charge is named Obama, or Bush, or Reagan, or Clinton.\n\nThe bottom line? Looking to the federal government \u2013 whether it\u2019s though elections, or protests, or lawsuits, or rallies \u2013 is a failed strategy.- So how about trying something new?\n\nA DIFFERENT PATH: NULLIFICATION\n\nOver the years, wise men and women warned us that the Constitution would never enforce itself. I believe it\u2019s time for people to recognize this as fact, and bring that enforcement closer to home.\n\nFortunately, this is already starting to happen. All that\u2019s needed is you to help take it to the next level.\n\nIn recent years, more than two-dozen states have defied federal laws banning the production, sale and consumption of marijuana. Three states have banned enforcement of some federal gun laws. Three states now allow the farming of industrial hemp, contrary to what the federal government permits. And a number of states have taken steps to block the effects of NSA spying or the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn Jeffersonian-speak, this all falls under the banner of \u201cnullification.\u201d This happens when a state takes any set of actions that results in a federal law being rendered null and void, or simply unenforceable within that state. In other words, not a law \u2013 in practice \u2013 as far as that state is concerned.\n\nWhether you\u2019re on the left, or on the right, or even somewhere in the middle, the path to freedom, the path to your own political goals lies not in Washington D.C. Instead, it lies in Madison, and Jefferson (City) \u2013 and other state capitols around the country.\n\nThis Constitution Day, take a new pledge. Ignore and nullify the federal government. Going to the federal government to fix problems created by the federal government is as futile as it is dangerous.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Constitution Day, take a new pledge.
