Macdonald supports Trump, a connection trumpeted by conservative radio host Howie Carr in celebrating the mayor\u2019s win.\n\n\u2014 And Sun Journal reporter Scott Taylor wrung his hands at outside takes, saying people voted \u201cfor very personal reasons in this election\u201d and that Chin\u2019s big, professional campaign turned many off.\n\n\u2014 Mark Brewer, a University of Maine political scientist, said \u201ca little bit of everything\u201d made for the result.\n\nThis includes incumbency, the campaign, Lewiston\u2019s divides and national factors. But it may not have taught us anything new about politics in Maine\u2019s second-largest city or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThe simplest way to break it down is, \u2018Was Lewiston ready for change?\u2019\u201d said Lizzy Reinholt, a Democratic strategist from Stratton. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMacdonald is known in Lewiston. Chin was seen as an outsider, and his campaign highlighted that for many.\n\nThe 68-year-old mayor is well-known in Lewiston, not only for his time at City Hall but his 23 years of service on the city police force and with other community groups. Chin, 30, moved to Lewiston to attend Bates College and hadn\u2019t held public office.\n\nHe also brought a heavily political touch to his campaign, raising $88,000 through Nov. 24 and putting the Maine People\u2019s Alliance to work on an aggressive campaign that rallied a base of college students, immigrants and other activists.\n\nChin outpolled Macdonald in November, but not by enough to avoid a runoff. It could be argued that he couldn\u2019t have done that without the monied effort.\n\nBut the Bates connection and the size of the campaign hurt Chin among many.\n\nAt the polls on Tuesday, Glorianne Travaglini, a city native who voted for Macdonald, said Bates students \u201cknow nothing about Lewiston, and they\u2019re taking over,\u201d echoing criticism from other older voters.\n\nIn September, Macdonald supporter Nelson Peters Jr. wondered why Chin\u2019s out-of-state funders cared about Lewiston politics.\n\nState Rep. Michel Lajoie, a Democrat and a former city fire chief who supported Chin, said the challenger gave voters \u201csomething that they\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ran too good a campaign, so to speak,\u201d said Stephen Morgan, a Republican and former city councilor who finished third in the November election and supported Macdonald in the runoff.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Race played a factor in the election \u2014 and the national political climate edged it along.\n\nLewiston\u2019s influx of African immigrants makes it different than any other place in Maine, the nation\u2019s oldest and whitest state. Portland also has a large immigrant population, but it\u2019s bigger, more prosperous and more liberal.\n\nMacdonald is probably best known for telling Somalis to \u201cleave your culture at the door\u201d in 2012, highlighting an inevitable tension between the city\u2019s established and new residents.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jama Mohamed, a Somali immigrant and school board member, said that immigrants are \u201cin our home\u201d now and supported Chin because he wanted a leader to \u201crepresent us, all of us.\u201d\n\nBut Don Hebert, a lifelong Lewiston resident who voted for Macdonald, said it\u2019s \u201can insult\u201d that immigrants are being compared to his Franco-American ancestors who came to the city about 1900.\n\nHebert\u2019s statement that \u201cthere was no welfare\u201d when his ancestors arrived illustrates how closely the immigration and welfare narratives played out in runoff.\n\nRace also came into play when local landlord Joe Dunne \u2014 whom Chin had dubbed a \u201cslumlord\u201d \u2014 put up signs in the city that called the Chinese-American candidate \u201cHo Chi Chin.\u201d Dunne said it was a reference to his progressive policies, but many saw them as racist.\n\nAlso, the campaign happened during the rise of Trump, the New York magnate who has called for banning all Muslim travel to the U.S. after the Paris terror attacks in November.\n\n\u201cI thought about Trump a lot,\u201d Macdonald told Carr. \u201cHe\u2019d say something, and he\u2019d go up in the polls, and I\u2019d figure, every time his numbers improve, mine probably do, too.\u201d\n\nBut this was a local contest, not a referendum on Trump.\n\n\u201cPut Donald Trump back on \u2018The Celebrity Apprentice,\u2019\u201d Brewer said, \u201cand the outcome would still be the same in this race.\u201d\n\nBut it probably doesn\u2019t tell us anything new about Democrats\u2019 problems in Lewiston or anywhere else.\n\nChin\u2019s defeat was a major disappointment for Maine Democrats, who sought a show of strength in a traditional stronghold for their party.\n\nThey still hold a 6,000-voter edge on Republicans in the city. Democrats control all five legislative seats in Lewiston, and a majority of the next City Council endorsed Chin.\n\nThe city, however, was won by Gov. Paul LePage in 2010 and 2014, and Macdonald\u2019s win has Republicans bullish on their future. Maine GOP Chairman Rick Bennett said in a statement that the result showed the party is \u201cprepared to keep gaining ground.\u201d\n\nAnti-welfare rhetoric has been a winning message for Maine Republicans. Morgan called welfare \u201cthe hottest issue\u201d in Lewiston. He said when he knocked on doors for his campaign, seven out of 10 voters talked about it.\n\nBut we already knew welfare posed a political problem for Democrats. LePage won last year with welfare reform at the core of his platform. Dennis Bailey, a Democratic strategist who once was a reporter in Lewiston, said Republicans are \u201ctapping into people\u2019s unease about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey strike a chord, and Democrats don\u2019t have a good comeback,\u201d he said.\n\nPhil Bartlett, chairman of the Maine Democratic Party, said Chin\u2019s campaign was altogether positive for the party, saying it showed there\u2019s \u201ca real hunger for bold leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope the candidates of all political stripes will take that to heart and build their campaigns around issues that they care about,\u201d he said, \u201cother than all the sorts of junk that gets tossed around in political campaigns.\u201d\n\nBut after Chin\u2019s defeat and two November losses in special elections for House seats formerly held by Democrats, the question remains whether Bartlett\u2019s approach can succeed in Maine\u2019s current political landscape.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 Plenty have weighed in on why Lewiston Mayor Robert Macdonald won re-election in a runoff on Tuesday and what it means. \u2014 In Ben Chin\u2019s concession speech, the challenger described his long odds based on the mayor\u2019s two-term incumbency. \u2014 Republicans said it was a victory for [...]", "title": "Lewiston wasn\u2019t ready for change, but is Maine?", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/12/13/the-point/lewiston-wasnt-ready-for-change-but-is-maine/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/10061441_H16568747-600x389.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 Plenty have weighed in on why Lewiston Mayor Robert Macdonald won re-election in a runoff on Tuesday and what it means. \u2014 In Ben Chin\u2019s concession speech, the challenger described his long odds based on the mayor\u2019s two-term incumbency. \u2014 Republicans said it was a victory for [...]", "title": "Lewiston wasn\u2019t ready for change, but is Maine?", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/12/13/the-point/lewiston-wasnt-ready-for-change-but-is-maine/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/10061441_H16568747-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 Plenty have weighed in on why Lewiston Mayor Robert Macdonald won re-election in a runoff on Tuesday and what it means.\n\u2014 Mark Brewer, a University of Maine political scientist, said \u201ca little bit of everything\u201d made for the result.\nChin\u2019s defeat was a major disappointment for Maine Democrats, who sought a show of strength in a traditional stronghold for their party.\n\u201cThe simplest way to break it down is, \u2018Was Lewiston ready for change?\u2019\u201d said Lizzy Reinholt, a Democratic strategist from Stratton.\n\u2014 A liberal Salon writer gave Lewiston a new name: \u201cTrumpland,\u201d saying the racially tinged politics of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump won."}
