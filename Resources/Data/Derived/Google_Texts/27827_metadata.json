Gandhi would lead India to freedom by 1947. But writing at a time when he was still surrounded by the squalid spectacle of imperial exploitation, he imagined a future when Britain\u2019s destitute subjects sought, upon their liberation from foreign rule, to mimic the hoggish habits of their colonial overlords. If the masses of Asia \u201ctook to similar economic exploitation\u201d as the West, he warned, \u201cit would strip the world bare like locusts.\u201d\n\nMichael Buckley renders an important service in this outspoken book by alerting us to the fact that, for millions of Tibetans, the desolate future evoked by Gandhi has been a reality for decades. Buckley, a Canadian journalist and photographer, has been traveling to Tibet for more than 30 years. Here, he documents the calamitous consequences of China\u2019s unsparing usurpation of Tibet\u2019s natural resources. Since its violent annexation of Tibet in 1950, China has relentlessly disfigured the hypnotically beautiful plateau. It has mined and carted away Tibet\u2019s mineral wealth, dammed and diverted waters from its bountiful rivers, herded innumerable Tibetans into what it calls \u201cNew Socialist Villages,\u201d suppressed the expression of Tibetan identity, and annihilated whole ways of life. \u201cTibet,\u201d Buckley reminds us, \u201cis the largest colony in the world.\u201d\n\nBuckley is a keen observer. Seemingly minute changes in Tibet\u2019s environment set him off on a quest to uncover their underlying causes. Stung by a mosquito in Lhasa, Tibet\u2019s capital, he is at first baffled: Mosquitoes aren\u2019t supposed to be able to survive above 11,000 feet, and Lhasa sits at an altitude of 12,000 feet. Historically, Tibet has never been affected by malaria, still among the most fatal diseases in the vicinity. But, as China\u2019s aggressive colonization degrades Tibet\u2019s habitat, this may soon change. The railway line from Beijing to Lhasa \u2014 a feat of engineering and a fount of pollution \u2014 brings trainloads of Han Chinese tourists and settlers who, occupying the top tier of China\u2019s ethnic hierarchy and indifferent to the local customs, increasingly resemble the British in India: foreigners seeking fortunes and adventure in an exotic outpost.\n\nDespite his emotional investment in Tibet, Buckley\u2019s prose is not weighed down by sentimentalism. He does not romanticize or exalt the victims. \u201cTibetans were not environmentalists,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey had no concept of sanitation, plumbing, or garbage disposal.\u201d\n\nBut unlike the starry-eyed Western observers of China who, enraptured by the glitz of Shanghai\u2019s skyscrapers, have rushed to pronounce this the Chinese century, Buckley is mindful of the unfathomable human suffering on the periphery that underwrites the glamour of the governing elite who inhabit China\u2019s metropolises.\n\nAs the worsening condition of dissidents from Tibet to Xinjiang demonstrates, Tibet\u2019s fate now looks like a chilling preamble, rather than the coda, to the story of China\u2019s ruthless race to the top.\n\nCOLONIZATION: DEGRADATION\n\nMeltdown in Tibet: China\u2019s Reckless Destruction of Ecosystems from the Highlands of Tibet to the Deltas of Asia\n\nby Michael Buckley, (Palgrave Macmillan)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "China\u2019s ruthless ruin of Tibet", "title": "China\u2019s ruthless ruin of Tibet", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/08/chinas-ruthless-ruin-of-tibet/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-08T17:49:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-08T17:49:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d9e\"", "article_summary": "COLONIZATION: DEGRADATIONMeltdown in Tibet: China\u2019s Reckless Destruction of Ecosystems from the Highlands of Tibet to the Deltas of Asiaby Michael Buckley, (Palgrave Macmillan)\n\u201cTibet,\u201d Buckley reminds us, \u201cis the largest colony in the world.\u201dBuckley is a keen observer.\nAs the worsening condition of dissidents from Tibet to Xinjiang demonstrates, Tibet\u2019s fate now looks like a chilling preamble, rather than the coda, to the story of China\u2019s ruthless race to the top.\nStung by a mosquito in Lhasa, Tibet\u2019s capital, he is at first baffled: Mosquitoes aren\u2019t supposed to be able to survive above 11,000 feet, and Lhasa sits at an altitude of 12,000 feet.\nBuckley, a Canadian journalist and photographer, has been traveling to Tibet for more than 30 years."}
