More than two tons of eggs and potatoes, 30 onions and 150 litres of olive oil were mixed into the gigantic dish that was then divided into 10,000 portions and passed on to the crowd.\n\nMonths later, according to The Guardian, the Guinness World Records rejected the tortilla on the grounds that it did not beat an 11,036kg tortilla that was made in Japan in 1994.\n\nAside from just not being big enough, Guinness found fault with the actual method of preparation wherein many small, precooked omelettes were put into one huge five-meter diameter omelette.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the Spanish Capital of Gastronomy Association omelette not weighing more than the current record, it did not prepare the omelette correctly and in accordance with our guidelines,\" Guinness World Records said in their official statement.\n\nWhat likely started out as a good-natured stab at national pride and culinary unity has become political fodder in Spain, where opposing politicians are using what is being dubbed \u201ctortillagate\u201d to target the municipal People\u2019s party that failed to receive the Guinness title in an expensive spectacle that ended up costing 45,000 Euros.\n\nJavier Maroto, the mayor of Vitoria, defends his city\u2019s attempt at fame, talking up the obvious visibility that has been brought to Vitoria.\n\n\u201cIt was worth it, regardless of the result,\u201d he said, going on about Guinness\u2019s decision and sticking to his own belief that \u201cthe tortilla that we made in Vitoria is the biggest tortilla de patatas that has ever been made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Spain\u2019s attempt at claiming a Guinness World Record for cooking up the world\u2019s largest tortilla (omelette) has failed.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "Spain\u2019s attempt at claiming a Guinness World Record for cooking up the world\u2019s largest tortilla (omelette) has failed.", "title": "Vitoria, Spain Has Egg on Its Face After Guinness World Record Fail: Five-Meter Omelette Rejected in 'Tortillagate' Controversy", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/27134/20141204/vitoria-spain-egg-face-guinness-world-record-fail-five-meter.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/26452/spain-world-record-omelette-tortillagate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "Spain\u2019s attempt at claiming a Guinness World Record for cooking up the world\u2019s largest tortilla (omelette) has failed.", "creator": "@latinpost", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/27134/20141204/vitoria-spain-egg-face-guinness-world-record-fail-five-meter.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/26452/spain-world-record-omelette-tortillagate.jpg", "title": "Vitoria, Spain Has Egg on Its Face After Guinness World Record Fail: Five-Meter Omelette Rejected in 'Tortillagate' Controversy", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/27134/20141204/vitoria-spain-egg-face-guinness-world-record-fail-five-meter.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Keywords": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Title": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-04"}, "Subject": "Latin Post", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "vitoria, spain, has, egg, on, its, face, after, guinness, world, record, fail, five, meter, omelette, rejected, in, tortillagate, controversy"}, "article_summary": "Spain\u2019s attempt at claiming a Guinness World Record for cooking up the world\u2019s largest tortilla (which in Spain means omelette) has fallen flat.\nMonths later, according to The Guardian, the Guinness World Records rejected the tortilla on the grounds that it did not beat an 11,036kg tortilla that was made in Japan in 1994.\n\u201cIn addition to the Spanish Capital of Gastronomy Association omelette not weighing more than the current record, it did not prepare the omelette correctly and in accordance with our guidelines,\" Guinness World Records said in their official statement.\nJavier Maroto, the mayor of Vitoria, defends his city\u2019s attempt at fame, talking up the obvious visibility that has been brought to Vitoria.\nAside from just not being big enough, Guinness found fault with the actual method of preparation wherein many small, precooked omelettes were put into one huge five-meter diameter omelette."}
