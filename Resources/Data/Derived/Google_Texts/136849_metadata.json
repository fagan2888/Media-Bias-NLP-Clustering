On the assumption that Medicaid expansion would reduce the number of indigent (non-paying patients), Obamacare will cut back funds to hospitals under the established Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program to help offset the cost of uncompensated care. If Virginia fails to expand Medicaid, as now seems likely, and the federal government cuts DSH funding as planned, Virginia hospitals will take a hit to the bottom line.\n\nThe debate may be academic now that Governor Terry McAuliffe has essentially punted on Medicaid expansion in the face of strong Republican opposition in the General Assembly and has proposed a scaled-down Healthy Virginia plan. But the issue still is worth revisiting. Virginia hospitals stand to lose about $386 million in payments from the DSH program between 2017 and 2022 \u2014 an average of $77 million per year. How badly will hospitals be hurt? Will cuts impair the quality of care? Do we need to worry?\n\nMike Thompson, president of the Thomas Jefferson Institute, a conservative think tank, has compiled the profit figures for Virginia hospitals from the Virginia Health Information Foundation. In the aggregate, in November 2013 Virginia\u2019s hospitals had combined profits of $1.6 billion and net worth of $15 billion. The annualized DSH payments are equivalent to about 5% of 2013 profits.\n\nOne would think that hospitals should be able to absorb that hit to revenues \u2014 equivalent to a year or so of profit growth. Does the picture change when we drill into the numbers? The burden of indigent care is not apportioned equally between hospitals. Some facilities serve largely poor populations and provide extensive uncompensated care and rely more than others on the DSH funds. Also, hospital profitability varied widely from institution to institution. Several hospitals are losing money. In theory, a loss of funds could be devastating.\n\nThompson\u2019s data reveals that several money-losing hospitals are part of larger health care systems; while they lose money, they feed profitable business to the tertiary care hospitals at the center of those systems, hence, they are not in danger of being shut down. Other facilities represent expansions into new markets \u2014 start-up enterprises, in effect. Their parent companies are fully prepared to bear the losses while the facilities ramp up to profitability. Then, too, there are some hospitals that appear to have serious problems. However, it\u2019s not clear from one year\u2019s data whether those losses are ongoing or simply the result of a one-year write-down.\n\nIt would be helpful to get a hospital-by-hospital breakdown of DSH funding and see how it compares to hospital profitability. The not-for-profit VCU Health System is reputedly the largest provider of uncompensated care in the state. But, then, it reported a profit of $130 million \u2014 a 12.8% return on equity (net worth). Would the loss of, say, $30 million a year in DSH funding be crippling? Maybe VCU could spin a tale of woe that would persuade me otherwise, but it sure doesn\u2019t look like it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Hospital profits are a good thing. Try getting your healthcare from money-losing hospitals \u2014 you won\u2019t like it. Even not-for-profits need earnings to help fund expansions and new initiatives. But when hospitals are funded with public funds and receive special tax exemptions, the public has a right to ask tough questions.\n\nUpdate: The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association response to Thompson\u2019s study can be seen here. The main thrust: The data is two years old, and the financial pressure on Virginia hospitals has intensified since then.\n\n\u2014 JAB\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nThere are currently no comments highlighted.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Mike Thompson, president of the Thomas Jefferson Institute, a conservative think tank, has compiled the profit figures for Virginia hospitals from the Virginia Health Information Foundation.\nThe main thrust: The data is two years old, and the financial pressure on Virginia hospitals has intensified since then.\nOne of the justifications given for expanding Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program as part of the implementation of Obamacare is to shore up the financial condition of Virginia\u2019s hospitals.\nUpdate: The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association response to Thompson\u2019s study can be seen here.\nIn the aggregate, in November 2013 Virginia\u2019s hospitals had combined profits of $1.6 billion and net worth of $15 billion."}
