For health purposes, the watch is aiming to be a revolutionary in the way its tracking technology operates, as it consolidates the amount of time you\u2019ve spent standing, moving, and exercising with your fitness goals \u2014 of course, heart rate, blood sugar, and calories burned are included in this. All of this will be included in the Apple Watch\u2019s HealthKit, but how did the company develop the technology? It used it\u2019s own employees.\n\nApple recently granted an exclusive interview to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, in which it showed Rebecca Jarvis the back-alley lab where it tested all sorts of health measures. Essentially, the lab is just a high-tech gym, full of treadmills, rowing machines, and yoga space. For two years, Apple employees have been hitting the gym decked out in instruments meant to measure everything from how heavy they\u2019re breathing to their heart rate, all with the intention of improving HealthKit. The creepiest part: None of them were told what they were working out for. Nevertheless, they all seemed to be in good spirits.\n\nThe Apple Watch was originally intended to have sensors capable of tracking stress levels, blood pressure, and heart activity, similar to the way a polygraph test and electrocardiogram work. However, the sensors had problems working on people with hairy arms or dry skin. Whether or not the watch will work better than current fitness trackers on the market without these functions remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "secret, apple, watch, health, lab, opens, its, doors, first, time, inside, development, healthkit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The health lab in which the Apple Watch's HealthKit was developed recently opened its doors for the first time since its inception two years ago.", "title": "A First Look At The Apple Watch Health Lab [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/secret-apple-watch-health-lab-opens-its-doors-first-time-inside-development-healthkit-326600", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/22/secret-apple-watch-health-lab-opens-its-doors-first-time-inside-development-healthkit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The health lab in which the Apple Watch's HealthKit was developed recently opened its doors for the first time since its inception two years ago.", "title": "A First Look At The Apple Watch Health Lab [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/secret-apple-watch-health-lab-opens-its-doors-first-time-inside-development-healthkit-326600", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/22/secret-apple-watch-health-lab-opens-its-doors-first-time-inside-development-healthkit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/secret-apple-watch-health-lab-opens-its-doors-first-time-inside-development-healthkit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-03-22T15:57:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T10:26:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The health lab in which the Apple Watch's HealthKit was developed recently opened its doors for the first time since its inception two years ago."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce393\"", "article_summary": "The Apple Watch will be released in only a few weeks now, and the hype surrounding it is only growing.\nWhether or not the watch will work better than current fitness trackers on the market without these functions remains to be seen.\nThe Apple Watch was originally intended to have sensors capable of tracking stress levels, blood pressure, and heart activity, similar to the way a polygraph test and electrocardiogram work.\nAll of this will be included in the Apple Watch\u2019s HealthKit, but how did the company develop the technology?\nApple recently granted an exclusive interview to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, in which it showed Rebecca Jarvis the back-alley lab where it tested all sorts of health measures."}
