Ted Cruz and Mike Lee are challenging leaders over amendments to the highway bill. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nConservative Sen. Mike Lee abandoned plans late Monday night to demand a controversial vote on repealing Obamacare following a meeting in which he apologized to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the actions of a Lee staffer.\n\nLee gave up his plan to seek an amendment to the must-pass highway bill with a simple-majority vote \u2014 a tactic known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 after serious backlash from Republican colleagues, including McConnell.\n\nRepublicans were angered by an e-mail sent by a Lee staffer to outside groups, including the conservative Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute, encouraging them to \u201cscore\u201d the amendment vote. That would have forced Lee\u2019s colleagues to support his Obamacare gambit or risk criticism from the right.\n\n[Get e-mail updates by using our new Follow feature]\n\nLee\u2019s actions prompted McConnell to call an hour-long closed-door meeting Monday night to bring the party together on a central strategy after weeks of infighting. Lee at first proposed pulling the amendment in favor of getting a later vote during budget reconciliation.\n\nLee Communications Director Conn Carroll said the senator spoke to McConnell ahead of the Monday night meeting and apologized for the e-mail from his staffer and said that the staffer was reprimanded.\n\nRepublicans halted a similar procedural move from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), when he tried on Sunday to stop the Iran nuclear deal until that country recognizes Israel and frees American hostages.\n\nThe Cruz and Lee efforts highlighted tension within Senate GOP ranks over when they should pick fights with the Obama administration and when they should hold their fire and move bipartisan legislation. Only a small handful of Republicans rose on Sunday to support Cruz.\n\n[House won\u2019t vote on Senate highway bill, putting trust fund at risk]\n\nLee and McConnell have had a bumpy relationship from the start, and the move to ditch the rules is just their latest conflict. Lee joined a group of conservative senators in a push to ban earmarks in 2010, just weeks after he was elected, putting him at odds with McConnell\u2019s pro-earmark position from day one.\n\nThey have since repaired their relationship and Lee now serves as an appointed member of McConnell\u2019s leadership team. Lee\u2019s spokesman, Conn Carroll, said the senator plans to keep his position in leadership and that the dust-up over rules is nothing more than a political disagreement.\n\nDemocrats famously used the so-called nuclear option in 2013 to break a blockade of presidential nominees by allowing them to be confirmed with simple-majority votes, leading to angry protests from Republicans who said they were ditching Senate traditions in the name of partisan politics.\n\n[Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet]\n\nBut Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters ahead of the Cruz vote that there was no reason for Republicans to use the Democrats\u2019 2013 move as a justification for employing a similar tactic now.\n\n\u201cI think if we\u2019re going to change the rules we\u2019d better have debate and we\u2019d better have votes and we\u2019d better have consultation,\u201d McCain. \u201cWe can\u2019t just turn around and change the rules of the Senate.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, Lee was going to offer the Obamacare repeal amendment that failed through normal procedure on Sunday. He intended to argue that his proposal is directly related to the highway funding bill and appeal the ruling of the chair that it is not. Under Senate rules, amendments that are directly related, or germane, to the underlying legislation can pass with just 51 votes.\n\nLee would need at least 11 vote to even get to a vote on overturning the chair\u2019s ruling. But he was expected to fall far short of even that threshold because his parliamentary gambit is opposed by most Senate Republicans.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) on Sunday said there\u2019s no reason to change Senate rules because legislation that has sufficient support will ultimately pass.\n\n\u201cAny time 65 senators want to do something here in the Senate, sooner or later they\u2019re going to get their way,\u201d he said on the Senate floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't want anything to get in the way of passing his highway bill.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't want anything to get in the way of passing his highway bill.", "title": "Lee backs down from Obamacare amendment, after staffer e-mails outside groups", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/27/senate-republicans-dont-want-to-ditch-the-rules-to-repeal-obamacare/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/01/National-Politics/Images/182021152.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pkcapitol"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mike lee, mitch mcconnell, ted cruz, obamacare, affordable care act, highway bill, heritage, cato", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mike lee, mitch mcconnell, ted cruz, obamacare, affordable care act, highway bill, heritage, cato"}, "article_summary": "Republicans were angered by an e-mail sent by a Lee staffer to outside groups, including the conservative Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute, encouraging them to \u201cscore\u201d the amendment vote.\non Sunday said there\u2019s no reason to change Senate rules because legislation that has sufficient support will ultimately pass.\nUnder Senate rules, amendments that are directly related, or germane, to the underlying legislation can pass with just 51 votes.\nTed Cruz and Mike Lee are challenging leaders over amendments to the highway bill.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just turn around and change the rules of the Senate.\u201dOn Monday night, Lee was going to offer the Obamacare repeal amendment that failed through normal procedure on Sunday."}
