And at this point, that will be the last thing we do, \u2026 but there is no way we can say right now that that wont happen,\u201d Koskinen told reporters at a Thursday press conference on the upcoming tax season. \u201cAgain, I would stress that would be the last option.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How bad would an IRS shutdown be?)\n\nHe said a shutdown would mean the IRS would \u201cclose the agency for a day, two days, whatever days it would take to close the gap that we can\u2019t otherwise close in a reasonable way.\u201d\n\nThe agency estimates each closed day would save $29 million.\n\nThe news comes a day after Koskinen in an email warned IRS employees that overtime would be suspended and a hiring freeze enacted. He also said more tough news would likely follow as IRS leadership negotiates with the National Treasury Employees Union, particularly because personnel costs comprise about 75 percent of the IRS costs.\n\nIn the recent budget deal, Congress cut the IRS budget by $346 million to $10.9 billion \u2014 $1.5 billion less than the administration asked for. The IRS\u2019 budget has been reduced about $1 billion since 2010.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Republicans seek to cripple IRS)\n\nThe agency was one of the only agencies that got a cut this year \u2014 despite the storm of a tax season looming on the horizon. The IRS will be implementing Obamacare tax credits and penalties for the first time as well as a new tax evasion law.\n\nBut Koskinen said his current budget challenge is made worse by a mandated one percent federal employee increase it must abide by.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the $350 million cut in the budget; it\u2019s the fact that we have $250 million in new expenses for a government-wide pay raise. \u2026 So we really have a $600 million hole this year,\u201d he said.\n\nKoskinen took over the agency after it faced big criticism following the controversy over added scrutiny given to tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status. Republicans, never a fan of the IRS, have sought to cut its budget further ever since. They\u2019ve also been critical of the IRS paying out bonuses this year, and still mention lavish conferences the IRS hosted several years back.\n\nSince then, the IRS has cut its training budget by more than 85 percent, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate, which is anticipating more trouble due to budget cuts.\n\nKoskinen says there is no more fat to cut at the IRS.\n\nFollow @politico\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The commissioner says a one-day closure would save an estimated $29 million.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The commissioner says a one-day closure would save an estimated $29 million.", "title": "IRS warns of possible shutdown", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/irs-possible-temporary-shutdown-113681.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "IRS", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8c5\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro IRS warns of possible shutdownThe IRS is considering its own temporary shutdown due to recent budget cuts enacted by Congress, its chief said Thursday.\n\u201cAgain, I would stress that would be the last option.\u201d( Also on POLITICO: How bad would an IRS shutdown be?)\nThe IRS\u2019 budget has been reduced about $1 billion since 2010.\nThe news comes a day after Koskinen in an email warned IRS employees that overtime would be suspended and a hiring freeze enacted.\nIn the recent budget deal, Congress cut the IRS budget by $346 million to $10.9 billion \u2014 $1.5 billion less than the administration asked for."}
