Miecyjak, practice administrator and chief operating officer at Westermeier Martin Dental Care in East Aurora, is marking 20 years with the practice. She is among several dental professionals I\u2019ve talked with about dental costs during the last couple of years. (Read a Refresh Buffalo Blog post here from earlier this year with the owners of Drs. Mark S. Wendling and David Rice, owners of East Amherst Dental Center.)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has begun to change the face of medical insurance \u2013 here, too generally making out-of-pocket costs for patients costlier \u2013 while a growing number of dental patients who remember getting great company insurance coverage in the 1990s are now shouldering more of the costs.\n\nBottom line: as health costs rise more than inflation, government officials on both sides of the political aisle have decided (mostly quietly) that the U.S. health system can\u2019t continue unless patients bring more dollars to the table.\n\nAnother bottom line: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that medical insurances are so costly that employers have to make a choice and don\u2019t cover so much of the dental,\u201d said Miecyjak, subject of today\u2019s In the Field feature in WNY Refresh.\n\nDental offices are doing what they can to stay affordable, she said, by offering various scales of service, payment plans and some pro bono work.\n\nHere\u2019s what she told me how Westermeier Martin has addressed the cost realities, including its offer of an individual preventative dental package for $239 a year:\n\nQ. You cover a wide range of services in the office: Dental implants, sedation dentistry, cosmetic, Strickland Facelift Dentures, adult orthodontics, porcelain veneer, teeth whitening, CEREC crowns, emergency dentistry. Which are the most common procedures? Which are the most complicated and costly?\n\nThe most common would be your cleaning and your checkup, fillings. The most complicated and costly would be some of the restorative work; for instance, people who come in and need a whole mouthful of teeth. That can be more expensive. Sometimes the doctors say that\u2019s like putting a new car in your mouth, but that\u2019s going to be there the rest of your life. We typically tell patients your care will be anywhere from $100 to $50,000 \u2013 and you\u2019ll probably find yourself somewhere in between.\n\nQ. How has the nature of paying for dental care changed over the last 20 years?\n\nIt used to be you used to either accept insurance in full or patients would pay you in cash or check. That was it. When I first came here, I thought not too many people can afford that (out of pocket), so we went and found a no-interest payment plan that gave patients up to 12 months to pay off their dental work with no interest. We started to do that and that\u2019s when the practice started to grow because people could afford the type of dental work that people need.\n\nNow we have a whole range \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons we brought in the patient advocates. People really do need work that\u2019s comprehensive and complex. How can you make a good decision on something you don\u2019t understand. So patients sit down and the advocates will go through everything with you. They can either phase something out so it\u2019s more affordable or apply for financing programs. We do a courtesy adjustment for people who want to pay us ahead of time. We like that, too, because we know they\u2019re going to show up for their appointments.\n\nIt\u2019s been a natural evolution. Every time we would come to a point where we\u2019d say, \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping patients from getting what they need?,\u201d We would try to find an answer and overcome that.\n\nQ. These days, patients not only to have to worry about the pain associated with dental care, but the cost because of changes in dental health insurance coverage. What do you say to folks concerned about the cost?\n\nWe say, \u201cWhat if we could divide you fee into 12 months interest-free?\u201d \u201cWhat is the minimum amount we can do so you don\u2019t have to be in pain anymore?\u201d\n\nQ. Are you seeing a lower percentage of patients covered with any form of dental insurance?\n\nYes. One of the things we did was create our own membership in this practice which for a nominal amount \u2013 $239 a year for adults, $269 for children and $807 for a family of four \u2013 includes all your cleanings, all your X-rays, your checkups and 15 percent off certain procedures we do here. These are preventive-based.\n\nI once asked one of the insurance companies, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you paying for this?\u201d (A representative) said, \u201cThey should have taken better care of their teeth.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? Sometimes you can\u2019t help it. Sometimes it\u2019s genetics. It\u2019s what you\u2019re born with. Some people have good teeth, some people have soft teeth. Some people have great gums, other people have terrible gums.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also evolved into the body-mouth connection. It\u2019s not that your mouth is one thing and you body is another. We find with some of the new medical insurances that you have to pay the high deductibles (generally up to $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families). We\u2019re more affordable for a cleaning and a checkup and our doctors can actually sense some health problems. We take blood pressures. When patients have disease or infections in their mouths, it definitely affects the rest of their body.\n\nQ. Talk about the Dentistry from the Heart program. What kinds of services are provided?\n\nWe provide free dental care once a year. We did it June 19 and saw over 100 patients. This was the 11th year. We heard about this at a dental meeting and thought it was a cool way to give back. At first we did it in February because we thought of it as our Valentine\u2019s Day gift to the community. We did not realize that people would be standing in line (for first-come, first-served care). The next year we decided to move it to June. The first person in line this year was at 3 a.m. We let the area churches and soup kitchens know and we put it on the website.\n\nA lot of people, year after year, we are their dentist. They come once a year. People have asked what they can do to thank us and we decided this year, \u201cLet\u2019s pay it forward.\u201d We asked everybody to bring a perishable food donation and we had two huge boxes and we took it across the street to FISH, part of the Nativity Lutheran Church across the street. They have a food pantry.\n\nWe do cleanings, exams, checkups. The hygienists do their part and the doctors will do whatever the pressing need is. We do fillings, some extractions, some root canals \u2013 depending on the time pressure. We don\u2019t embarrass people here, we don\u2019t lecture and we don\u2019t judge. We\u2019re happy you\u2019re here and we\u2019re here to take care of you.\n\nQ. What are the nuts and bolts of what you do?\n\nI\u2019m in charge of human resources. I\u2019m in charge of finances. I\u2019m in charge of marketing and any projects are happening. We work with a dental coach and I\u2019m the liaison between the dental coach and the practice. We\u2019re always trying to figure out how to be better at what we\u2019re doing. I attend a lot of the dental meetings with the doctors because I\u2019m learning as well. Then we bring things back to the practice and implement them. I report to the two owners and I have four team leaders. I have a team leader who\u2019s responsible for the hygiene department. I have a team leader who\u2019s responsible for the front office and I have a team leader who\u2019s responsible for the clinical department, all the assistants and the doctors, and a team leader for our patient advocates.\n\nQ. How busy is the dental practice and how to you help make it hum?\n\nWe have 15 rooms going most days. We see easily 50 to over 100 patients a day, depending on the day and their needs. I try to keep my finger on everything. I walk around, I talk to everybody. We make sure that people we hire have the right temperament, the right attitude. We have to like being here because working here is like being a family. ... We want people to say, \u201cI may not like going to the dentist, but I like going there.\u201d\n\nemail: refresh@buffnews.com\n\nTwitter: @BNrefresh", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Refresh Buffalo Blog", "description": "The American Dental Association estimated in 2006 that only about one-quarter of low-income Americans \u2013 about 82 million of them at that time \u2013 went to a dentist annually, a reflection on the rising cost of dental care at a time when public and workplace dental insurance plans continued on a 20-year slide when it came to coverage.
