His revised stance was obviously a political calculation in a year when the voters seem to be sick of political calculations.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has been Trump right from the jump. He is authentically boorish and nasty. I\u2019m not sure that you can suddenly transform yourself from grasshopper to gladiator and not seem a bit phony somehow, even though the Florida senator brought it off low-key, funny and well.\n\nIt is possible that Rubio\u2019s assault on Trump will have the same effect as Chris Christie\u2019s assault on Rubio: It may ding Donald a bit, but it may also have been a kamikaze mission, doing Rubio no good at all or even, perhaps, hurting him.\n\nIn my wildest moderate fantasy, the beneficiary of the combined Rubio-Cruz attack would redound to the benefit of John Kasich\u2013who, yet again, established himself as the one candidate on the stage with both feet planted on Planet Earth. But that hasn\u2019t happened in previous debates.\n\nAside from the central trash-Trump narrative, I found the discussion of Obamacare\u2014and health care in general\u2014to be weird and misleading, and typical of what passes for \u201csubstantive\u201d discourse in these circuses. Let me take you into the weeds a bit:\n\nDonald Trump is right about \u201cthe [state] lines\u201d which limit the market for purchasing health insurance, but he doesn\u2019t have a clue about anything else. Obamacare\u2014and its conservative predecessor, the Heritage Foundation plan\u2014depend on market principles. Individual state markets (the term of art is \u201chealth care exchanges,\u201d which are websites\u2014like Amazon or Travelocity\u2014where purchasers can compare health insurance plans) are inefficient, and too many of them offer minimal choices. There was an effort to create larger, regional markets in the final stages of the Obamacare debate. For some obscure reason\u2014it probably has to do with insurance company lobbying\u2014the idea was killed by moderate Democrats. Part of the problem was that most Republicans were refusing to negotiate. They were simply against the bill; if they\u2019d participated, we might have had a much more effective program.\n\nDonald Trump is wrong about \u201cthe lines\u201d being the most important thing. The most important thing is who pays for the people who work, but don\u2019t make enough money to pay for health insurance? (Medicaid pays for the people who don\u2019t work.) In a CBS News interview, Trump said bluntly: \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s one way to do it. Another is to impose an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d\u2014that is, to require healthy young people who don\u2019t think they need health insurance to buy some. The implicit deal is that young people have a moral and civil responsibility to pay into the system when they\u2019re healthy so that the system will take care of them when they\u2019re older and less healthy. The original Heritage plan, which John Kasich (wisely) supported in 1994 had a mandate.\n\nKasich is wrong about the individual mandate being unnecessary. If you want to cover less-healthy people\u2014those with pre-existing conditions\u2014everyone has to pay into the system. There are two ways to do this: by requiring people to buy in, or by the less efficient and more inequitable method of having the government pay for it. In the end, Obamacare needed both the mandate and government subsidies for the working poor\u2014because it was loaded down with \u201cgottas.\u201d You gotta cover contraception. You gotta cover mental health. You gotta cover abortion. The original Heritage Found plan had none of these gottas, which make the program less comprehensive but cheaper. If Republicans had chosen to negotiate the Obamacare system, we might have ended up with something more like the one that Ben Carson was (unintelligibly) describing: health savings accounts\u2014where the insured person can decide which coverage he or she wants\u2014plus catastrophic coverage, in case something awful happens to you. This would, I believe, have been a good compromise.\n\nKasich was incomprehensible about what he\u2019s doing about health care in Ohio, which he says would be a model for a national system if he wins the nomination. I suspect he\u2019s trying to get rid of the current fee-for-service system, which encourages doctors to provide services (blood tests etc.) even when they\u2019re not necessary. The alternative (used by the Cleveland Clinic) is to pay doctors salaries and, as Kasich said, give them performance bonuses based on how well their patients fared. This is one good way to control costs, and it is working well in private Medicare Advantage plans. But it is not very popular with patients.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio are screaming fire in a crowded theater when they describe Obamacare as \u201cjob-killing.\u201d What they\u2019re referring to is the supposition that thousands people will leave the workforce if they can get \u201cfree\u201d health care. This may or may not be true at the margins. The overwhelming majority of people prefer to work. (It also presupposes that people will leave jobs that already provide health insurance, which\u2014almost by definition\u2014are better paying and more satisfying jobs than flipping burgers). On a sounder footing, they\u2019re arguing that this will discourage small businesses, which are not required to provide healthcare, from growing larger and being required to cover them. This is called an \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d and it is, surely, a bad idea. The \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was posed as an alternative to that. Obamacare is a mixed system of individual and employer mandates. Once again, the absence of Republicans in the Obamacare negotiations caused this mess\u2014and Republicans could, surely, help clean it up if they were willing to play. (The fact that they haven\u2019t been willing to play is disgraceful.)\n\nThe bottom line is that Obamacare is not a disaster, but it could have been\u2014and could still be\u2014made better if the Republicans had decided to negotiate a more efficient system. The original Heritage Foundation plan had the advantage of being intellectually honest; it covered everyone, it limited the deductibility of health insurance for wealthier people, but it assumed that individuals could decide the type of health care they wanted. I still think it\u2019s a good idea.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the sort of thing one can debate rationally in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There wasn't much healthy about the GOP debate's discussion on healthcare", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The Republican candidates' views on how to improve our heath care system are weird and misleading", "title": "An Unhealthy Republican Debate", "url": "http://time.com/4238582/republican-debate-healthcare-trump/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "description": "The Republican candidates' views on how to improve our heath care system are weird and misleading", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "An Unhealthy Republican Debate"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, republican, debate, gop, healthcare, obamacare, heritage foundation, donald trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016 election, republican, debate, gop, healthcare, obamacare, heritage foundation, donald trump"}, "article_summary": "Aside from the central trash-Trump narrative, I found the discussion of Obamacare\u2014and health care in general\u2014to be weird and misleading, and typical of what passes for \u201csubstantive\u201d discourse in these circuses.\nAnother is to impose an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d\u2014that is, to require healthy young people who don\u2019t think they need health insurance to buy some.\nDonald Trump was demolished in the 10th Republican presidential debate, but I\u2019m not sure it will make any difference.\nThe most important thing is who pays for the people who work, but don\u2019t make enough money to pay for health insurance?\n(It also presupposes that people will leave jobs that already provide health insurance, which\u2014almost by definition\u2014are better paying and more satisfying jobs than flipping burgers)."}
