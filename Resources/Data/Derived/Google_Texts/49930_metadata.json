(Photo: Valerie Mosley/News-Leader)Buy Photo\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Two Springfield pizza kings served up some politics with their pies Tuesday, pressing Rep. Billy Long to support a bill aimed at weakening new calorie-count disclosure rules.\n\nAt an event designed to build support for the legislation, Art Hurteau and Marty Prather, who co-own 13 Domino\u2019s pizza franchises in the Springfield area, hosted Long at their Bolivar restaurant \u2014 showing the Springfield Republican how to make pizza and lobbying him on the proposal.\n\nThe bill would exempt pizzerias from federal rules that will require chain restaurants and certain other food retailers to display calorie information on their in-store menu boards. Congress included the calorie count mandate in the Affordable Care Act, part of a broader effort to tackle the obesity epidemic in the U.S.\n\nPublic health advocates say the rules \u2014 issued last fall and set to take effect in 2016 \u2014 will help consumers make more informed choices about their diet and health. But pizzeria owners said they will be uniquely burdened by the rules because each additional pizza topping changes the total calorie count and most of their customers don\u2019t come into their stores to order.\n\nThe two sides are engaged in a fierce lobbying battle over the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, which would loosen the rules for pizzerias and other food vendors. The bill is pending before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, which held a June hearing on the issue. Long serves on that panel, which could vote on the measure when Congress returns next month.\n\nAt the Bolivar event, Long made a pizza with black olives, ham, and pepperoni and sounded sympathetic to the Domino\u2019s-backed legislation. But Hurteau said Long did not explicitly endorse the measure or agree to co-sponsor it (nor did he ask for the calorie count on his own pie).\n\nIn written responses to questions from the News-Leader, Long said he plans to be \u201cheavily involved\u201d in shaping the bill and will be \u201clooking for common-sense provisions that are feasible and workable.\u201d\n\nHe said he won\u2019t decide how to vote until he sees the final product.\n\nPizza industry advocates say they don\u2019t want to deny information to anyone and are not seeking an exemption from the rules. They want to provide the calorie count data online \u2014 where they say they could give more accurate calorie calculations and where a growing number of their consumers go to order now anyway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like McDonald\u2019s, where you order a set thing and you can easily put the calorie\u201d information on a menu board, said Hurteau. \u201cWe have about 34 million different combinations of possible calorie counts.\u201d\n\nLong echoed that argument in his statement.\n\n\u201cThere is an infinite number of ways to build a pizza, which causes a unique set of concerns in the proper listing of nutritional values,\u201d Long said. \u201cWhatever rule is adopted needs to take that into consideration.\u201d\n\nHurteau said it would cost him and his business partner $5,000 per store to put the calorie ranges on their in-store boards \u2014 and only about one-third of their customers would see it. That\u2019s how many currently come into the store to order pizza, he said, with others ordering by phone or online.\n\n\u201cWe are all in favor of providing this information to our customers,\u201d said Ashley Coneff, Domino\u2019s manager of legislative affairs. \u201cWe just want to do it in a way that makes sense for both the customers and the small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe FDA rules would not require pizza restaurants to list every possible combination; they would need to list standard menu items and provide a reasonable range for the total calories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why pizza restaurants deserve a special exemption from listing calories on their in-store menus,\u201d Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told the subcommittee at the June hearing. The center is a nutrition and food-safety advocacy group.\n\nWootan noted that pizza, along with being \u201can American staple,\u201d is the fifth largest source of calories in Americans\u2019 diets. Pizza vendors should not be able to deny nutrition information to their in-store customers, she said.\n\nThe fate of the bill is unclear. It has bipartisan support and the backing of some GOP leaders.\n\nConeff said the pizza chain is looking at \u201canything and everything\u201d to build support for the bill. Wooing Long is an important part of their legislative strategy, she said, because he sits on the committee with jurisdiction over the bill.\n\n\u201cHe has not co-sponsored (the bill), but that\u2019s our goal,\u201d she said.\n\nLong\u2019s visit to the Bolivar Domino\u2019s was one of several such events organized by the company in recent weeks, including pizza-making photo-ops with lawmakers in Michigan, Texas and Houston.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than one-third of American adults and 17 percent of children are obese. Obese people are more likely to experience heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., noted at the June hearing that the health care costs of obesity are projected to be $344 billion by 2018. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t care about diabetes and all the other related things to obesity, we ought to be caring about what it costs our health care systems to treat obesity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe dismissed the pizza industry\u2019s arguments as \u201csilly\u201d and said the menu-labeling requirements are simple and doable. Besides, she said, consumers want this kind of information.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a woman who doesn\u2019t look at the calories on food that we\u2019re buying,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cWe all should.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Christopher Doering contributed to this story.\n\nContact Deirdre Shesgreen at dshesgreen@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter @dshesgreen.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1EiB8Lk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Local pizza purveyors push Long on menu-labeling bill", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "Local pizza purveyors push Long on menu-labeling bill", "title": "Local pizza purveyors push Long on menu-labeling bill", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/25/local-pizza-purveyors-push-long-menu-labeling-bill/32355809/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local pizza purveyors push Long on menu-labeling bill", "title": "Local pizza purveyors push Long on menu-labeling bill", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e398f6b2a7d459d486074793382a7b49f7cb905/c=656-0-3734-3078&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/25/Springfield/B9318588294Z.1_20150825175914_000_G3CBNOLPM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd573\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo U.S. Rep.
