Martin sure is taking his time to wrap up \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d his sprawling fantasy epic that will span seven novels \u2014 well, it might take even longer. According to his longtime editor, Anne Groell from Penguin Random House, the saga that inspired HBO\u2019s hit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d might span eight books:\n\nI begin to wonder\u2014though 7 is what we currently have under contract. I remember when he called me, years and years back, to confess that his little trilogy was\u2026well\u2026no longer a trilogy. He predicted four books. I said Seven Books for Seven Kingdoms. Then he said five books. I said Seven Books for Seven Kingdoms. Then he went to six. I said\u2026 Well, you get it. Finally, we were on the same page. Seven Books for Seven Kingdoms. Good. Only, as I recently learned while editing THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE (another awesome thing you must buy when it comes out!), there are really technically eight kingdoms, all having to do with who has annexed what when Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros. So, maybe eight books for Seven Kingdoms would be okay. Also, he has promised me that, when he finally wraps this great beast us, I can publish the five page letter outlining the bare bones of the \u201ctrilogy.\u201d\n\nGroell expects the series\u2019s sixth installment, \u201cThe Winds of Winter,\u201d to be out \u201creasonably soon.\u201d \u201cI currently have 168 pages that he submitted back in Feb 2013 in order to receive a contracted payment, but I know more exists, because he keeps talking about chapter he hasn\u2019t yet sent me,\u201d she wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Seven Books for Seven Kingdoms\"...but there are technically eight kingdoms", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Seven Books for Seven Kingdoms\"...but there are technically eight kingdoms", "title": "George R.R.
