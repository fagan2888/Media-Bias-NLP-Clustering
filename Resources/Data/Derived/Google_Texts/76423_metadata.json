As Time Warner Cable News reporter Katie Gibas explains, workers hope their message reaches Albany.\n\nCHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. -- Nurses say there aren\u2019t enough of them to go around, arguing nurse-to-patient ratios should be at least one-to-three, not one-to-eight.\n\nWhile there is a national shortage of health care workers, nurses at Catholic Health say the hospitals are understaffed, jeopardizing patient care.\n\n\u201cI got into it to help people and am I not helping or helping enough? It plays a big role in when you go home, emotional, physical everything, not enough staff is a big issue,\u201d said Kevonna Neely, a certified nursing assistant.\n\nThat\u2019s why health care workers held a vigil Monday outside Sisters of Charity Hospital, St. Joseph Campus, to raise awareness.\n\nThey say those ratios are recommendations by professional organizations and something that is usually negotiated in union contracts.\n\nAdvocates say even though legislation has passed at the local level, requiring certain staffing levels for nursing at hospitals, it\u2019s an issue that needs to be taken up at the state level. That\u2019s why legislation has already been introduced.\n\n\u201cIn California it is. That is the only state that has mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios. You need somebody with a little bit more power, but it\u2019s grassroots. The more communities we get on board, the more legislators, it\u2019s a movement. It\u2019s going to build. You have to start somewhere,\u201d said CWA 1133 President Deborah Arnet.\n\n\u201cI remember one day on my floor, I was working a double and nearly every light on the floor was lit up and I skipped my lunch. I skipped my break, and I knew I wouldn't be able to help everybody. And unfortunately that\u2019s what nurses at Catholic Health face every day. We need to do this. We need to pass a safe standard legislation now,\" said Erie County Legislator Patrick Burke, a Democrat.\n\nCatholic Health released a statement in response to this vigil, saying this vigil does nothing to move forward bargaining on the contract with the union. They say this has been a difficult bargaining process since the beginning four months ago. They claim the union is ignoring some key issues that affect staffing.\n\nThey also say they've hired several nurses, about 30 since the beginning of the year. Catholic Health says the union is calling for an additional 200 nurses, which administrators would cost the hospital an extra $1 million.\n\nCatholic Health's Full Statement:\n\nAfter four months of bargaining and two months since the expiration of its current contract, Catholic Heath presented Communication Workers of America (CWA) 1168 with a final contract offer on October 30 for registered nurses at Sisters of Charity Hospital, St. Joseph Campus. Throughout the course of negotiations, the union has refused to bargain as needed, ignored the hospital\u2019s repeated requests to schedule additional bargaining sessions and failed to respond to many of the hospital\u2019s proposals. These delays have cost each of the nurses hundreds of dollars in lost wage increases to date and led the National Labor Relations Board to issue a complaint against the CWA for failing to bargain in good faith \u2013 a charge the union has failed to resolve.\n\nEarlier this year, union leaders communicated publicly that they were raising issues and allegations to gain political leverage in the contract talks. Among a host of issues, the CWA has made safe staffing a focal point of the negotiations and the subject of a rally being held in front of the hospital today. Despite repeated requests from the hospital, however, the union has not presented any specific concerns or proposed any feasible solutions to what they see as unsafe staffing practices. Since bargaining began on June 29, 18 RNs have been hired at St. Joseph Campus, with 32 new RNs hired year-to-date.\n\nNurse staffing is a national issue and the subject of much debate throughout the healthcare industry. Research shows no direct link between arbitrary government-mandated staffing ratios and improved patient outcomes. Instead, industry experts believe better preparation and education of nurses, use of evidence-based patient care protocols and better communication and empowerment within the nursing team \u2013 all initiatives underway in Catholic Health \u2013 are critical to quality outcomes.\n\nCatholic Health remains committed to working with the CWA on staffing related matters. \u201cWe\u2019ve presented a new staffing proposal, which includes provisions for the hospital and union to work collaboratively to address staffing concerns,\u201d said Mary Dillon, Vice President of Patient Care Services at Sisters Hospital and its St. Joseph Campus. \u201cAs the union knows, hospital staffing is a complex issue affected by a number of factors, including fluctuations in patient volume, a shortage of qualified specialty care nurses and union-imposed provisions in our current contract.\u201d\n\nThe hospital contends that the union continues to ignore contractual language that contributes to staffing related issues, such as excessive absenteeism, unscheduled absences before and after holidays, and cumbersome \u201cbumping\u201d rules that make it difficult to fill vacant positions. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the union will not work with us to resolve these issues, but continues to point the finger at the hospital for things that are often beyond our control,\u201d said David DeLorenzo, RN, Senior Director of Human Resources at Sisters Hospital.\n\nWith its final offer, the hospital proposed a new four-year contract agreement. The offer includes a fair and competitive wage and benefit package, taking into consideration the local economy and the hospital\u2019s ongoing financial losses, which includes nearly $3.3 million through September 2015 and another $39 million in reimbursement cuts over the next 10 years as part of the Affordable Care Act. The union has proposed a one-year contract with wage increases ranging from 7-10%, increases in overtime, and premium pay of $10/hour for working extra shifts in addition to daily time and a half. With the addition of healthcare improvements, the demands from the Union\u2019s proposal would cost the hospital an additional one million dollars for 207 nurses.\n\n\u201cAt a time when most employers in Western New York are giving little or no increases and cutting health benefits, the economic package Catholic Health has on the table is a generous offer,\u201d DeLorenzo added. \u201cFor the CWA to assume the cost increases they are proposing can be borne by the hospital is unrealistic, unfair and jeopardizes the future of St. Joseph Campus.\u201d\n\nDespite very few changes to the current collective bargaining agreement, which expired August 31, the union has been resistant to settle the contract, delaying wage increases to more than 200 nurses. In order to provide the scheduled increases, which include a 3% wage increase upon ratification, the hospital is asking the union to bring its final offer to a vote before November 20.\n\n\u201cThis has been a difficult bargain from the start, with the union delaying negotiations, refusing to respond to many of our proposals, and more importantly, failing to recognize the economic reality of today\u2019s healthcare environment,\u201d DeLorenzo continued. \u201cToday\u2019s rally does nothing to move the bargaining process forward. We would like nothing more than to reach a tentative agreement and give our nurses a chance to vote the merits of the contract offer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "index, follow", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "og": {"site_name": "TWC News", "description": "All the technology in the world can't keep patients safe if there aren\u2019t enough health care workers -- that\u2019s the message Catholic Health nurses tried to get out Monday.
