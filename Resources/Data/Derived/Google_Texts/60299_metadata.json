Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are social and economic conservatives, and products of the tea party revolt. But they represent two entirely different approaches to the gathering and use of power.\n\nEach had a defining moment in their rapid rise. For Rubio, it was the Gang of Eight\u2019s attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Rubio now presents this as the ancient past, but I\u2019m old enough to remember those days of yore in 2013 and 2014. Rubio was determined to make a mark by improving a dangerously broken immigration system and, not coincidentally, by helping the GOP move past a debate it was losing in a spectacularly damaging fashion. (Under the flag of \u201cself-deportation,\u201d Mitt Romney had been recently crushed by 44 points among Latinos.)\n\nThe role played by Rubio as the rightward-most member of the Gang of Eight should actually allay some conservative concerns. Rubio pushed for an enforcement-first approach and a move away from chain migration. His main Democratic partner, Chuck Schumer, was stingy with concessions that might have provided more political cover. Rubio was the last of the hated eight to sign on but decided, in the end, that the bill was an improvement.\n\nThen came the deluge: the Central American unaccompanied minor crisis, a conservative talk-radio rebellion and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s primary loss to a tea party unknown. Rubio was savaged as an example to the others.\n\nBut in his ill-fated immigration reform effort, Rubio demonstrated his approach to building influence: master the policy details, work hard, push in a conservative direction, attempt to persuade even bitter critics and accept incremental progress.\n\nCruz\u2019s main moment on the national stage was the government shutdown of 2013. Cruz and his allies argued: Congress, if it really, really wanted to \u2014 if it only had the guts and principles \u2014 could stop implementation of the Affordable Care Act unilaterally. So funding the government was tantamount to supporting Obamacare.\n\nThere were a few problems with this strategy. First, it could not work. It is not legally possible for Congress to defund an entitlement by blocking discretionary spending. Second, anyone with a smidgen of knowledge about the legislative process knew it could not work \u2014 not that it was very difficult, but that it was impossible \u2014 which made Cruz\u2019s argument deceptive.\n\nWhom did this manufactured standoff benefit? Elements of conservative talk radio and the Internet that gain listeners and drive traffic by baiting the base. Tea party groups that use confrontation as a fundraising ploy. Conservative direct-mail firms that depend on a steady supply of controversy. And Cruz\u2019s email list, which swelled along with his presidential ambitions.\n\nCruz became identified with a tea party establishment (which is also an industry) that acts as a parallel avenue of influence to the Republican Party. Together, Cruz and his tea party allies set out a false construct to make the GOP \u2014 when it could not accomplish an impossibility \u2014 look bad in the eyes of the conservative base. Then tea party groups ran attack ads against Republicans who opposed the shutdown, accusing them of effectively supporting Obamacare.\n\nThis is the main reason, according to my conversations with top Capitol Hill Republicans, that Cruz is so intensely disliked. Those who had been in the trenches fighting Obamacare were accused of selling out by a transparently self-serving latecomer.\n\nBut the problem for Republicans was more than hurt feelings. President Obama found it easy to exploit the chaos Cruz created, making the Republican majority look simultaneously weak and radical. A paralyzed caucus proved unable to offer a positive agenda. Cruz was deceptive in a way that benefited himself and was bound to hurt the conservative cause.\n\nThis is not the first time a senator has grandstanded at the expense of his colleagues. But it is a measure of political character when such grandstanding is elevated to strategy, involves untruths and undermines conservative goals. Cruz has shown the ability to effectively motivate one-third of the Republican base with these niche marketing tactics. He has yet to show a talent for uniting the entire GOP (and a slice of independents) against the Democrats.\n\nRubio\u2019s loss on immigration reform spoke well of his ability to appeal broadly in the general election and govern effectively as president. Cruz\u2019s success in forcing a partial shutdown demonstrated only a talent for self-serving controversy.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Gerson, marco rubio, ted cruz, gang of eight, government shutdown, gop, 2016 presidential race", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Marco Rubio is policy-oriented and a hard worker; Ted Cruz is all about self-serving controversy.", "title": "Rubio and Cruz: A contrast in leadership", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rubio-and-cruz-a-contrast-in-leadership/2016/02/04/7d6688f8-cb65-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/04/Editorial-Opinion/Images/251016472_0-5-1396.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mjgerson"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rubio-and-cruz-a-contrast-in-leadership/2016/02/04/7d6688f8-cb65-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michael Gerson, marco rubio, ted cruz, gang of eight, government shutdown, gop, 2016 presidential race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "7d6688f8-cb65-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Marco Rubio is policy-oriented and a hard worker; Ted Cruz is all about self-serving controversy."}, "article_summary": "Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are social and economic conservatives, and products of the tea party revolt.\nCruz became identified with a tea party establishment (which is also an industry) that acts as a parallel avenue of influence to the Republican Party.\nThis is the main reason, according to my conversations with top Capitol Hill Republicans, that Cruz is so intensely disliked.\nThe role played by Rubio as the rightward-most member of the Gang of Eight should actually allay some conservative concerns.\nTea party groups that use confrontation as a fundraising ploy."}
