Medicare is penalizing about 720 hospitals around the nation for having high rates of avoidable medical mistakes. Nine are in Oregon.

Medical mistakes are things such as bed sores, falls and infections contracted during a hospital stay. For years, they didn’t attract a lot of attention because they benefited a hospital’s bottom line.

But under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government is tracking mistakes and for the first time, reducing Medicare payments to hospitals with higher rates.

Diane Waldo with the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems warns against reading too much into this first report, “One report card does not give you a comprehensive perspective of the organization,” she said.

Oregon hospitals fined this year in the Portland area are Legacy Emanuel, Legacy Good Samaritan, Legacy Mount Hood and Providence St. Vincent.

Mid-Columbia Medical in The Dalles is also being fined along with Providence in Medford, Santiam Memorial, Asante Ashland and Silverton Hospital.
