Denver police are investigating a shooting near a McDonald’s restaurant on the 16th Street Mall that wounded one man.

The man was taken to a hospital, but his injuries are not life-threatening, according to police. His identity was not released.

Police do not have a description of a suspect.

The McDonald’s is located adjacent to The Denver Post building at the intersection of Cleveland Place and the popular mall. Footage from The Post’s security cameras show a dark pickup truck, heading southwest on Cleveland, pull up outside the restaurant at 9:31 p.m. Two men immediately ran up from behind, jumped inside the cab and the driver sped off. The vehicle turned right onto 15th Street.

Police are examining the footage.
