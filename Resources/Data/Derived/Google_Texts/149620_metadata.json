Rand Paul, R-Ky, doubled down on his promise to filibuster the Boehner-Obama budget deal reached by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d Paul told Fox News about the deal, which would allow Congress to spend another $85 billion in the next three years. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything in my power to stop it.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky senator criticized the proposed budget for giving Obama \u201cunlimited borrowing power\u201d at a moment when the federal government borrows \u201ca million dollars a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rotten deal and it stinks,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI haven\u2019t met one Republican outside of Washington who thinks it\u2019s a good idea to give unlimited borrowing power to the president, to bust the budget caps, to spend more on the military, more on domestic spending.\u201d\n\nBrian Darling, a former senior Paul aide, tells The Daily Signal that a filibuster could delay the vote, allowing legislators and grassroots groups \u201cto actually read the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, a filibuster could stretch this process out by two or three days,\u201d he said.\n\nAnnounced Tuesday, the proposed agreement would fund the government by lifting the debt ceiling until March of 2017 while increasing defense and domestic spending by $80 billion, breaking the caps agreed to in 2011.\n\nPaul explained that Congress typically raises the debt limit by \u201ca certain amount\u201d but described the budget deal as letting the president \u201cborrow as much as he wants until March 2017.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s filibuster vow comes as the Nov. 3 debt ceiling deadline looms over Congress.\n\nPaul first floated the filibuster to reporters on Tuesday in Colorado.\n\n\u201cI will do everything I can do stop it. I will filibuster it,\u201d Paul told reporters. \u201cI will not let them condense the time, I will make sure that the country is aware that really both sides appear to have given up right and left.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's talking another filibuster.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He's talking another filibuster.", "title": "Rand Paul on Budget Deal: \u2018I\u2019m Going to Do Everything in My Power to Stop It\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RandPaul1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T14:23:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MivaXW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He's talking another filibuster.", "title": "Rand Paul on Budget Deal: \u2018I\u2019m Going to Do Everything in My Power to Stop It\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RandPaul1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-10-28T13:01:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T14:23:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything in my power to stop it.\u201dThe Kentucky senator criticized the proposed budget for giving Obama \u201cunlimited borrowing power\u201d at a moment when the federal government borrows \u201ca million dollars a minute.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rotten deal and it stinks,\u201d Paul said.\n\u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d Paul told Fox News about the deal, which would allow Congress to spend another $85 billion in the next three years.\nI will filibuster it,\u201d Paul told reporters.\nIn an interview Wednesday, Sen.
