Mosby, will be attacked from many sides for many reasons. But there are two charges that most of her colleagues in other cities have been criticized for that will not hold up for her: benign neglect and tacitly protecting the Police Department.\n\nJust for taking action quickly and forcibly, she should be commended. We will still wait for the facts of the case, but at least this time we are not wondering if the normal cover-up will prevail.\n\nSTEPHEN SCHREIBER\n\nPrinceton, N.J.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs executive directors of the Justice Policy Institute and the Prison Policy Initiative, respectively, whose report was referred to in a May 3 front-page article (\u201cA Hard but Hopeful Home to \u2018a Lot of Freddies\u2019 \u201d), we agree that Freddie Gray, a black man who was arrested and died in police custody in Baltimore, was not an outlier but one of many who experience barriers to success in the Sandtown-Winchester section of the city. There is a dire need to focus on the real challenges facing his neighborhood, and reinvest dollars to build stronger, safer communities.\n\nOur research showed that along with higher unemployment, higher rates of chronic school absence, and a lower life expectancy than the city average, Mr. Gray\u2019s community of Sandtown-Winchester and the Harlem Park neighborhood send the most people to prison of any neighborhoods in the city.\n\nTaxpayers spent $17 million in one year incarcerating people from these communities, and nearly $300 million incarcerating people across Baltimore.\n\nThe numbers underline the need for policy makers to re-evaluate their approach to policing and corrections and begin investing more in what we know will work: a public health approach to substance abuse and real opportunities for decent housing, education and employment.\n\nMARC SCHINDLER\n\nPETER WAGNER\n\nWashington\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nClosing Camden Yards and playing a baseball game without fans is unprecedented. The photo image (Sports pages, April 30) sends a horrible and lasting message of how not to deal with racial issues in the context of allegations of police misconduct.\n\nIt sadly demonstrates the lack of political, civic and Major League Baseball leadership.\n\nExcluding rather than including Baltimore residents from attending and watching the game is not the way to react to the death of Freddie Gray, the legitimate protests and even the wrongful violence.\n\nAddressing the systemic issues like the need for an independent special prosecutor to prosecute police officers accused of misconduct and a public preliminary hearing to determine whether to indict an officer rather than or in addition to the secret grand jury proceedings is the way to proceed if we are truly committed to overcoming this longtime fundamental problem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA residency requirement for police officers with housing subsidies or a tax deduction and better training and increased pay for officers are among other needed reforms.\n\nNORMAN SIEGEL\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is a civil rights lawyer.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nN. D. B. Connolly (\u201cBlack Culture Is Not the Problem,\u201d Op-Ed, May 1) gives us a new illustration of the Rashomon effect.\n\nHe saw Toya Graham\u2019s physical discipline in getting her son away from the riot scene as \u201cblack-on-black violence.\u201d But many see it as an example of parental love and concern, and extreme but necessary action.\n\nALAN SAGNER\n\nPalm Beach Gardens, Fla.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cWhat Black Moms Know,\u201d by Ylonda Gault Caviness (Sunday Review, May 3):\n\nThere may have been valid reasons for \u201ctough love\u201d during slavery and Jim Crow. But now, whipping a child to the point of raising welts is not \u201ctough love\u201d; it\u2019s child abuse. It needs to stop.\n\nLOUIS SCHWARTZ\n\nBrooklyn", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150504172707, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to news and opinion articles about the developments in Baltimore.", "title": "Lessons From Baltimore, and Beyond", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/opinion/lessons-from-baltimore-and-beyond.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003665528"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/opinion/L05baltimore/L05baltimore-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/opinion/lessons-from-baltimore-and-beyond.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003665528", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/opinion/lessons-from-baltimore-and-beyond.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Lessons From Baltimore, and Beyond", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 4, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Police Brutality  Misconduct and Shootings,Baltimore (Md),Mosby  Marilyn J (1980- ),Gray  Freddie (1989-2015)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/opinion/L05baltimore/L05baltimore-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Gray, Freddie (1989-2015)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers respond to news and opinion articles about the developments in Baltimore.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/opinion/L05baltimore/L05baltimore-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Readers respond to news and opinion articles about the developments in Baltimore.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 4, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-05-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Gray, Freddie (1989-2015)", "published": "2015-05-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Baltimore (Md)", "slug": "l05baltimore", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150505023202, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/opinion/lessons-from-baltimore-and-beyond.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/opinion/L05baltimore/L05baltimore-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers respond to news and opinion articles about the developments in Baltimore.", "title": "Lessons From Baltimore, and Beyond"}, "pdate": 20150504, "des": "Police Brutality, Misconduct and Shootings", "articleid": 100000003665528, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Lessons From Baltimore, and Beyond", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f36\"", "article_summary": "PhotoTo the Editor:Re \u201cSix Officers Charged in Baltimore Death\u201d (front page, May 2):The state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City, Marilyn J.
