But Barack Obama has been operating under an even more momentous lie for his entire presidency, from the day he took the oath of office. With that oath, he swore to \u201cfaithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution states the president \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d This is a duty, not a discretionary power. The president must enforce the laws as written. He has no authority to rewrite, amend, suspend, grant waivers to, or decide not to enforce them, but Obama has done all these. John Yoo, a professor of law (U. of Calif., Berkeley), writes:\n\nObama has pursued a dangerous change in powers of his office that disregards the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers between the branches of the federal government.\n\nOn December 3, 2013, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, presented a written testimony to the House Judiciary Committee stating:\n\nWhen a president claims the inherent power of both legislation and enforcement, he becomes a virtual government unto himself. He is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he becomes the very danger that the Constitution was designed to avoid.\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s first acts as president\u2014only a month since he took the oath of office\u2014was to announce his elimination of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada for storing highly radioactive nuclear waste. He flouted decades of scientific study and countermanded the explicit decisions of Congress set forth in duly-enacted laws over many years. In 1982 Congress directed the government to assume responsibility for commercial nuclear waste. In 1987 it singled out Yucca Mountain for evaluation as the repository because of its remote and dry location. After years of research, Congress in 2002 endorsed the Yucca Mountain site.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2009, when Obama put himself above the law by effectively revoking it, $13.5 billion was spent on the program; a five-mile tunnel was bored into the mountain, and hundreds of studies determined the safety of the site for thousands of years. The nuclear industry was also forced to pay $22 billion to the Energy Department for establishment of the repository. Obama is not a scientist, and his decision was not made from a review of the scientific research. But that is not the point, nor is the billions of dollars of taxpayer money that went down the drain.\n\nThe point is that Obama had no authority to violate the law rather than faithfully execute it. He called for more study of the issue, which he had no power to authorize. (More than 20 years of study already was not enough?) He said nuclear power still had a place in the U.S. and his administration would be quick to offer an alternative. With no alternative suggested after almost five years now, it is apparent he had no intention of providing any. In his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama told Nevadans that if elected he would not allow nuclear wastes to be stored in Nevada. End of story. So much for his oath of office and the constitutional requirement he \u201ctake care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\nThat was only Obama\u2019s opening shot against the Constitution. It was followed by a barrage of others.\n\nThe GM and Chrysler bankruptcies of 2009 were directed by a White House task force that upended established bankruptcy procedures. A major element of a bankruptcy is that debtors similarly situated get treated the same, but Obama violated this several ways, always to the benefit of unions. Under terms of the bailouts, Chrysler\u2019s unsecured union benefit trust fund got paid instead of Chrysler\u2019s secured creditors, and GM was required to pay parts manufacturer Delphi\u2019s union retirees $1 billion while its non-union retirees got nothing. What legal authority did Obama have for rewriting almost of a century of bankruptcy law as payback for political support from the United Auto Workers? None.\n\nIn the case of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Obama bypassed the courts and himself decreed the fine for BP. He also unlawfully imposed a moratorium on oil drilling, which drew a rebuke by the court\u2013in vain.\n\nObama decreed \u201crecess\u201d appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by claiming the Senate was not in session, meaning no Senate confirmation was required. However, the Senate was not in recess but merely taking a break within a session. Two federal courts subsequently held these Obama appointments were unconstitutional usurpations and voided them.\n\nProfessor Yoo writes: \u201cObama is the first chief executive since Richard Nixon to ignore a duly-enacted law simply because he disagrees with it.\u201d Obama instructed his justice department to cease enforcement of immigration laws against certain illegal immigrants. By executive order he adopted the very conditions allowing immigrants to remain in the U.S. that Congress rejected by refusing to enact the Dream Act. Before Congress\u2019 rejection, Obama himself had repeatedly stated the Constitution forbade him from taking these actions without Congress.\n\nUnder an executive order by Obama, attorney general Eric Holder ordered U.S. attorneys to stop prosecuting certain drug defendants for crimes that carry mandatory sentences. This is certainly contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court in Kendall v. United States, 1938, which said allowing the president to refuse to enforce laws \u201cwould be clothing the president with a power to control the legislation of Congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.\u201d\n\nThe president replaced congressional requirements for state compliance with the No Child Left Behind Act with new ones crafted by his administration. His administration also provided waivers to 42 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico even though the law contained no provision for waivers.\n\nThough the 1996 Welfare Programs Act required people on welfare to work or prepare for a job in order to receive federal benefits, the Obama administration waived the requirement.\n\nThere is no constitutional authority to order private companies to provide free services, but Obama\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services regulations require private insurers to provide free contraceptives to employees of objecting religious institutions.\n\nAccording to our Constitution, only Congress can declare war. In a 2007 interview Obama said:\n\nThe president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\n\nYet he ordered airstrikes against Libya though that country had neither attacked nor threatened us. Similarly, he asserted he didn\u2019t need Congressional approval for taking military action against Syria because it had used chemical weapons. But Syria neither attacked us nor threatened to do so. Obama claimed his proposed military action against Syria was authorized by the War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 as a result of the Vietnam experience. But the WPR specifically states that it applies to cases where the U.S. is attacked or is threatened with attack.\n\nFederal law requires the president every year to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday in February in order to start the congressional budgeting process. In four years Obama failed to meet this requirement. Congress also failed to adopt a budget for four years, thereby allowing the president great leeway in allocating funds within each department of the executive branch. Before this year, the last thing Congress passed that resembled a budget was a 2009 spending bill that combined nine normal separate bills.\n\nObama violated the law in numerous ways regarding his signature act, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That law specifically says it \u201cshall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.\u201d There is no provision for allowing the president to suspend or delay any part of it. Writing for the U.S. Supreme Court in 1998, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote:\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes a president to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.\n\nSo Obama was violating the law and the Constitution when he changed to 2015 the Obamacare requirement of 2014 as the year employers with 50 full-time workers must offer health-care coverage or pay fines. He also violated the law by suspending the requirement that individuals seeking subsidized health insurance prove their eligibility. He violated again when his Health and Human Services Secretary granted some 1,200 waivers from Obamacare requirements for hundreds of unions, companies and special interests.\n\nIn December 2013 syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote:\n\nHHS . . . asked insurance providers to start covering people on January 1 even if they signed up as late as the day before and even if they hadn\u2019t paid their premiums. And it is \u2018strongly encouraging\u2019 them to pay for the transition for doctor visits not covered in their current plans (if covered in the patient\u2019s previous\u2014canceled\u2014plan). On what authority does a Cabinet secretary tell private companies to pay for services not in their plans and cover people not on their rolls?\n\nIs this America? Krauthammer also notes that the phrase \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d is an offer the insurers can\u2019t refuse:\n\nDisappoint your federal master and he has the power to kick you off the exchanges, where the health insurance business of the future is supposed to be conducted.\n\nAgain, is this America?\n\nObama ignores the separation of powers and fails to respect Congress as an equal branch of government. At one point he famously even refused to negotiate with it. Rather than working with Congress, he told an audience in Denver that his administration will \u201clook every single day to figure out what we can do, without Congress.\u201d\n\nHe treats Congress like a second class department of which he is the superior to determine whether or not it is doing its job. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for Congress to do its job, so where they won\u2019t act, I will,\u201d he said regarding his Jobs Bill. \u201cIt is the belief of this administration . . . that we can\u2019t wait for action on the Hill,\u201d Obama said when signing an executive order regarding the FDA. \u201cIf Congress won\u2019t act soon to protect future generations, I will,\u201d Obama pledged. \u201cI will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take . . . \u201d\n\nHe ought to know\u2014but apparently doesn\u2019t\u2014that the executive branch must work with the Congress, not evade it, and it is not the president\u2019s role to determine what Congress\u2019 job is and whether or not it is doing that job. The Constitution determines what Congress\u2019 job is, and the voters are the ones to determine whether or not their representatives are doing their job.\n\nIn 1868 the House impeached President Andrew Johnson for defying the Tenure of Office Act, which prohibited him from firing anyone in Lincoln\u2019s cabinet. Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton anyway. The Senate failed to convict him by a single vote.\n\nAndrew Johnson committed a single violation of one law. Obama has committed multiple violations of multiple laws. Of course, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, Obama would never be convicted if impeached, and today there is far less concern about a president violating the law than when Johnson was president. It shows the pitiful, lawless, degradation of our once free country resulting from Obama \u201cfundamentally transforming\u201d America.\n\n[First published at American Liberty.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/obama-vs-the-constitution/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ObamaInauguration.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Obama vs. the Constitution"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21f3\"", "article_summary": "Before Congress\u2019 rejection, Obama himself had repeatedly stated the Constitution forbade him from taking these actions without Congress.\nThough the 1996 Welfare Programs Act required people on welfare to work or prepare for a job in order to receive federal benefits, the Obama administration waived the requirement.\nObama violated the law in numerous ways regarding his signature act, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\nObama is not a scientist, and his decision was not made from a review of the scientific research.\nthat we can\u2019t wait for action on the Hill,\u201d Obama said when signing an executive order regarding the FDA."}
