Albert Lea, MN

A Minnesota volunteer firefighter says he's been suspended for flying a confederate flag from an engine during a holiday parade, and that he expects to be asked to resign.



Brian Nielsen drove a Hartland Fire Department truck in the Third of July Parade in the southern Minnesota city of Albert Lea. He flew both the Confederate and American flags from the back - a move that's drawn community and social media criticism.



Nielsen said on Sunday that his fire chief told him he's suspended pending an investigation. He also says he's willing to apologize to the Albert Lea Chamber of Commerce, which organized the parade.



Neilsen says he flew the flag because he's fed up with political correctness and didn't realize how much trouble it would cause.
