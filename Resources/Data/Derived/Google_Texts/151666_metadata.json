(Photo: The Indianapolis Star)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Employers must walk a fine line in warning workers about possible threats from disgruntled former employees like Vester Flanagan, who shot two TV news reporters in Roanoke, Va.\n\nAn employer who has a reasonable expectation that an employee may be violent, yet fails to act, could find itself liable if that employee lashes out, legal experts told The Indianapolis Star. But without such knowledge, there is often little a company can do.\n\nAnd states have different restrictions on what kind of personal information can be released.\n\nAs details continued to emerge following Wednesday\u2019s horrific on-air shooting, employment attorneys told The Star there appeared to be little WDBJ-TV could have done to warn employees about the danger presented by Flanagan, a former on-air personality who went by the name Bryce Williams.\n\nFlanagan reportedly had been fired two years earlier. In an apparent suicide note, he discussed disgruntlement with the station, his admiration for the 2007 Virginia Tech campus shootings and his internal anger building into a \u201chuman powder keg.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that at the time they hired him they knew he was dangerous,\u201d said employment attorney Robert S. Rifken. \u201cI understand that this guy was terminated, but people get fired every day. Just because someone is fired doesn\u2019t make the employer liable if that individual comes back and takes severe action.\u201d\n\nBut that does happen. In 2013, there were 397 workplace homicides and 270 suicides among the 4,405 fatal work injuries in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent data.\n\nSo when does an employer become liable for workplace violence by current or former employees? What steps can and should employers take to protect their workers in those cases?\n\n\u201cJust because someone is fired doesn\u2019t make the employer liable if that individual comes back and takes severe action.\u201d Robert S. Rifken, employment attorney\n\nEach state\u2019s laws can differ. In 2008, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Aris, a company that supplies traffic controllers to contractors, after one of its employees murdered two people.\n\nFrederick M. Baer had several felony convictions for murder on his record when Aris hired him in 2004. He was later found guilty of leaving a job site in Madison County to kill two people, Cory and Jenna Clark.\n\nThe Clarks\u2019 estate sued Aris for negligent hiring. The court, though, essentially ruled Baer\u2019s job did not put him into personal contact with the Clarks or other citizens, that his murder of them had nothing to do with his past convictions or the scope of his job.\n\nThe court, though, cited a 1991 case in which American Painting Co. was found negligent after hiring a man named Robert Hicks.\n\nBefore his hiring, he had committed a burglary, theft and arson at the apartment of a former girlfriend. After being hired, Hicks burglarized and set fire to a customer\u2019s home. The company was found liable in a subsequent lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe company simply ignored (the earlier incident) or failed to do a proper background check,\u201d Rifken said. \u201cThat is not what happened in Virginia, that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d\n\nEmployment attorney John H. Haskins said employers do have options if they have reason to believe an employee is a threat. They can have the employee undergo a psychological evaluation. And since Indiana is an at-will state, they also can simply fire the employee. They can also call the police to warn about a potential danger.\n\nHe said employers who are reporting information about a potential threat can\u2019t disclose a mental condition due to the Americans With Disabilities Act. But they can simply describe an employee\u2019s behavior as threatening.\n\n\u201cYou could make an announcement that has nothing to do with their mental stability,\u201d Haskins said, \u201cbut say that we dismissed this individual because of our concern for safety at the workplace.\u201d\n\nStates also have their own laws. In Indiana, company human resources departments can directly share information with one another about otherwise confidential employee records. While they can\u2019t share a medical diagnosis due to the Americans With Disabilities Act, they can share documented symptoms \u2014 like hallucinations that led to threatening behavior.\n\n\u201cThe only right to privacy that you really have an expectation of is your medical,\u201d Haskins said.\n\nHaskins said workplaces can and do experience violence. Usually, though, he said it\u2019s a fight between two people that results in the firing of one or both. And it usually ends there.\n\nBut, he believes, there\u2019s little a company can do \u2014 even a restraining order or police monitoring \u2014 to stop a determined shooter such as Flanagan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to stop someone who is that determined,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkplace violence is an issue local companies know they may face. Eli Lilly & Co. has a standing threat-assessment team to avoid workplace violence, which includes security, human resources and psychologists.\n\nThe company encourages employees to report threats or threatening situations, either through a web page or a 24-hour hotline.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t solve society\u2019s ills, but we have long-established procedures in place to keep our people and facilities as safe as possible,\u201d said Robert Casey, chief of global security at Lilly.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Esadgo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Employers must walk a fine line in warning workers about possible threats from disgruntled former employees like Vester Flanagan, who shot two TV news reporters in Roanoke, Va.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Employers must walk a fine line in warning workers about possible threats from disgruntled former employees like Vester Flanagan, who shot two TV news reporters in Roanoke, Va.", "title": "What employers can (and can\u2019t) do to protect you", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/08/29/employers-can-protect/71392478/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Employers must walk a fine line in warning workers about possible threats from disgruntled former employees like Vester Flanagan, who shot two TV news reporters in Roanoke, Va.", "title": "What employers can (and can\u2019t) do to protect you", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/177498b7a2070accb6d8b12a32ddc6d002c60d68/c=27-0-427-400&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Robert Casey", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/Robert Casey", "title": "What employers can (and can\u2019t) do to protect you", "author": "Chris Sikich", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae1a6f0d5e97bfdc9f314f0287973a947f03b956/c=53-0-353-400/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7661ffe0e036a9aa3223e4e90a35da8f4468a659/c=27-0-427-400/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a24233b352be1a2b92017328afc7f42b06ede2a/c=34-0-566-400/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63a0217a98ee91da0df52cdfbfa87ef355b01fff/c=0-31-600-370&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-29T17:19:08.860000-04:00", "shorthed": "What employers can (and can\u2019t) do to protect you", "articleid": 71392478, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f1c1ec210180395d28ce6033ae73bbf0f5e456d/c=0-31-600-370/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ae870e9dc3d5f374ff09cc2c0609c4b7abaf1f1/c=60-0-284-400/local/-/media/2015/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635764652127927964--inidc5-6b06nof9kaw1fcfmlc6m-original.jpg-20150504.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "He said employers who are reporting information about a potential threat can\u2019t disclose a mental condition due to the Americans With Disabilities Act.\nWhat steps can and should employers take to protect their workers in those cases?\nJust because someone is fired doesn\u2019t make the employer liable if that individual comes back and takes severe action.\u201dBut that does happen.\nThe company encourages employees to report threats or threatening situations, either through a web page or a 24-hour hotline.\nWhile they can\u2019t share a medical diagnosis due to the Americans With Disabilities Act, they can share documented symptoms \u2014 like hallucinations that led to threatening behavior."}
