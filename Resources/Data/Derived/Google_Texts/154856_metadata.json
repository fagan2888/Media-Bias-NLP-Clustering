Timothy McDonald gripped the pulpit with both hands, locked eyes with the shouting worshippers, and decided to speak the unspeakable.\n\nThe bespectacled Baptist minister was not confessing to a scandalous love affair or the theft of church funds. He brought up another taboo: the millions of poor Americans who won\u2019t get health insurance beginning in January because their states refused to accept Obamacare.\n\nMcDonald cited a New Testament passage in which Jesus gathered the 5,000 and fed them with five loaves and two fishes. Members of his congregation bolted to their feet and yelled, \u201cC\u2019mon preacher\u201d and \u201cYessir\u201d as his voice rose in righteous anger.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about our God is that he doesn\u2019t throw people away,\u201d McDonald told First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta during a recent Sunday service. \u201cThere will be health care for every American. Don\u2019t you worry when they try to cast you aside. Just say I\u2019m a leftover for God and leftovers just taste better the next day!\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s congregation cheered, but his is a voice crying in the wilderness. He\u2019s willing to condemn state leaders whose refusal to accept Obamacare has left nearly 5 million poor Americans without health coverage. But few of the most famous pastors in the Bible Belt will join him.\n\n\n\nJoel Osteen? Bishop T.D. Jakes, and other prominent pastors throughout the South?\n\nLike McDonald, they preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline yet the poor can\u2019t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere. All declined to comment.\n\nWhen people talk about the Affordable Care Act, most focus on the troubled launch of its website. But another complication of the law has received less attention: a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d that will leave nearly 5 million poor Americans without health care, according to a Kaiser Health Foundation study.\n\nLearn more from Kaiser about the coverage gap in states that refused Obamacare\n\nThe coverage gap was created when 25 states refused to accept the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. The people who fall into this gap make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and not enough to qualify for Obamacare subsidies in their state insurance exchanges. If they lived elsewhere, they would probably get insurance. But because they live in a state that refused the new health care law, they likely will remain among the nation\u2019s uninsured poor after Obamacare coverage kicks in come January.\n\nThe coverage gap has been treated as a political issue, but there is a religious irony to the gap that has been ignored.\n\nMost of the people who fall into the coverage gap live in the Bible Belt, a 14-state region in the South stretching from North Carolina to Texas and Florida. The Bible Belt is the most overtly Christian region in the country, filled with megachurches and pastors who are treated like celebrities. All but two Bible Belt states have refused to accept the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nShould Bible Belt pastors say anything publicly about the millions of poor people in their communities stranded by the coverage gap? Is it anti-Christian for state leaders to turn down help for the people Jesus called \u201cthe least of these\"? Or should pastors say nothing publicly about such issues because they are strictly political?\n\nCNN's Sanjay Gupta explains who falls into the coverage gap\n\nWho speaks for the poor in the coverage gap?\n\nWhen these questions were sent to many of the most popular pastors in the Bible Belt, they hit a wall of silence. Virtually no prominent pastor wanted to talk about the uninsured poor in their midst.\n\nJoel Osteen, pastor of the largest church in the nation, declined to be interviewed about the subject. So did Bishop T.D. Jakes. Their megachurches are both in Texas, the state with the nation\u2019s highest number of people without health insurance.\n\nMax Lucado, the best-selling Christian author who is a minister at a church in Texas, declined to speak; Charles Stanley, the Southern Baptist pastor in Georgia whose In Touch Ministries reaches millions around the globe, declined to speak; Ed Young Sr. and Ed Young Jr., a father and son in Texas who pastor two of the fastest-growing churches in the nation, also declined to speak.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThe silence is not hard to understand. Obamacare is a polarizing political issue in the Bible Belt. A pastor who publicly weighs in on the subject could divide his or her congregation or risk their job. And some prominent pastors like Osteen are popular in part because they do not alienate fans by taking political stands.\n\nThe Rev. Phil Wages, senior pastor Winterville First Baptist Church in Georgia and a blogger, was one of the few Bible Belt ministers willing to speak on the subject.\n\nHe says he won\u2019t preach about the coverage gap created by the state\u2019s rejection of the Medicaid expansion because he has what he calls theological differences with the thrust of the new health care law.\n\nWages says the Bible teaches that the care of orphans, widows and the sick are given to the church, not to the government. Early Christians were the first to create hospitals, orphanages and hospices.\n\n\u201cI have an issue with the government coming in to get money through me - through taxes - to take care of people, when my argument is that I should be free to give to charities or to my church in order to take care of the sick and destitute,\u201d he says.\n\nWages says he has no doubt that lack of health insurance is a monumental problem, and that many people are poor because of circumstances beyond their control. Yet there is no New Testament example of Jesus trying to shape public policy on behalf of the poor.\n\n\u201cI do not see any biblical precedent where Jesus ever went to Herod or Pilate and said you should be taking care of the poor,\u201d Wages says. \u201cJesus told his disciples to take care of the poor and the apostles said the same thing to the early church.\u201d\n\n\n\nWages\u2019 position is impractical and unbiblical, says Ronald Sider, a longtime advocate for the poor and author of \u201cThe Scandal of Evangelical Politics.\"\n\nChurches and charities don\u2019t have enough resources to take care of an estimated 48 million Americans who don\u2019t have health care. The Bible is filled with examples of God's fury over economic oppression of the poor, which Christians should regard as scandalous, he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are not sharing God\u2019s concern for the poor, it raises huge questions about whether you are a Christian at all,\u201d he says about pastors who say nothing about the uninsured poor.\n\n\u201cAs God\u2019s spokespersons, you ought to be talking about God\u2019s concern for the poor as much as God. In the richest nation in world history, it\u2019s contradictory to have millions without health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt absolutely stinks\u201d\n\nThe coverage gap may inspire a religious debate, but for its victims the issue is raw and personal.\n\nA recent New York Times article about the coverage gap revealed that many of its victims are the working poor: cooks, cashiers, sales clerks and waitresses.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are working people but they haven\u2019t been able to afford health insurance or their employers don\u2019t offer it and they\u2019re stuck,\u201d says Andy Miller, editor of Georgia Health News, a nonprofit news organization that covers health news in the state. \u201cA lot of these folks have chronic health conditions.\u201d\n\nThey are people like Shelley \u201cMyra\u201d Mitchell, a single mom with four children who makes $9 an hour working at a Chick-fil-A in Georgia. She makes $18,000 a year \u2013 too much for Georgia\u2019s existing Medicaid program, but not enough to qualify for subsidies to sign up for Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplace in Georgia.\n\nMitchell\u2019s voice grew edgy with frustration when asked to describe her health needs. She rang up about $20,000 in emergency room bills because she has no health insurance. She can\u2019t afford to get pap smears, go to the dentist or get surgery for a two-year-old hernia. She can\u2019t take medication for her depression and anxiety because she can\u2019t afford it.\n\nShe thought she could get help under Obamacare but recently learned she can\u2019t because Georgia did not accept the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIt stinks,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this hernia for two years now, and I can\u2019t get anyone to help me because I don\u2019t have health insurance. It absolutely stinks.\u201d\n\nWhy pastors should stay silent about the coverage gap\n\nMitchell\u2019s plight may stink. But at what point should a pastor go public on such a complex issue, and what could he or she actually say?\n\nTwo prominent evangelical pastors openly wrestled with those questions.\n\nAndy Stanley is one of the most popular evangelical pastors in the nation. He is the senior pastor of North Point Community Church in Alpharetta, Georgia, a megachurch with at least 33,000 members. He is also the author of the forthcoming book \u201cHow to be Rich,\u201d which urges Christians to be \"rich in good deeds\" instead of wealth. His church recently announced that it donated $5.2 million to Atlanta charities and provided another 34,000 volunteer hours.\n\nStanley says the coverage gap disturbs him. The church cannot handle the needs of millions of uninsured people alone and should quit taking shots at government involvement, he says. But he adds that it\u2019s not anti-Christian for political leaders in states like Georgia to turn down the Medicaid expansion for the poor.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to know how concerned someone is for the poor ask them what percentage of their personal money they give to organizations that help the poor,\u201d he says. \u201cAsk them how much time they give to organizations that help the poor.\u201d\n\nStanley says it would be difficult for any pastor to talk about the Medicaid expansion without addressing the entire law.\n\n\u201cI tried to imagine a scenario where I urged people to write our governor encouraging him to reconsider his decision regarding the expansion of Medicaid for the poor,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I imagined that, I got the feeling that by the time I finished explaining the issue, people\u2019s eyes would be glazed over.\u201d\n\nPastors who don't preach one way or the other on Medicaid expansion aren't callous or apathetic, says Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. They may be suspicious of a bigger government and skeptical of whether this move will solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Bible calls on Christians to answer the cries of the poor,\u201d he says. \u201cAll Christians must do that. The question of the Medicaid expansion is a question of how we do that. I don\u2019t hear many people arguing that we shouldn\u2019t care about the plight of the poor when it comes to medical care. The question is a genuine debate about the role of the state.\u201d\n\nMoore says some people have a \u201cutopian view\u201d of what state power can accomplish.\n\n\u201cGovernment programs sometimes encourage dependency, unintentionally break down family structures, and become unsustainable financially,\u201d Moore says.\n\nBob Coy, pastor of Calvary Chapel megachurch in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, wondered aloud about what he could, and should, say.\n\nFlorida, which has the second highest number of people without health insurance behind Texas, has not accepted the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nCoy says he hasn\u2019t spoken publicly about poor people missing health coverage in Florida. But he has called the governor to get more information.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an activist guy. I don\u2019t tell the government what to do. I am a church guy. I teach the Bible.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care for the poor, though, Coy says. He grew up in a poor family that couldn\u2019t afford to go to the dentist. His church also spends a large percentage of its budget on serving the poor.\n\nCoy says he is suspicious of large-scale programs that are publicly funded because they are often abused.\n\n\u201cOne side of our society is saying, 'We need this,' while on the other side is saying, 'This isn\u2019t fair and isn\u2019t going to work.\u2019 So how should a pastor, who has a heart to help people, respond?\u201d\n\nWhy pastors should speak out\n\nThe Rev. Shane Stanford\u2019s answer to Coy is simple: Talk about justice for the poor like Jesus did.\n\nStanford is the senior pastor of Christ United Methodist Church in Memphis and author of \u201cFive Stones: Conquering Your Giants.\u201d\n\nHe is also HIV-positive. He was born a hemophiliac and contracted the virus when he was 16 during treatment for his illness.\n\nStanford says he publicly speaks out about the millions of Americans stranded without health coverage because he knows how it feels. Once, after heart surgery, he was getting a transfusion when a nurse came into the room and pulled the needle out of his arm because she said he had maxed out his health insurance coverage.\n\nHe says standing up for people in the coverage gap is a matter of justice.\n\n\u201cSometimes pastors have to tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nStanford ignores fellow pastors who counsel him to be silent about his state and others that refused to accept the Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThey say you have to be careful talking about political issues,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I look at their lives, part of me thinks they never had that needle yanked out of their arm.\u201d\n\nConservative pastors who urge their colleagues to avoid politics are hypocrites, says James Cone, a prominent theologian who has spent much of his career writing books condemning white churches for what he says is their indifference to social justice.\n\n\u201cWhen their own interests are involved, they are very much involved in politics,\u201d Cone says. \u201cSame-sex marriage and abortion \u2013 they have no trouble politically opposing them.\u201d\n\nCone, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York, says a nation is defined by how it treats its most vulnerable members. But there is an entrenched hostility to poor people in America that goes unchallenged by some white, conservative Christians, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen poor people get food stamps, they get mad,\u201d Cone says. \u201cWhen the rich and corporations get tax breaks and pay no taxes, they don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nMcDonald, the pastor who spoke out on behalf of poor people from his Atlanta church, says Jesus provided universal health care. The Gospels are filled with accounts of Jesus healing marginalized people.\n\n\u201cHe did it for free,\u201d McDonald says of Jesus\u2019 healing. \u201cThe reason the crowds gathered around Jesus primarily was for healing. People want wholeness.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the gap between Bible Belt pastors who say nothing about the uninsured poor and those who do is also rooted in history.\n\nConservative Christians have traditionally emphasized providing charity to the poor - soup kitchens, donations to impoverished people in undeveloped countries - while progressive Christians have blended charity with calls for public policy changes that help the poor.\n\nThe distinction between both approaches was distilled by a memorable quote from the late Brazilian Roman Catholic Bishop Dom Helder Camara, who said: \"When I feed the poor they call me a saint. When I ask why so many people are poor they call me a communist.\"\n\nThat may be changing as a new generation of evangelicals rise in the Bible Belt and elsewhere. One minister who speaks to them is the Rev. Timothy Keller, a conservative Christian author who pastors a megachurch in New York.\n\nKeller is the author of \u201cGenerous Justice: How God\u2019s Grace Makes Us Just,\u201d a popular book that argues that evangelicals should do more than preach personal salvation; they must \u201cspeak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves.\u201d He is a role model for many younger evangelicals.\n\n\u201cGod loves and defends those with the least economic and social power, and so should we. That is what it means to \u2018do justice.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n\nCNN.com recently contacted Keller to see if he would talk about \"Generous Justice\" and how it might apply to health care and the poor. Did he think pastors in Bible Belt states should say anything publicly on behalf of poor people being denied basic medical insurance? His publicist said she would contact Keller with the request.\n\nSeveral days later, she returned with Keller\u2019s answer.\n\nHe had no comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By John Blake, CNN (CNN)\u00a0-- The Rev.
