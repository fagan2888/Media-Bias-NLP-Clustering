To prove they are together and intend to marry, the couple have to have met at least once in the previous two years and show photographs or other evidence, like a wedding invitation or personal messages.\n\nAfter the foreigner receives the visa, the couple must marry within 90 days. After that period, the visa expires and cannot be renewed.\n\nOnce married, the visa-holder can apply for permanent residence.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year\u2014the most recent data available\u201436,627 people applied for K-1 visas, with 3,727 requests rejected.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, according to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, there were 262,162 fianc\u00e9 visas granted, about 29,000 per year.\n\nPakistan, where Malik was born, accounted for 272 K-1 visas in 2013. Saudi Arabia, where Malik later moved, accounted for 21 K-1 visas that year.\n\nSo far, Congress seems content with the program, but lawmakers plan to review it as part of a wider investigation of the various ways foreigners can enter the U.S.\n\nThe House has already passed bills limiting the Syrian refugee resettlement program and toughening the visa waiver program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel here without a visa.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told The Daily Signal that lawmakers are approaching the fianc\u00e9 visa program differently from how they did the Syrian refugee issue, which was addressed quickly after the Paris terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us addressing the fianc\u00e9 visa program as much,\u201d Meadows, R-N.C., said. \u201cI do believe we need to take seriously this one incident and to certainly not turn a blind eye to the risks. But you are dealing with one situation where you have a U.S. citizen and the potential of making things difficult on their soon-to-be wife or husband, and the other situation [the refugee program] that is totally discretionary and that\u2019s based on administration policy or State Department policy\u2014one that is thrust upon us.\u201d\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Malik went through two rounds of criminal and national security checks to earn her fianc\u00e9 visa and, later, a resident green card to live in the U.S.\n\nThe checks flagged no negative information, The Times reported.\n\nMalik was granted the K-1 visa in Pakistan in July 2014 and traveled to the U.S. that month.\n\nThe AP reported that Malik married her husband, Syed Farook, an American citizen and her partner in the shooting, in August 2014, within the 90-day time limit.\n\nMalik received a conditional green card in July 2015, according to the Times. After two years, she would have had to apply for a regular green card, proving the couple remained married.\n\nJames Comey, the FBI director, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, said, \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to know what, if anything, might have been missed in the screening process.\u201d\n\nFor at least one senator known to be tough on immigration, Malik\u2019s ability to enter the country without suspicion is enough to warrant change to the fianc\u00e9 visa program.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely need to investigate and reform the fianc\u00e9 visa,\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt is clearly vulnerable to infiltration and fraud and provides an obvious route for jihadists and would-be jihadists to entry the country. The problem of sham marriages is already significant and overlooked, but the risks are compounded further by the fianc\u00e9 visa program.\u201d\n\nNowrasteh believes that policy-makers need to put Malik\u2019s situation in perspective.\n\n\u201cThe K-1 visa is a fraction of a percent of the people coming into the U.S. on visas,\u201d Nowrasteh said. \u201cAnd to the best of my knowledge, this is the first one [K-1 recipient] to be involved with terrorism. I\u2019d say that is a pretty good track record.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A visa that facilitates marriage is under scrutiny after one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack used the visa to enter the U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A visa that facilitates marriage is under scrutiny after one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack used the visa to enter the U.S.", "title": "Is the 'Fianc\u00e9 Visa' a Security Risk After Bernardino?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Fiance-visa.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-11T13:54:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RHifpl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A visa that facilitates marriage is under scrutiny after one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack used the visa to enter the U.S.", "title": "Is the 'Fianc\u00e9 Visa' a Security Risk After Bernardino?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Fiance-visa.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-12-10T16:50:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T13:54:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "San Bernardino, terrorist attack, fianc\u00e9 visa, ISIS, Department of Homeland Security, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tashfeen Malik, Syed Farook, House Freedom Caucus"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e4d\"", "article_summary": "In a time of anxiety over border security, the so-called fianc\u00e9 visa is one avenue into the United States that has generated little attention.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us addressing the fianc\u00e9 visa program as much,\u201d Meadows, R-N.C., said.\n\u201cWe absolutely need to investigate and reform the fianc\u00e9 visa,\u201d Sen.
