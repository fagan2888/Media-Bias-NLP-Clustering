ATLANTA, Ga. – Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker discussed his platform of “reform, growth and safety” during a speech to conservative activists Saturday.

Walker, speaking at the RedState Gathering along with several other Republican presidential candidates, said that the Iranian nuclear agreement presents a great risk to the national security of the United States.

“Iran is not a place we should be doing business with,” Walker said.

He said should he become president, he will immediately “terminate” the deal with Iran and reinstate the economic sanctions against Tehran.

“The greatest threat to future generations is radical Islamic terrorism,” Walker said.

Walker reiterated his opposition to Common Core, Obamacare and federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

He advocated “lowering the tax burden” for individuals and employers.

He said he supports an “all of the above” approach to energy.

“We are an energy-rich country, we should start acting like it,” Walker said.

He also called for the next president to “speak out” about China’s human rights record.
