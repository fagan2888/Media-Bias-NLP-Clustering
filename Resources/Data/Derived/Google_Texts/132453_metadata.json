(PAYX) isn\u2019t a company that\u2019s typically on the tongues of stock analysts and investors, but it sure is this year. PAYX is beating the pants off the market \u2014 and competitor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) \u2014 with 14% gains, and is trading at decade-plus highs.\n\nBut better yet for new money: This payroll and human resources provider looks set to be among 2016\u2019s most exciting stocks.\n\nInvestors can thank a strengthening job market, solid fundamentals and management\u2019s innovative expansion efforts that include both acquisitions and new service offerings.\n\nThe November jobs report, which saw payrolls expand at a promising pace, implies general improvement in the state of the U.S. economy. That steady job growth \u2014 particularly for small- and medium-sized companies \u2013has helped PAYX remain at the top of the payroll services industry. A strengthening job market means more employers will require payroll processing services, as well as human resources assistance.\n\nPlus, confusion and complications involving Obamacare have been a boon for Paychex stock.\n\n2015 marked the first year in which non-payroll services accounted for more than $1 billion in revenue, as an increasing number of PAYX clients require assistance navigating the new, often-complicated health insurance reforms.\n\nPaychex Continues to Expand Through Acquisitions\n\nLast week, PAYX announced its acquisition of Advance Partners, an Ohio-based human resources solutions provider focused on temporary staffing companies. Paychex CEO Martin Mucci stated, \u201cGiven Paychex\u2019s extensive product suite, financial strength, and access to capital, we can help expand Advance Partners\u2019 product offering and accelerate client growth.\u201d\n\nCombining the resources and client bases of Paychex and Advance Partners will allow PAYX to provide a wider array of products and services to the 7,500 temporary staffing companies currently working with Advance Partners. Plus, Paychex can further capitalize on this acquisition through the introduction and upselling of newly designed services to Advance Partners\u2019 customers. Specifically, small business lending \u2014 which accounts for roughly half of Advance Partners\u2019 revenue \u2014 offers significant potential, thanks to synergy with PAYX current services.\n\nWhile PAYX has some stiff competition from ADP, Paychex\u2019s top line has been growing more quickly. Further, in a survey conducted by BestPayrollServices.com, PAYX was ranked No. 2 (above No. 3-ranked ADP) on the list of the best services providers in the industry for the month of December.\n\nClearly, management has been successful in its efforts to acquire new business and deliver services clients actually want.\n\nPaychex Stock Fundamentals\n\nAs far as fundamentals are concerned \u2026 well, growth is there. Recently, PAYX reported that it grew earnings to 52 cents per share this quarter, up from 47 cents in the year-ago period, and management expects EPS growth of 7.84% for 2016.\n\nAdditionally, Paychex carries no debt (and hasn\u2019t for the past decade), and has performed better than the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, \u201chighlighting that financial engineering by adding leverage isn\u2019t necessarily needed for solid returns,\u201d according to CNBC. And considering PAYX\u2019s ability to generate cash, not having debt service offers substantial opportunity for further acquisitions, stock buybacks and/or dividend increases.\n\nSpeaking of which, Paychex stock currently yields more than 3% on a payout that has been elevated by 20% since the beginning of 2014.\n\nPaychex is scheduled to report earnings again on Dec. 22, so obviously any significant changes from what we know right now would merit another look at PAYX.\n\nBut for now, PAYX looks like an unsexy but solid addition to just about any portfolio in 2016.\n\nAs of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace", "article_metadata": {"description": "PAYX stock has solid potential for growth in 2016 as Paychex management capitalizes on a recent acquisition and a stronger jobs market.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "PAYX stock has solid potential for growth in 2016 as Paychex management capitalizes on a recent acquisition and a stronger jobs market.", "title": "Why Paychex (PAYX) Stock Should Be in Every Investor's Portfolio", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Checkbook.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-18T13:29:44-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2015/12/paychex-payx-stock-should-be-in-your-portfolio/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "PAYX stock has solid potential for growth in 2016 as Paychex management capitalizes on a recent acquisition and a stronger jobs market.", "creator": "@TwistedNonsense", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Checkbook.jpg", "title": "Why Paychex (PAYX) Stock Should Be in Every Investor's Portfolio", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Stocks to Buy", "published_time": "2015-12-21T06:05:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T13:29:44-04:00", "author": "greggambone"}, "keywords": "markets, Paychex, PAYX, PAYX stock,", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "pubdate": 20151221, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "markets, paychex, payx, payx stock"}, "article_summary": "Paychex, Inc.
