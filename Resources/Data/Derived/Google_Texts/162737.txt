The inpatient campus at Coldstream Park on Newtown Pike includes a main hospital and four separate, stand-alone units that state officials said at the time the campus opened would be used as step-down or transitional units for patients who needed additional support after they left the hospital. Nearly 18 months later, only two of those units are in use.
