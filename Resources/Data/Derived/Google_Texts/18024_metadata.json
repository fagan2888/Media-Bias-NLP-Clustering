At best, it looked like the Bulldogs were going into overtime. At worst, Coastal Carolina would pull out an FCS playoff win in regulation.\n\nBut somebody on the Bulldogs\u2019 sideline saw it differently.\n\n\u201cGeneral Rosa was there on the sideline,\u201d Goins said of Citadel president Lt. Gen. John Rosa. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Hey, you are gonna have to kick another one.\u2019 And I believed him.\u201d\n\nRosa, a former Citadel quarterback, was right. Goins got another chance on the game\u2019s final play, and came through with a 43-yard field goal as time expired. The kick lifted the 18th-ranked Bulldogs to a 41-38 win over No. 9 Coastal Carolina before a stunned crowd of 6,751 at Brooks Stadium, and set off a wild celebration among the Bulldogs on the Chants\u2019 teal-colored field.\n\nThe Citadel, 9-3 after its first FCS playoff win since 1992, advances to a rematch next Saturday against No. 8 seed Charleston Southern. After three straight losses to the Buccaneers \u2014 including a painful 33-20 defeat to the broom-wielding Bucs on Sept. 26 at Johnson Hagood Stadium \u2014 The Citadel is eager for a rematch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely pretty excited about this one,\u201d said Citadel quarterback Dominique Allen, who ran for 174 yards and two touchdowns against Coastal (9-3). \u201cWe let that one get away from us in the second half, so I\u2019m pretty happy we get another shot at them.\u201d\n\nThe Citadel has won seven of eight games since that loss to Charleston Southern, including last week\u2019s 23-22 upset of South Carolina.\n\nThe Bulldogs piled up 524 rushing yards on Saturday, the most ever given up by Coastal Carolina. Three Citadel backs ran for at least 100 yards, with fullback Tyler Renew rushing for 129 yards and a TD and Cam Jackson getting 113 yards and a score. It was the first time since 2012 that The Citadel had three 100-yard rushers in one game, and Vinny Miller almost made it four \u2014 he finished with 93 yards.\n\n\u201cThey just kept coming at us,\u201d said Coastal defensive end Calvin Hollenhurst of the Bulldogs. \u201cThey are relentless as a team.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs\u2019 defense was equally relentless, even though the Chanticleers piled up 577 yards, with Summerville product De\u2019Angelo Henderson rushing for 101 yards and a score and catching three passes for 60 yards and another TD.\n\nThe Citadel forced four turnovers, including two huge takeaways in the second half. Cornerback Shy Phillips\u2019 32-yard interception return for a TD, forced by pressure from end Joe Crochet, gave The Citadel a 38-28 lead with 13:06 to play.\n\nAnd after Coastal Carolina rallied to tie the score at 38-38 \u2014 and after Goins\u2019 47-yard field goal try was blocked by Marcus Williamson with 1:28 left \u2014 linebacker Tevin Floyd came up with the play of the game.\n\nOn third and 7 from the Coastal 47, Floyd sacked Chants quarterback Alex Ross and forced a fumble, recovered at the Coastal 41 by Mitchell Jeter.\n\nThree runs and two timeouts later, Goins booted the game-winner from the right hash.\n\n\u201cThey never doubted each other and never hung their heads,\u201d Citadel coach Mike Houston said of his defense. \u201cAnd then they came up with two big turnovers, so I\u2019m proud of them.\u201d\n\nRoss, a senior playing in his final game for Coastal, hit 21 of 31 passes for 415 yards and three touchdowns, but was picked off twice. Kailik Williams\u2019 interception on the third play of the game set up The Citadel\u2019s first score.\n\n\u201cWe let one slip away tonight, and that\u2019s on me,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI had the pick-six, turnovers. That\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nAnd now, the Bulldogs are one of 16 teams left with a shot at the FCS national championship. Sweet 16, indeed.\n\n\u201cJust time after time, a gutsy comeback from our kids,\u201d Houston said. \u201cThey never gave up, they stuck together and kept believing in each other. And we found a way in the end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Citadel wins on last-second field goal, sets up rematch with Charleston Southern, Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nLocal Sports, FCS playoffs,Mike Houston,The Citadel", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CONWAY \u2014 His first attempt at a game-winning field goal blocked with just 88 seconds left in the game, The Citadel\u2019s Eric Goins trotted slowly off the field.
