PARIS — Roger Federer’s 4-year-old twins, Myla and Riva, hung in there for about 20 minutes Sunday in his guest box at Court Philippe Chatrier, long enough to see Daddy take control of his French Open match.

Federer swept the last five games of the opening set, won 36-of-43 service points in the first two sets and eliminated 87th-ranked Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the second round at Roland Garros.

Sunday’s win was the 2009 champion’s 59th in a French Open match, tying Federer with Rafael Nadal for the most in history. Nadal, who has won eight titles in Paris, gets an opportunity to nudge ahead Monday when he plays his first-round match against American wild-card entry Robby Ginepri.

“Rafa is the favorite” to win this tournament, Federer proclaimed, saying Novak Djokovic comes next in the pecking order, “and then the rest (of us); it’s very clear.”

When Federer departed the main stadium, Serena Williams entered and had about the same amount of difficulty, beating 130th-ranked French wild-card entry Alize Lim 6-2, 6-1. Across the grounds at Court Suzanne Lenglen, Venus Williams defeated 17-year-old Belinda Bencic of Switzerland 6-4, 6-1.

Venus, whose 34th birthday is next month, turned professional about 2½ years before Bencic was born. No longer are there teens at the top — Venus, for example, was 17 when she reached her first Grand Slam final; younger sister Serena was that age when she won her first major championship.

Indeed, the 2014 French Open women’s field has more than twice as many players age 30 or older (17) as teens (eight).

“Young folks today, eh?” Venus said. “I’m just trying to hopefully stay alive myself as an older player.”
