Mesquite’s Christmas in the Park ended 15 minutes early Saturday night after teenagers caused a disturbance, a city spokesman said.

“Large groups of teens” were running through the crowds and blocking some entertainment areas at Westlake Park during the annual event, which had been scheduled to end at 9 p.m., said the spokesman, Wayne Larson.

“Simply teens acting a little crazy,” he said. “Due to the large crowd we had at our event, and the success of it, police and Parks and Recreation decided to shut down.”

No injuries were reported.

Six Dallas teenagers were detained — three for creating a disturbance and three for allegedly using drugs, Larson said. One of the teenagers was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia.

In another part of the park, an officer fired a Taser at someone who was fighting, Larson said. The Taser missed and the person escaped.

Larson said that except for the disturbance, the three-day event ended without safety or security problems. The event typically draws 10,000 and 15,000 people.

Last week, after gunfire was reported at an apartment complex about a quarter-mile from the park, the city tightened security at Christmas in the Park. No one was injured in the shooting.
