What identities do I have that are different from my family?\u201d\n\nLucas-Hubbard said, using the most popular option on a drop-down menu the first story in the category was 10,000 Dresses by Marcus Ewert. Here is Amazon\u2019s description of the book.\n\nEvery night, Bailey dreams about magical dresses: dresses made of crystals and rainbows, dresses made of flowers, dresses made of windows. \u2026 Unfortunately, when Bailey\u2019s awake, no one wants to hear about these beautiful dreams. Quite the contrary. \u201cYou\u2019re a BOY!\u201d Mother and Father tell Bailey. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about dresses at all.\u201d Then Bailey meets Laurel, an older girl who is touched and inspired by Bailey\u2019s imagination and courage. In friendship, the two of them begin making dresses together. And Bailey\u2019s dreams come true! This gorgeous picture book\u2013a modern fairy tale about becoming the person you feel you are inside\u2014will delight people of all ages.\n\n\u201cChildren are being indoctrinated into the LGBT agenda without ever realizing what is going on and parents may never know about this type of reading/activity going on in the classroom,\u201d said Lucas-Hubbard. \u201cThis program/curriculum is about indoctrinating our children and reducing emphasis on family and solid moral values by emphasizing tolerance for all despite societal norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis SPLC-sponsored program incorporates the goals of Common Core with the goals of those who want to change our traditional American culture and accomplish fundamental change in America,\u201d concluded Lucas-Hubbard.\n\nEarlier this year, The Southern Poverty Law Center came under public scrutiny when adding GOP Presidential Candidate, Dr. Ben Carson, to its \u201cextremist list.\u201d The SPLC initially named his pro-traditional marriage stance, opposition to ObamaCare, and support for a flat tax as reasons for placing him on the list alongside members of the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nEven just a few months ago, this \u201cCivil Rights\u201d group published the \u201cWomen Against Islam\u201d list, targeting women who are outspoken against Islamic extremism.\n\nThanks for reading!
