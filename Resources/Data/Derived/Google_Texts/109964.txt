Oldham County students could start their summer break nearly a week earlier than expected, if the Oldham County Board of Education approves a proposal to amend the school calendar during Monday’s meeting.

But, moving the last day of school to June 1 would require class to be in session during Oaks Day on May 6, a day most schools take off.

Oldham County Schools canceled school six times this academic year because of snow, according to a board document.

Kids are currently scheduled to dismiss for summer break on June 7, but because the board previously added five minutes to the elementary school day – and middle and high schools in Oldham County already exceed the minimum instructional hours required by the state – the board had the option to forgo three makeup days, according to document.

Although Interim Superintendent Rick McHargue is slated to recommend making June 1 the last day of school, even if that means holding class on Oaks Day, a second option is also on the table: keeping Oaks Day a school-free day and making June 2, a Thursday, the last day of class.

According to the agenda, moving the last day of school to June 1 would require teachers to work three days without students to fulfill contract requirements and would result in a loss of revenue for the food services department to the tune of $63,725, since staff are required to work a certain number of days even if students aren't in school.

The vote is scheduled to take place during the board’s second session of the evening, which is open to the public and will likely start around 6 p.m. The meeting will take place at Oldham County High School, 1150 N. Kentucky 393 in La Grange.

A full agenda can be found on the district's website.
