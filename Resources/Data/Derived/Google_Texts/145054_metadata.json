Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a bill Wednesday to lift federal prohibitions on marijuana and throw the decision on legalizing the drug squarely into the hands of the states.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan would strike marijuana from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s list of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d substances, which currently classifies weed alongside drugs such as heroin, ecstasy, and LSD.\n\nThe legislation also would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act, the U.S. government\u2019s central drug control law, giving states the authority to legalize and regulate marijuana without federal interference\u2013in the same way states govern alcohol and tobacco sales.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use,\u201d Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, said at George Mason University last week. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong. That has got to change.\u201d\n\nSanders underscored the fact that 2.2 million people are imprisoned for various offenses across the nation, which he said costs taxpayers roughly $80 billion a year. Changes to drug laws could help alleviate the situation, he said.\n\n\u201cThe time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government\u2019s list of outlawed drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nMarijuana advocacy groups hailed the bill, the first in the Senate aiming to end the federal prohibition, as a positive step.\n\n\u201cThe science is clear that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol, and that should be reflected in our nation\u2019s marijuana policy,\u201d Mason Tvert, director of communications at the Marijuana Policy Project, told Huffington Post. \u201cSenator Sanders is simply proposing that we treat marijuana similarly to how we treat alcohol at the federal level, leaving most of the details to the states. It is a commonsense proposal that is long overdue in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBut Cully Stimson, manager of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s national security law program, disputed that the drug is as safe as advocates claim.\n\n\u201cSound science should drive the issue of whether marijuana should be delisted as a Schedule I controlled substance, and sound science is clear: Marijuana is a dangerous, addictive drug,\u201d Stimson told The Daily Signal.\n\nStimson said the American Medical Association and the American Lung Association, along with countless medical and mental health experts, oppose removing the drug from the DEA\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous\u201d Schedule I category because a series of studies concluded marijuana is harmful and addictive.\n\nChuck Rosenberg, acting administrator of the DEA, said Wednesday that smoking marijuana for medicinal purposes is \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal\u2014because it\u2019s not,\u201d Rosenberg told reporters. \u201cWe can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don\u2019t call it medicine\u2014that is a joke.\u201d\n\nAlthough pot remains illegal on the federal level, 23 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized some forms of marijuana use. Another 17 states are moving to advance ballot initiatives on legalization in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government\u2019s list of outlawed drugs,\" the Vermont senator says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"The time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government\u2019s list of outlawed drugs,\" the Vermont senator says.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Submits Bill to End Federal Prohibitions on Pot", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151105_BernieWeed_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-05T16:00:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Orr3Qc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"The time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government\u2019s list of outlawed drugs,\" the Vermont senator says.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Submits Bill to End Federal Prohibitions on Pot", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151105_BernieWeed_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "drugs", "published_time": "2015-11-05T15:47:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-05T16:00:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, marijuana, weed, pot, Drug Enforcement Administration, legalization, Controlled Substances Act"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
