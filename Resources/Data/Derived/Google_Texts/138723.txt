A concert was held Sunday evening to raise money for local teens going into the education environment. West Mount Moriah Baptist Church had community groups from all over the state present songs of worship and praise, in an attempt to raise the money. The event put on by the Reflection of Light Association says it's important for all individuals to receive quality education.

"With everything that's going on in the community, education is one of the things that most powerfully impacts our city as a whole," said President of the Association Kevin Dodson. "I was one who came to the city of Meridian as an undereducated young man and it's organizations like this that helped me get my education now."

The organization says in raising funds to help underprivileged kids go to college, it could help safe a life.
