Of that, $18 million will go for a 25 percent uninsured rate in the city of Savannah. The other $10 million is for patients outside Savannah.\n\n\u2022 $15 million in changes caused by the Affordable Care Act, known broadly as Obamacare, especially cuts to safety net funding and provider reimbursements.\n\n\u2022 $76 million for integrating new technology, including electronic health records.\n\nAnd for the challenge of maintaining a competitive cost structure while supporting new programs, growth needs and team members.\n\nIn Chatham County, that includes sharing the landscape with St. Joseph\u2019s/Candler, a medical group that includes two hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere are two very good hospital systems in this town,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cThat works to everybody\u2019s advantage.\u201d\n\nUnsettling times\n\nMemorial has gone through major financial challenges over much of the past decade, for much of that time spent fighting recurring red ink. That has brought into question the ability of management to maintain its identity in the health care sector.\n\nHaslam said he remains confident the medical center\u2019s image and vision will be unchanged.\n\nHaslam\u2019s predecessor, attorney and businessman J. Curtis Lewis III, who left the chair\u2019s seat Wednesday after three years, came on in 2011 with a new interim president/CEO in Maggie Gill and recurring large financial deficits.\n\nGill, who became permanent president/CEO in April 2011, was the third head of the hospital in just more than three years.\n\nGill inherited a $27 million gross operating loss amid a string of five years when the system ended in the red.\n\nWithin a year, Gill and the board were able to report a $29.1 million turnaround and an operating income of $1.5 million and a system net income of $4.8 million.\n\nEven then, she cautioned that the margins were slim and would need constant attention to preserve the turnabout.\n\n\u201cOur margins are dangerously thin,\u201d Gill said at the time in a mantra she continues to maintain, calling them \u201cstill too thin for me to sleep at night.\u201d\n\nAudits for last year are not expected to be ready until April, but Gill said unaudited 2013 financials for Memorial Health System show net operating revenues of $541.9 million and net income, which includes operating income/losses and investment earnings, was $8.1 million.\n\nIt will mark the third consecutive year of positive financial results.\n\nMore stable\n\nHaslam inherits a more stable governance under Gill\u2019s leadership.\n\nHe said he has great confidence in Gill; Mary Chatman, chief operating officer and chief nursing officer; Dr. Ramon Meguiar, Memorial\u2019s senior vice president and chief medical officer, and Bill Lee, chief strategy officer.\n\nThe board has changed its by-laws to bring to the table at least four members of the Chatham County Hospital Authority, which owns the land where the hospital sits, on to the board membership.\n\nThe authority leases the land to Memorial Health for $1 a year.\n\nAuthority members now on the board include Arthur \u201cArt\u201d Dana, Dr. Gerald Caplan, Dr. Francis P. \u201cFrank\u201d Rossiter Jr., and W. Rex Templeton Jr.\n\nThe board also includes Gill as a non-voting member and Jacqueline \u201cJackie\u201d Rabinowitz, chairwoman of the Memorial Health Foundation trustees.\n\nLeadership has brought the Chatham County Commission into the mix with a refinance of $183 million bonds in 2012 that freed funds for needed capital improvements.\n\nThat has allowed Gill and the board to launch more than $40 million in hospital upgrades and, in concert with North Carolina-based Novant Health, to build a free-standing children\u2019s hospital on campus that will be called \u201cThe Children\u2019s Hospital of Savannah, a Memorial-Novant Partnership.\u201d\n\nWhen completed in three years, the new hospital will serve the immediate 35-county region. Last year, the existing childen\u2019s hospital served children from 120 Georgia and South Carolina counties.\n\n\u201cIt helps fulfill our mission,\u201d Haslam said of the Novant partnership, adding that his personal mission will be completion of the children\u2019s hospital project.\n\nThe electronic records conversion project, which will cost about $70 million over five years, is one of his major challenges, Haslam said.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to see some very significant long-term benefits,\u201d he said. (But) \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to pay for it up front. It is a capital expenditure and will take a large portion of our capital budget\u201d\n\nBoth Haslam and Lewis give Gill credit for the positive moves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very impressed with Maggie and the job she is doing,\u201d Haslam said, adding that her \u201chard work, integrity and boundless energy\u201d were traits she brought with her to the top office.\n\nVision, mission safe\n\nLewis, who took the chairmanship pledging \u201cnot to change the mission of the organization,\u201d said Memorial\u2019s goal still is to be a community and regional health care provider.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that will ever change,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that\u2019s pretty much etched in stone and what it means to the community.\u201d\n\nBut Lewis said the financial challenges facing health care providers and Memorial in particular are not going away.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of unknowns,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe have to be prepared to meet the challenges, but it\u2019s going to be difficult going down the road.\u201d\n\nThe Harry Haslam, Jr. file\n\nName: Harry Haslam Jr.\n\nPosition: Board chair, Memorial Health\n\nAge: 62 (DOB 11/17/1962)\n\nNative: Savannah\n\nEducation: Benedictine Military School, 1969, Bachelor of business administration in accounting, University of Georgia, 1973\n\nProfessional: Certified Public Accountant, Partner at Hancock Askew & Co., LLP, 1973 - Present\n\nCurrent Civic: Board member of Memorial Health, Saint Benedict Education Foundation, and The 200 Club of the Coastal Empire.
