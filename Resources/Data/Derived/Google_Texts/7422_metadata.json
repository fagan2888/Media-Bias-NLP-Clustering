But it\u2019s critical to make time to put together a financial plan.\n\n\u201cSince single parenting means a single income source, making the right moves financially is that much more important,\u201d says Dale Terwedo, a financial advisor with Terwedo Financial Services in Edmonds, Wash.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re flying solo with the kids, follow these seven steps to make sure your finances stay on track.\n\n1. Create and stick to a budget\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t realize how much money they actually spend each month on things like coffee and lunch,\u201d says David Walters, a certified financial planner with Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Portland, Oregon. \u201cEstablishing a budget and adhering to it can help save hundreds of dollars a year and has the added advantage of highlighting where you waste the most money.\u201d\n\n2. Address \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios\n\nEstate planning is important for all parents, but it\u2019s even more so for single people who have no one else to fall back on, in many cases. \u201cDetermine who will take care of your child in the event of your illness or death,\u201d advises Charles Weinrich, first vice president with SunTrust Investment Services.\n\nRELATED: BROKE AND SINGLE: WHY IT PAYS TO BE MARRIED\n\n\u201cMake sure you\u2019ve got adequate insurance coverage. Work with an attorney to get the rest of your estate planning documents in order, including a living will, health care and child care proxies, and allocate specific assets or insurance to address these issues,\u201d adds Weinrich. Set up a trust to benefit your children and name an appropriate trustee of the assets, who may or may not be the children\u2019s guardian.\n\nCarefully review your employee benefits to make sure you have disability insurance coverage. \u201cIf not, think about purchasing an individual policy,\u201d says Shelley Cabangon, senior wealth planner for PNC Wealth Management.\n\n3. Review financial documents\n\nIf you\u2019re recently divorced or widowed, reevaluating financial documents is critical. Make sure your accounts are registered under the proper names and that beneficiaries have been established or changed, if needed. Additionally, says Walters, speak with your financial advisor about your current risk tolerance if you have any investment accounts. Pursuing an aggressive investment strategy is favored by many families who feel they have adequate wealth \u2013 but single parents may feel differently.\n\n4. Pay yourself first\n\nMost people should have an emergency fund with at least six months\u2019 worth of expenses saved \u2013 but when you don\u2019t have the safety net of a second income, it\u2019s even more critical. Make saving a priority, even if it means downsizing your lifestyle.\n\nThen move on to retirement savings. \u201cDon\u2019t put off your own retirement savings in order to give your child an elevated lifestyle,\u201d says Kelly Long, a certified public accountant with Shepard Schwartz & Harris in Chicago. \u201cTake care of yourself financially so that you model financial responsibility while also avoiding becoming a burden on your child later in life.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 11 WAYS PARENTS CAN HURT THEIR CHILD\u2019S JOB CHANCES\n\n\n\n5. Don\u2019t let your kids send you on a guilt trip\n\nSingle parents often feel guilty for not spending enough time with their children due to work commitments. Don\u2019t try to compensate with cash. \u201cMoney isn\u2019t a cure for guilt,\u201d says Scott Halliwell, a certified financial planner with USAA. \u201cDon't succumb to guilt-driven purchases that blow your budget. It can wreak havoc on your financial situation and teach the wrong behaviors.\u201d\n\n6. Get support\n\nNetwork. Many mom networks, for example \u2013 even if they\u2019re not geared to single mothers \u2013 are forums for swapping tips on bargains and things like child care, gently used clothing, sports equipment and other money saving strategies, says Clare Levison, author of Frugal Isn't Cheap: Spend Less, Save More, and Live Better. There are also single dads\u2019 meet-up groups and other resources for single fathers.\n\n7. Strike a balance\n\nWhen you\u2019re home, be with your family. When you\u2019re at work, make sure your children understand why it\u2019s important for you to work and that they know not to interrupt unless there is an emergency, says Leslie Tayne, a financial attorney with the Tayne Law Group who\u2019s also a single mom.\n\n\u201cIt can be tough to maintain focus when you\u2019re pulled in so many directions and are responsible for making all the decisions,\u201d she says \u2013 including the financial decisions. \u201cNo one can do it all. Lean on friends and family for babysitting. Take time for yourself when possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s a wake-up call for anyone who still thinks the \u201ctypical\u201d American family consis", "title": "7 Money Strategies for Today\u2019s Single Parents", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/06/7-Money-Strategies-Today%E2%80%99s-Single-Parents", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09062013_Single_Parent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/06/7-Money-Strategies-Today%E2%80%99s-Single-Parents", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09062013_Single_Parent.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Here\u2019s a wake-up call for anyone who still thinks the \u201ctypical\u201d American family consis", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc997f\"", "article_summary": "Pursuing an aggressive investment strategy is favored by many families who feel they have adequate wealth \u2013 but single parents may feel differently.\nWith one person playing mom and dad (not to mention cook, chauffeur, teacher and everything else), single parents\u2019 schedules are often already stretched to the breaking point.\n\u201cSince single parenting means a single income source, making the right moves financially is that much more important,\u201d says Dale Terwedo, a financial advisor with Terwedo Financial Services in Edmonds, Wash.\nThere are also single dads\u2019 meet-up groups and other resources for single fathers.\nRELATED: BROKE AND SINGLE: WHY IT PAYS TO BE MARRIED\u201cMake sure you\u2019ve got adequate insurance coverage."}
