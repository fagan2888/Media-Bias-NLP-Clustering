Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most members of Congress understand them,\u201d added Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), one of the lawmakers leading the fight against inversions.\n\nDemocrats have ramped up their rhetoric against the deals in recent days, with Obama labeling companies seeking a foreign address \u201ccorporate deserters.\u201d Doggett said Tuesday that businesses inverting their address \u201cpledge allegiance to some foreign power.\u201d\n\nSenate leaders have already pushed a measure \u2014 almost identical to a 2012 proposal and backed by vulnerable senators such as Mark Pryor Mark PryorEx-Sen.

Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said about voters. \u201cThey get it.\u201d\n\nClose to 50 companies in all have shifted their legal address abroad in the last decade, according to the Congressional Research Service. Just this month, AbbVie wrapped up the largest inversion deal yet, at $55 billion, while several other top healthcare companies have also explored the move.\n\nSen. John Thune John ThuneOvernight Tech: Senate panel poised to advance email privacy bill Senators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security Overnight Tech: Rubio, Cruz take up internet domain fight MORE (S.D.), a member of GOP leadership, admitted that inversions were becoming a more prominent campaign issue. \u201cSex appeal is the wrong word, but it\u2019s a hot topic in political circles right now,\u201d Thune told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBut Thune also brushed aside the idea that the tax deals could be a political liability for the GOP, which is in a strong position heading into the midterms because of the continued frustration with ObamaCare, a friendly electoral map and voter fatigue with the president.\n\n\u201cA lot of what the Democrats are proposing right now is more designed to give a political issues to the fall campaigns than actually fix the problem,\u201d Thune said.\n\nLike a lot of other fiscal issues, Democrats and Republicans do agree that the influx of inversions is a problem \u2014 but have found little common ground in seeking a bipartisan fix.\n\nRep.
