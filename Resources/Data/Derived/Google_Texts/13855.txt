SCG Adds Three Landscaping Companies

The PE fund is investing in Green Leaf Landscaping, M&M Professional Grounds and A New Look Lawn, and will seek additional deals in the sector

SCG Partners, a mid-market PE firm, is purchasing three landscaping providers in Florida. The firm is investing in Green Leaf Landscaping & Irrigation, M&M Professional Grounds and A New Look Lawn Care. Together, the three companies will operate under the Green Leaf brand.

Green Leaf provides commercial landscaping services such as pest control and tree trimming for corporate and health care facilities as well as retailers. SCG, of Cleveland, Ohio, will seek additional add-ons for Green Leaf.

“Green Leaf represents an opportunity for SCG Partners to invest in an industry that continues to be highly fragmented and offers opportunities to augment acquisitions with substantial organic growth,” says SCG managing director Jonathan Ives. SCG invests in businesses that have up to $200 million in revenue.
