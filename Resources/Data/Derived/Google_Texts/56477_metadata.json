Forthcoming titles define jargon in plain terms, detail how to find the right financial advisor, and offer advice on taking control of your finances, whether you\u2019re seven or 70.\n\nThe Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Complicated by Helaine Olen and Harold Pollack (Penguin/Portfolio, Jan. 2016) itemizes 10 points that fit onto a 4\u201d \u00d7 6\u201d card\u2014literally. The book is packaged with a pullout titled \u201cAll the Financial Advice You\u2019ll Ever Need on One Card\u201d; tips include \u201cstrive to save 10%\u201320% of your income\u201d and \u201cnever buy or sell individual stocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are overwhelmed by all the noise and fearmongering coming from the financial services industry,\u201d says Niki Papadopoulos, senior editor at Portfolio, Sentinel, and Current. \u201cThey know they have to plan for the future, but they get a lot of conflicting advice.\u201d\n\nThe book grew out of an interview that Pollack, a social scientist at the University of Chicago, conducted with Olen for the Reality-Based Community blog (motto: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts\u201d) about her book Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry (Penguin/Portfolio, 2013). Pollack said that everything one needs to know about managing money could fit on an index card and then scribbled down his points. He posted a snapshot of the card on the blog, which was widely shared online, earning attention from USA Today, Forbes, and other outlets.\n\nJane Bryant Quinn, an Emmy Award\u2013winning financial journalist and author of several books including Smart and Simple Financial Strategies for Busy People (Simon & Schuster, 2006), zeroes in on her readers\u2019 later years with How to Make Your Money Last: The Indispensable Retirement Guide (Simon & Schuster, Jan. 2016), which PW\u2019s starred review called a \u201chugely valuable resource.\u201d She shows how to turn assets into a steady monthly paycheck that will last for life and offers advice on fixing retirement-planning mistakes, such as taking Social Security too early. (For more on Quinn, see \u201cWhy I Write.\u201d)\n\nRick Wolff, senior executive editor at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, says that the post-corporate economy is spurring individuals to customize their financial planning. \u201cThere was a time not that long ago,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen most employees didn\u2019t need to be all that financially savvy. You worked for a corporation, they defined a pension for you, and when you got to 65 you were given the gold watch and a monthly pension for as long as you lived.\u201d\n\nThose days are long gone, he explains, and even those working for companies that offer 401(k)s must make their own investment decisions. The task of simply getting a financial advisor isn\u2019t enough: many people, Wolff says, don\u2019t even know what their advisor charges them. What Your Financial Advisor Isn\u2019t Telling You: The 10 Essential Truths You Need to Know About Your Money by Liz Davidson (Jan. 2016) aims at this audience, with explanatory charts, checklists, plain talk, and chapter headings such as \u201cTaxes: Why Your Investment Statement Is Not Entirely Accurate\u201d and \u201cYour Life Partner May Be Your Worst Financial Enemy.\u201d Davidson is the founder of the financial education organization Financial Finesse and holds an M.B.A. from UCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Management.\n\nIn Self-Made: How to Become Self-Reliant, Self-Realized, and Rich in Every Way (Random/Spiegel & Grau, May 2016), Nely Gal\u00e1n, an Emmy Award\u2013winning TV producer and former president of entertainment for Telemundo, addresses the personal aspect head-on. Early in Gal\u00e1n\u2019s career, according to senior v-p and publisher Julie Grau, the author, whose family emigrated from Cuba when she was a child, was ashamed of her Spanish accent. She turned that shame into an entrepreneurial opportunity and started a company to help women who wanted to lose their accents.\n\nGrau says that many people, particularly women, \u201care looking to start businesses that are personally gratifying, personally motivating, profitable, and benefit friends and family.\u201d That\u2019s no small order, and Gal\u00e1n, beyond making catchy pronouncement such as \u201cDon\u2019t buy shoes, buy real estate,\u201d also digs into the fundamentals of financial success, advising that readers \u201cget out of survival mode\u201d and shift focus \u201cfrom instant gratification to goal orientation.\u201d\n\nNew Concerns, New Definitions\n\nOther forthcoming titles offer their own spin on the concept of personal wealth. Taking an overtly political tack is Gerri Willis\u2019s Rich Is Not a Four-Letter Word: How to Survive Obamacare, Trump Wall Street, Kick-Start Your Retirement, and Achieve Financial Success (Crown Forum, Apr. 2016). Willis, host of the Fox Business News show The Willis Report, speaks to traditional conservatives, libertarians, and Tea Party conservatives, offering advice on how to overcome the financial hurdles that she sees as the result of liberal Democratic policy.\n\nScammed: Learn from the Biggest Consumer and Money Frauds How Not to Be a Victim by Gini Graham Scott (Skyhorse/Allworth, Aug. 2016) sounds an alarm bell exposing prevalent fraud schemes. Scott, a sociologist and author of numerous books including A Survival Guide for Working with Bad Bosses (Amacom, 2005), recounts the personal stories of victims of over two dozen types of scams\u2014investments, housing, and more\u2014and what they did to recover.\n\nThe new Rich Life series from Plata, home to Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s Rich Dad Poor Dad books, shifts the publisher\u2019s typical focus from personal wealth toward personal goals\u2014or more plainly, according to Mona Gambetta, director of global publishing, \u201cit\u2019s not all about money.\u201d\n\nBooks in the series will downplay conspicuous consumption and material wealth and instead, Gambetta says, focus on \u201crichness in your life, health, relationships.\u201d Of course, finances still matter. Among the line\u2019s first releases is The M Words: Marriage/Money/Motion by Robert Kiyosaki and his wife, Kim Kiyosaki (June 2016), which posits that the #1 stressor in marriage and the leading cause of divorce is money.\n\nSimilarly, in The Feel Rich Project: Reinventing Your Understanding of True Wealth to Find True Happiness (Career Press, June 2016), certified financial planner Michael F. Kay says that deep-rooted feelings about money inform how each person interprets the concept of being rich. By examining these personal beliefs, he says, readers will be better equipped to achieve true wealth\u2014however they define it.\n\nLiz Hartman writes frequently about books for Publishers Weekly, the Wall Street Journal, and other publications.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of a senior executive editor at HMH.
