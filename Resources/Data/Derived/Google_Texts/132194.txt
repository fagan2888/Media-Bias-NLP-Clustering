It’s not always about the alcohol when South Simcoe Police officers pull over a driver in a RIDE spotcheck.

A 40-year-old Alcona man was charged for driving under suspension and driving without a licence at a RIDE check yesterday.

“This man was found to have been driving his entire life without a driver’s licence, and yet drove into the RIDE line,” Sgt. Lou Dasilva said.

Officers also charged a 20-year-old Everett man with being intoxicated in public when he decided to urinate on a road, where police were conducting spotchecks.

Officers pulled over 355 vehicles in Innisfil Friday, giving roadside tests to 23 drivers suspected of drinking. Four drivers were in the warning range. They had their vehicles impounded and lost their licences for three days.

Dasilva said officers have been setting up RIDE checks on back roads recently instead of on high-profile main roads.

Police are finding more violations even though fewer vehicles are being checked.

“This tells me drivers are still using back roads to avoid detection from police. Most are very surprised to see us on those back roads,” Dasilva said. “Also the trend to see more drugs on board seems to be increasing.”

Police have charged three people with possession of marijuana since RIDE checks started this week.

So far, one person has been charged with impaired and five have seen their licenses suspended for registering a warning. Two drivers were driving under suspension. Police also laid 10 Highway Traffic Act charges in RIDE checks.
