They understood the masses would never act rationally.\n\nFor instance, Gov. Edmund Randolph, of Virginia, on May 29, 1787, at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, warned: \u201cOur chief danger arises from the democratic parts of our [State] constitutions. It is a maxim which I hold incontrovertible, that the powers of government exercised by the people swallows up the other branches. None of the [State] constitutions have provided sufficient checks against democracy.\u201d\n\nTwo days later Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts, said: \u201cThe evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue, but are dupes of pretended patriots.\u201d\n\nJames Madison referred to \u201cthe inconvenience of democracy,\u201d and Alexander Hamilton to the \u201cimprudence\u201d of it.\n\nToday we again we see why.\n\nThe presumptive nominee of the Republican Party for president of the United States is a man who publicly humiliated a handicapped man, said a POW from the Vietnam War wasn\u2019t a hero because he was captured, petitioned to have disabled veteran vendors removed from the streets near Trump Tower because they were a blight, blamed the 17-year-old victim of a rape by boxer Mike Tyson; has numerous failed businesses, etc.\n\nHe is a hypocrite, a pathological liar, and a serial flip-flopper. He hires illegal immigrants while claiming he wants to deport them before he said he supported touchback amnesty. He is for and against Common Core. He is opposed to Obamacare but wants essentially a single-payer health care system. He is pro-abortion, anti-abortion, pro-abortion, anti-abortion.\n\nI could go on. Suffice it to say, Donald Trump is the most uninformed and vulgar person to have ever sought the office.\n\nThe other side is no better.\n\nThe likely Democratic Party nominee should be indicted and jailed for using her personal email server for classified communications. She also has the blood of four heroes in Benghazi, Libya, on her hands, though her Republican opponent probably does not think they are heroes because they died.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s challenger, Bernie Sanders, is a self-avowed socialist whose lack of understanding of basic economics is profoundly stupefying for a U.S. senator.\n\nAs famed journalist H.L. Mencken prophetically wrote in the Baltimore Evening Sun on July 26, 1920, \u201cAs democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.\u201d\n\nBut there is an alternative.\n\nOn the ballot in all 50 states will likely be a two-term governor who balanced budgets, cut taxes, cut regulations and truly reduced the size of government. You know, all those conservative values for which the Republican Party used to stand. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson seems to be the only intelligent choice for president and will likely be the Libertarian Party candidate.\n\nGoogle him. Be a smart, informed voter. Don\u2019t vote for moronic clowns because they tell you there is no other choice.\n\nIf you pull the handle for the Republican or the Democrat after researching all the options because you truly believe that one of those knaves is what is best for America, good for you. You\u2019re wrong, but good for you.\n\nHowever, if you vote for one of those rogues because you think voting for someone else is a wasted vote, just stay home. You are an uninformed boob and part of the problem.\n\nBe libertarian with me. Just once. Vote for Gary Johnson in November. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nhttp://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/web1_LUCENTE-Thomas-Web-1-1.jpg\n\nBy Thomas Lucente [email protected]\n\nThomas J.
