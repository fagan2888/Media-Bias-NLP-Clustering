The federal government put six hospitals in northeastern Oklahoma on notice that they will be penalized next year due to the rate of Hospital-Acquired Conditions.

Such conditions include infections, sepsis, hip fractures and other complications that occur in the hospital.

The penalties were part of a program mandated by the federal Affordable Care Act to reduce patient injuries.

Any hospital scoring higher than 6.75 for Total HAC will see a one percent reduction in payments from Medicare and Medicaid in Fiscal Year 2016.

In northeastern Oklahoma, those included the following facilities:

OSU Medical Center

Tulsa Spine & Specialty Hospital

Southwestern Medical Center

Wagoner Community Hospital

Craig General Hospital

Hillcrest Hospital - Cushing

Of those on the list of facilities facing reduced payments in 2016, Southwestern Medical Center and Hillcrest Hospital in Cushing were also penalized in 2015.

"We are accredited by the Joint Commission," said Denise Geuder, Chief Nursing Officer at Southwestern Medical Center. "That's the top accreditation in health care. They looked at all of our quality indicators and found nothing wrong with what we do."



The HAC Reduction Program is mandated by the federal Affordable Care Act to reduce patient injures and complications.
