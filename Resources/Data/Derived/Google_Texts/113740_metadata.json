It is \u201cworking together like music,\u201d Kuma said, to create a comfortable and luxurious spot even in a cramped space.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic principle of a Japanese tea house, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our genetic makeup,\u201d Kuma told The Associated Press, sitting in his Tokyo studio.\n\nAlso erasing boundaries with the outside is the architecture of Sou Fujimoto, another rising star.\n\nFujimoto\u2019s house of glass \u2014 literally, just that \u2014 sits in a residential area in Tokyo, stunning in how it quietly asserts itself, despite its transparency, turning housing stereotypes on their heads.\n\nInstead of seeking shelter from the environment, residents experience the passage of time, seeing the sun and the stars above, watching and being watched by neighbors and passers-by. No room is defined by walls, as we know them, although drapes can be drawn for privacy.\n\nInhabitants move from one area to another within a borderless box.\n\nAt night, the home glows like a luminescent jewel.\n\nLike Kuma, Fujimoto is busy, working all over the world, including Germany, the U.S., France and China. Eighty percent of his work is from outside Japan, and half of his staff is non-Japanese.\n\nIn a telling sign of their rising stature, four of the winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in the last six years have been Japanese: Kazuyo Sejima, Ryue Nishizawa, Toyo Ito and Shigeru Ban.\n\nIn the past, Japanese winners were few and far between.\n\nKenzo Tange, known for his statuesque, curvaceous Tokyo Olympic stadium, won the Chicago-based Pritzker in 1987; Fumihiko Maki, who infused an Eastern sensibility into his floating forms of glass, metal and concrete, won in 1993; and the self-taught and idiosyncratic Tadao Ando was the third Japanese to win, nine years after Tange.\n\nMore recently, Japanese have also been recognized with the gold medal by The American Institute of Architects. Maki won in 2011 and Ando in 2002.\n\nIto won the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2006.\n\nA win by a non-Westerner for such awards had long been rare.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Japan architects sell a lifestyle on global stage", "title": "Japan architects sell a lifestyle on global stage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/08/japan-architects-sell-a-lifestyle-on-global-stage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140808__20140810_K3_BZ10ARCHITECTSp2.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140808__20140810_K3_BZ10ARCHITECTSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-08T17:57:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:32:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd25\"", "article_summary": "TOKYO \u2014 A new generation of Japanese architects believes the world has fallen out of love with the 20th-century steel and concrete skyscraper.\nJapanese architecture offers warmth and kindness as it is adept in the use of natural light and artisanal craftsmanship, such as bamboo and paper.\nTheir sensibility is also a hit abroad, said Erez Golani Solomon, professor of architecture at Waseda University in Tokyo.\nInstead of pursuing monuments that cry out with a message of economic power, these Pritzker Prize-winning architects are scoring success with a uniquely Japanese reinterpretation of the past.\nIto won the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2006."}
