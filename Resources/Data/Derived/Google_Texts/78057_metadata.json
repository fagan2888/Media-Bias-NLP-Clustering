Jennifer Attride-Stirling, chief executive officer of the Council, said: \u0093Bermuda will always have to rely on overseas care because it\u0092s impossible for any small community to have highly specialised medical care within its borders. \u0093For this reason, all insurers cover medical care overseas \u0097 including public plans like HIP [Government\u0092s Health Insurance Plan]. \u0093They do so as supplemental benefits, so they vary in what they cover and where. All payers have provider networks overseas or medical assistance providers to help secure better prices at quality hospitals \u0097 this is in the best interest of both patients and insurers, as quality care at good value helps to keep patients healthy and premiums down.\u0094 Nevertheless, she added, Bermuda continues to struggle with the amount of healthcare dollars exported overseas \u0097 more than $100 million in 2013. \u0093When this is medically necessary, there is no question as to its benefit,\u0094 she said. \u0093But it\u0092s unclear whether all of it is warranted or truly providing value for money. The Health Council is currently analysing claims to gain better understanding of the trends.\u0094 According to industry sources, United States hospitals need assurances that they will be paid for their services before accepting patients from abroad. Before insurance companies developed networks, US facilities demanded guarantees of payment. Local insurers then turned to preferred provider organisations such as MultiPlan, Beech Street Network and UnitedHealth Group to negotiate discounts. However, recent changes in the US such as the Affordable Care Act have cut margins for US hospitals \u0097 resulting in a closer scrutiny of the deals offered to patients from other countries. This stands to affect Bermudians travelling to the US for medical care, as prices rise and limits could be imposed on access to special preferred provider organisation rates.\n\nAs Bermuda\u0092s health spending climbs ever higher, insurance tactics to contain costs result in some patients being effectively denied the overseas treatment of their choice.\n\nAllan DeSilva, of the Bermuda Healthcare Advocacy Group (BHAG), needs back surgery that he cannot obtain in Bermuda \u0097 but found his operation would only be covered by his local insurer to the tune of ten per cent.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve never been away in my life for medical services \u0097 I want to go to the surgeon of my choice,\u0094 Mr DeSilva said. \u0093It\u0092s my life, my back, and for the amount of money I\u0092m paying, I see no reason to be shut out.\u0094\n\nFor the \u0093delicate\u0094 surgery on his thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, Mr DeSilva\u0092s doctor recommended he obtain treatment from a physician at Connecticut\u0092s Griffin Hospital, which has had a high rate of success with the operation.\n\nHowever, his insurer told him \u0093he isn\u0092t on their network\u0094, Mr DeSilva said, while treatment at New England Baptist Hospital gets full coverage.\n\n\u0093I have nothing against them but I don\u0092t know their doctors. I do know the success rate of Griffin Hospital, and there are more than 100 people from Bermuda who have been there.\u0094\n\nWorse, he said, was that other Bermudian insurers do network with Griffin.\n\n\u0093I can\u0092t change my insurance because I have it through my job,\u0094 Mr DeSilva said. \u0093I pay out $1,550 a month. That\u0092s more than $18,000 a year. It\u0092s exorbitant.\n\n\u0093My doctor at Griffin is even willing to charge me the same as what the preferred place would charge. But it\u0092s been six months now and I don\u0092t have any answer.\u0094\n\nFor one woman, who asked not to be named to protect her privacy, the lack of choice is especially grave.\n\nStricken with an extremely rare cancerous tumour attached to her sciatic nerve, she needs treatment abroad. The tumour is known technically as a schwannoma.\n\n\u0093When I found out, I went online and found that the best surgeon is at Johns Hopkins \u0097 that\u0092s where the leading specialist is,\u0094 she said.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s extremely rare. It\u0092s so rare they can barely find any information on it. But my insurance company said I would have to pay 50 per cent. I\u0092d have to go to Lahey Clinic to be covered, even though Lahey told me I would need two surgeons, not one.\n\n\u0093What concerns me is that if they screw up the surgery on my sciatic nerve, I will have what\u0092s called a dropped foot. I\u0092ll lose mobility in my foot. It will affect me for the rest of my life.\n\n\u0093I have fought this tooth and nail, it\u0092s been a real ordeal. My insurance company insists they will take care of me at Lahey.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ll go and listen to the doctors but if I\u0092m not comfortable, I will come back home. I\u0092ll get treated at Johns Hopkins even if I have to pay for it the rest of my life.\u0094\n\nAfter speaking with patients, The Royal Gazette asked Argus, BF&M and Colonial insurance companies to explain their policies on overseas care.\n\nThe use of overseas networks emerged as a necessary tactic for containing costs.\n\nAccording to the Bermuda Health Council, more than $100 million leaves the Island each year for treatment abroad.\n\nMichelle Jackson, executive vice president of group insurance for the Argus Group, said the insurer\u0092s network encompassed more than 10,000 acute care facilities and 600,000 doctors in approximately 130 countries \u0097 including \u0093some of the world\u0092s best facilities, such as Brigham and Women\u0092s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Lahey Hospital and Medical Center\u0094.\n\n\u0093We work with physicians and hospitals to provide 100 per cent coverage at some of the world\u0092s best facilities, while still controlling premium costs,\u0094 she said.\n\n\u0093In 2010, Argus developed an overseas Preferred Provider Network where we partner with facilities selected from the worldwide Argus Network. The Preferred Provider Network includes more than 40 facilities in the US and Canada where we have negotiated preferential rates.\u0094\n\nMs Jackson said the insurer also reined in overseas costs by being diligent in its review of claims abroad.\n\n\u0093Over the past two years at the Argus Group, we have seen overseas claims stabilise as we focus on cost containment,\u0094 she said.\n\nPatients occasionally wish to be treated near families at facilities outside either of Argus\u0092s networks.\n\n\u0093In these instances, we contact the hospital to establish a relationship with the aim of bringing them into one of the networks,\u0094 she said.\n\nBF&M president John Wight also confirmed that the use of overseas provider networks was common practice.\n\n\u0093If a patient is referred by his or her practitioner in Bermuda abroad to a practitioner or facility that is not within BF&M\u0092s provider network, which is rare, BF&M works with the referring physician to locate an appropriate alternate. The reason for this is to reduce potential patient out-of-pocket expense as much as possible.\u0094\n\nAdded Mr Wight: \u0093BF&M doesn\u0092t select the facility that the patient goes to. BF&M health insurance members and their referring physicians may choose any facility or practitioner abroad.\n\n\u0093However, the coverage type the member has purchased does dictate benefits, and thus one facility may be more appropriate than others.\n\n\u0093Prior to care abroad, BF&M confirms benefits directly with the member to ensure our members and their practitioners make an informed decision about where care will be received.\u0094\n\nAccording to Naz Farrow, chief operating officer for health at Colonial Group, the insurer has maintained a preferred provider arrangement in the US since 1995.\n\n\u0093They are very commonplace now, so I doubt they will become more commonplace,\u0094 she added, describing the policy as a means of obtaining affordable care.\n\nColonial is part of a preferred provider organisation in the US representing \u0093dozens of insurance companies and millions of patients\u0094 \u0097 enabling the company to negotiate a wide range of discounts.\n\n\u0093The hospitals also need to be accredited with the provider organisation, which means things like medical malpractice insurance has to be in place and that the hospitals meet high standards of care.\n\n\u0093Due to changes caused by ObamaCare legislation, [which] have had a direct and indirect impact on access to US care [and] the cost and management of care, we resisted the urge to cut benefits and restrict access to overseas hospitals. We worked hard with our overseas providers to make sure we got access.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Health, Health treatment  Social issue, Health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "The Royal Gazette", "description": "As Bermuda\u0092s health spending climbs ever higher, insurance tactics to contain costs result in some patients being effectively denied the overseas treatment of their choice.Allan DeSilva, of the Bermuda Healthcare Advocacy Group (BHAG), needs back surgery that he cannot obtain in Bermuda \u0097 but found his operation would only be covered by his local insurer to the tune of ten per cent.\u0093I\u0092ve never been away in my life for medical services \u0097 I want to go to the surgeon of my choice,\u0094 Mr DeSilva", "title": "Patients\u2019 anger as treatment choices denied | The Royal Gazette:Bermuda Health", "url": "http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150114/NEWS06/150119881", "image": "http://www.royalgazette.com/storyimage/RG/20150114/NEWS06/150119881/AR/0/AR-150119881.jpg", "datepublished": "2015-01-14T08:00:00", "headline": "Patients\u2019 anger as treatment choices denied", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000553573348, "app_id": 502972206505241}, "description": "As Bermuda\u0092s health spending climbs ever higher, insurance tactics to contain costs result in some patients being effectively denied the overseas treatment of their choice.Allan DeSilva, of the Bermuda Healthcare Advocacy Group (BHAG), needs back surgery that he cannot obtain in Bermuda \u0097 but found his operation would only be covered by his local insurer to the tune of ten per cent.\u0093I\u0092ve never been away in my life for medical services \u0097 I want to go to the surgeon of my choice,\u0094 Mr DeSilva", "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde31b\"", "article_summary": "\u0093In 2010, Argus developed an overseas Preferred Provider Network where we partner with facilities selected from the worldwide Argus Network.\nAccording to the Bermuda Health Council, more than $100 million leaves the Island each year for treatment abroad.\nPatients\u2019 anger as treatment choices denied\u0091We\u0092ll always have to rely on overseas care\u0092 Bermuda\u0092s health insurers maintain a \u0093network\u0094 with overseas clinics, according to the Bermuda Health Council, in a bid to curtail the Island\u0092s mounting costs.\n\u0093For this reason, all insurers cover medical care overseas \u0097 including public plans like HIP [Government\u0092s Health Insurance Plan].\nAs Bermuda\u0092s health spending climbs ever higher, insurance tactics to contain costs result in some patients being effectively denied the overseas treatment of their choice."}
