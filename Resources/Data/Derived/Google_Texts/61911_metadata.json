But when the facts are examined, you see that he is none of these things. There is an enormous disconnect between who the pope really is in terms of his policies and his public relations image, as crafted by the Vatican\u2019s PR man, previously with Fox News. The current PR mission is all about reversing the incredible decline in fundraising under the last pope from the U.S. Catholic Church in particular. Pope Francis has made any number of statements that seem to indicate change and progress that are not reflected in policy. In fact, in the wake of such comments from Pope Francis, the Vatican often makes a point to explicitly state that no church policy has changed.\n\nWhile the pope transmits a populist vibe\u2014particularly about the economy\u2014 he is an old-school conservative who, despite his great PR, maintains nearly all of the socialpolicies of his predecessors and keeps up a hardline Vatican \u201ccabinet.\u201d He has done virtually nothing to change the policies of the church to match his more compassionate rhetoric. People excuse the pope, claiming that he doesn\u2019t have much power to make changes, but this simply isn\u2019t true. Further, it is ludicrous to suggest that a man who denies comprehensive reproductive health care (including all forms of birth control including condoms and abortion) and comprehensive family planning is a man who cares about the poor of this world. The bigotry of homophobia and sexism cloaked in religion are still bigotry and sexism. By giving to the church, American Catholics aren\u2019t supporting \u201cprogress,\u201d they are supporting oppression and in this way are complicit in the bigotry, sexism, and oppression of the church.\n\nPope Francis to the rescue of a church in financial crisis\n\nPeople in the U.S. have fallen hard for Pope Francis. According to polls conducted byThe Washington Post/ABC and CNN, his approval ratings with Americans are sky high. \u201cSeven-in-ten U.S. Catholics also now say Francis represents a major change in direction for the church,\u201d according to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center. In truth, while he is a PR darling, the new pope aligns closely on social issues with his predecessor, the wildly unpopular Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe wheels were set in motion to change the perception of the church before Pope Francis was elected. In March of 2010, Pope Benedict XVI had only a 40 percent favorable rating in the United States. By June of that year, the U.S. Bishops were planning a PR campaign to soften their image and attract the younger generation. Shortly thereafter, the Vatican hired Greg Burke, a former Fox News correspondent, as a senior communications adviser reporting directly to the Vatican\u2019s third-ranking official, Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu. The New York Times points out that Mr. Burke had previously met Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, and \u201cdid not rule out that being known by the cardinal might have helped him get hired.\u201d Clearly, the American cardinals have a great deal of influence over Vatican PR, given how much Vatican funding comes from the U.S. Burke is a traditionalist, a celibate, a member of the conservative catholic alliance Opus-Dei, and his spiritual practices reportedly include self-flagellation, in keeping with Opus Dei traditionalists.\n\nIn addition to Burke, the Vatican has also hired the consulting firm of McKinsey & Company. The consulting firm was engaged to \u201cstudy the Holy See\u2019s communications, with an eye to creating a more effective media operation.\u201d The goal was that this hire, along with that of Burke the year before, would reverse the declining view of the Church caused, in part, by public relations miscues.\n\nA poll of U.S. Catholics conducted at the end of February 2013, just before Pope Francis was elected, indicated that most felt the church was out of touch. Pope Benedict\u2019s favorable ratings were still only at 40 percent. Clearly, Pope Benedict was not the man to implement the PR vision of the church. The New York Times article from March 5, 2013, by Laurie Goodstein and Megan Thee-Brenan, which details the polling results, includes a telling quote from Eric O\u2019Leary, a funeral director from Des Moines, Iowa. He says, \u201cI would like them not to be so quick to condemn people because of their sexual preference or because of abortion, or to refuse priests the right to get married or women to be priests. I don\u2019t think the church should get involved in whether or not people use birth control.\u201d This sentiment typifies that of a majority of Catholics in America.\n\nGreg Burke told reporters when he was hired that he \u201cknow[s] what journalists are looking for and what they need,\u201d and \u201cI know how things will play out in the media.\u201d Pope Francis has played the part nearly perfectly and Burke\u2019s strategies have certainly paid dividends for the Church. By going on the offensive and promoting positive stories instead of waiting to react to negative ones, Burke helped to turn around the Catholic Church\u2019s image in the United States. And improving American\u2019s image of the Catholic Church is of critical importance. According to The Economist, \u201cThe American church may account for as much as 60 percent of the global institution\u2019s wealth. Little surprise, then, that it is the biggest contributor to head office (ahead of Germany, Italy and France). Everything from renovations to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University, the church\u2019s version of West Point, is largely paid for with American money.\u201d The National Catholic Reporter points out that American Catholics put more than $150 million a week into the collection plate, totaling $8 billion annually. Even if, as they assert, ninety percent of those donations never leave their parish, that means that about $800 million a year donated by American Catholics is being used to fund the Catholic Church around the world.\n\nForbes points out that U.S. Catholics are responsible for almost a third of the charitable contributions that directly fund the Holy See, contributions that were down from $82 million in 2009 to 70 million in 2011. This time period overlaps the decline in Pope Benedict\u2019s favorable numbers among U.S. Catholics and is widely attributed to Benedict\u2019s lack of PR finesse, handling of the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandal, and launching of an investigation into the practices of the American nuns. The same piece in Forbes points out that \u201cas of the last Vatican financial report from mid-2012, the Holy See is in the red. The Church may be growing more rapidly in Africa and South America, but both the faithful and religious institutions in those nations simply do not have access to significant resources.\u201d The U.S. Catholics are an imperative center of the funding picture for the church worldwide.\n\nAnd these already staggering figures only account for money collected directly by the Catholic Church. Including the money raised by Catholic Charities paints an even more impressive picture of just how much money American Catholics are pouring into the coffers of the Church and Church-related organizations. According to Forbes, in FY 2012, Catholic Charities USA raised $4.39 billion dollars for its charitable and social service programs. Combine the facts that U.S. Catholics fund the majority of the Church\u2019s activities worldwide, the decline in donations from U.S. Catholics, and how the drop in donations correlates with the decline in reputation of the Catholic Church in America over the same time period and the need for a serious PR campaign becomes clear: Improve the Church\u2019s image with U.S. Catholics in order to improve the cash flow.\n\nThe new sexist, nun-hating, poverty-perpetuating, pedophile-protecting homophobe is the same as the old sexist, nun-hating, poverty-perpetuating, pedophile-protecting homophobe, but gosh how the media loves him\n\nIn late October and early November 2013, reports were beginning to circulate that Pope Francis may appoint the first female Cardinal. However, the Vatican quickly crushed that notion, calling it \u201cnot remotely realistic.\u201d Francis himself said \u201c\u2026it is a line that has come from who knows where\u2026\u201d However, the impression stuck that Pope Francis is progressive about women in the church.\n\nLikewise, it has been widely reported that Pope Francis has struck, as The New York Times called it, \u201ca more compassionate tone than his predecessors\u201d regarding homosexuality. Where Pope Benedict XVI wrote in 2005 that homosexuality is \u201ca strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil,\u201d Pope Francis said in 2013, \u201cIf someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d In fact, he has judged plenty. Salon compiled his 5 worst quotes on homosexuality. Again, though, the media widely circulated the story about his seemingly revolutionary comments about gays, and the pope\u2019s reputation as progressive on gays in the church was set.\n\nIn April of 2014, Pope Francis announced his plan for a fall meeting of senior clerics to discuss topics including contraception and gay marriage. In his piece in The Los Angeles Times, Henry Chu pointed out that, \u201cHardly anyone expects the pope to propose sweeping changes to Catholic doctrine at the synod in October despite widespread criticism that the modern world has left the church behind. Indeed, Francis has unequivocally upheld heterosexual marriage and procreation as God\u2019s established, sanctified ideal.\u201d Nonetheless, the perception remains that Pope Francis is better about social issues than his predecessor.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, Politico pointed out that in an interview given by the pope in August 2013, and published in September of that year, \u201cPope Francis said the church did not have to talk about gay marriage and abortion all the time.\u201d And yet, \u201cthe very next day [after the interview was published] Francis condemned abortion as \u2018unjust.\u2019\u201d Furthermore, after the interview was given, a week before its publication, the pope excommunicated a priest from Melbourne, Australia, Greg Reynolds, for advocating for female clergy and gay marriage. Pope Francis\u2019s seemingly understanding words about gay marriage and abortion were sandwiched in between two events that completely undermined that message. Pope Francis is wise, though, to grab headlines that make him seem less homophobic than his predecessors, because in the United States, home of the church\u2019s funding base, most Catholics support marriage equality.\n\nAmong Pope Francis\u2019s most publicized and well-received moves have been to forgo living in the papal apartment. Instead he has chosen to live in a three-room suite in the Domus Santa Martha hotel. This decision has been widely interpreted as a sign of his humility and his effort to refocus the church on the plight of the poor. Seven months after moving into Domus Santa Martha, Pope Francis said, \u201cThe Church, all of us should divest ourselves of worldliness. Worldliness is a murderer because it kills souls, kills people, kills the Church.\u201d This apparently does not apply to the Pope\u2019s lavish apartment in the Apostolic Palace. According to NBC News Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, \u201c\u2026the pope will be using the offices in the Apostolic Palace and its grand, frescoed reception rooms to meet heads of state and delegations, and will continue to appear each Sunday to deliver a blessing from the window of the papal apartments overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square.\u201d\n\nIt is ludicrous to take either Pope Francis or the Catholic Church seriously on their commitment to end poverty. Even the National Catholic Reporter calls out the hypocrisy of the Vatican on this issue. Lack of access to birth control and comprehensive family planning traps people in a cycle of poverty. According to theUNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund,\n\n\u201cFamily planning is a powerful tool in combating poverty. However, universal access to family planning is not yet a reality, particularly not among the poorest. Worldwide, 200 million women would like to delay or prevent pregnancy, but are not using effective contraception.\u201d Nicholas Kristof wrote in The New York Times, \u201cWe should all be able to agree on voluntary family planning as a cost-effective strategy to reduce poverty, conflict and environmental damage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't buy his populist rhetoric.
