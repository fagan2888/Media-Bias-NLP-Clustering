HOBOKEN — The Hoboken 2013 Ragamuffin Parade will be held next Thursday, on Halloween, the city has announced.

The setup for the parade’s line of march is scheduled for 3 p.m. at Washington Street between 12th and 13th streets. The parade will step off roughly 30 minutes later.

A costume contest overseen by MC Polka Dot will be held at Little League Field on Fifth Street and River Terrace immediately following the parade.

Last year, the parade was postponed a couple of weeks because of superstorm Sandy.

Prizes will be awarded in five categories.

Residents and businesses who wish to take part in trick-or-treating should place a sign on their doors so parents and children know who is participating.
