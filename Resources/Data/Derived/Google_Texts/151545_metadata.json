That assertion is under new scrutiny due to a judicial order.\n\nAttorneys for a Syrian prisoner have begun studying hours of video showing him being removed from his cell, placed in a restraint chair and fed by a tube with liquid nutrients.\n\nThey are looking for evidence of what he has portrayed as abusive force-feeding, akin to torture, during the months that he has participated in a hunger strike that drew the attention of President Barack Obama and led to a renewed effort to close the prison on this U.S. base in Cuba.\n\nIn May, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler said the manner used to feed Dhiab caused \u201cunnecessary suffering\u201d and imposed a temporary order barring the feeding procedure.\n\nShe lifted it a week later to avoid endangering his life from starvation, but ordered the military to turn over 34 videos of Dhiab being removed from his cell and fed. She has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the status of the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a modest thing to ask a court to order our military not to torture these men,\u201d lawyer Jon Eisenberg said about both this prisoner, Abu Wa\u2019el Dhiab, and others who have been fed through a nasal tube while on hunger strike.\n\nLawyers, who have never been allowed to witness the procedure in person, said they expected to study the first batch of videos, about 10 hours of them, over the weekend at a special facility for viewing classified evidence near the Pentagon. They also plan to seek videos of at least three other prisoners.\n\n\u201cOf course, I expect it to be upsetting,\u201d said Cori Crider, a member of the legal team. \u201cThey say it\u2019s humane, but that\u2019s totally not the way Dhiab and dozens of other people have reported it to me.\u201d\n\nMilitary officials, who call the hunger strike a propaganda stunt, reject the phrase \u201cforce-feeding.\u201d They say the video will show nothing more than guards and medical personnel doing their jobs in a difficult situation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t force feed anyone,\u201d said Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who oversees the prison as commander of U.S. Southern Command.\n\nThere have been hunger strikes at Guantanamo since shortly after the detention center opened in 2002 to hold and question men suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban.\n\nThe practice of using a restraint chair for feeding began in early 2006 during a mass hunger strike that grew so serious authorities feared some participants might die. Using a modified version of a procedure adopted by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the military straps a prisoner down, inserts a flexible tube into a nostril and sends liquid nutrients, typically Ensure or a similar product, directly to the stomach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "title": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "title": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/videos_open_window_on_guantanamo_hunger_strike/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/guantanamo-hunger-strike.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "title": "Videos open window on Guantanamo hunger strike", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/guantanamo-hunger-strike.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Fox", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The practice of using a restraint chair for feeding began in early 2006 during a mass hunger strike that grew so serious authorities feared some participants might die.\nThere have been hunger strikes at Guantanamo since shortly after the detention center opened in 2002 to hold and question men suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsGUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba (AP) \u2014 The U.S. military has long insisted it employs only humane methods to keep hunger-striking prisoners alive at Guantanamo.\nShe lifted it a week later to avoid endangering his life from starvation, but ordered the military to turn over 34 videos of Dhiab being removed from his cell and fed.\nThey also plan to seek videos of at least three other prisoners."}
