(Christy Steadman / Daily Record)\n\nA general consensus of the attendees at the digital premier Saturday night is that they are happy the theater on Main Street \"made it.\"\n\nComplete with a red carpet, DJ Rich Bosisio and complimentary hot cider and cookies, Skyline Theater showed \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" as part of the reward package for Kickstarter pledgers of $100 or more.\n\n\"Most everybody is here because they are huge movie buffs,\" said Linda Epperson, co-owner of Skyline Theater.\n\nSkyline launched its second Kickstarter campaign Sept. 12 with the goal to raise $35,000 in 45 days to fund a digital conversion, and they reached that goal near the end of October.\n\nMary Etter, of Ca\u00f1on City, was the first to pledge to Skyline's Kickstarter campaign. She said she \"loves movies,\" and she wanted the theater \"to survive.\"\n\n\"It would not be correct for a town this size not to have a movie theater,\" she said.\n\nSkyline opened its doors for a digital movie-going experience Nov. 21. With the conversion, movies at Skyline went from 35-millimeter films to digital projection and digital sound conversion with a new screen.\n\nEpperson said the digital picture is a lot cleaner.\n\n\"It's a great picture whenever you see it,\" she said. \"From the first time to the 200th time, it's going to be just as clear.\"\n\nEpperson said people have commented on how \"great the screen looks\" and the quality of the sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Now it's what it's supposed to be,\" Epperson said.\n\nSkyline Theater is a family business, and the children of Kate Kelly-Voss, who died of breast cancer last year, \"rallied together and decided as a family that we will do our best to save this theater and her legacy,\" stated Karen Nothdurft on Kickstarter's website.\n\n\"I see a lot of people I know, and a lot of people I don't know,\" said Nothdurft at the digital premier Saturday. \"Without all of you, this would not have been possible. Thank you, Ca\u00f1on City.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24634932/kickstarter-pledgers-enjoy-special-digital-premier-showing-hunger", "modificationDate": "2013-12-01T18:56:26-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1201/20131201__02drskylinew~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Christy Steadman \n \n  steadmanc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "A general consensus of the attendees at the digital premier Saturday night is that they are  happy the theater on Main Street \"made it.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:24634932:view"}, "startDate": "2013-12-01T18:55:40-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24634932/kickstarter-pledgers-enjoy-special-digital-premier-showing-hunger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1201/20131201__02drskylinew~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A general consensus of the attendees at the digital premier Saturday night is that they are  happy the theater on Main Street \"made it.", "title": "Kickstarter pledgers enjoy a special digital premier showing of 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "A general consensus of the attendees at the digital premier Saturday night is that they are  happy the theater on Main Street \"made it.", "title": "Kickstarter pledgers enjoy a special digital premier showing of 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24634932/kickstarter-pledgers-enjoy-special-digital-premier-showing-hunger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1201/20131201__02drskylinew~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-01T18:55:40-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2023-12-01T18:55:36-0700", "sailthru.title": "Kickstarter pledgers enjoy a special digital premier showing of 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Christy Steadmansteadmanc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1201/20131201__02drskylinew~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-12-01T18:57:52-0700", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Canyon City Colorado Education news, Canyon City Colorado news, Education Canyon City news, Education Colorado news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "article_summary": "Kickstarter pledgers wait in line to receive their tickets to 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' for Skyline Theater's digital premier.\nComplete with a red carpet, DJ Rich Bosisio and complimentary hot cider and cookies, Skyline Theater showed \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" as part of the reward package for Kickstarter pledgers of $100 or more.\n\"Most everybody is here because they are huge movie buffs,\" said Linda Epperson, co-owner of Skyline Theater.\n\"I see a lot of people I know, and a lot of people I don't know,\" said Nothdurft at the digital premier Saturday.\n(Christy Steadman / Daily Record)A general consensus of the attendees at the digital premier Saturday night is that they are happy the theater on Main Street \"made it.\""}
