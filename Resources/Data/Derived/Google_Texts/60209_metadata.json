The hospital has previously said Duncan, who was being kept in isolation, was in serious but stable condition.\n\nDuncan traveled from disease-ravaged Liberia to Dallas last month before he began showing symptoms of the disease that has killed some 3,400 people in West Africa.\n\nHealth officials said Saturday that they are still monitoring about 50 people who may have had contact with Duncan for signs of the deadly disease. Among those are nine people who are believed to be at a higher risk. Thus far none have shown symptoms.\n\nIncluded in the group being monitored are people who later rode in the ambulance that took Duncan to the hospital last Sunday, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDuncan was staying with Troh at a Dallas apartment when he became ill. On Friday a hazardous-materials crew hauled out items from the apartment in industrial barrels for permanent disposal. That same day, Troh, originally from Liberia, and three others \u2014 her 13-year-old son, Duncan\u2019s distant relative and a family friend \u2014 were moved to a private residence where they are being carefully monitored.\n\nThe city had trouble finding a place to take them until a volunteer offered the private residence.\n\nThe first Ebola diagnosis in the U.S. has raised concerns about whether the disease could spread in the U.S. Federal health officials say they are confident they can control it.\n\nFrieden said that they\u2019ve already gotten \u201cwell over\u201d 100 inquiries on suspicious cases in recent months, with an uptick coming after the Dallas patient was diagnosed. Federal officials have said tests have been done on about 15 and all but one \u2014 Duncan \u2014 were false alarms.\n\nMost of the cases don\u2019t involve travel to West Africa, \u201cbut we\u2019d rather have a wider net cast,\u201d said Frieden. That way \u201cwe\u2019re more likely to find someone promptly if they did actually have exposure and they do actually have symptoms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe virus that causes Ebola is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids \u2014 blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen \u2014 of an infected person who is showing symptoms.\n\nDuncan arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 and fell ill a few days later. After an initial visit to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, he was sent home. He returned to the hospital two days later, last Sunday, and has been kept in isolation ever since.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s explanation about what they knew about his travel history has changed in the time since his diagnosis was revealed on Tuesday. Federal health officials have advised hospitals to take a travel history for patients with any Ebola-like symptoms.\n\nWhen Duncan\u2019s diagnosis was first disclosed, the hospital said it wasn\u2019t till he came back Sunday that they discovered he had been in West Africa. The hospital later acknowledged that Duncan had told a nurse his travel history on his first visit but said the information hadn\u2019t been fully communicated to the whole team.\n\nOn Thursday, the hospital elaborated by saying that a flaw in the electronic health records systems led to separate physician and nursing workflows and that the doctor hadn\u2019t had access to Duncan\u2019s travel history.\n\nBut the hospital issued a statement late Friday saying that the doctor who initially treated Duncan did have access to his travel history after all.\n\nHospital spokesman Wendell Watson said Saturday he could provide no further details, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re still looking into the entire chain of events.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital: Dallas Ebola Patient Thomas Eric Duncan Critical", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hospital: Dallas Ebola Patient Thomas Eric Duncan Critical", "title": "Hospital: Dallas Ebola Patient Thomas Eric Duncan Critical - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/05/ef9f47fee1987b26610f6a706700a531jpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/05/hospital-dallas-ebola-patient-critical/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hospital: Dallas Ebola Patient Thomas Eric Duncan Critical", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/05/ef9f47fee1987b26610f6a706700a531jpg.jpg", "title": "Hospital: Dallas Ebola Patient Thomas Eric Duncan Critical - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-10-05T07:44:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdc7\"", "article_summary": "Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas didn\u2019t provide any further details or respond to questions about Duncan\u2019s health on Saturday.\nThe hospital\u2019s explanation about what they knew about his travel history has changed in the time since his diagnosis was revealed on Tuesday.\nFederal health officials have advised hospitals to take a travel history for patients with any Ebola-like symptoms.\nBut the hospital issued a statement late Friday saying that the doctor who initially treated Duncan did have access to his travel history after all.\nHealth officials said Saturday that they are still monitoring about 50 people who may have had contact with Duncan for signs of the deadly disease."}
