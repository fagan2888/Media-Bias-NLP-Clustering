Eventually it was narrowly approved that in two years there will be smoking in designated areas only.\n\nWhere and how that plan will be put in place will come before the board in the future.\n\nThe board also approved the development of a master plan for renovations to the fair grounds. Several of the fair buildings are in need of either replacing or repair.\n\nNo timeline was given for when the Master plans would be in place.\n\nThe Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.\n\nA Reno County youth group called Communities That Care has twice discussed its research and ideas on a smoking ban with the state fair board, which will consider the request Tuesday.\n\nThe Hutchinson News reports smoking is currently not allowed in the fair buildings or in the grandstand seating area. The youth group wants the fair board to expand that ban to the entire grounds, saying it would create a healthier environment for fairgoers.\n\nFair manager Denny Stoecklein says the board has to consider that about 20 percent - or 78,000 fairgoers each year - are smokers. He says other issues are accommodating vendors who smoke and how to enforce the ban.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"description": "The Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.", "title": "UPDATE: Smoking restrictions approved for Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Group-pushing-State-Fair-to-ban-or-limit-smoking-304109861.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/387/3D7/3873D7D08BF64EF0816E922FA1D342DA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/103/F6E/103F6ED2BA4945828963805D8673093B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.", "title": "UPDATE: Smoking restrictions approved for Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Group-pushing-State-Fair-to-ban-or-limit-smoking-304109861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kansas-State-Fair-logo-2015.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Smoking restrictions approved for Kansas State Fair", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Smoking restrictions approved for"}, "article_summary": "UPDATE: After much discussion and a 6-5 vote, the Kansas State fair Board approved Kansas State Fair implementing some type of smoking restrictions at the fair grounds starting in 2016.\nThe Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.\nThe board also approved the development of a master plan for renovations to the fair grounds.\nA Reno County youth group called Communities That Care has twice discussed its research and ideas on a smoking ban with the state fair board, which will consider the request Tuesday.\nEventually it was narrowly approved that in two years there will be smoking in designated areas only."}
