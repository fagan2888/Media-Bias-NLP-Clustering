Reps. Clarice Navarro of Pueblo and Polly Lawrence of Douglas County are lobbying members of their Republican caucus to be the next assistant minority leader.

The office is now held by Rep. Libby Szabo of Arvada, who will be resigning as she was selected by a vacancy committee to serve on the Jefferson County board of commissioners. Her resignation date and the caucus election date are not known yet.

Lawrence said she worked with the minority leader, Brian DelGrosso, during the election to help pick up three seats that had been in Democratic hands. “I think Brian and I make a great team, raising money, reaching out and identifying candidates and working with our caucus,” she said.

Navarro said she has leadership skills that would help the caucus.

“We need to be more aggressive in our tactical and political moves,” she said, adding that includes raising money. “We all need to own a piece of this, especially those of us in safe seats. If we don’t raise the money to win critical races we won’t win back the majority.”
