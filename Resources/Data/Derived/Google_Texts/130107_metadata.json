A final close by year-end would make it one of the fastest fundraisings of 2014. Private equity and distressed private equity funds globally have taken an average of 16 months to reach a final close so far this year, according to data provider Preqin.\n\nA spokeswoman for Centerbridge declined to comment.\n\nOne investor said limited partners rated Centerbridge because of its ability to execute buyout and debt investments in both healthy and distressed companies through the same fund.\n\nThe firm\u2019s debut fund, which raised $3 billion in 2006, is currently performing roughly three-times as well as the industry \u00adaverage. The fund was generating a net internal rate of return of 21.14% as of September 30, 2013, according to public disclosures from U.S. pension fund California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, an investor in the vehicle. This compares to a 6.5% median IRR for private equity funds of that vintage and a 7.7% median IRR for distressed private equity funds of the same vintage, according to Preqin.\n\nCenterbridge was set up in 2006 by Mark Gallogly, former head of the private equity investment team at Blackstone, and Jeffrey Aronson, former head of distressed-debt investing at hedge fund Angelo Gordon. Mr. Gallogly was at Blackstone for 16 years, while Mr. Aronson was at Angelo Gordon for over 17 years.\n\nCenterbridge has since been involved in some of the world\u2019s most high-profile restructurings. It is one of a group of creditors that are owed $24.4 billion by a division of Energy Future Holdings, the private equity-backed Texas-based energy company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. Last year the firm also bought debt in Billabong International, the Australian surfwear maker that sought a rescue package after a debt-fuelled expansion began to unwind during the financial crisis.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Centerbridge Partners, the investment firm co-founded by the former head of private equity at alternative investment giant Blackstone Group, has attracted more than $11 billion of demand for its $5.75 billion third fund within just six weeks of launching.", "title": "Centerbridge Attracts More Than $11bn of Demand in Six Weeks", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/05/centerbridge-attracts-more-than-11bn-of-demand-in-six-weeks/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Centerbridge Attracts More Than $11bn of Demand in Six Weeks", "description": "Centerbridge Partners, the investment firm co-founded by the former head of private equity at alternative investment giant Blackstone Group, has attracted more than $11 billion of demand for its $5.75 billion third fund within just six weeks of launching.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Alec Macfarlane, Hillary Canada and Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Centerbridge Partners, the investment firm co-founded by the former head of private equity at alternative investment giant Blackstone Group, has attracted more than $11 billion of demand for its $5.75 billion third fund within just six weeks of launching.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-05T16:37:31-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/05/centerbridge-attracts-more-than-11bn-of-demand-in-six-weeks/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17160", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Centerbridge Partners, the investment firm co-founded by the former head of private equity at alternative investment giant Blackstone Group, has attracted more than $11 billion of demand for its $5.75 billion third fund within just six weeks of launching.", "title": "Centerbridge Attracts More Than $11bn of Demand in Six Weeks", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/05/centerbridge-attracts-more-than-11bn-of-demand-in-six-weeks/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17160", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-05T16:38:02-04:00"}, "article_summary": "This compares to a 6.5% median IRR for private equity funds of that vintage and a 7.7% median IRR for distressed private equity funds of the same vintage, according to Preqin.\nCenterbridge Partners, the investment firm co-founded by the former head of private equity at alternative investment giant Blackstone Group, has attracted more than $11 billion of demand for its $5.75 billion third fund within just six weeks of launching.\nPrivate equity and distressed private equity funds globally have taken an average of 16 months to reach a final close so far this year, according to data provider Preqin.\nCenterbridge was set up in 2006 by Mark Gallogly, former head of the private equity investment team at Blackstone, and Jeffrey Aronson, former head of distressed-debt investing at hedge fund Angelo Gordon.\nOne investor said limited partners rated Centerbridge because of its ability to execute buyout and debt investments in both healthy and distressed companies through the same fund."}
