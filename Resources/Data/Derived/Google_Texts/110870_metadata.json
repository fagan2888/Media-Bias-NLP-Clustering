He snapped it up, had it restored and finally got to play it.\n\n\u201cIf you find something you like, you had better buy it right away before someone else does,\u201d Osterweil said.\n\nThe 72-year-old Tampa man has turned that philosophy into a lifelong avocation.\n\nHis business is Memorabilia Magic, a West Tampa storefront filled wall-to-wall with vintage things from sports, entertainment, politics and history \u2014 all for sale and available on consignment for charity auctions.\n\nHundreds of charities across the country take advantage of his offer every year.\n\nSelections from his collection were recently on display at a fundraiser for Ronald McDonald House Charities of Tampa Bay. In July, you can find some of them up for auction at a benefit for the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working with him for 10 years,\u201d said Janice Davis, CEO of Tampa\u2019s Ronald McDonaold House. \u201cHe has such a unique collection that offers something for everyone.\u201d\n\nShe said at her last event his items on display were as eclectic as dental devices from the early 1900s to baseballs signed by Hall of Famers.\n\nIn his home office, Osterweil keeps more-cherished personal items \u2014 including a hand fan given to guests at the 1891 opening of the Tampa Bay Hotel, now part of the University of Tampa. He knows of only three left and thinks his is the only one in mint condition. Featuring an image of the hotel and its pointy minarets, the artistry of the object still draws a gasp from its owner decades after he acquired it.\n\nThen there is his collection of spoons from the hotel; maps detailing the layout of the city in its early years; musket balls from Egmont Key\u2019s Fort Dade; and a host of Ybor City and West Tampa cigar labels, signs and boxes dating to the area\u2019s days as cigar capital of the world.\n\nHis collection tells the story of Tampa\u2019s earliest years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable collection,\u201d said Cynthia Gandee Zinober, executive director of the Plant Museum, which tells the story of the former Tampa Bay Hotel. \u201cHis material on the hotel is in many ways superior to what the Plant Museum has in its own archives.\u201d\n\nThe slot machine, though, remains his crown jewel. He fawns over it like a boy.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\n\u201cSmell this,\u201d Osterweil said as he opened the slot machine, which he keeps in his storefront\u2019s back office. \u201cThe inside smells the same as it did in 1937. That is history you smell. It never ceases to amaze me.\u201d\n\nOsterweil doesn\u2019t work in collectibles for the money. He said he is financially comfortable.\n\nHe does it for the fulfillment he gets helping charities and to see the faces of fellow collectors when he produces something they long have sought.\n\nHe also does it to support his addiction to collecting.\n\nOsterweil is so consumed with the hobby he can\u2019t do business at a bank without asking the teller for change in half-dollar coins. He tells the bank employees his grandchildren are coin collectors \u2014 a half-truth, he later admits.\n\nHe actually is looking for rare coins. On a recent bank visit, he walked out with a coin worth $10.\n\n\u201cI got 20 times its face value,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that is really exciting.\u201d\n\nHis collecting started with coins in 1955, inspired by his grandfather.\n\nHe next turned to autographs, from minor league baseball players in Savannah in the beginning.\n\nOsterweil\u2019s parents owned a toy store in Savannah and offered him the chance to start his own small business. They gave him a corner of the store to sell his coins and autographs.\n\nIn those days before the Internet, he would search newspapers for garage sales and collectibles shows. Autographs from minor leaguers gave way to more famous names.\n\nOsterweil arrived in Tampa in 1972 and worked as a city planner through the Model Cities program, which used federal grant money to tackle problems facing Tampa\u2019s inner city.\n\nHe later founded a security company.\n\nAnd all the while he continued to collect memorabilia, mostly coins and sports and entertainment items.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nIn the 1970s Osterweil lived next door to Tony Pizzo, one of Tampa\u2019s best-known historians. A statue of Pizzo stands in Ybor City at Ninth Avenue and 17th Street, placed there after his death.\n\nPizzo fired Osterweil\u2019s passion for tracking down items of historic significance to Tampa.\n\nHe introduced Osterweil to a series of postcards from the early 1900s depicting scenes from throughout Florida. Twenty-three of them are from Tampa, such as the Ballast Point Pavilion and the domed Hillsborough County Courthouse on Franklin Street, both now gone.\n\nEach image has an alligator border.\n\nPizzo challenged Osterweil to find the entire set of postcards, all 164 of them.\n\n\u201cI do things to the nth degree,\u201d Osterweil said. \u201cWhen I get started, I cannot stop.\u201d\n\nHe crisscrossed the country for 15 years to complete the collection, visiting large memorabilia shows and calling fellow collectors whenever he heard a rumor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people can understand the excitement of tracking down something like the gator borders. It\u2019s a rush,\u201d he said.\n\nIn time, his memorabilia collection grew too large to contain in his home.\n\nHe sold his security company in 1998, and his wife suggested he turn his hobby into a second career.\n\n\u201cShe suggested I call it \u2018Gems and Junk\u2019 and she would help me,\u201d he said, and then quipped, \u201cShe was the gem, and I was the junk.\u201d\n\nHe took her advice, but not on the name of the company.\n\nHe continues to scour the country for collectibles. The Internet has made it easier, as long as he does his due diligence to ensure authenticity.\n\nAnd though some items are closer to his heart than others, every piece he owns is up for sale for the right price \u2014 even his beloved slot machine.\n\n\u201cI used to say I would never sell it. Then I realized two things: That is bad business, and never is a long time.\u201d\n\npguzzo@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7604", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 26 May 2014 20:21:35 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Growing up in Savannah, Georgia, John Osterweil often visited the DeSoto Hotel at nearby Tybee Island with his grandfather.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Growing up in Savannah, Georgia, John Osterweil often visited the DeSoto Hotel at nearby Tybee Island with his grandfather.", "title": "Collectibles shop owner captures Tampa history", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/collectibles-shop-owner-captures-tampa-history-20140526/", "image": {"width": 2674, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140526/ARTICLE/140529419/EP/1/2/EP-140529419.jpg", "height": 2028}, "updated_time": "2014-05-26T20:21:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Growing up in Savannah, Georgia, John Osterweil often visited the DeSoto Hotel at nearby Tybee Island with his grandfather.", "title": "Collectibles shop owner captures Tampa history", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140526/ARTICLE/140529419/AR/0/AR-140529419.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-26T20:21:35Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-26T20:21:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29e5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you find something you like, you had better buy it right away before someone else does,\u201d Osterweil said.\nIn time, his memorabilia collection grew too large to contain in his home.\nSelections from his collection were recently on display at a fundraiser for Ronald McDonald House Charities of Tampa Bay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable collection,\u201d said Cynthia Gandee Zinober, executive director of the Plant Museum, which tells the story of the former Tampa Bay Hotel.\nHis business is Memorabilia Magic, a West Tampa storefront filled wall-to-wall with vintage things from sports, entertainment, politics and history \u2014 all for sale and available on consignment for charity auctions."}
