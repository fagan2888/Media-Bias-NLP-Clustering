Insurers and government officials in Wyoming are bracing for an impending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a challenge to the Affordable Care Act that could leave nearly 20,000 state residents without health coverage.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on a legal challenge to the federal law.

The challenge targets the federal insurance exchange system that allows people in Wyoming and more than 30 other states to purchase insurance and receive federal tax credits to offset the cost. People in states that run their own insurance exchanges wouldn't be affected.

Wyoming Insurance Commissioner Tom Glause says most Wyoming program participants couldn't afford insurance without federal subsidies.

A spokesman for Gov. Matt Mead says state officials will review the decision and determine the best way to respond.
