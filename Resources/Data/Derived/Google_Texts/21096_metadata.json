The report concluded that banks\u2019 third-party vendors have significant potential cyber security vulnerabilities. Superintendent Lawsky said that the regulations will strengthen cyber security standards for banks\u2019 third-party vendors, including potential measures related to cyber security representations and warranties that banks receive from their vendors.\n\nThe NYDFS report surveyed 40 covered entities and identified what it described as a number of potentially significant security gaps. Among other issues, the report found that:\n\nLess than 50% of the institutions surveyed required any on-site assessments of vendor cybersecurity practices; only 46% required these evaluations to be conducted before a vendor was retained; and only 35% conducted periodic on-site inspection after the vendor was hired.\n\nOver 20% of surveyed banks did not ask vendors to warrant that they had adequate cybersecurity practices and procedures in place. Of the banks that called for such representations, only 36% required that the warranties also apply to subcontractors.\n\n44% of banks did not expect their vendors to guarantee that data and other products provided by them would be free of viruses and other cybersecurity issues.\n\n30% of the surveyed organizations did not require vendors to notify them of cybersecurity breaches.\n\nThe agency also stated that it would be surveying a group of regulated insurers for similar issues concerning the cybersecurity of third-party vendors.\n\nFor more information, the full statement can be found here and the report can be accessed here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Based on a report released last week about cyber security vulnerabilities faced by financial institutions, New York State Department of Financial Services the agency will soon move forward with cyber security regulations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/cyber-security-regulations-ahead-says-new-york-state-s-dept-financial-services", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "type": "article", "description": "Based on a report released last week about cyber security vulnerabilities faced by financial institutions, New York State Department of Financial Services (&amp;ldquo;NYDFS&amp;rdquo;) Superintendent Benjamin", "title": "Cyber Security Regulations Ahead Says New York State\u2019s Dept. of Financial Services"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Cyber Security, New York State Department of Financial Services, NYSDFS, Regulations, Data Protection", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Cyber Security, New York State Department of Financial Services, NYSDFS, Regulations, Data Protection"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa52\"", "article_summary": "Sunday, April 19, 2015Based on a report released last week about cyber security vulnerabilities faced by financial institutions, New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYDFS\u201d) Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky signaled that the agency will soon move forward with cyber security regulations.\nSuperintendent Lawsky said that the regulations will strengthen cyber security standards for banks\u2019 third-party vendors, including potential measures related to cyber security representations and warranties that banks receive from their vendors.\nThe report concluded that banks\u2019 third-party vendors have significant potential cyber security vulnerabilities.\nThe NYDFS report surveyed 40 covered entities and identified what it described as a number of potentially significant security gaps.\nThe agency also stated that it would be surveying a group of regulated insurers for similar issues concerning the cybersecurity of third-party vendors."}
