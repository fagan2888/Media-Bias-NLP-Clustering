As Marsha Blackburn, who ranks second on the House Energy Committee, declared, in connection with the pope\u2019s address, \u201cI don\u2019t think you will see me being persuaded.\u201d\n\nAll of this raises an interesting question: Why exactly are the Republicans so determined to ignore reality? Why won\u2019t they listen to anyone? The answer is actually simple: The reality of climate change demonstrates that progressives are right and they are wrong. Not just wrong about the effect of human activity on the environment, but wrong about their basic approach to the problems of the modern world.\n\nRepublican ideology is based on the idea of freedom for capitalists (another concern voiced by Pope Francis). For progressives, freedom involves the ability of ordinary people to express themselves, to choose their own level of religious observance and, increasingly, to receive the education and healthcare that they need to function in modern society. For conservatives, it means the ability of property owners and large corporations to use their economic power any way they wish, to determine exactly how they will treat their employees and what they will say to the consumers who depend on the products they produce.\n\nAmericans have rejected this approach for over 100 years, perhaps since the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. We insist that the way large business enterprises deal with their employees and their customers must be regulated. More recently, we have insisted that the impact of these enterprises on the environment needs to be regulated as well, and that they cannot be permitted to pour poison into our waters and fumes into our air at will.\n\nRecognizing the reality of climate change will necessarily lead to further forms of regulation. That reality emphasizes what physical and social scientists have come to recognize in recent years: that the most recent geological era (usually called the holocene) has ended, and that we are now in an entirely new situation, often described as the anthropocene \u2013 the era of human domination. We now decide whether plant and animal species survive or go extinct, we control the drainage patterns of the lakes and rivers, we determine the extent of the forests and the grasslands. Now it\u2019s become clear that we are decisively affecting the basic climate of the Earth \u2013 the temperature of the air and of the seas, the patterns of atmospheric and oceanic currents, the size of the polar ice caps, the frequency of violent storms, and the general habitability our the only place where we will ever live. The indelible image that our conquest of space has given us \u2013 that of our planet as a small, blue and white ball turning in a void \u2013 carries an important message. Because of our technology, we truly hold the Earth in the palm of our hand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It isn't just that conservatives disagree with the pontiff's politics.
