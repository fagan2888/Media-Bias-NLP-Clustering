And not necessary, as we shall see.\n\nWhile going to any college is far better than not attending one at all, not all higher education degrees confer the same benefit. And while elite colleges tend to be expensive, they\u2019re also likely to provide more financial aid, too.\n\nThe education advocacy group A+ Denver has released a report detailing just how few of Colorado\u2019s low-income kids go to top-tier colleges \u2014 just 3 percent of such graduates.\n\nMeanwhile, 12 percent of Colorado kids who graduate who are not low income go to those schools.\n\nPart of the answer to this gap is obvious: a general improvement in Colorado\u2019s educational system. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nBut the report, called \u201cMissing the Bus,\u201d provides other clues, too.\n\nFor one, the report notes that children who receive free or reduced-price lunches and live in wealthier districts are more likely to attend top-tier colleges, while low-income students who live in districts with higher concentrations of poverty are less likely to do so.\n\nIs that a function of higher expectations? A curriculum more geared toward college prep? Or are the kids in poor districts generally worse off than their peers in wealthier districts? Not all poverty is created equal.\n\nBut policy-makers aren\u2019t helpless even without the answers to those questions. As it happens, a handful of the state\u2019s high schools seem to do a better job at sending low-income kids to top-tier colleges, a list of 169 compiled by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe top tier includes elite Ivy League schools, private colleges and flagship state schools. The ranking, admittedly arbitrary, does not include \u201caccess\u201d schools, such as community colleges.\n\nIn Colorado, the two programs that send the most low-income kids to top-tier colleges are George Washington High School\u2019s International Baccalaureate program and Denver School of Science and Technology. Both are in Denver and both are highly regarded for their rigorous curriculums. Bravo.\n\nYet, the raw numbers even for these schools are low. For instance, George Washington scored the highest in the report, sending 44 percent of its low-income kids to top-tier schools over three academic years. But that was only 17 students. And the numbers at other schools are even smaller.\n\nWe can do better by Colorado students. Indeed, we must.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Can the poor get into top colleges?", "title": "Can the poor get into top colleges?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/21/can-the-poor-get-into-top-colleges/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141121__OP24COLLEGESp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141121__OP24COLLEGESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-21T17:02:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:11:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c73\"", "article_summary": "The education advocacy group A+ Denver has released a report detailing just how few of Colorado\u2019s low-income kids go to top-tier colleges \u2014 just 3 percent of such graduates.\nIn Colorado, the two programs that send the most low-income kids to top-tier colleges are George Washington High School\u2019s International Baccalaureate program and Denver School of Science and Technology.\nMeanwhile, 12 percent of Colorado kids who graduate who are not low income go to those schools.\nWe can do better by Colorado students.\nThe top tier includes elite Ivy League schools, private colleges and flagship state schools."}
