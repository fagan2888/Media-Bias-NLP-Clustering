That\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nThe Caller will never be called boring. Carlson and his staff of 50 draw visitors to the site with a blend of high-energy reporting (especially on anything having to do with the Obama administration), right-leaning opinion columns and a hearty dose of semi-SFW slideshows of the female form. \u201cWe care about traffic,\u201d Carlson told me unapologetically.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Caller is more than click-bait, though: It\u2019s a gamble that right-leaning readers hunger not only for opinion pieces written by their own\u2014the bread and butter of established conservative magazines like the Weekly Standard and National Review and the Wall Street Journal opinion page\u2014but that they\u2019re looking for news reported by their own as well. In recent years, a whole new media ecosystem has sprung up around this premise, bringing new energy and digital savvy (and a lot more busty slideshows) to compete with the occasionally stodgy old outlets of the right.\n\nThe energy behind the moment, without question, is the hardening opposition to President Obama and the glimpse of life beyond his second term. As the Obama era slouches wearily into its sixth year, conservatives see the chance\u2014the mandate, even\u2014to torment, debunk and distract from his agenda, even to effect its failure. That might feel familiar. As Ben Domenech, who co-founded RedState and, more recently, a new conservative site called the Federalist, pointed out to me, it\u2019s \u201ckind of the same way there was a proliferation of folks on the left starting up places\u201d like the Huffington Post and Think Progress at a similar point in President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure. In the eyes of the left, the media herd had fatally discredited itself by accepting the Bush administration\u2019s Iraq intelligence. The time seemed right for a more activist era of journalism, and the new liberal blogs\u2014back before blogs were declared over\u2014took as a founding principle the notion that they could be both opinionated and purveyors of news.\n\nThat philosophy has since been enthusiastically embraced by media entrepreneurs on the right, who see in what Sarah Palin famously called \u201cthe lame-stream media\u201d an establishment hopelessly biased against their cause. The new outlets range widely in size, scope and bent. Smaller, more targeted sites like the Washington Free Beacon and Domenech\u2019s Federalist seek to go deep on the issues and sway the conversation in Washington. The Blaze, founded by Glenn Beck in 2010, sees enormous traffic\u2014more than 20 million unique visitors over the last month, dwarfing its competitors\u2014and is far more omnivorous, almost as if Yahoo! were reimagined by a fierce conservative. (The site\u2019s \u201c About\u201d page concludes: \u201cWe answer to God and you.\u201d) The elder statesman of the group, Breitbart.com, which was founded in 2007 by the late provocateur Andrew Breitbart, seems to be the outlet of choice for Tea Party activists. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be carrying a \u2018Don\u2019t Tread on Me\u2019 flag outside the Capitol building, you\u2019re probably going to Breitbart first,\u201d a Republican press strategist told me. The Daily Caller, for its part, sits somewhere in the middle, playing both the inside and outside game.\n\nAll together, these outlets add up to a movement with sufficient mass to make a measurable difference in how politics is reported. \u201cOur coverage of proposed immigration reform/amnesty, the attack on gun rights, and the Obamacare debacle shaped both the debate and the outcome,\u201d Alex Marlow, Breitbart\u2019s editor in chief boasted in an email. \u201cWe also fought back, successfully, against various media outlets that are hostile to those with Judeo-Christian and conservative values.\u201d\n\nAs another conservative put it: \u201cYou could spend $5 million on a week of ads, and what do you get for that? For $5 million you can launch a newspaper and beat up the administration all year.\u201d\n\n***\n\nCertainly Carlson, Domenech and the rest have done their share of beating up on Obama. But the idea is to go beyond landing punches and build an actual readership by getting people to stay on the page. So, hours after Obama announced that newly canceled health care plans would be un-canceled for a year, the Daily Caller led with a grabbily headlined news item: \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Like My Plan, You Can Tweak It.\u201d But also featured on the site that day were \u201c Here\u2019s the newest Playboy playmate\u201d and a listicle touting \u201c 15 hottest moments from the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show.\u201d Carlson is unapologetic about the high-low vibe; he just hired gossip columnist Betsy Rothstein from the media water-cooler site FishbowlDC, and he plans to add more sports coverage, too. As for the salacious stuff, Carlson defends the more titillating fare as \u201ccelebrating pulchritude in a way that\u2019s edifying and uplifting\u201d\u2014before conceding the more relevant point: \u201cIn any case, readers love it.\u201d\n\nApparently. According to Carlson, the Caller had more than 9 million unique visitors in October, rivaling websites like Slate and, well, Politico. He\u2019s circumspect about the Caller\u2019s financials but said the site has been making money for a little more than a year. \u201cI\u2019ll put it this way,\u201d he said, \u201cin contrast to virtually everyone else in Washington, we aren\u2019t a nonprofit.\u201d\n\nThe news organization that Carlson built reflects his own attributes\u2014cavalier, colorful, at times impolitic\u2014occasionally to a fault. In June of last year, Neil Munro, a Caller reporter, interrupted Obama during a Rose Garden speech on immigration, shouting, \u201cWhy\u2019d you favor foreigners over Americans?\u201d The outburst earned the Daily Caller a round of finger-wagging from the White House, and from frustrated competitors. Carlson stepped in to cover for his man, saying, \u201cThis is what reporters are supposed to do. They're supposed to get their questions answered.\u201d Then in March, the Caller found itself in hot water over a shaky story about two Dominican women who claimed that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) had paid them for sex, which Menendez denied outright, satisfying most other outlets that there was no story. A lawyer for the women came forward to say that someone from the Caller had paid him to find prostitutes who would fabricate such a story. Carlson denied the lawyer\u2019s charges.\n\n\u201cI think the Caller's work over the years has been decidedly mixed,\u201d said Jon Ward, a former White House correspondent for the Daily Caller who now works at Huffington Post. \u201cBut I'm cheering for them to keep moving closer to the bar Tucker set in 2009, when he talked about a conservative outlet with the same kind of accuracy and depth and insight in reporting as the New York Times.\u201d In an email, Ward credited Carlson with encouraging him to \u201cswing for the fences more often, to punch hard (my emphasis to him was that I wanted my punches to connect), to not be so worried about angering a government official or a politician.\u201d Carlson, Ward said, \u201ctaught me to give fewer fucks.\u201d\n\nReid Cherlin is a writer in New York and a former White House spokesman in the Obama administration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Come for the Obama bashing, stay for the busty slideshows and viral videos.", "title": "The HuffPo-ization of the Right", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/conservative-media-huffpo-ization-of-the-right-101877.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/07/140107_cherlin_mediagrid.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Fourth Estate,Conservative Media", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Come for the Obama bashing, stay for the busty slideshows and viral videos.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd361c\"", "article_summary": "The Daily Caller, for its part, sits somewhere in the middle, playing both the inside and outside game.\n\u201cWe have no right to be boring or irrelevant,\u201d Tucker Carlson says.\n\u201cI think the Caller's work over the years has been decidedly mixed,\u201d said Jon Ward, a former White House correspondent for the Daily Caller who now works at Huffington Post.\nThat philosophy has since been enthusiastically embraced by media entrepreneurs on the right, who see in what Sarah Palin famously called \u201cthe lame-stream media\u201d an establishment hopelessly biased against their cause.\nAccording to Carlson, the Caller had more than 9 million unique visitors in October, rivaling websites like Slate and, well, Politico."}
