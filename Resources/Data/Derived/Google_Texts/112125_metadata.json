Hoffer said Gruber\u2019s invoices billed Vermont $100 per hour for the work of a research assistant \u2014 1,000 hours in 10 weeks.\n\n\u201cTo do so, the RA would have worked exclusively on this project for more than 14 hours per day \u2014 every day,\u201d the auditor said. \u201cThe evidence suggests that Dr. Gruber overstated the hours worked by the RA and that the Agency of Administration ignored the obvious signs that something was amiss.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general said in an interview that Hoffer raised \u201cserious questions.\u201d\n\nGruber said in an email Monday he did not wish to comment.\n\nAn adviser to the Obama administration on the federal Affordable Care Act, Gruber told groups in 2012 and 2013 that voter stupidity and a \u201clack of transparency\u201d were important to passing the hard-fought legislation. He has apologized repeatedly for his comments, saying they were uninformed, \u201cglib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting.\u201d\n\nVermont Administration Secretary Justin Johnson said Monday the two state officials working with Gruber, Robin Lunge and Michael Costa, were in contact with him frequently enough \u2014 sometimes multiple times a day \u2014 to monitor his work.\n\nStill, Johnson said he is urging staff to step up contract vigilance, and he agreed with Hoffer\u2019s criticism that Gruber\u2019s invoices need more detail. He said state officials had assumed Gruber had multiple assistants working with him, but later learned there was just one.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the work was done, but clearly it would have been better if we had documented that and they had documented that,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHoffer said the round numbers in Gruber\u2019s invoices were a red flag.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that Dr. Gruber\u2019s first invoice reported round numbers of hours worked (100 for Mr. Gruber and 500 for the research assistants),\u201d Hoffer wrote. \u201cThis is possible, but unlikely. In addition, the second invoice reported exactly the same figures, which is implausible.\u201d\n\nVermont contracted with Gruber in July to do economic modeling for Green Mountain Care, a universal, publicly-funded health care system that had been in development since the Legislature passed and Gov. Peter Shumlin signed a bill in 2011 to create the system. Shumlin ended up pulling the plug on Green Mountain Care in December, saying it would be too expensive.\n\nJohnson said the state has paid $160,000 to date on what initially was a $450,000 contract, including $50,000 for a subcontractor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about \"the stupidity of the American voter\" was a target Monday in a report from the Vermont state auditor saying the economist may have padded his bills to the state.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d was a target Monday in a report from the Vermont state auditor saying the economist may have padded his bills to the state.", "title": "Jonathan Gruber, Obamacare architect, may have padded bills to Vermont, auditor says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/23/jonathan-gruber-obamacare-architect-may-have-padde/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/23/Gruber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/23/Gruber.jpg", "description": "A Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about \"the stupidity of the American voter\" was a target Monday in a report from the Vermont", "card": "summary", "title": "Jonathan Gruber, Obamacare architect, may have padded bills to Vermont"}, "Author": "Dave Gram", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Gruber, Douglas Hoffer, Justin Johnson"}, "article_summary": "Hoffer said Gruber\u2019s invoices billed Vermont $100 per hour for the work of a research assistant \u2014 1,000 hours in 10 weeks.\nAuditor of Accounts Douglas Hoffer said he referred his findings on Jonathan Gruber and his contract with the state to Attorney General William Sorrell.\nStill, Johnson said he is urging staff to step up contract vigilance, and he agreed with Hoffer\u2019s criticism that Gruber\u2019s invoices need more detail.\nHoffer said the round numbers in Gruber\u2019s invoices were a red flag.\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that Dr. Gruber\u2019s first invoice reported round numbers of hours worked (100 for Mr. Gruber and 500 for the research assistants),\u201d Hoffer wrote."}
