The Obama administration is trying to impose its transgender ideology on medical professionals, apparently without regard to the impact on the profession.

The Obama administration has imposed new regulations under the Affordable Care Act that require medical personnel and hospitals to provide hormone and surgical procedures for transgender-confused people, including sex reassignment - even if it violates their medical judgment or religious beliefs.

Dr. Gene Rudd of the Christian Medical Association tells OneNewsNow the new regulation only exacerbates an already existing problem in healthcare.

“Certainly it's going to be fought tooth and nail, because underlying this is a right of conscience for all individuals in our society to work within their moral convictions and not be forced to do something that violates their conscience,” he tells OneNewsNow.

Rudd says right of conscience is already a growing problem on other social issues in healthcare such as abortion, adding that four out of ten CMA members have been pressured to violate their conscience, and one in four have suffered consequences for refusing to do so.

“Since doctors of faith provide a disproportionate amount of care for the poor, 95 percent of them have said, We would have to leave medicine before we would violate our conscience,” he explains. “If these rules get enforced and tend to violate conscience, we're going to see a mass exodus of the very doctors we most need in healthcare.”

Rudd doesn't expect an answer from Congress for now because of gridlock and political posturing. “Sometimes it takes legal efforts to prevent the administration from bullying people in society in order to gain what they want,” he says.
