That\u2019s according to research at the University of Michigan.\n\nHeadaches are one of the most common reasons people go to the doctor \u2014 up to a quarter of all doctor visits, says Shots.\n\nSending a billion dollars \u201cdown the drain.\u201d Annually.\n\nPresumably people are getting the scans because they\u2019re worried that headache is a sign of something much more scary \u2014 say a brain tumor.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem. Most headaches are just that \u2014 a headache.\n\nFrom the Shots post:\n\n(S)ince headaches are almost never caused by a tumor or other serious brain problem, that $1 billion is money down the drain, according to Dr. Brian Callaghan, the assistant professor of neurology who led the study. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big number,\u201d Callaghan told Shots. \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible number of MRIs and CTs that people get.\u201d From 2007 to 2010, people visited the doctor 51 million times for headache-related problems, according to a national database of outpatient visits. And 12 percent of the time, the doctors sent their patients for a brain scan. Those numbers are on the rise, the analysis found, even though guidelines urge doctors to shun the scans. The results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nI\u2019m guilty of sending part of that billion down the drain. A few years ago, I was driving on the highway with my two children in the back seat. I glanced down, then back at the road, and suddenly was seeing double. I managed to pull over but was very shaken. I didn\u2019t know if I was having a stroke. But over a few minutes, the symptoms subsided. I won\u2019t drag you through everything I did next, but in short, I got home safely and made an appointment with the doctor.\n\nShe listened to my story, then pointed out that this episode was likely a version of the migraines I get. Migraines are often preceded by an aura, a visual effect that can include flashing lights or blind spots, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nBut I was freaked out. She referred me to an ophthalmologist with whom I had a long conversation about getting an MRI. He said he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nI did it.\n\nI was lucky \u2014 not because the MRI came back normal (which I\u2019m sure you expected by now) but also because it didn\u2019t turn up any false positives as can happen, often, with MRIs. If the MRI turns up something suspicious, it can \u201cprompt a cascade of tests and invasive procedures,\u201d Shots says, over things that will never cause any harm.\n\nBut that\u2019s not as bad as a CT scan \u2014 in that case, you\u2019re exposing your brain to needless radiation. Personally, I like my brain not irradiated, if at all possible.\n\nPatients like me certainly bear some responsibility, but doctors are guilty as well, says Callaghan. Ordering a scan both gets the patient out the door quickly and it does make the patient feel like someone is taking care of them.\n\nStill, there are times you should worry. Again, from Shots:\n\nWhen should we worry? If a severe headache strikes suddenly, the neurologists say. People also should seek medical help for headaches that are markedly different than ones in the past, are brought on by exertion, or come with fever, vomiting, loss of coordination, or a change in vision, speech or alertness.\n\nIn retrospect, my doctor was taking care of me by pointing out the correct problem: the migraine. In the weeks after that first episode, I had a few more episodes of double vision. It turns out if I stopped what I was doing, closed my eyes and took some deep breaths, my vision returned to normal.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot cheaper and easier than an MRI.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans spend $1 billion on brain scans annually, but headaches are almost always nothing serious.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Yes, It's A Headache.
