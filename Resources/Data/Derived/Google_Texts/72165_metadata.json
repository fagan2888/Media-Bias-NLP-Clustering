In November, it reversed itself and gave gynecologists permission to screen and treat men at high risk for anal cancer. Then the board said gynecologists who had been treating men with chronic pelvic pain could continue to see current patients.\n\nBut with few other exceptions, the policy stands: No male patients.\n\nThe to-and-fro has sent doctors scrambling to cut ties with patients, then to reinstate them. And the board's pronouncements have puzzled many, including some physicians, who wonder what harm there is in gynecologists' treating men and whether a specialty board has the authority to impose such a rule.\n\nThe board said the ban was part of a larger effort to preserve the integrity of the gynecology specialty and to protect patients from doctors who had begun to practice types of medicine for which they had not been trained or certified. But in casting a wide net to curb abuses, the board may have snared more doctors and patients than it had intended.\n\nThe gynecology board is one of 24 boards that certify medical specialists in the United States, based on training, exams and other requirements. Certification is voluntary and not required by law, but in practice it is essential, because most hospitals and insurers require it and patients are increasingly encouraged to choose only specialists who are certified.\n\nThe gynecology episode began when the board posted on its website a newly explicit definition of the specialty, with a requirement that members devote at least 75 percent of their practice to gynecology. In addition, treating male patients was prohibited, with exceptions for, among other things, circumcising babies, testing for infertility and treating transgender people.\n\nTwo board members -- the executive director, Dr. Larry C. Gilstrap, and the director of evaluation, Dr. Kenneth L. Noller -- said too many gynecologists had been straying into areas like testosterone therapy for men, liposuction, plastic surgery and other cosmetic procedures for both women and men. The board members said some of these doctors were behaving unethically and unprofessionally by presenting themselves as \"board certified\" without revealing that their certification was in obstetrics and gynecology, potentially misleading patients into thinking the certification was in plastic surgery or some other specialty.\n\nAs for treating men, Gilstrap said: \"If you voluntarily want to be known as a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, it's restricted to taking care of women. We really need the specialty. There are plenty of physicians out there to take care of men.\"\n\nHe noted that treating women has been the official mission of the specialty since 1935, and that the notice in September was really just a restatement and a reminder.\n\n\"I have three daughters and six granddaughters,\" he said, \"and I can tell you that women have been getting shortchanged in research and studies for as long as I've been a doctor.\"\n\nStephanie Prendergast, a physical therapist in San Francisco and president of the pelvic pain society, said the board's permission to treat chronic pelvic pain was good news, but that she wished it had been extended to new patients as well, because gynecologists often have the most success in diagnosing and treating pelvic pain in men. The condition is poorly understood, Prendergast said, adding that patients typically see five doctors and have symptoms for a year before they receive the correct diagnosis.\n\nArthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, said, \"I think using the male-female boundary -- it's old-fashioned and should change. What should be the basis of certification and specialization is what skills you have, what knowledge you have that can benefit patients. A bright line for male-female in 1935 might have made sense. In 2013 it doesn't.\"\n\n\u2013Denise Grady, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/01/hfqa07.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf21a\"", "article_summary": "Then the board said gynecologists who had been treating men with chronic pelvic pain could continue to see current patients.\nA: A medical specialty board stirred up a hornet's nest in September when it warned gynecologists that if they accepted male patients, they could lose their certification.\nIn November, it reversed itself and gave gynecologists permission to screen and treat men at high risk for anal cancer.\nAnd the board's pronouncements have puzzled many, including some physicians, who wonder what harm there is in gynecologists' treating men and whether a specialty board has the authority to impose such a rule.\nThe gynecology board is one of 24 boards that certify medical specialists in the United States, based on training, exams and other requirements."}
