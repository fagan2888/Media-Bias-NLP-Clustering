And while the law has helped reduce the proportion of uninsured Americans from 20 to 15 percent, according to The Commonwealth Fund, it has left millions without coverage.\n\nThese uninsured Americans, falling into a gap created by the ACA, are too poor to receive assistance on their health insurance premiums, but make too much to qualify for Medicaid, putting them in a difficult predicament when costly medical bills come due.\n\nWhen Rush last shopped for coverage \u2013 while working full time at a local events center that didn\u2019t offer benefits he could afford \u2013 he says he didn\u2019t qualify for subsidies under the ACA. But because Nebraska didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, he didn\u2019t qualify for that either.\n\n\u201cBoth of my kids are on Medicaid,\u201d says Rush, who has a daughter, 5, and a son, 3. Rush lost that job and briefly had access to Medicaid, but once his unemployment benefits kicked in, he made too much money and again had to go without coverage.\n\nCourt Ruling Creates Gap\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court determined Medicaid expansion as written in the ACA couldn\u2019t be forced on states. Each state can decide whether to expand coverage. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, 21 have not and two are debating the issue.\n\n\u201cThe way that the law was originally intended was that there would be a continuum of coverage for people across the income spectrum,\u201d says Rachel Garfield, senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation and associate director for the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The poorest Americans would be eligible for Medicaid; those in the middle would get their coverage through an employer or the ACA marketplace; and those with the highest incomes could purchase their insurance where they saw fit.\n\nWith the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, this continuum was interrupted.\n\n\u201cBecause the intention was that there would be this continuum, the way the law was written was so that those at the lowest income levels are not eligible for tax credits to purchase coverage in the marketplace,\u201d Garfield explains. \u201cSo, if they\u2019re in a state that doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid, they are left with no financial assistance for coverage under the ACA.\u201d\n\nThis tear in the continuum created a gap \u2013 one that Rush fell into.\n\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t find anything under $140 per month, the last time I looked, and as a single father raising two small children on a limited income, even that was something I felt like I couldn\u2019t afford,\u201d Rush says. He estimates he would need to bring in $40,000 to comfortably afford health insurance. But at that level, he\u2019s worried his children wouldn\u2019t be eligible for Medicaid.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the average bronze Marketplace plan to cost $224 a month in 2014. This may not seem like much for many Americans, but represents 25 to 50 percent of the monthly income of people who fall into the gap.\n\n\u201cWe estimate about 4 million people fall into this situation,\u201d Garfield says. \"[These people] would have been eligible for Medicaid had their state been expanded, but are not eligible for anything because their state decided not to.\u201d\n\nWho are these people? By definition, they are the poor, with incomes between 50 and 100 percent of the federal poverty level. But that\u2019s not the only characteristic worth pointing out, Garfield says. Most of them are adults without children, 86 percent live in the South, over half are middle-aged or older and minorities are disproportionately represented. Also, they work.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the people who fall into the gap are in a working family,\" Garfield says. \"They are just working in jobs that don\u2019t offer affordable health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nWhere to Turn if You\u2019re Uninsured\n\nSo where do you turn if you\u2019re one of the millions who have been shut out of some of the benefits that make health insurance affordable under the ACA?\n\n\u201cWhether or not you have insurance, you\u2019re likely to have a health need,\u201d Garfield says. In other words, your health won\u2019t take a back seat just because you don\u2019t have coverage.\n\nGarfield recommends the uninsured look into Medicaid even if their state didn\u2019t expand, explaining there are some pathways in those states that could make some people eligible.\n\nRush has found a temporary solution, returning to school full time and working part time in a federal work-study program. Medicaid may finally be available. He has submitted income evaluations to the state and is awaiting a response.\n\nGarfield further suggests uninsured folks explore the options available in their community, using local clinics and other resources designed to help people who can\u2019t afford medical care.\n\nThese cost-saving strategies may also be helpful:", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Even if heart disease runs in your family, you can take steps to dramatically reduce your risk.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "A look at where to turn when you end up without coverage.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A look at where to turn when you end up without coverage.", "title": "Uninsured Under the ACA: Millions of Americans Can\u2019t Afford Coverage", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/12/15/uninsured-under-the-aca-millions-of-americans-cant-afford-coverage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/57/ef/5ac0b2e84615989235a7c7ac665d/141215-healthcosts-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A look at where to turn when you end up without coverage.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Uninsured Under the ACA: Millions of Americans Can\u2019t Afford Coverage - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-12-15", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b5e3381/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F57%2Fef%2F5ac0b2e84615989235a7c7ac665d%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141215-healthcosts-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Medicaid,health insurance,HealthInsurance-Bucket-Obamacare [Consumer Advice],Elizabeth Renter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-12-15"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z4qk99", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0985\"", "article_summary": "Affordable health insurance for all Americans was one of the cornerstones and selling points of the ACA.\nIf you're struggling to secure health coverage, rest assured because you do have options.\n\"They are just working in jobs that don\u2019t offer affordable health insurance coverage.\u201dWhere to Turn if You\u2019re UninsuredSo where do you turn if you\u2019re one of the millions who have been shut out of some of the benefits that make health insurance affordable under the ACA?\nHe estimates he would need to bring in $40,000 to comfortably afford health insurance.\nAnd while the law has helped reduce the proportion of uninsured Americans from 20 to 15 percent, according to The Commonwealth Fund, it has left millions without coverage."}
