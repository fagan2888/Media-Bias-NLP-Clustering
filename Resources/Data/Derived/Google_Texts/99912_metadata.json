Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-WI) politically contentious plan to radically restructure the Medicare program \u2014 which independent analysts predicted would more than double health costs for the average 65-year-old \u2014 and criticized progressive lawmakers for failing to engage with Ryan\u2019s proposals. Despite recent evidence that the program\u2019s finances are secure, the former Florida governor suggested that Medicare isn\u2019t solvent.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people recognize that we need to make sure we fulfill the commitment to people that have already received the benefits, that are receiving the benefits. But that we need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others and move to a new system that allows them to have something \u2014 because they\u2019re not going to have anything,\u201d Bush said.\n\nAs MSNBC\u2019s Steve Benen points out, the position that the United States should end Medicare altogether is radical even among Republicans, who typically avoid taking the stance that the massive federal health program should be eliminated.\n\nGOP lawmakers have pushed back on Democrats\u2019 characterization that Ryan\u2019s proposal to privatize Medicare amounts to \u201cending the program as we know it,\u201d maintaining that they simply want to reform it. Even so, efforts to implement those reforms have been unsuccessful in Congress, largely because the health program is very popular among seniors and talking about changing it can be a political liability. This spring, Republicans quietly dropped the proposed policy in budget negotiations, and analysts predicted that the party might finally be giving up the fight against Medicare.\n\nBush\u2019s comments come just one week before Medicare and Medicaid, which Americans overwhelmingly rate among the most important government-run programs, will mark their 50th birthday. Across the country, there are events planned to mark the occasion and, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services describes it, recognize \u201cthe ways in which these programs have transformed the nation\u2019s health care system over the past five decades.\u201d\n\nThe Republican presidential hopeful is no fan of the country\u2019s existing health policies, however. Jeb Bush has previously said that he favors repealing Obamacare altogether because the advent of new technology like the Apple Watch will make the health law unnecessary.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Just in time for the program's 50th birthday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Just in time for the program's 50th birthday.", "title": "Jeb Bush Quietly Suggests \u2018Phasing Out\u2019 Medicare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/23/3683804/jeb-bush-medicare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_549646981527.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just in time for the program's 50th birthday.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_549646981527-321x214.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush Quietly Suggests \u2018Phasing Out\u2019 Medicare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_549646981527.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_549646981527.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-23T12:12:41+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16bb\"", "article_summary": "Health Jeb Bush Quietly Suggests \u2018Phasing Out\u2019 Medicare CREDIT: AP Photo/John LocherGOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggested that the United States should figure out a way to \u201cphase out\u201d Medicare, the federal program that provides insurance to more than 50 million elderly and disabled people, at a political event on Wednesday night.\nJeb Bush has previously said that he favors repealing Obamacare altogether because the advent of new technology like the Apple Watch will make the health law unnecessary.\nEven so, efforts to implement those reforms have been unsuccessful in Congress, largely because the health program is very popular among seniors and talking about changing it can be a political liability.\nDespite recent evidence that the program\u2019s finances are secure, the former Florida governor suggested that Medicare isn\u2019t solvent.\nThis spring, Republicans quietly dropped the proposed policy in budget negotiations, and analysts predicted that the party might finally be giving up the fight against Medicare."}
