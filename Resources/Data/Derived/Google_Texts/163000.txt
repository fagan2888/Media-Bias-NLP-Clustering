On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) defended his decision to sign a letter penned by his colleague Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and signed by 46 other Republicans senators warning the Iranian regime that any deal that doesn’t receive approval from the U.S. Senate stands the chance of being negated by a future administrations.

According to Cruz, the intent of the letter was to ensure that the United States’ national security were preserved. However, co-host Mika Brzezinski suggested otherwise.

“I’m still stuck on the fact that you are saying to me that what’s happening now in terms of the hardliners using the letter to stall on these negotiations was actually a part of your intention,” Brzezinski said. “It just seems extremely destructive.

“I think it’s not inappropriate for Congress to have a say and to have a voice and that’s what they’re there for,” she continued. “But to interfere with a negotiation with Iran, and to actually possibly even undermine a deal in the making — basically the next step to that is to just get right down the road to war.”

Co-host Joe Scarborough pushed back against Brzezinski’s charges, suggesting her analysis mentioning the possibility of war wasn’t necessarily the case and noted there is a past precedent of members of Congress challenging a commander-in-chief’s foreign policy abroad.
