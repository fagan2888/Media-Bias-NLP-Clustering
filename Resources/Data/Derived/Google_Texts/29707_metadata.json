In the end, the large portion of Chicago transplants went happily into the night, as the Blackhawks beat the Avalanche 3-2 on Wednesday.\n\nBryan Bickell\u2019s goal late in the third period against valiant goalie Calvin Pickard broke a tie game, one that was close in final score but not otherwise. Chicago dominated in puck possession and shots on goal, as an injury-ravaged Avs team just didn\u2019t have enough key personnel to compete for 60 minutes.\n\nAnd, especially, Avs coach Patrick Roy said, when Chicago was getting all the calls. The Blackhawks had nine minutes, 17 seconds of power-play time to 2:45 for Roy\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cI thought 5-on-5 we were the better team. It\u2019s kind of funny how this game goes; the last few games we\u2019ve had one or no power plays,\u201d Roy said. \u201cTonight, we gave them five in (the first) 33 minutes, and that\u2019s all they needed to score those first two goals. I just thought that they got away with things.\u201d\n\nSo did Avs veteran Alex Tanguay.\n\n\u201cI thought the game was pretty even at 5-on-5. But certainly they had more power-play chances than we did,\u201d Tanguay said. \u201cUsually it\u2019s pretty tight on the penalties when it\u2019s like that, and I thought there were a couple calls that could have come our way.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche had one really good stretch in the first two periods, from about the two-minute mark of the second to the 10-minute mark. The Avs got a 1-0 lead out of it, on Max Talbot\u2019s bang-bang goal in front of the net, after some good forechecking pressure from linemates Cody McLeod and Marc-Andre Cliche.\n\nBut the rest of the time, Chicago mostly carried the play, with only the strong early netminding of Pickard keeping the Avs in it. Then, when the Avs took a couple of penalties, the potent Chicago power play made them pay.\n\nAvs defender Nick Holden carried on his season of regressed play with a costly penalty at 12:51 of a 1-1 game. He got beat around the corner by Chicago\u2019s Andrew Shaw and was forced to grab him from behind. That earned Holden a holding violation, and Shaw scored as power-play goal at 14:21, a short-side shot that he didn\u2019t get a lot on, but it fooled Pickard nonetheless. Pickard was tremendous otherwise, making 42 saves in his second career start.\n\nTomas Vincour\u2019s high stick led to Chicago\u2019s first power-play goal, by Jonathan Toews at 11:50. Nathan MacKinnon should have tied it late in the second, staring at a wide-open net following a set-up pass from Ryan O\u2019Reilly, but MacKinnon had to put the puck to his forehand from the left side, and that little delay allowed Bickell to backcheck and break up his shot.\n\nHolden, however, did make a good play in the third. He helped keep a puck alive in the crease after Corey Crawford had stoned the Avs on some good chances. After Holden put a shot on net that was stopped, Ryan O\u2019Reilly backhanded the rebound home to tie it 2-2. It was O\u2019Reilly\u2019s first goal since Nov. 1 at St. Louis.\n\nHolden was the main defender beaten on the game-winning Chicago goal, though, scored by Bickel. Patrick Kane cut inside the slot area past Holden, coming down the right side, and got a shot on net that Pickard got a piece of, but not enough, and Bickell swept into the net.\n\n\u201cWith 10 injured players, I think our players certainly deserve a lot of credit for that performance,\u201d Roy said.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche loses at home on late goal to Blackhawks", "title": "Avalanche loses at home on late goal to Blackhawks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/26/avalanche-loses-at-home-on-late-goal-to-blackhawks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__avs-blackhawksp1.jpg", "height": 508}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__avs-blackhawksp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-26T21:38:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:52:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb774\"", "article_summary": "Tomas Vincour\u2019s high stick led to Chicago\u2019s first power-play goal, by Jonathan Toews at 11:50.\nHolden was the main defender beaten on the game-winning Chicago goal, though, scored by Bickel.\nIn the end, the large portion of Chicago transplants went happily into the night, as the Blackhawks beat the Avalanche 3-2 on Wednesday.\nHolden, however, did make a good play in the third.\nChicago dominated in puck possession and shots on goal, as an injury-ravaged Avs team just didn\u2019t have enough key personnel to compete for 60 minutes."}
