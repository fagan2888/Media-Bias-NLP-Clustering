Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page studied 1,779 policy outcomes over two decades and came to a pretty simple conclusion: the collective opinion of average citizens doesn't matter a whit:\n\nWhen the preferences of interest groups and the affluent are held constant, it just doesn't matter what average folks think about a policy proposal. When average citizens are opposed, there's a 30 percent chance of passage. When average citizens are wildly in favor, there's still only a 30 percent chance of passage. Conversely, the odds of passage go from zero when most of the affluent are opposed to more than 50 percent when most of the affluent are in favor.\n\nInterest group lobbying, it turns out, also has an effect on policymaking\u2014but business interest groups matter a lot more than mass interest groups. This comes via John Sides, who has much more detail about the study here. But none of it should come as a surprise. We've seen plenty of results like this before.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Or unless you get organized.", "title": "Nobody cares what you think unless you're rich", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/nobody-cares-what-you-think-unless-youre-rich", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_policy_preference_average_elite_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Nobody cares what you think unless you're rich", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/nobody-cares-what-you-think-unless-youre-rich", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_policy_preference_average_elite_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_policy_preference_average_elite_1.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Money+in+Politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8af\"", "article_summary": "Interest group lobbying, it turns out, also has an effect on policymaking\u2014but business interest groups matter a lot more than mass interest groups.\nWhen average citizens are wildly in favor, there's still only a 30 percent chance of passage.\nWhen average citizens are opposed, there's a 30 percent chance of passage.\nIn a simple model of democratic politics, there are three basic drivers of political decisionmaking:The collective opinion of average citizensThe collective opinion of the affluentThe lobbying of interest groupsBut which of these really matter?\nConversely, the odds of passage go from zero when most of the affluent are opposed to more than 50 percent when most of the affluent are in favor."}
