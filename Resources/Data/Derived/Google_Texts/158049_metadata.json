Six other states with similar bans \u2013 Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2013 are also affected by the decision because they are covered by the rulings of the Tenth Circuit and Fourth Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n\nEmployer requirements post-Windsor\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in United States v. Windsor in June 2013, federal law required employers to recognize all legally valid same-sex marriages \u2013 regardless of the state in which the couple resided \u2013 for all federal tax and ERISA Title 1 purposes. Those requirements remain unchanged. Monday\u2019s action simply expanded the number of states where same-sex couples can legally marry.\n\nFor Oklahoma employers, here\u2019s a quick rundown of the implications related to same-sex spouses:\n\nTax-qualified retirement plans \u2013 Same-sex spouses must be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses. Additionally, if an employer-sponsored retirement plan currently defines \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201cmarriage\u201d as between two people of the opposite gender, the plan documents must be amended by December 31, 2014.\n\n\u2013 Same-sex spouses must be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses. Additionally, if an employer-sponsored retirement plan currently defines \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201cmarriage\u201d as between two people of the opposite gender, the plan documents must be amended by December 31, 2014. Spousal health care coverage \u2013 Federal law, including the Affordable Care Act, does not require employers to provide coverage to either same-sex or opposite-sex spouses. However, private-sector employers who now wish to extend benefits to same-sex spouses need to amend their plan documents to reflect this change.\n\nJoin us for a special webinar October 22nd\n\nWhile the Windsor decision addressed a number of issues involving federal employment law and the provision of certain employee benefits, many questions remained unanswered. McAfee & Taft\u2019s Labor & Employment and Employee Benefits Groups will be hosting a special webinar titled \u201cSame\u2011Sex Spouses: What the changing legal landscape means for employers\u201d on Wednesday, October 22, to address these issues and provide practical advice to navigating the potentially murky waters ahead.\n\nFind out more information and register here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "EmployerLINC", "description": "On Monday, Oklahoma became one of five additional U.S. states required to allow same-sex couples to marry after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review lo", "title": "EmployerLINC  \u2013  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS LAW ALERT \u00bb  What the legalization of same\u2011sex marriage  means for Oklahoma employers", "url": "http://employerlinc.com/2014/10/employee-benefits-law-alert-what-the-legalization-of-same-sex-marriage-means-for-oklahoma-employers", "image": "http://employerlinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/same-sex_rings_feature.jpg", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For Oklahoma employers, here\u2019s a quick rundown of the implications related to same-sex spouses:Tax-qualified retirement plans \u2013 Same-sex spouses must be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses.\n\u2013 Same-sex spouses must be treated the same as opposite-sex spouses.\nHowever, private-sector employers who now wish to extend benefits to same-sex spouses need to amend their plan documents to reflect this change.\nSpousal health care coverage \u2013 Federal law, including the Affordable Care Act, does not require employers to provide coverage to either same-sex or opposite-sex spouses.\nAdditionally, if an employer-sponsored retirement plan currently defines \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201cmarriage\u201d as between two people of the opposite gender, the plan documents must be amended by December 31, 2014."}
