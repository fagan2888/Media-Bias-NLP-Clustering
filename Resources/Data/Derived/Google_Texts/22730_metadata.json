Asa Hutchinson\u2019s efforts and the legislation he got passed in this recent session will be all-encompassing.\n\n\u201cThe private option is a good first step,\u201d he said. \u201cMore importantly, we want to move it further from what we have right now.. . These last few years we\u2019ve been talking solely about the private option. What the task force is looking at is all of health care reform.\u201d\n\nGov. Hutchinson pushed state lawmakers to fund the private option through the end of 2016. The innovative and controversial program has led 230,000 enrollees into health insurance coverage, according to the latest statistics.\n\nHutchinson also convinced legislators to form a task force to recommend changes by the end of this year for ending the private option program by next year and to design a new marketplace for health care and insurance by the start of 2017.\n\nBledsoe sits on the 16-member legislative task force that meets Monday to begin that challenge. As a non-voting member, he\u2019ll still be representing the Governor\u2019s interests to the panel.\n\n\u201cI think this is a once in a generational opportunity to do this,\u201d said Bledsoe, who added that a potential special session is \u201con the table\u201d to ultimately address the task force\u2019s recommendations.\n\nA key reform driver that will quickly come up in discussion for the task force involves a federal waiver known as a 1332 waiver. It allows great flexibility within the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In short, 1332 waivers allow states to:\n\nModify or eliminate the Individual Mandate component of the ACA\n\nModify or eliminate the Employer Mandate component of the ACA\n\nModify Benefits or Subsidies\n\nModify or eliminate Marketplaces and Health Plans\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the opportunity to truly remake Medicaid and remake health care in the state through these 1332 waivers, we\u2019ve got an incredible opportunity. There\u2019s a lot of flexibility built into the Affordable Care Act through the 1332 waivers,\u201d Bledsoe said.\n\nWhen asked how eliminating individual or employer mandates could impact health insurance participation, Bledsoe said he did not have a crystal ball on if the task force would keep those mandates in a state plan or create different incentives for participation.\n\nHe said one of his first meetings as state Surgeon General involved a face-to-face with Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Bledsoe said he felt the feds would bend greatly in Arkansas\u2019 efforts to reshape health care.\n\nAccording to Bledsoe, Burwell said if the White House says no or the federal law forbids it, there is little she can do. \u201c\u2018But everything else is on the table for discussion,'\u201d Bledsoe says he was told. \u201cI think the federal government is in a position where they\u2019re willing to negotiate.\u201d\n\nAlso, a U.S Supreme Court ruling, King vs. Burwell, could come down this summer. The challenge to the federal health care law is based on the constitutionality of exchange insurance subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act. A ruling against the subsidies could lead to the act\u2019s demise. If upheld, it\u2019s business as usual.\n\nBledsoe confesses that a ruling against the exchange insurance subsidies \u201ccould change the dynamic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor and I and the rest of the staff have been looking at how we would respond in case they ruled against the government, against Burwell, and we have a plan in place to deal with that. But we\u2019re not going to get out ahead of that and speculate until the Supreme Court actually makes its ruling,\u201d he said, declining to offer more details when asked.\n\nWatch his full video interview below.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "Arkansas\u2019 new Surgeon General, Dr. Greg Bledsoe, says the legislative health care task force that begins its work in earnest this week will be looking at a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/arkansas-surgeon-general-1332-waiver-important-task-force-work", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201504/2015_04_19_bledsoe.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Arkansas\u2019 new Surgeon General, Dr. Greg Bledsoe, says the legislative health care task force that begins its work in earnest this week will be looking at a", "title": "Arkansas Surgeon General: 1332 Waiver Important To Task Force Work"}, "story_id": 400990408, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarpublicradio"}, "author": "Roby Brock", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Arkansas Surgeon General: 1332 Waiver Important To Task Force Work"}, "nid": 40245, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "keywords": "Arkansas Healthcare", "wordCount": 948, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A key reform driver that will quickly come up in discussion for the task force involves a federal waiver known as a 1332 waiver.\nWhat the task force is looking at is all of health care reform.\u201dGov.\nArkansas\u2019 new Surgeon General, Dr. Greg Bledsoe, says the legislative health care task force that begins its work in earnest this week will be looking at a much wider swath of reform than just the private option.\nThe innovative and controversial program has led 230,000 enrollees into health insurance coverage, according to the latest statistics.\nBledsoe sits on the 16-member legislative task force that meets Monday to begin that challenge."}
