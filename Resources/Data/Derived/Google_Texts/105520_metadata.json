Unlike Hillary Clinton and her fellow socialist line-up, voters on the Right are witnessing a vigorous debate over policy that would benefit our nation. The two Republicans have placed their tax reform plans out for review and analysis.\n\nThe plans are quite different, though both aim to reform the entangled and excessive current tax code and regulations that compile more than 70,000 pages and millions of technical words. In essence, one proposal takes the existing structure and collapses its size and increases the utilization of tax credits. The second moves away from the tiered structure based on income to a flat tax on income and transactional taxes replacing the corporate tax.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the main points.\n\nRubio\u2019s plan\n\nCreates three income brackets for taxation \u2014 15%, 25% and 35% \u2014 versus the existing seven with the top tier taxed at almost 40% (more than 40% with ObamaCare taxes factored in)\n\nReduces the corporate income tax to 25%, down from what is the world\u2019s highest at 35% (individuals operating small businesses pay 39.6%)\n\nRepeals the estate (death) tax, the alternative minimum tax and any ObamaCare taxes\n\nPermits exemptions of interest, dividends, and capital gains from income taxes\n\nCreates a child credit of up to $2,500 per child that may be partially refundable (if your taxable income zeroes out, you get a tax refund)\n\nReplaces standard deductions based on filing status with refundable tax credits\n\nThe \u201ccost\u201d of the tax reform plan has been estimated to be up to $6 trillion expanding a decade of implementation. Translation, the government would confiscate $6 trillion less through taxes.\n\nCruz\u2019s plan\n\nReplaces the seven brackets of income taxation with a \u201cflat tax\u201d of 10% on individual income\n\nIncreases the standard deductions from $6,300 to $10,000 for single filers and $12,600 to $20,000 married filing jointly\n\nCreates a universal savings account sheltering up to $25,000 in personal savings\n\nEliminates all itemized deductions except for the home mortgage interest deduction and the charitable deduction\n\nEliminates all individual tax credits except the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is expanded by 20% Replaces the world\u2019s leading corporate tax of 35% with a \u201cBusiness Transfer Tax\u201d of 16% on all profits, payroll and business transactions minus capital investment\n\nEliminates the death/estate tax\n\nThe \u201ccost\u201d of the Cruz plan would be a net loss to the federal government of $3.6 trillion over 10 years of projected implementation.\n\nBoth plans result in economic growth, logically because federal control of individual and corporate assets is reduced. The plan offered by Rubio creates a projected 15% in GDP while the Cruz plan shows GDP growth at 13.9% over the same 10-year window. Of course, there are infinite other variables, but both would be good for the economy.\n\nAppreciate the tension this creates within Congress to reduce spending in light of a reduction in their purse, yet, the increase in demand of jobs and goods in the private sector versus those either subsidized by your taxes or provided by the public sector.\n\nThe biggest criticisms of these plans are understandable.\n\nThe Rubio plan, according to the Tax Foundation, awards low-income families with a refund via the child and income tax credits whose incomes fall below zero when applied. The benefits to those creating jobs through a small reduction in the corporate income tax does not do enough within the \u201csupply-side\u201d structure of rewarding investment, production and job-creation.\n\nThe Cruz plan, while eliminating the corporate tax completely, creates a new business tax applied to the cost of goods and services at each stage of production and transaction. In Europe, this is known as the Value Added Tax (VAT), and it is often a stealth way of raising money and funding those nations' lavish welfare states. Simply, all the profits are taxed with transactional taxes paid to other companies and businesses incurred as the \u201ccost of business\u201d and are subtracted, hence the official name, \u201ctax-inclusive subtraction-method value-added tax.\u201d Further, wages for employees are no longer tax deductible, but a taxed transaction at the source.\n\nOn the positive side of the ledger, the Cruz and Rubio plans tout wage growth of 12.2% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nTo the Left, which believes all property and wealth is best stewarded by the State, the debate and dialogue over tax policy is rhetoric with numbers to appease the wealthy instead of promising free birth control or subsidized housing, internet, phones, et al. To those of us on the center-Right who work, produce and seek to save, the specifics of seeing our hard-earned money left in our paychecks is a priority.\n\nThe great news for both the Cruz and Rubio plans is blindingly obvious: After the worst economic recovery recorded in modern history, speaking of economic growth due to real wage increases and job creation are welcomed changes we not only hope for but are counting on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two of the leading GOP candidates tackle reform.", "csrf-token": "NjbOf/j35tqYYThbrGi2gghklSvJiMpvP/xtsbVmVzE=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Two of the leading GOP candidates tackle reform.", "title": "Cruz vs. Rubio on Taxes", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/40111", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2016-01-19-d900940e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd207b\"", "article_summary": "Economy, Regs, & Taxes Cruz vs. Rubio on TaxesA policy debate is brewing between two of the top Republican contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination \u2014 Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, the Cruz and Rubio plans tout wage growth of 12.2% and 12.5%, respectively.\nThe second moves away from the tiered structure based on income to a flat tax on income and transactional taxes replacing the corporate tax.\nThe plan offered by Rubio creates a projected 15% in GDP while the Cruz plan shows GDP growth at 13.9% over the same 10-year window.\nThe Rubio plan, according to the Tax Foundation, awards low-income families with a refund via the child and income tax credits whose incomes fall below zero when applied."}
