The news of two new store closures at Wausau Center mall — Deb Shops, a clothing chain that is closing nationwide, and Great American Cookies — rekindled reader debate about the health of the downtown mall and its future prospects. Some excerpts from readers’ comments on our website and Facebook page:

It’s not about filling the mall. It’s about reinventing the space. Seems to me there’s a pretty large company based downtown that could potentially utilize the space, pay taxes and free up a lot of potential river front land for development.

— Owen Jones

Shut the mall down. Everyone in Wausau goes out to Rib Mountain anyway. Malls are a thing of the past. Time to pull the plug.

— Jesse Riege

The Wausau Center has been operating for more than three decades. If you make a plan and it works for more than 30 years, then that’s a pretty good plan. If you need to redevelop after more than a generation of success, that doesn’t mean your plan was a failure. That there are some serious challenges to consider going forward is a fact. Rib Mountain Drive provides some valuable retail options to central Wisconsin, but little in the way of defining a community or a unique culture in the way that a true, historic downtown center does.

— Jim Rosenberg

Think of new ways to utilize the space. Maybe turn JC Penney’s space into an indoor skatepark. Or a studio for art and photography classes maybe.

— Eric Zannino

Thanks Obama!

— Jake Brewer

It’s not just the Wausau mall. Fond du Lac mall has lost JC Penney, Sears, the cinema and many others including the soon-to-be closed Deb.
