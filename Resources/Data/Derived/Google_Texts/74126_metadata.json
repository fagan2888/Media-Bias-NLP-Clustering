Ray Lesniak described the kind of governor he thinks New Jersey needs after Governor Chris Christie\u2019s term ends.\n\nWhile he claims that he will wait until after the 2016 presidential election to announce a run, Lesniak is seemingly positioning himself for the spot.\n\nHere are ten of the qualities he says New Jersey\u2019s next governor needs\u2026\n\nTo be more interested in New Jersey than \u201chis own political ambitions.\u201d Governor Christie is currently facing ever-increasing criticism for his time away from his home state. A governor who will give N.J.\u2019s teachers \u201ca hug and a thank you.\u201d Last month, Governor Christie said that the national teacher\u2019s union deserved a \u201cpunch in the face.\u201d That instance was part of a long line of issues between Christie and teachers unions. Lesniak, though he has a contentious history with the board of education in his hometown of Elizabeth, believes the Christie administration has undervalued teachers. Someone who will \u201cstand up to ExxonMobil.\u201d A recent $225 million settlement let ExxonMobil off the hook for oil contamination cleanup in N.J. that was initially valued at costing nearly $9 billion. Governor Christie touts the settlement as a success. Lesniak, on the other hand, claims that the settlement goes too easy on the corporation, making them pay \u201conly three cents on the dollar.\u201d One of Lesniak\u2019s main focuses is the cleanup of Morses Creek in his home county of Union. Who listens to questions from residents and \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell them to sit down and shut up.\u201d Governor Christie\u2019s brash style has become something of a trademark for the sitting governor, even as he seeks the presidency. Lesniak\u2019s style is notably different. Who will \u201cstand up against animal cruelty.\u201d Lesniak has been a longtime advocate against animal cruelty. He has introduced legislation banning the ivory trade, restricting the import of endangered species through ports operated by the Port Authority and against gestation crates for pigs. Someone who ensures pensions for employees Governor Christie slashed the state\u2019s contribution to the pension fund earlier this year. That decision was upheld by the state Supreme Court but unions are now petitioning the federal Supreme Court to reverse the decision. According to Lesniak, if \u201cyou have earned it, it is yours, you deserve it.\u201d Who will support Obamacare. According to Lesniak, support for the Affordable Care Act is critical to the future of New Jersey. Christie has said the law needs to be \u201cfixed.\u201d Who focuses on treatment of addiction before incarceration. The governor and Lesniak have similar views here. Christie touts treatment before incarceration as an important reform during his gubernatorial run. Who demands equal pay for women and stands up for Planned Parenthood. Conservatives have panned Planned Parenthood this year pushing for defunding of the healthcare provider. As he did as governor, Christie has vowed to defund PP nationally if elected president. Lesniak has been a long-time supporter of PP and other issues that primarily impact women like equal pay for equal work. In 2011, he was honored by N.J.\u2019s Women\u2019s Political Caucus for his work. Who pushes for universal background checks for firearms and a ban on assault rifles. Lesniak is an Army veteran. He said that \u201cassault weapons belong in our military and in the hands of police officers if they need them.\u201d He does not believe that they should be sold to the general public.\n\nLesniak, it seems, it looking to position himself as a counterpoint for Governor Christie\u2019s time in office.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo3-e1441854606695.jpg?w=50", "description": "State Sen.
