If you just can’t wait for the lines, sales, and stampedes of Black Friday, Best Buy has you covered, at least on the sales part. If you stop by Best Buy today, you can pick up an iPad Air for about 20 percent off its normal price, and there are equally good deals on iPod touch units as well.

Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday Apple sales popped into our view via Apple Insider, and the retailer looks like it’s going all out to make sure its iPad deals stand out ahead of the rest. The 16GB 2013 iPad Air – that’s the first iPad Air from last year, not this year’s iPad Air – normally retails for around $400. At $320, Best Buy is offering the iPad for $80 off its normal price, or 20 percent.

For more storage-dependent user, Best Buy’s got options as well, including the 32GB iPad Air for $370, the 64GB iPad Air for $415, and the 128GB model for $614.

Best Buy is also offering significant discounts on iPod touch models. A 64GB iPod touch model is available for $250, $50 off the full price. There are also deals on AirPlay-capable speakers from iHome for just $50, while Beats by Dre Solo HD On-Ear Headphones drop in price by nearly a third to just $70.

There’s no telling just how long this particular iPad sale will last, but Best Buy will have even more deals next Thursday when the holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest with Black Friday. That day will see Best Buy offering the iPhone 6 at half price on contract, as well as the iPad Air for $100 below its normal cost.
