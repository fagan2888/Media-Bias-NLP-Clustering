We are blessed with an extraordinarily group of competent, intelligent and capable candidates, that love this nation and very much wish to see it succeed.\n\n\u201cOver the next several months the polls will vary, but hopefully the resolve of the candidates to present the American people with solid ideas and solutions will only grow stronger.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously very pleased with the result, and it demonstrates our growing grassroots\u2019 appeal. Thank you, Oklahoma GOP!\u201d he added.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier on Carson\u2019s big win, where the neurosurgeon defeated the winner of the CPAC straw poll, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul:\n\nCarson, who formally announced his candidacy for president less than three weeks ago, finished with 25.4% of the vote according to a press release. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)\n\nfinished second and third with 20.5% and 16.6% of the vote, respectively. Rounding out the top ten were New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (5.3%) of the vote, former Texas Governor Rick Perry (5.0%), former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (4.9%), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) (4.1%), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) (4.1%), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (4.1%), an Carly Fiorina (2.7%). The full results of the straw poll can be viewed here.\n\nThe media scoffed at the poll\u2019s significance \u2014 \u201cStraw polls are generally not accurate in forecasting success on the presidential campaign trail. And Oklahoma is not expected to play a major role in choosing the GOP nominee in 2016,\u201d wrote National Journal.\n\nNational Journal also claimed that Carson\u2019s campaign bought tickets for the event and sold them for a reduced price to Carson fans in order to swing the poll:\n\nCarson and his team made a priority of winning the straw poll, which they hoped would demonstrate his strength among grassroots Republicans. Carson supporters flooded the event, passing out literature and lobbying attendees to support him in the straw poll. His campaign even purchased 100 tickets to the conference and resold them to activists at a cheaper price. \u201cThat certainly gave him an advantage,\u201d said Bill Shapard, whose firm, SoonerPoll, conducted the survey.\n\nCarson\u2019s communications director, Doug Watts, pushed back against the narrative.\n\n\u201cAs an aside, wanted to tell you that, notwithstanding the bullshit National Journal piece, we did nothing to organize or seek votes for the poll, other than show up and make our pitch,\u201d Watts stated to Breitbart News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a stunning victory, Dr. Ben Carson swept the straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference (SRLC) in Oklahoma City on Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In a stunning victory, Dr. Ben Carson swept the straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference (SRLC) in Oklahoma City on Saturday.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson Storms Through Oklahoma To SRLC Straw Poll Victory", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/carson.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/23/dr-ben-carson-storms-through-oklahoma-to-srlc-straw-poll-victory/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a stunning victory, Dr. Ben Carson swept the straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference (SRLC) in Oklahoma City on Saturday.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson Storms Through Oklahoma To SRLC Straw Poll Victory", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/carson.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dr. Ben Carson,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,ben carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Dr. Ben Carson", "published_time": "2015-05-23T14:18:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a stunning victory, Dr. Ben Carson swept the straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference (SRLC) in Oklahoma City on Saturday.\nThe media scoffed at the poll\u2019s significance \u2014 \u201cStraw polls are generally not accurate in forecasting success on the presidential campaign trail.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI am grateful for the support of the many Americans who attended the conference,\u201d Carson told Breitbart News.\nCarson supporters flooded the event, passing out literature and lobbying attendees to support him in the straw poll.\nThe full results of the straw poll can be viewed here."}
