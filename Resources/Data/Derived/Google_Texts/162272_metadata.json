The previous contract, which expired Oct. 31, was extended twice as the United Food & Commercial Workers negotiated with Safeway and Giant over health insurance, holiday pay and wage increases.\n\nIn the end, though, both parties say they are satisfied.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the best retail food contracts in the country,\u201d Mark P. Federici, president of UFCW Local 400, said in a statement. \u201cUnlike many other agreements, our members will keep their current health-care benefits and won\u2019t be forced onto the inferior plans offered through the [Affordable Care Act\u2019s] health care exchanges.\u201d\n\nOn average, employees will receive an additional $3.35 per hour in wages and benefits over the next three years, with a 35-cent-per-hour raise backdated to November, according to the union. Employees will receive another 35-cent raise next November and an additional 30 cents in November 2015.\n\nThe contract is one of a few in the retail food industry that continues to provide health-care coverage for all current employees and most future employees, Federici said. Safeway and Giant \u2014 which racked up a combined $6.41 billion in area sales last year \u2014 also agreed to time-and-a-half pay on Sundays and holidays.\n\n\u201cThroughout negotiations, our goal was to reach fair and reasonable contracts that respect our legacy and honor our associates\u2019 contributions, while also recognizing our competitive realities,\u201d Jamie Miller, a spokesman for Giant of Landover, said in a statement.\n\nBut the process wasn\u2019t always amicable. After more than six weeks of talks, members of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400 in November voted to authorize a strike against Giant and Safeway if the two sides failed to agree on a new contract.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had negotiations as tough as these, with two contract extensions,\u201d said Michelle Hepner, a member of the bargaining team who works for Giant in Stafford.\n\nThe grocery stores had proposed eliminating health-care benefits for part-time employees and workers\u2019 spouses, as well as doing away with Sunday and holiday pay, according to a union statement.\n\nThe agreement, which covers 17,000 workers, took effect retroactively as of Nov. 1.\n\nThe contract \u201ccontinues to provide our employees with excellent wages and benefits while also allowing Safeway to remain competitive in the local retail food market,\u201d said Brian Baer, Eastern Division President for Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The three-year agreement comes after months of contentious debate about health care benefits.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abhabhattarai", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The three-year agreement comes after months of contentious debate about health care benefits.", "title": "Union approves new contract with Safeway, Giant", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/union-approves-contract-with-safeway-giant/2013/12/20/ef553a64-68d3-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@abhabhattarai"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/union-approves-contract-with-safeway-giant/2013/12/20/ef553a64-68d3-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiznews", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abhabhattarai"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ef553a64-68d3-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiznews"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c59\"", "article_summary": "Unionized Safeway and Giant Food employees voted Tuesday to overwhelmingly approve a contract with the area\u2019s two largest grocery chains.\nThe three-year agreement, which continues to provide health-care benefits and pensions to area workers, comes after months of contentious debate.\nThe previous contract, which expired Oct. 31, was extended twice as the United Food & Commercial Workers negotiated with Safeway and Giant over health insurance, holiday pay and wage increases.\n\u201cThis is one of the best retail food contracts in the country,\u201d Mark P.
