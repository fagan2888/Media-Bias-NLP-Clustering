Eric Fehr left the Washington Capitals’ 2-1 overtime loss to the New York Islanders with what the team would only describe as an upper-body injury in the first period and did not return.

Fehr, who missed the Capitals’ final three games of the regular season with what is believed to be a right shoulder injury, appeared to aggravate that injury when taking a check from Islanders right wing Kyle Okposo at 3:11 of the first period.

The center was attempting to play a puck in the corner when he was hit against the glass by Okposo. He lay on the ice after the hit for nearly 20 seconds before scampering off, then immediately headed down the tunnel toward the dressing room to receive medical attention.

Fehr played just two shifts, totaling 1:19 of ice time. Jay Beagle, who began the game alongside Fehr as the third-line right wing, took a number of faceoffs in Fehr’s absence, while fourth-line center Brooks Laich also took shifts alongside Beagle and left wing Jason Chimera.

Coach Barry Trotz said approximately 20 minutes after the game that he didn’t have an update on Fehr’s health. If he can’t return for Game 4 on Tuesday, his spot in the lineup could conceivably be taken by Michael Latta, who was a healthy scratch the last two games.

In addition to Fehr, left wing Marcus Johansson missed the final six minutes of the first period after taking a hit from Islanders right wing Cal Clutterbuck, but he was back on the ice for his first shift of the second period.
