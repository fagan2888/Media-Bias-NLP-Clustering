You\u2019d be surprised how they use them things up there,\u201d said Hall, who added county officials began the practice about a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe probably made $75,000 to $80,000 this year alone just on the profit of those cigarettes. It may even go to $100,000 next year.\u201d\n\nCounty officials place that extra revenue in the general fund, which typically pays for expenses associated with the sheriff\u2019s office, jail, trustee\u2019s office and ambulance services, Hall said.\n\nBut is there potential for abuse?\n\nIn a recently released audit, state comptrollers reported county officials paid $33,015 for these e-cigarettes without seeking competitive bids.\n\nCounty officials responded by saying they had, in fact, sought competitive bids, but that came later in the year, according to the audit.\n\n\u201cWe only got one vendor to even bid on it,\u201d Hall said.\u201cI\u2019d figure we would have had 10 of those vendors, but we only had one.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n(Photo from Flickr and it was cropped.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A county in Tennessee is making huge profits selling e-cigarettes to inmates in its county jail.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A county in Tennessee is making huge profits selling e-cigarettes to inmates in its county jail.", "title": "County Making Nice Profit Selling E-Cigarettes to Inmates", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ecig.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-13T14:12:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/12XuFmQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A county in Tennessee is making huge profits selling e-cigarettes to inmates in its county jail.", "title": "County Making Nice Profit Selling E-Cigarettes to Inmates", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ecig.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime,law", "published_time": "2014-12-13T11:29:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T14:12:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tennessee, e-cigarettes, tobacco, Dickson County, Tenn., Tennessee,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39ca\"", "article_summary": "NASHVILLE \u2014 A sheriff\u2019s office in Tennessee has made a hefty profit selling vapor cigarettes to inmates.\nIn a recently released audit, state comptrollers reported county officials paid $33,015 for these e-cigarettes without seeking competitive bids.\nCounty officials responded by saying they had, in fact, sought competitive bids, but that came later in the year, according to the audit.\nYou\u2019d be surprised how they use them things up there,\u201d said Hall, who added county officials began the practice about a year ago.\nDon Hall, director of accounts and budget for Dickson County, said officials will enjoy the e-cigarette windfall."}
