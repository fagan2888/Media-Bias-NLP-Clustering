John Kitzhaber, over alleged ethics violations committed by the governor and Cylvia Hayes.\n\nThe ORP is preparing to file an ethics complaint that would trigger an investigation into both Kitzhaber and Hayes, Oregon Republican Party Vice Chairman Bill Currier said. The party is claiming both Hayes and Kitzhaber violated the Oregon Government Ethics law, or ORS 244.320.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Kitzhaber requesting the ethics commission provide an opinion on whether Hayes is a public official and subject to the ethics laws.\n\n\u201cWe will be calling for an investigation of both the governor and Cylvia Hayes, according to Oregon ethics law, \u201c Currier said. \u201cClearly Gov. Kitzhaber is attempting to head this off by asking for an opinion but what should be requested is an investigation because there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the Oregon ethics law was violated.\u201d\n\nThe Party claims Kitzhaber violated the ethics law by rewriting ethics rules to allow for Hayes to use Mahonia Hall and the badge of first lady for her personal business. The allegation is based on reporting by Willamette Week.\n\nThe complaint will also accuse Hayes of violating the ethics law by using her title as first lady for a paid speaking event on energy policy, Currier said.\n\nLast week, The Willamette Week published an expose on Hayes, accusing her of ethics violations and stating that she has profited as a political consultant due to the access she has as the governor's fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe complaint could result in a review of Kitzhaber and Hayes depending on the determination of the ethics commission, officials said.\n\n\"A Preliminary Review can be initiated either on a signed complaint, or an \u201cown motion\u201d of the Commission,\" Ethics Commission Executive Director Ron Bersin said. \"No not all complaints result in a preliminary review.\"\n\nCritics have scoffed at Kitzhaber\u2019s call for an opinion from the ethics commission on whether Hayes is subject to the law, saying it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cGov. Kitzhaber\u2019s request for an opinion from the ethics commission is not an investigation,\u201d Currier said. \u201cThat is our main concern.\u201d\n\nExperts say even Hayes\u2019s relationship to the governor makes her a public official and therefore ethical standards should apply.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, in terms of conflicts of interest, those also apply to the public official\u2019s family,\u201d said Hana Callaghan, director of the government ethics program at Santa Clara. She said if a family member is pushing a political agenda then it could be considered a conflict.\n\n\u201cThe public has to come first,\u201d she said, adding she was speaking generally and not specifically to Kitzhaber\u2019s case.\n\nConservatives have been quick to pounce on the governor for the alleged misdeeds.\n\nCritics argue the latest report that Kitzhaber changed ethics rules to accommodate Hayes is telling and that the question over whether she is a public official is moot.\n\n\u201cI know they are trying to walk that back but that\u2019s a defensive tactic,\u201d Conservative Talk Show Host Lars Larson said. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t a public official she wouldn\u2019t have to rewrite the rules.\u201d\n\nDennis Richardson, Kitzhaber's opponent in the race for governor, also issued a statement Tuesday, criticizing Kitzhaber for the alleged suppression of an internal report critical of how Cover Oregon was handling the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Tuesday, Currier called for Kitzhaber to drop out of the race for governor.\n\n\"Why doesn\u2019t Kitzhaber do the honorable thing and end his bid for a fourth term,\" he said. \"It\u2019s pretty clear right now that for John Kitzhaber Oregon truly is ungovernable.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?
