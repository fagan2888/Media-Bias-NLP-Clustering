Thanks to a new report from Pew, here the twain shall meet: Researchers asked people of all ages whether society is better off if people focus on getting married and having kids.\n\nAmerican Attitudes Toward Marriage and Kids\n\nLooking at this chart is a little like taking a Rorschach inkblot test on the topic of \"American values\": You could see a lot of different things, if you wanted. The most obvious would be Chicken-Little style fears about the coming end of marriage: With just 29 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds affirming the importance of matrimony and maternity, it would be easy to say a quick eulogy for wedding vows. This narrative of decline may be true for certain people in America\u2014those living in poverty, in particular\u2014but for the wealthy and the educated, the institution of marriage is still in very good shape.\n\nYou could also read this graph as a manifesto of \"not right now\": In 2010, the average marriage age was 26-and-a-half for women and nearly 29 for men. It's understandable that 22-year-olds might be blas\u00e9 about the benefits of marriage and kids\u2014and equally understandable that their 65-year-old counterparts are twice as likely to say it's important. As marriage-shy Millennials age, they might warm to the idea of lifelong commitment.\n\nBut again, the data suggests something slightly more complicated: In a 2013 Gallup poll, 75 percent of respondents were either married or said they wanted to be married. This included 84 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds; only nine percent of Millennials in that poll said they never wanted to get hitched. How can both sets of poll findings be true?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A poll suggests young people aren&#39;t convinced that spouse-hunting and baby-making should be a priority for their generation.", "author": "Emma Green", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A poll suggests young people aren&#39;t convinced that spouse-hunting and baby-making should be a priority for their generation.", "title": "Millennials: Society Will Be Just Fine Without Marriage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/RTR2XS88/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/07/millennials-society-will-be-just-fine-without-marriage/374060/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5c3\"", "article_summary": "The future of marriage, the future of Millennials: two topics the Internet loves to freak out about.\nAs marriage-shy Millennials age, they might warm to the idea of lifelong commitment.\nYou could also read this graph as a manifesto of \"not right now\": In 2010, the average marriage age was 26-and-a-half for women and nearly 29 for men.\nThis included 84 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds; only nine percent of Millennials in that poll said they never wanted to get hitched.\nIt's understandable that 22-year-olds might be blas\u00e9 about the benefits of marriage and kids\u2014and equally understandable that their 65-year-old counterparts are twice as likely to say it's important."}
