SAN DIEGO — A person with knowledge of the situation says the San Diego Padres have a deal in place to acquire outfielder Matt Kemp and catcher Tim Federowicz from the division rival Los Angeles Dodgers for catcher Yasmani Grandal and two pitchers.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the deal hadn’t been announced by either team.

The Padres are due to receive some $30 million to help offset the $107 million still remaining on Kemp’s deal, which must be approved by the commissioner’s office.

San Diego has been desperate for a power bat to punch up its woeful offense. Kemp had a strong second half in 2014 for the NL West champion Dodgers, finishing with a .287 average, 25 home runs and 89 RBIs.
