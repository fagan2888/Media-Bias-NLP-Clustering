Jim McDermott said Thursday that Democrats should adopt a \u201ctwo-pronged approach\u201d to their agenda and for the midterm elections this year \u2014 with one of the prongs involving Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think there clearly is an exciting thing happening today,\u201d Mr. McDermott, Washington Democrat, said on MSNBC. \u201cFor the first time many people have health care and that\u2019s going to be an issue that Democrats I think can run on and be very proud of, and the other side\u2019s going to have a hard time explaining why it isn\u2019t good for people to have health insurance and be protected against previous problems they\u2019ve had and getting their children covered. That\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d\n\nThe White House this week touted figures that showed more than 2 million people have selected health care plans through state and federal insurance exchanges, and almost 4 million learned in the first two months of the health care law\u2019s rollout that they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nThe administration did not say, however, how many people would be newly insured versus the number of people who are trying to sustain their health insurance after being kicked off an old plan \u2014 a development Republicans have seized on and plan to hammer Democrats with both on the Hill and in this election cycle as well.\n\n\u201cWhile there may be additional targeted legislative strikes, the heavy emphasis will be on oversight,\u201d Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told Politico. \u201cThe law can\u2019t truly be \u2018fixed,\u2019 so we\u2019ll be making the case for repeal by highlighting the endless negative consequences of the law.\u201d\n\nThe second item Mr. McDermott talked about Thursday was \u201cmore money in the pockets of workers\u201d as many Democrats are pushing to hike the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour when Congress returns next week.\n\n\u201cI think it ought to be a two-pronged, approach, really,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care and the money in people\u2019s pockets. Without both of those, people will be healthier, but they won\u2019t have any money to spend. And I think that\u2019s really why you have to do both.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
