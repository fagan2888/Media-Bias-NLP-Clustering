A fight over a redevelopment project in Denver’s West Highland neighborhood came to a disappointing conclusion last week when the City Council approved historic designation for an abandoned church against the property owner’s wishes.

We agree with Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz, who said hostile designation should be a last, last resort and wish a compromise could have been reached in this case.

Property rights are subject to some limitations, of course, but a “hostile” historic designation is a comprehensive restriction that gives the city veto power over a multitude of uses.

On May 19, about 20 people spoke in favor of the designation and 400 people signed a petition extolling the virtues of the 83-year-old Beth-Eden Baptist Church at 32nd Street and Lowell Boulevard, which is in the middle of parcels slated for redevelopment.

The landowner, represented by Tom Wooten, said he had not intended to raze the structure. Instead, he had worked out a deal with neighbors to apply for non-historic designation for the church in exchange for agreeing to limit the height of any newly constructed buildings to less than four stories when zoning would allow for five stories.

But that non-historic designation may have meant the church could have been demolished, which prompted a separate group of neighbors to successfully apply for historic designation.

Now, Wooten’s height cap agreement is null. He is right to be concerned that it will be difficult to find a developer who will want to work around the restrictions on the property. For example, any significant change would require a two-to-three-month review with final approval from City Council.

We have seen similar hostile designations before on residential properties in Denver, which is even more troublesome. And while historic preservation has saved many fine structures, the bar should be very high when the owner is opposed.
