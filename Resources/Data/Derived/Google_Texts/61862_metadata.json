After all, she said, \u201cI hardly ever get sick.\u201d\n\nThen she had to go to an emergency room about a month ago.\n\nThat left her with a $13,000 medical bill \u2013 and a resolve to buy insurance.\n\n\u201cThat kind of scared me,\u201d she said.\n\nShe signed up with Humana Insurance on Saturday as part of the company\u2019s effort to enroll people in the federal exchange, which offers subsidies for those qualify.\n\nThe third year of enrollment in the exchanges, which were established by the federal Affordable Care Act, started Nov. 1.\n\nWoodcock qualified. She chose Humana\u2019s Bronze Plan with a monthly premium of $20, a $500 annual deductible and 60 percent paid by the insurer. She said she may upgrade to the Silver Plan, whose monthly premium is $69 and pays 70 percent coverage.\n\nShe is a single mother, with three of her seven children still at home. The dependent children have coverage through the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, which is administered by the Division of Medicaid and has no premiums or deductibles.\n\nWhen she was younger, she received Medicaid insurance, and eventually she made too much money to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nMississippi leads the nation in that 95.4 percent of enrollees qualify for the subsidy, and on average get $351 a month as a premium tax credit, according to the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nThose who qualify for the income tax credit can take advance payments of it to lower their monthly premium payment, according to healthcare.gov.\n\nWoodcock is a cook for Wayne\u2019s Cafeteria at the Mississippi Department of Employment Security building at 1235 Echelon Place in Jackson. The cafeteria is not required to provide a group plan because it has fewer than 50 employees.\n\nBut everyone is required by the ACA to have coverage, or pay a penalty, which in 2016 will rise to 2.5 percent of income or $695 per adult and $345.50 per child, whichever is more.\n\nWoodcock worked her way through the review process at Humana\u2019s enrollment outreach Saturday at Northpark Mall. The insurer also conducted a signup at the Jackson Medical Mall.\n\nFor many people, the insurance exchange is a \u201cblank slate,\u201d said Todd Oglesby, Humana sales manager for metro Jackson.\n\nFifteen percent of Mississippi residents don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nHumana will have two more days of signup, on Dec. 11 and 12, at Northpark and the Jackson Medical Mall, Oglesby said.\n\nHumana is one of three insurers who offer insurance through the Mississippi exchange. The others are Ambetter of Magnolia and United Healthcare.\n\nEfforts to get information from the other two insurance companies were unsuccessful.\n\nDec. 15 is the deadline for those who want coverage by Jan. 1. Those who sign up by Jan.15, will have coverage by the first of February and those who enroll by Jan. 31 will have coverage starting in March.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\r\n\r\nDenise Woodcock had never seen a reason for her to have health insurance.
