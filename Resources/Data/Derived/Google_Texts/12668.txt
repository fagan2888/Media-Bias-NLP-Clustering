The crash happened at around 12:15 p.m. and involved a motorcycle and a pickup truck.





According to Fort Myers Police, the driver of the pickup truck - later identified as Oheli Velazquez Soto - was heading east on SR-82. Once she passed Forum Boulevard, Velazdquez Soto realized a five-foot piece of wood she was transporting had fallen off the truck. She stopped the truck in the left lane of SR-82 and got out to get the piece of wood.





A few seconds later, a motorcycle - driven by Victor King - collided with the back of the parked pickup truck. King was rushed to Lee Memorial Hospital -- where he later died from his injuries.





Velazquez Soto was found at fault for the crash and cited for improper stopping and unsecured load.





Speed, alcohol or drugs were not a factor in the crash.
