Hearing 24 percent, that\u2019s pretty much what we expect.\u201d\n\nSo does the IRS, to the ire of taxpayers.\n\nThe audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, the IRS\u2019 auditor, notes that, once again, the IRS is opting not to follow recommendations to lower the rate of improper payments.\n\nAuditors also found that the IRS made between $5.9 billion and $7.1 billion in improper additional child tax credits, representing between 25.2 percent and 30.5 percent of all payments issued in fiscal year 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the EITC lifted about 6.2 million people out of poverty, including about 3.2 million children, according to Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank.\n\n\u201cThe number of poor children would have been one-quarter higher without the EITC. The credit reduced the severity of poverty for another 21.6 million people, including 7.8 million children.\u201d\n\nBut there are a lot of people who abuse or simply do not understand the complicated tax credits, leading to fraud and errors that have proved costly to taxpayers.\n\nThe ultimate question, Cole said, is how successful is a program with a waste rate of 25 percent.\n\n\u201cRather than trying to reform a broken program, Congress could replace the EITC with a spending-side wage subsidy,\u201d the Tax Foundation\u2019s Kyle Pomerleau wrote earlier this year. \u201cAlthough administrative costs are generally higher for spending programs, the huge reduction in payment errors may be worth it.\u201c\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS is opting not to follow recommendations to lower the rate of improper payments.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The IRS is opting not to follow recommendations to lower the rate of improper payments.", "title": "Audit: $14.5 Billion in Erroneous Earned Income Tax Credits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140904_IRS_Hans1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-01T22:07:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CTPPlI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The IRS is opting not to follow recommendations to lower the rate of improper payments.", "title": "Audit: $14.5 Billion in Erroneous Earned Income Tax Credits", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140904_IRS_Hans1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-01-02T03:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T22:07:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "IRS, Internal Revenue Service, tax credits, tax rates, taxpayers"}, "article_summary": "The fact that the erroneous payouts amounted to about 24 percent of the $63 billion Uncle Sam sent out in refundable earned income tax credits was nothing new as well.\nA recent audit showing the Internal Revenue Service handed out $14.5 billion in improper earned income tax credits in 2012 came as little surprise to budget watchers such as Alan Cole.\nAuditors also found that the IRS made between $5.9 billion and $7.1 billion in improper additional child tax credits, representing between 25.2 percent and 30.5 percent of all payments issued in fiscal year 2013.\n\u201cI was not surprised at all,\u201d Cole, economist for the Tax Foundation, a tax policy research organization.\n\u201cRather than trying to reform a broken program, Congress could replace the EITC with a spending-side wage subsidy,\u201d the Tax Foundation\u2019s Kyle Pomerleau wrote earlier this year."}
