Each received an hour of private instruction, adaptive rental equipment, a lift ticket, and lunch, all free of cost.\n\nAdaptive Program Director Rob Flannery says the event has been so successful, Great Bear intends to expand it season-long.\n\n\"Our hope is to transition into more of a sustainable program that runs every sunday next ski season so people that are in the area can come out and maybe progress through their skiing and really take hold of the sport,\" Flannery said.\n\nThe event was made possible by sponsor groups and the hard work of more than 50 volunteers, assistants, and instructors. Donors included the Alpine Society, IMED Mobility, Orthotic & Prosthetic Specialties, Inc., the VA, and Sanford.\n\nNews\n\nOutdoors\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
