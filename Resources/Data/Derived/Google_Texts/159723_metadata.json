The task force is charged with exploring alternatives to the private option and making recommendations by Dec. 31.\n\nThe private option, which uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for low-income Arkansans, is scheduled to end Dec. 31, 2016, under legislation enacted earlier this year. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he likely will call a special session next year so lawmakers can take up the task force\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThe program, an alternative to the expansion of state Medicaid rolls that was envisioned in the federal Affordable Care Act, has provided coverage to 248,000 Arkansans. Another 66,000 Arkansans have obtained insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace that was created under the federal health care law.\n\nNell Smith, an analyst with the state Bureau of Legislative Research, told the task force that in the first six months of 2014, a survey of 23 Arkansas hospitals found that the hospitals saw a collective $18.2 million decrease in uncompensated care costs, or costs to treat patients who could not pay for their treatment.\n\nBo Ryall, president and CEO of the Arkansas Hospital Association, told the task force that annual uncompensated costs for the state\u2019s 104 hospitals were over $3oo million as recently as 2013.\n\nHe and others who addressed the panel noted that the Affordable Care Act mandates cuts in aid to hospitals for uncompensated care costs, in the expectation of decreases in the uninsured population.\n\nArkansas\u2019 uninsured population decreased by 11 percent in 2014, the first year that the private option was in effect, according to a Gallup poll. It was the largest decrease in the nation.\n\nDr. Dan Rahn, chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, told the task force that \u201cinsurance expansion has certainly helped our operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn December of 2013 we had our highest rate of uninsurance \u2014 13.7 percent of the patients seen were uninsured. This year we\u2019re running in the range of 3 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been very important in terms of our ability to fund the entire mission.\u201d\n\nTaylor told the panel he runs two hospitals, one in Gravette and one in Springfield, Mo. Unlike Arkansas, Missouri chose not to implement any form of Medicaid expansion.\n\nSince 2014 the Missouri hospital has seen about 100 layoffs and has been reduced from 45 beds to three, while the Arkansas hospital has expanded and added about 100 employees, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThe one change, folks, is really just the private option,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, asked Taylor, \u201cIf it is such a good thing, in the position you\u2019re sitting in, what are two or three things you see as a state we ought to do that would improve upon what we already have?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do nothing other than continue basically what you\u2019re doing now, I\u2019m in pretty good shape,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf you do anything else that worsens it, then my entire system is just right on the edge. So I\u2019m desperately hoping that you continue doing at least what you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A legislative task force heard Monday from a hospital CEO who spoke urgently about what is at stake for him as lawmakers consider the future of the state\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A legislative task force heard Monday from a hospital CEO who spoke urgently about what is at stake for him as lawmakers consider the future of the state\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion.", "title": "Task force hears of private option\u2019s impact on hospitals", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/task-force-hears-private-option-s-impact-hospitals", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_bo-ryall_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/task-force-hears-private-option-s-impact-hospitals", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_bo-ryall_2.jpg"}, "title": "Task force hears of private option\u2019s impact on hospitals", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-20T18:30:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "The task force is charged with exploring alternatives to the private option and making recommendations by Dec. 31.\n\u201cSo please come through.\u201dTaylor was one of several representatives of Arkansas hospitals who addressed the task force in a meeting at the state Capitol Monday.\nThe private option, which uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for low-income Arkansans, is scheduled to end Dec. 31, 2016, under legislation enacted earlier this year.\n\u201cThe one change, folks, is really just the private option,\u201d he said.\nBo Ryall, president and CEO of the Arkansas Hospital Association, told the task force that annual uncompensated costs for the state\u2019s 104 hospitals were over $3oo million as recently as 2013."}
