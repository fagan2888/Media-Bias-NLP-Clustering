WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — The Carolina Pine Music Festival was held at Satellite Bar and Lounge Saturday to support local musicians.

Carolina Pine Music Series (CPMS) showcases local bands online by interviews and performances.

The organization is made up of film students and music enthusiasts, and aims to promote local artists and businesses.

This event was held to get their name out in the community says Web Series Producer Will Daube.

“We are trying to expand our outreach for our web series on YouTube. By having this event and getting the community involved, maybe we can draw in some people who don’t even know who we are just by hearing the music, coming out and learning a little bit more about it,” said Daube.

The event was held Saturday from 12-9 pm featuring 9 local bands and a drum circle.
