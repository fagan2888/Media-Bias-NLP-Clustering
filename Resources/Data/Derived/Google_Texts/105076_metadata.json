Full emissions controls were activated only during testing and then automatically shut down during normal operation, the agency charged.\n\n\u201cUsing a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. \u201cWorking closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules. EPA will continue to investigate these very serious matters.\u201d\n\nDuring normal operation, the \u201cdefeat device\u201d allowed Volkswagen cars to emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the federal threshold as laid out in the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe EPA has issued \u201ca notice of violation\u201d to the automaker, and the state of California has launched its own investigation into the matter. Volkswagen could face civil penalties for the violations, the agency said.\n\nThe allegations apply to about 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold since 2008, including Jettas, Beetles, Audi A3s, Golfs and other models.\n\nIn a statement, Volkswagen said it will cooperate with the ongoing federal and state investigations.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen Group of America, Inc., Volkswagen AG and Audi AG received today notice from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Justice and the California Air Resources Board of an investigation related to certain emissions compliance matters. VW is cooperating with the investigation; we are unable to comment further at this time,\u201d the automaker said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration on Friday accused Volkswagen of using a \"sophisticated software algorithm\" to cheat on emissions testing and mask the fact that some models emit too much harmful pollution.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration on Friday accused Volkswagen of using a \u201csophisticated software algorithm\u201d to cheat on emissions testing and mask the fact that some models emit too much harmful pollution.", "title": "EPA: Volkswagen used \u2018sophisticated software\u2019 to cheat emissions tests", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/18/epa-volkswagen-used-software-cheat-emissions-tests/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/18/AP_134914847354.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/18/AP_134914847354.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration on Friday accused Volkswagen of using a \"sophisticated software algorithm\" to cheat on emissions testing and mask the fact that some models emit too much harmful pollution.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EPA: Volkswagen used \u2018sophisticated software\u2019 to cheat emi"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Law Crime, Volkswagen Ag, Environmental Protection Agency"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe096f\"", "article_summary": "Some Volkswagen cars from model years 2009 to 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency said, include software that can detect when they\u2019re undergoing emissions testing.\nThe Obama administration on Friday accused Volkswagen of using a \u201csophisticated software algorithm\u201d to cheat on emissions testing and mask the fact that some models emit too much harmful pollution.\n\u201cWorking closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules.\nFull emissions controls were activated only during testing and then automatically shut down during normal operation, the agency charged.\nThe EPA has issued \u201ca notice of violation\u201d to the automaker, and the state of California has launched its own investigation into the matter."}
