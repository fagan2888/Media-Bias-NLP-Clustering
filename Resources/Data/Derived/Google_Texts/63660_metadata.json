Among possible moves: leasing dormant private prisons and closing portions of outdated and dangerous state-run facilities.\n\nA former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and former campaign manager for President George W. Bush, Allbaugh cited an outdated process in which corrections staff calculate offenders' early-release credits with a \"Big Chief tablet and a calculator.\" Many facilities are overcrowded, understaffed and crumbling, he said. Finances are tenuous: Mid-year budget cuts will cost the department around $12 million.\n\nFollowing are excerpts from the interview:\n\nQ: What was your initial impression of the prison system?\n\nA: \u201cMy hope was that we would be in the 21st Century. I think in a lot of respects we\u2019re not even in the 20th Century.\"\n\nAllbaugh picks up a nearly five-inch thick prisoner\u2019s file and drops it on his desk with a sold thud. \u201cThis goes back to the territorial days of prisons. Yes, we have a computer with software that\u2019s 30 years old, but it\u2019s key punch, which is ripe for human error. So everything is backed up with this stuff \u2013 paper.\n\n\u201cWe have a basketball gymnasium at Kate Barnard (Community Corrections Center), it\u2019s full of records. We can\u2019t even use it for the women over here. That\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s an error I\u2019m going to change. This (paper) drives the system. Without this, we\u2019re blind. We\u2019ve got to do something to get us into the 21st Century.\u201d\n\nQ: How do you fix the state corrections system?\n\nA: \u201cProgress is made in small steps. The first thing I have to do is start telling the story about the department, its condition, its dilapidated facilities. A lot of the facilities need to be closed. We\u2019ve got two of them, OSR (Oklahoma State Reformatory) and OSP (Oklahoma State Penitentiary) that are both over 100 years old. We have locks and doors and all types of mechanisms that do not work, so our correctional officers are at risk \u2013 hourly. And we only pay those guys $12.78 per hour, and we\u2019re down about 700 on correctional officers. Hopefully, one silver lining to the oil and gas bust will be we can get back some of the people who were with us before and new ones, getting them trained and getting them back on the yards. We are staffed about as minimally as we possibly can be.\u201d\n\nQ: Do you plan to shut down parts of the penitentiary, the reformatory or other facilities?\n\nA: \u201cI don\u2019t have the capacity. The only thing we have today is relying on private prisons. I really don\u2019t like that. The state is paying a premium to access those beds because they\u2019re for-profit. There are two (private) facilities in Sayre and Watonga that are unused right now. I reached out to their owners to see if we might reach an accommodation to give us some relief and allow us to close some facilities...\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not arguing for (leasing more private prison beds). I\u2019m arguing for maybe leasing those two facilities, operated with our people, according to our manual, our systems, our standards, expanding our efficiency by closing down some of these units that are in bad disrepair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to cost more money (to lease private beds). We can do it cheaper. We can do it holistically \u2013 our way instead of their way. And we are confident in the system we have.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using facilities in a way they weren\u2019t designed. We\u2019re housing inmates in those units to correct the deficiencies in the system. Yes, they may be called temporary beds, but they\u2019re permanent beds. In gymnasiums, dining halls.\n\n\u201cMost of these facilities weren\u2019t designed as prisons. That\u2019s error number one. But the state does what it can. It does have a budget problem.\u201d\n\nQ: Are you considering selling a state prison to a private company?\n\nA: \u201cNo. Private prisons would not buy one unit we have today. Most of the way we get our property \u2013 it\u2019s an old boys' home or an old mental hospital, and we have to come in and put up fences and harden it.\u201d\n\nQ: Is retaining staff a problem?\n\nA: \u201cIt\u2019s tough. Our correctional officers\u2019 turnover rate is approaching 35 percent annually. That means we\u2019re always investing money in training and hosting the academies. All that stuff costs money. Our correctional staff is getting older.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out what we can do as an agency to retain our correctional officer population.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our vision is: Can we make it to the end of the day? We don\u2019t have a two-year program, a five-year program, a seven-year program. I\u2019m hoping however long my tenure here is that we can establish some sort of planning group here internally and move the ball down the court and have a plan we can put before the Legislature that gives us certainty.\n\n\u201cWe will have one (a long-range plan) on my watch. I just don\u2019t what it will look like yet, on day 32.\u201d\n\nQ: How will you address growth in offenders?\n\nA: \u201cWe\u2019re on the wrong glide path when it comes to incarceration rates. In fiscal year 2017, we\u2019ll probably add another 900 to 1,200 people into the system. We\u2019re at 122 percent capacity system-wide, and if it weren\u2019t for the private prisons, we would really be up the creek without a paddle.\n\n\u201cThe $20 million (supplemental appropriation requested by) the governor so kindly gave us will buy us a few extra days, but it\u2019s tied directly to how fast they\u2019re being thrown into prison. We need to look at criminal justice and figure out better ways to address our first and second time offenders, especially the non-violent ones.\n\n\u201cThe mandatory sentencing \u2013 we\u2019re paying a price for that. And I understand the rationale. I\u2019m just as much a law and order guy as the next person. But there has to be a reality check at some point when we\u2019re predicting somewhere between 900 and 1,200 (more offenders) next year. And I don\u2019t have 900 to 1,200 beds out there...\n\n\u201cSociety has to take ownership of this issue. I understand that, I\u2019m for it. But we have to be smart about how we are penalizing some of these offenders, particularly nonviolent offenders. Half our population is nonviolent offenders. Half our population is drug offenders, too, in some fashion. We\u2019ve got to get our arms around that.\u201d\n\nQ: Do you think putting nonviolent offenders in prison with violent offenders contributes to recidivism?\n\nA: \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It makes them hardened criminals, particularly if they don\u2019t have anything to look forward to on their (early release) credits. If they\u2019re nonviolent and in with a violent offender and have to make it to 85 percent (of time served) before they gain anything \u2013 forget it. They\u2019re toast. Men and women. They\u2019re going to be captured by the system. It\u2019s a lot uglier than anybody knows.\u201d\n\nQ: What strengths do you bring to this job that are going to be needed for DOC?\n\nA: \u201cThe ability to make a decision quickly. I\u2019m a decision maker. That\u2019s what I thrive on. Not only making a decision, you have to be able to implement it. Then you need to be sure people are held accountable, starting with myself...\n\n\u201cIf there are problems in the system, it\u2019s my responsibility to articulate those issues, instead of being on the back end. (Not doing so) is not dealing your cards on the table properly for all to see. That\u2019s one thing I do \u2013 I call them like I see them. Some don\u2019t like that, some people can\u2019t handle that. That\u2019s one thing about me \u2013 I\u2019m direct.\u201d\n\nQ: With all of the challenges, why did you accept the position?\n\nA: \u201cI love making a difference. I believe we all exist to make a difference in something, whatever it is \u2013 your passion.\u201d\n\nQ: You have no corrections experience. Why choose to work for DOC?\n\nA: \u201cWhy not? They need help. Lack of corrections experience doesn\u2019t matter. What this job requires is management and the ability not to be shy to make decisions, ask a lot of questions. This place is filled with professionals in corrections, but I think the department has suffered somewhat over the years. I\u2019m talking about decades, by growing people up in the system and promoting them to director. It\u2019s always good to have a fresh set of eyes and ears to come in.\u201d\n\nQ: Three factors seem to be working against the department \u2013 lack of manpower, deteriorating facilities and a continued rise in the number of inmates. Given the lack of funding, what\u2019s the worst-case scenario?\n\nA: \u201cMy job is to prevent that. I can design several worst-case scenarios. (What if) we have a meltdown at a prison? It\u2019s very, very dangerous. That\u2019s the worst-case scenario. The other end of the spectrum is the feds come in, as they have in other states, and say, 'You have to start letting people out.\u2019 That\u2019s a problem, too. Then the public is immediately at risk.\u201d\n\nQ: How long do you intend to stay? Will you become permanent director?\n\nA: \u201cYou have to ask the (corrections) board. I\u2019m not sure they want me to stay. We\u2019ll see what happens. The department needed a director, and I\u2019m filling the shoes right now. If they want me to stay, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it.\"\n\nOklahoma Watch is a nonprofit, nonpartisan journalism organization that produces in-depth and investigative content on a range of public-policy issues facing the state.
