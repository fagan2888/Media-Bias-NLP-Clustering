JEFFERSON CITY – Senator-elect Bob Onder prefiled the first bill of his 2015 legislative package today. The bill strengthens Missouri’s existing Health Care Freedom Act by protecting Missourians and Missouri businesses from Obamacare insurance mandates. Specifically, the bill would require insurers to follow the Obamacare law as written and not accept federal subsidies. Those insurers who accept subsidies in violation of the law would have their license suspended by the state.

“Missourians spoke loudly against Obamacare with over 71 percent voting in favor of the Health Care Freedom Act in 2010 and a majority voting to not allow the Governor to establish a state exchange in 2012,” said Senator-elect Onder. “During the 2014 elections, citizens of the 2nd Senatorial district in St. Charles County identified the continued fight against the implementation of Obamacare as a top priority. I believe this bill is yet another step in that direction.”

In addition to today’s filing, Senator-elect Onder intends to introduce other legislative priorities for the 2015 session during the prefiling period.

The 2015 legislative session begins on January 7. New legislation can be filed through February 26, 2015.
