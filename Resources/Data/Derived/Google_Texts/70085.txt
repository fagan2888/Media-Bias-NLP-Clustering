What’s more awesome than a Tesla coil rigged to play musical notes? How about a Tesla coil playing the Game of Thrones theme song?

For those who may not be familiar with it, a Tesla coil is “an air-core transformer used to produce high voltages of high-frequency alternating currents.” Or, in this case, it’s specially constructed to play musical notes.

ArcAttack, a music group that incorporates custom-built ‘singing’ Tesla coils into their shows, built the two smaller Tesla coils featured in the video to “check them onto airplanes as baggage.” (Why the group would need to take a Tesla coil on an airplane is anyone’s guess. Easier than shipping?) In order to test them, the group made this amazing music video.

The video has been out for a couple months, but only recently got noticed. And thankfully, ArcAttack has many other fantastic Tesla coil videos to watch, like a Tesla coil controlled via Xbox Kinect. You’re welcome.

Does it get any cooler than this? No. No it doesn’t.
