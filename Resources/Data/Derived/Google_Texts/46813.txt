The American Federation of Government Employees selected to former House Budget Committee staff director Thomas Kahn as its new legislative director on April 4.

“Tom has more than 30 years of experience on Capitol Hill and is one of the foremost experts on the federal budget,” AFGE National president J. David Cox Sr. said, in a statement.

“We are proud to welcome him to the AFGE family, where he will lead our legislative program and fight for government employees to get the funding and support they need to deliver quality programs and services to the American people.”

According to a 2011 Washington Post story, Kahn joined the House Budget Committee staff in 1997, after working for former Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., and being a corporate attorney from New York firm, Sullivan & Cromwell.

The article noted that Kahn was integral in the 1997 budget agreement, which began four years of balanced budgets, and a 2010 budget resolution to help pave the way for passage of the Affordable Care Act.

Kahn replaces Beth Moten, who served as AFGE’s legislative and political director for 26 years before retiring in December 2015.
