Kimar Williams, a senior guard who helped lead Constitution to a 24-8 record and the the PIAA Class A state championship, committed Sunday to play at Florida International.

The 6-foot-1, 170-pound Williams, the Public League Division A's most valuable player, was also recruited by Canisius, Delaware, Niagara, Rider, Robert Morris, and Towson.

Of not drawing any interest from Big Five schools, Williams said, "It was a little bit disappointing, but I used it as motivation. It is what it is. I'm just glad Florida International wanted me."

Williams, an Inquirer second-team all-Southeastern Pennsylvania selection, averaged 16.2 points this season for the Generals.

In the state final against District 10's Farrell, he contibuted 20 points, including two three-pointers, and eight assists in an 85-53 victory.

The Frankford resident's only visit was to Florida International.
