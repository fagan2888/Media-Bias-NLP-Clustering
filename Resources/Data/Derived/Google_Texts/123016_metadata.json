The president had no choice. Any claim that Hayden possessed credentials that match those of her distinguished predecessors over the last 40 years would have been dismissed as false.\n\nThe video commercial about Hayden that the White House released the same day also made no such claims. And yes, you read that right: the White House produced a political, campaign-style commercial touting her candidacy: \u201cI\u2019m Carla Hayden, a nominee to be the 14th Librarian of Congress,\u201d she announces.\n\nThe camera follows Hayden as she walks through the Baltimore public library and greets patrons standing at a card catalog (does the library still use printed catalog cards?). The camera pans to men standing in front of a row of desktop computers as they presumably apply for jobs online. Then the commercial shows blighted neighborhoods in Baltimore.\n\nThis seems unprecedented. There appears to be no other case in which a presidential nominee has actually appeared in an ad to lobby the Senate for her confirmation.\n\nWho produced it, what did it cost, and who paid for it? The American taxpayer? Why was it made?\n\nThe answer to the last question is obvious. The mere existence of the commercial is a tip-off that the White House knows Hayden is a weak candidate who lacks the credentials that the public -- and, more importantly, the United States Congress (it is, after all, the Library of Congress) -- have come to expect from a librarian of Congress. Thus, Obama handlers have tried to boost the odds of winning confirmation through an unprecedented public relations stunt.\n\nThat was unwise, for the video turns out to be more revealing than the White House could have imagined. Indeed, Hayden\u2019s own words make a compelling case against her confirmation. Her misguided vision for the Library is simplistic, wrong-headed, and alarming.\n\nIn her White House video, Hayden describes her experience in Baltimore:\n\nThe neighborhood libraries were opportunity centers. An opportunity to get the latest Harry Potter as soon as it came out, a place that you could apply for a job \u2026 and a place that you could find that step up in your life.\n\nThat statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of the Library of Congress (LOC). Hayden seems to think of the LOC as just another neighborhood branch library, merely on a larger scale. It isn\u2019t. The LOC is not a local library that loans books to the public.\n\nNo one can check out \u201cthe latest Harry Potter,\u201d or for that matter any book, from the LOC.\n\nNor is the LOC an online job-search center. Again, local libraries can do this, as they have apparently done in Baltimore. Nor is the Library of Congress the place \u201cto find that step up in your life\u201d -- whatever that means.\n\nIt sounds like Hayden is lobbying for another term as president of the American Library Association, not the position of librarian of Congress.\n\nHayden claims the Library of Congress \u201cepitomizes what libraries are in every community.\u201d Hayden is wrong. The LOC does not \u201cepitomize\u201d what every community library is, nor should it be treated as a community library. It is a unique institution with several specific and special missions that is not like other libraries.\n\nFirst, it serves the research needs of its principal client, the United States Congress. The scholarly research that the library staff produces for members of the House of Representatives and the Senate on an annual basis is enormous.\n\nSecond, it serves as one of the finest research libraries in the world for American scholars and for international scholars who travel here. That is one of the many reasons why, for the last forty years, the librarians of Congress have been important scholars and historians in their own right.\n\nThird, the LOC\u2019s mission is to preserve its vast holdings for future generations.\n\nNeither President Obama\u2019s nominating statement nor Dr. Hayden\u2019s comment says one word about her ability to sponsor and inspire cutting-edge research; about her ability to attract scholars from around the world to the Library of Congress; about her ability to enhance the collections in content and subject matter; about her plans for innovative conferences, symposia, and exhibitions; or her plans to revive the National Book Festival, the LOC\u2019s signature event, which has suffered cutbacks and decline during the Obama administration; or her willingness to embrace the LOC\u2019s mission to promote American cultural greatness.\n\nBut Hayden does talk about things she has done that have nothing to do with the mission of the Library of Congress. She speaks about how the Baltimore library responded to the riots and racial disturbances there:\n\nDuring the recent unrest in Baltimore, it was very evident that people needed not only information, but a safe place and a trusted place to go and so \u2026 we decided to open the library right across from the epicenter of the unrest \u2026 we became a site for people to actually get food, to get supplies \u2026 and so it became that community meeting place, and people were so relieved to have a safe place to be.\n\nThis was an admirable act of community service by Dr. Hayden. But this is not the job description of the librarian of Congress. It is the job description of a community organizer. That might qualify Dr. Hayden to become the first director of the Obama Presidential Library, but not to become the head of America\u2019s leading research and cultural institution.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Librarian of Congress Nominee Carla Hayden Seems To Not Know What Job She is Up For", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Who paid for this?
