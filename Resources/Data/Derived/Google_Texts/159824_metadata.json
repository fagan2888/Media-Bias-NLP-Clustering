(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nROCHESTER \u2013 If Zumbrota-Mazeppa was going down, it wouldn\u2019t be without a fight.\n\nFacing top-seeded and second-ranked Stewartville in the Section 1AA-West semifinals, the Cougars put up little resistance in the first two sets, losing 25-10, 25-12. But Z-M had shown success against the Class 2A powerhouse earlier this season, taking the Tigers to five sets.\n\n\u201cWe figured that Stewartville was going to take us lightly and we were going to come in and fight back,\u201d said Z-M libero Molly Lawler. \u201cWe knew our potential against them.\u201d\n\nThe Cougars cut the third-set deficit to 24-23, but Stewartville completed the sweep, winning the match 25-10, 25-12, 25-23.\n\nThe loss was a bitter pill to swallow, but Z-M head coach Stacy Liebenow couldn\u2019t be upset after the feisty comeback try.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of them than in the third set to be able to come back and fight,\u201d Liebenow said. \u201cI told them before the start of the third game, \u2018Leave everything out on the court,\u2019 and they did that.\u201d\n\nEarly on, the jitters seemed to get to the Cougars as the Tigers got four of their first five points thanks to Z-M hitting errors. When Stewartville was able to get their offense set, Maddie Hettinger was the big swinger for the Tigers, piling up a game-high 16 kills. Up 19-10 in the first set, Stewartville took a 1-0 lead after scoring six straight points to close out the set.\n\nIn the second set, the Cougars\u2019 hitters were still out of sync as the teams\u2019 first nine points came from hitting and serving errors by Stewartville. It wasn\u2019t until a kill by Carley Henning that made it 17-10 that Z-M generated its own point during the second set. All afternoon, it was a frustrating hitting day for Henning, the Cougars\u2019 top hitter.\n\n\u201cThey knew Carley was our go-to when we needed it,\u201d Liebenow said. \u201cWe were struggled on the outside trying to find a rhythm. They had a great block out there on our outsides and got in our outsides\u2019 heads.\n\n\u201cThey were pushing us to our limits and making us frustrated a little bit, so we were out of sorts.\u201d\n\nWith elimination looming, Z-M was intent on going down swinging.\n\n\u201cOur plan was to just leave it all out on the court and play with heart,\u201d said Lawler, who led the Cougars with 18 digs.\n\nAn ace serve by Henning made it 6-3, forcing the Tigers to take a time out. After that, Stewartville was able to regroup, tying the match at 9-9, then scoring eight of the next nine points to go up 18-10.\n\nBut from that point, the Tigers couldn\u2019t close the match as a litany of attacking errors put the Cougars back into the match, 22-18. Then with Henning on the bench, Z-M\u2019s other attackers came alive and cut the deficit to 23-21 after a kill by Katelyn Buck. Buck was the team\u2019s leader in kills with six.\n\n\u201cWe came back and our right sides finally found (the ball) and our outsides managed to keep the ball in play when Carley was out, too,\u201d Liebenow said.\n\nA swing by Henning went off a Stewartville blocker, cutting the Tigers\u2019 lead to 24-23. But Stewartville was able to punch its ticket to the sub-section finals following a kill by Stephanie Schmidt.\n\nHenning finished with four kills, and Kalli Paukert ended the match with 11 set assists and 11 digs. For the Tigers, Marissa Behrens finished with eight kills and Ashley Eberle and Meghan Schmitz had 14 digs apiece.\n\nAgain for Liebenow, it was hard to be upset after Z-M\u2019s late surge.\n\n\u201cWe had a great run this last five or six games. I told the girls, \u2018There\u2019s nothing to hang your heads about,\u2019 Liebenow said. \u201cStewartville\u2019s a great team; (head coach John Dzubay\u2019s) got a great program. They\u2019re a tough team.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,Volleyball,Zumbrota-Mazeppa Cougars", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "ROCHESTER \u2013 If Zumbrota-Mazeppa was going down, it wouldn\u2019t be without a fight.\r\n\r\nFacing top-seeded and second-ranked Stewartville in the Section 1AA-West semifinals, the Cougars put up little resistance in the first two sets, losing 25-10, 25-12.
