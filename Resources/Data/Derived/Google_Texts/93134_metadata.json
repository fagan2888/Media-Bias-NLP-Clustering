See the video and transcript below.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nThere is the only one way to explain the new proposal by Speaker of the House John Boehner and other top Republicans for stopping President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty: they don\u2019t want to stop it at all.\n\nHere\u2019s the story.\n\nRepublicans have two options: the smart option and the stupid option.\n\nThe smart option would be for Republicans to pass a short-term continuing resolution to fund the government through January. That would allow Republicans to come into office and take power in the Senate. Then Republicans could do what Congresses have done for centuries: avoid passing omnibus spending bills, which tie all spending together and lead to shutdowns, and instead fund the government through separate appropriations bills, one per department. That de-links funding for the Defense Department, for example, from funding for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. Obama would have a tough time vetoing a standalone Defense funding bill that has nothing to do with executive amnesty.\n\nThen there\u2019s the stupid option.\n\nRepublicans could push forward an omnibus spending bill that would completely fund the government through next September, but fund the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 and Obama\u2019s amnesty \u2013through next March. That would effectively allow 60 days of funding for Obama\u2019s program to give work permits to illegal immigrants.\n\nNow, Obama probably won\u2019t accept the deal, and will shut down the government over the failure to fully fund his executive amnesty. Speaker Boehner will then cave, and fund the entire program. We know this because that\u2019s exactly what he did regarding Obamacare two years ago, during the infamous government shutdown.\n\nBut let\u2019s say Obama signs the bill. There\u2019s no guarantee Speaker Boehner will fight over DHS funding in March, either. In fact, certain Republican congresspeople have already indicated he won\u2019t.\n\nNaturally, Boehner is pursuing the stupid option. Why? Not because he\u2019s stupid, but because he likes Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty allows him to sign off on the establishment Republican soft-on-immigration policy while simultaneously complaining about Dictator Obama. He can win points with the base by bashing President Obama, and at the same time, greenlight Obama\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 which Republican establishment types from the Wall Street Journal to Jeb Bush to the Chamber of Commerce have been pushing relentlessly as \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d Obama has given them cover. All they have to do now is whine about Obama being a Big Bad Tyrant, then fund his tyranny. They can pop the cork in the back offices secretly while hypocritically blasting Obama for seizing their power in public.\n\nThey\u2019re playing conservatives for suckers.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "A Truth Revolt video.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "A Truth Revolt video.", "title": "Ben Shapiro: Republicans Secretly Want Obama's Amnesty", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/247194/ben-shapiro-republicans-secretly-want-obamas-truthrevoltorg", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:30-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/247194/ben-shapiro-republicans-secretly-want-obamas-truthrevoltorg", "description": "A Truth Revolt video.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Shapiro: Republicans Secretly Want Obama's Amnesty"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T19:50:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf697\"", "article_summary": "Ben Shapiro explains why establishment Republicans aren't using the power of the purse to stop Barack Obama's executive amnesty: They don't want to stop it.\nThat de-links funding for the Defense Department, for example, from funding for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nPresident Obama\u2019s executive amnesty allows him to sign off on the establishment Republican soft-on-immigration policy while simultaneously complaining about Dictator Obama.\nNot because he\u2019s stupid, but because he likes Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nObama would have a tough time vetoing a standalone Defense funding bill that has nothing to do with executive amnesty."}
