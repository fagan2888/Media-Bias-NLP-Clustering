But if you took the over on anything less than four minutes, you lost.\n\nIt has actually come to this in the Republican presidential primary. Last week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio mocked frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump, claiming that Trump had small hands and suggesting none-too-subtly that men with small hands are not, ahem, manly.\n\nRelated: Trump: A Perfect Storm of Voter Rage, Reality TV and Social Media\n\nIn the opening minutes of last night\u2019s debate, hosted by Fox News Channel, host Bret Baier went straight at Rubio for lowering the tone of the campaign.\n\n\u201cSen. Rubio, three weeks ago, you said, \u2018I don\u2019t do the personal attacks, primarily because it\u2019s not who I am, because it\u2019s beneath the office I\u2019m seeking, and also because I don\u2019t want to embarrass my kids.\u2019 But in last week, you\u2019ve mocked Mr. trump\u2019s hands, you\u2019ve made fun of his spelling, you\u2019ve called him a con artist, you\u2019ve suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other jokes and jabs. So, what happened?\u201d\n\nRubio immediately went into serious mode, claiming that, much to his regret, the media had forced him to resort to puerile insults to get attention. The argument might have carried a little more weight had the Fox cameras not caught him grinning and wiggling his hands in front of the camera as Baier questioned him.\n\nTrump, demonstrating the grade-school-level impulse control that has marked his campaign thus far, completely avoided the off-ramp to the high road that Rubio offered him. Instead, he took the opportunity to assure the crowd that he is indeed well endowed.\n\n\u201cLook at hose hands,\u201d he said, holding them up to the camera. \u201cAre they small hands?\u201d the crowd roared. \u201cAnd, he referred to my hands, \u2018If they\u2019re small, something else must be small.\u2019\u201d\n\nLooking out at the crowd, he said, \u201cI guarantee you there\u2019s no problem. I guarantee you.\u201d\n\nRelated: Debating the Deficit: 'Mr. Trump Your Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up!'\n\nIn defense of the Fox News Channel moderators, who in addition to Baier included Chris Wallace and, most notably, Megyn Kelly, the debate got better after that. (Kelly, who Trump attacked viciously after the first Fox debate in August, was the billionaire\u2019s ostensible reason for skipping the last FNC debate.)\n\nIn the end, Trump lost the debate on points, but won it by remaining on his feet throughout.\n\nDiscussion ranged through domestic and foreign policy, and at every turn both Rubio and Cruz had attacks ready for Trump, whose answers, as they always are, were loud, authoritative-sounding, and substance-free.\n\nWallace nailed him on multiple claims about how his proposed elimination of waste, fraud and abuse in the government and, more specifically, his promise to saved hundreds of billions of dollars by letting government-run health insurance negotiate drug prices, were nonsense once anyone looked at the math.\n\nTrump also plainly backtracked on the hardline immigration stance that has won him so many voters thus far. He said that he had changed his position on the immigration of skilled workers, saying that allowing some in was necessary for the success of US businesses. Whether or not that shift will penetrate to his base is, at this point, unclear.\n\nRelated: After Stumbling Badly Over Health Care, Trump Now Has a Plan\n\nBoth Rubio and Cruz delivered multiple well-placed bows, hitting Trump on his lack of policy specificity across virtually every element of the federal government. Trump not once, but twice, insisted that through sheer force of will, he would persuade US military leaders to authorize their troops to commit war crimes.\n\nAt various points in the debate, the moderators had to ask Trump, Cruz and Rubio to stop shouting at each other, if only so that the audience could understand what was being said.\n\nLost in the shuffle for much of the debate was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who by simply maintaining his cool, has managed to look, if not presidential, then at least like a grownup through the most recent debates.\n\nBetween Saturday and Sunday, another Republican 175 delegates will be awarded to the remaining GOP candidates in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, and Puerto Rico. The most recent polls in those states show Trump a formidable lead.\n\nOr, as The Donald might say, \u201cI guarantee you, it\u2019s yuge.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last night\u2019s Republican presidential debate was held in Detroit, not Las Vegas, so the", "title": "For Trump, Last Night\u2019s Debate Was Another Episode of Survivor", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/Trump-Last-Night-s-Debate-Was-Another-Episode-Survivor", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTS97SH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/Trump-Last-Night-s-Debate-Was-Another-Episode-Survivor", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTS97SH.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last night\u2019s Republican presidential debate was held in Detroit, not Las Vegas, so the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "(Kelly, who Trump attacked viciously after the first Fox debate in August, was the billionaire\u2019s ostensible reason for skipping the last FNC debate.)\nLast week, Florida Sen.
