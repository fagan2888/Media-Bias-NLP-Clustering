It was Tuesday morning in NBC\u2019s studios in Sochi when Costas, the face of the network\u2019s Olympics coverage, clinked glasses with his colleague Mary Carillo. He also pointed to his face.\n\n\u201cMy eyes can\u2019t get any redder,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we go. Down the hatch!\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for a strange sight to emerge as an Olympics phenomenon. At the London Games, for example, the lasting image was U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney flashing an unimpressed scowl on the medal stand.\n\nBut no one was betting on Costas\u2019s red eyes as the spectacle of the Sochi Games.\n\nIn the opening minutes of NBC\u2019s first broadcast last week, a bespectacled Costas announced he was staring down an eye issue, having woken up with one eye swollen shut. But a viral infection spread to his other eye for Monday\u2019s broadcast, making for an unseemly vision on NBC. His blurry and sensitive eyes made it impossible for Costas to complete his hosting duties, he said, and NBC announced Tuesday that Matt Lauer would replace Costas on the network\u2019s primetime and late-night Olympics broadcasts, part of a package that cost the network $775 million.\n\nTuesday would be the first night since 1988 that someone other than Costas hosted NBC\u2019s primetime Olympics show, a streak that lasted 157 consecutive nights, according to NBC publicists. The network has listed its star anchor as day-to-day. Costas said he hoped his condition would improve \u201cin the next couple of days\u201d and that he would return to his seat.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is go through the rest of my life owing Matt Lauer a bunch of favors,\u201d Costas said in a news release.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An eye infection has shelved NBC broadcaster Bob Costas, as his blurry and sensitive eyes have made it impossible for him to complete his hosting duties, he announced Tuesday.
