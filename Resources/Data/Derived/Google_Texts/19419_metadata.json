Chuck Schumer (D-NY) predicted Republicans in the U.S. Senate would not follow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u201cover the cliff\u201d in blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to fill that spot.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Martha and Senator Sanders there. And let\u2019s get more on this now from the number two Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, also member of the Judiciary Committee. So let\u2019s look at the math right here. You heard Senator Cruz say he\u2019s going to filibuster. Mitch McConnell says it\u2019s not going to happen. You only have 46 votes in the Senate so there\u2019s not going to be a nominee here.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: Well, the job, first and foremost, is for the president to nominate and for the Senate to hold hearings and go through the process. You know, the Constitution, Ted Cruz holds the Constitution, you know, when he walks through the halls of Congress. Let him show me the clause that says president\u2019s only president for three years. Does this mean we don\u2019t hold hearings on anything? The president shouldn\u2019t nominate Cabinet ministers? It certainly might mean the Republicans shouldn\u2019t repeal ObamaCare in the fourth year. And so our job is to go forward with the process and then we\u2019ll see what happens. That\u2019s what Democrats \u2014\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHUMER: Well, no, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. You know, the kind of obstructionism that Mitch McConnell\u2019s talking about, he\u2019s harking back to his old days, you know, he recently he said, well, I want regular order. But in 2010, right after the election or right during the election, he said, \u201cMy number one job is to defeat Barack Obama,\u201d without even knowing what Barack Obama was going to propose. Here, he doesn\u2019t even know who the president\u2019s going to propose and he said, no, we\u2019re not having hearings; we\u2019re not going to go forward to lead the Supreme Court vacant at 300 days in a divided time. This kind of obstructionism isn\u2019t going to last. And you know, we Democrats didn\u2019t do this. When in the \u2014 we nominated \u2014 we voted 97-0 for Justice Kennedy in the last year of Reagan\u2019s term.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: After voting down Justice (INAUDIBLE) and Justice \u2014\n\nSCHUMER: Yes. Well, but we had nominations. And that\u2019s the point here. The president\u2019s going to nominate. I believe that many of the mainstream Republicans, when the president nominates a mainstream nominee, will not want to follow Mitch McConnell over the cliff \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So that\u2019s what you think the president should do, send someone who he thinks can credibly get Republican support rather than send someone who will send a powerful message about the direction he wants to take supporting (ph)?\n\nSCHUMER: I think he \u2014 I think first the American people don\u2019t like this obstruction. When you go right off the bat and say, I don\u2019t care who he nominates, I am going to oppose him, that\u2019s not going to fly. A lot of the mainstream Republicans are going to say I may not follow this. But second, I think the president, past is prologue, will nominate someone who is mainstream. Look \u2014 His nominees in the past have gotten Republican votes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Schumer: Mainstream GOP Will Not Follow McConnell 'Over the Cliff' of Obstructionism on Scalia Successor", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Schumer: Mainstream GOP Will Not Follow McConnell 'Over the Cliff' of Obstructionism on Scalia Successor", "title": "Schumer: Mainstream GOP Will Not Follow McConnell 'Over the Cliff' of Obstructionism on Scalia Successor - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/scum.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/14/schumer-mainstream-gop-will-not-follow-mcconnell-over-the-cliff-of-obstructionism-on-scalia-successor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Schumer: Mainstream GOP Will Not Follow McConnell 'Over the Cliff' of Obstructionism on Scalia Successor", "title": "Schumer: Mainstream GOP Will Not Follow McConnell 'Over the Cliff' of Obstructionism on Scalia Successor - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/scum.jpg", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chuck Shumer, Justice Antonin Scalia, Mitch McConnell,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Schumer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Mitch McConnell", "published_time": "2016-02-14T11:54:22-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "A lot of the mainstream Republicans are going to say I may not follow this.\nSCHUMER: I think he \u2014 I think first the American people don\u2019t like this obstruction.\nBut second, I think the president, past is prologue, will nominate someone who is mainstream.\nAnd let\u2019s get more on this now from the number two Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, also member of the Judiciary Committee.\nYou know, the Constitution, Ted Cruz holds the Constitution, you know, when he walks through the halls of Congress."}
