The results have presented by breaking the country down into 326 local authority areas, or 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships.\n\nThe investigation combined the results from seven different categories -\u2013 income, employment, education skills and training, health deprivation and disability, crime, barriers to housing and services, and living environment \u2013 to produce the Index of Multiple Deprivation.\n\nThe results for the Local Enterprise Partnerships showed the Westcountry is relatively less deprived compared to other areas of the country.\n\nThe national ranking of Westcountry local authorities (out of 326 councils) (1=Most deprived)", "article_metadata": {"description": "PLYMOUTH is the 82nd most deprived community in the country, according to new figures.
