So cool looking and excellent food, reasonable prices and I like that the little bar down here overlooked the water. \"\n\nThe property has been vacant for several years, but not for too much longer.\n\nAnother popular restaurant is moving to the site.\n\nThe boatyard will construct an entirely new building to call home.\n\nThat leaves the boatyard's current location available for bud and alleys to move-in.\n\nOwners already have plans for the new sister to their original seaside location.\n\n\"We\u2019re really going to be focusing on the beautiful roof deck and we're going to be serving lunch and dinner there on the roof deck and we are also going to have late night djs and bands. And really bring some nightlife to grand lagoon,\" said Dave Rauschkolb, Bud & Alleys owner.\n\nThese new restaurants will be creating dozens of new jobs.\n\n\"We have a lot of talent at bud and alleys that we're going to be bringing over there as well as hiring a whole lot of people,\" said Rauschkolb.\n\nAnd as for added competition, current restaurant owners and managers say more choices will be good for everyone.\n\n\"We\u2019re so thrilled the new restaurants are coming to the area. We wish them the best of luck,\" said Mia Howard, runaway bay coordinator.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The New Year means new restaurants in Panama City Beach.", "language": "english", "author": "Tiffany Huertas", "og": {"description": "The New Year means new restaurants in Panama City Beach.", "title": "Thomas Drive Expanding this New Year", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/New-Restaurant-Activity-in-Panama-City-Beach--238370411.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/ADC/A82/ADCA827B9C094509901139F6929F01AB", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/397/668/39766827CCD74345967777E7111ABF34.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "The New Year means new restaurants in Panama City Beach.", "title": "Thomas Drive Expanding this New Year", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/New-Restaurant-Activity-in-Panama-City-Beach--238370411.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/business+thomas+drive.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Thomas Drive Expanding this New Year", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Thomas Drive Expanding this New"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f74\"", "article_summary": "It was April of 2010, when fire destroyed the iconic treasure ship restaurant off Thomas drive.\nThe treasure ship had been a landmark in the community since it opened in 19-78.\nAnd really bring some nightlife to grand lagoon,\" said Dave Rauschkolb, Bud & Alleys owner.\nSo cool looking and excellent food, reasonable prices and I like that the little bar down here overlooked the water. \"\nThat leaves the boatyard's current location available for bud and alleys to move-in."}
