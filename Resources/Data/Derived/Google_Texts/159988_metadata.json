Stephen Fincher, wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAct like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don\u2019t make faces during televised, public events,\u201d Ms. Lauten added.\n\nMs. Lauten also blasted the president and first lady for not showing respect for their positions and said that contributed to the girls \u201ccoming up a little short in the \u2018good role model\u2019 department.\u201d\n\nMs. Lauten deleted the post after an onslaught of social media backlash, set her profile to private, and posted an apology.\n\n\u201cWhen I first posted on Facebook I reacted to an article and I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAfter many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Ms. Lauten\u2019s first social media gaffe.\n\nIn August she posted a tweet about \u201cshagging\u201d from Mr. Fincher\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\n\u201cGod I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,\u201d Ms. Lauten tweeted in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio.\n\nShe later deleted the tweet and apologized for the accident, clarifying that \u201cshagging\u201d is a dance term, not a sexual reference.\n\n\u201cIt had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don\u2019t think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn\u2019t have it,\u201d Ms. Lauter said, according to Politico.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A GOP staffer issued an apology on Facebook after she called the Malia and Sasha Obama classless for their choice of attire at the national turkey pardoning, sparking social media outrage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A GOP staffer issued an apology on Facebook after she called the Malia and Sasha Obama classless for their choice of attire at the national turkey pardoning, sparking social media outrage.", "title": "Obama daughters outrage: GOP staffer sparks backlash for outfit critique", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/obama-daughters-outrage-gop-staffer-sparks-backlas/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/26/obama-turkey-pardonjpeg-00dcc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/26/obama-turkey-pardonjpeg-00dcc.jpg", "description": "A GOP staffer issued an apology on Facebook after she called the Malia and Sasha Obama classless for their choice of attire at the national turkey pardoning, sparking social media outrage.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama daughters outrage: GOP staffer sparks backlash for outfit critiq"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Elizabeth Lauten, Stephen Fincher, Facebook, Sasha Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7771\"", "article_summary": "AND shagging #pandora,\u201d Ms. Lauten tweeted in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio.\nA GOP staffer issued an apology on Facebook after she called the Malia and Sasha Obama classless for their choice of attire at the national turkey pardoning, sparking social media outrage.\nAnd certainly don\u2019t make faces during televised, public events,\u201d Ms. Lauten added.\nI don\u2019t think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn\u2019t have it,\u201d Ms. Lauter said, according to Politico.\n\u201cAfter many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were.\u201dThis isn\u2019t Ms. Lauten\u2019s first social media gaffe."}
