Family First Health plans to offer medication-assisted treatment for drug and alcohol abuse with the nearly $352,000 it receives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to Family First CEO Jenny Englerth.

Grant money was awarded to health agencies nationwide to treat the prescription opioid abuse and heroin epidemic in America, according to a release Friday from Health and Human Services.

Family First Health will also incorporate routine drug and alcohol screening and add staff with the grant funding, Englerth said. Programming will be operational this summer, she said.

An increased need expressed by patients prompted Family First to pursue the funding, Englerth said. The demand for support exceeded the health center's capacity and the capacity at a community level, she said.

"By adding these resources we believe that we can better meet the needs of our patients and so do our part to bring resources to the table to meet this growing community problem," Englerth said.
