As Texas governor, he rejected two key state components of the act: expansion of Medicaid and establishment of a Texas-based insurance exchange.\n\nOn gay marriage, Perry told CNBC \"Squawk Box\" anchor Joe Kernen in 2014 that Texas voters decided \"by a vote of over 75 percent\" that \"marriage is between one man and one woman, and I respect that. And I respect whatever they want to do in California or New York for that matter.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Commonwealth Club of California in 2014, Perry was asked if he thought homosexuality is a disorder. He answered by comparing it to choices someone makes when he has a predisposition toward alcoholism. \"Whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that,\" he said, according to video of the event shown by a San Francisco TV station. \"I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.\"\n\nPerry supports expanding foreign trade, which he says has been good for Texas. But he is in no hurry for President Obama to get fast-track authority so trade deals through Congress without obstruction, saying that \"if we have to wait until there's a new president, that's OK.\"\n\nRICK PERRY'S POLL STANDING:\n\nNational average, 1.3 percent; Iowa, 1.3 percent; New Hampshire, 1.0 percent; South Carolina, 1.5 percent.\n\nFigures are current averages of polls, tracked by RealClearPolitics.com, that compare the potential candidates in Republican primaries and caucuses.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Rick Perry, rick-perry, rnc-2016, elections, news", "title": "Where does Rick Perry stand?", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Where does Rick Perry stand?\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/rnc-2016/index.ssf/2015/04/where_does_rick_perry_stand.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/nationworld_impact/photo/9887351-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15701294\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-15T19:19:43Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"rick-perry\",\"rnc-2016\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@SteveKoff", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rick Perry&nbsp;suspended his presidential campaign&nbsp;on Sept. 11.
