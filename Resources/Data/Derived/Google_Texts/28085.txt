Five years after his death, Michael Jackson appeared onstage at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday as an eerily lifelike hologram to perform “Slave to the Rhythm” from his recent posthumous album, “Xscape.” The hologram moonwalked across the stage, accompanied by a five-piece band and 16 live dancers. While Jackson’s older brother Jackie teared up and called the performance “amazing,” many fans with a less personal relationship with the singer found the performance to be unsettling. In an online poll on “Good Morning America,” 61 percent of voters found the hologram to be “creepy” rather than “cool,” while other media personalities expressed disapproval on Twitter:
