The online company is a premium cannabis provider that offers a monthly marijuana delivery service to consumers in San Francisco who have a California medical marijuana identification card.\n\nThis high-end marijuana-of-the-month subscription is the brainchild of Dane Pieri, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur. Pieri told The Telegraph, \"We are trying to normalize people's experience of cannabis. We'd like it to be just like any other consumer product.\"\n\nRelated: Budding Pot Industry Has Trouble Stashing Its Cash\n\nMarvina is not a dispensary. Instead, the company partners with local California cannabis growers who package and deliver the product in sleek black boxes.\n\nDelivery drivers will even send text messages to recipients before arrival. The company only accepts cash upon delivery, but is exploring other payment options for the future.\n\nMarvina boasts on their website that their service eliminates the customer's need to choose. Each month the company's gourmet strain mix changes and different samples are provided for purchase. The only choice subscribers need to make is which cannabis package they want: sativa-heavy or indica-heavy.\n\nEach packaged strain includes a description of predicted effects and a flavor profile. Marvina boxes are weighted at 7, 14, and 28 grams and start at $95 per month.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more in CNBC:\n\nIs the China share selloff a teapot tempest?\n\n2 dancers sue Oregon strip club for unpaid wages\n\nHow to escape the black hole of student debt", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/21/Why-Mail-Order-Marijuana-Flying-High", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01032014_Marijuana_Grower.jpg", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "Why Mail-Order Marijuana Is Flying High"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/21/Why-Mail-Order-Marijuana-Flying-High", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01032014_Marijuana_Grower.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c3f\"", "article_summary": "The online company is a premium cannabis provider that offers a monthly marijuana delivery service to consumers in San Francisco who have a California medical marijuana identification card.\nThe only choice subscribers need to make is which cannabis package they want: sativa-heavy or indica-heavy.\nMarvina, a new subscription service, is catching fire\u2014literally.\nThis high-end marijuana-of-the-month subscription is the brainchild of Dane Pieri, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur.\nInstead, the company partners with local California cannabis growers who package and deliver the product in sleek black boxes."}
