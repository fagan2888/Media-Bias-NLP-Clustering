West African immigrants and lifelong Minnesotans, parents and grandparents with kids, church and civic volunteers and weekend warriors using a day off to help nameless people a continent away.\n\nSaturday\u2019s scene at the River\u2019s Edge Convention Center in St. Cloud was the culmination of efforts by several Minnesota nonprofits and task forces to collect and package enough food to fill an entire shipping container with meals for families fighting not just the Ebola outbreak, but now a critical hunger crisis.\n\nWhile the need was somber, the mood was uplifting.\n\n\u201cToday is beautiful,\u201dsaid Rosemond Sarpong Owens, one of the organizers. \u201cWe are coming out of the arctic blast. In Ghana, where I am from, it is 85 or 90 degrees, no white on the ground. We are here today for Liberia.\u201d\n\nOwens said about 700 volunteers worked in three shifts Saturday to package almost 200,000 meals. The goal for the shipment is 285,000. The packages contain life-sustaining staples: fortified rice, soy, goat cheese, protein mix.\n\nSampson Sarclay, whom Owens described as \u201cthe man in charge, small in stature, but very respected,\u201d will travel to Liberia to meet the food shipment, which should arrive in about five weeks. It will travel by rail from Minnesota to New York, where it will be put on a vessel and shipped across the Atlantic to Monrovia.\n\nAbout 700 volunteers worked in three shifts Saturday at the River\u2019s Edge Convention Center in St. Cloud to package almost 200,000 meals for shipment to Liberia. The packages contained life-sustaining staples: fortified rice, soy, goat cheese, protein mix.\n\nSarclay, who fled civil war to the United States 1990, says he feels safe from the disease while traveling. \u201cI am protected by the Lutherans in Liberia,\u201d he said, pausing as a loud speaker told volunteers that the first shift had just packed 59,000 meals.\n\nThe main sponsor, Kids Fighting Hunger, based in Sauk Rapids, hopes to package enough food to feed 1,300 families for a month, said Pam Beard, executive director. \u201cWe have almost 700 volunteers and 50 more waiting to help in this huge space with people busy packaging food,\u201d she said.\n\nOwens said the event had raised about $30,000 toward a goal of $40,000. \u201cMore would help buy fuel for trucks to get the food to rural areas, where they often don\u2019t get aid. Much aid arrives in Monrovia and stays in Monrovia,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad, the condition in Liberia,\u201d said Jeffrey Karbedeh, another organizer. \u201cIt is a third-world country, so when a disease like this virus enters into a community, it spreads very fast. With lack of education to stop it, it\u2019s even more deplorable.\u201d\n\nThe communal culture in rural Liberian villages just adds to the crisis, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to gather together as part of their tradition, to eat together. Many entire families die because of their close association. When Ebola affects one, it can affect the entire community.\u201d\n\nHis group, ShareCARE International, works to provide better health conditions, improve literacy and help people deprived by poverty, war and situations such as the Ebola crisis.\n\nKarbedeh praised U.S. efforts to contain the virus. \u201cLiberia has one of the highest death rates from Ebola. But things are changing now. The presence of U.S. military and other health practitioners is making a difference.\u201d\n\nAbdullah Kiatamba brought 10 volunteers from Brooklyn Park, home to one of Minnesota\u2019s largest Liberian communities, to help box food. As executive director of the Minnesota African Task Force Against Ebola, Kiatamba knows the challenge ahead.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge crisis around food already in Liberia,\u201d he said as he worked the floor of the convention center. \u201cEbola only complicated the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery little step helps alleviate the crisis,\u201d Kiatamba said. \u201cAnd this is a big step today in Minnesota, a powerful message that people are willing to impact lives \u2014 to add their purses and their hearts to feed these hungry families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "They came by the hundreds to help package meals for Liberians trapped in villages by the Ebola quarantine.", "title": "Liberian relief effort draws 700 in St. Cloud", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/liberian-relief-effort-draws-700-in-st-cloud/283601251/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141670125111126.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141670125111126.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "They came by the hundreds to help package meals for Liberians trapped in villages by the Ebola quarantine.", "title": "Liberian relief effort draws 700 in St. Cloud", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/liberian-relief-effort-draws-700-in-st-cloud/283601251/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141670125111126.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141670125111126.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "They came by the hundreds to help package meals for Liberians trapped in villages by the Ebola quarantine."}, "article_summary": "About 700 volunteers worked in three shifts Saturday at the River\u2019s Edge Convention Center in St.\nWe are here today for Liberia.\u201dOwens said about 700 volunteers worked in three shifts Saturday to package almost 200,000 meals.\nThey came by the hundreds from all over central Minnesota, lining up to help package meals for Liberians trapped in villages by the Ebola quarantine.\n\u201cThere was a huge crisis around food already in Liberia,\u201d he said as he worked the floor of the convention center.\n\u201cWe have almost 700 volunteers and 50 more waiting to help in this huge space with people busy packaging food,\u201d she said."}
