Rather, he simply listed the bill number with eight others and slapped it onto the bottom of his announcement to finally grant the pardons to Henry McCollum and Leon Brown.\n\nThat was courageous.\n\nMeanwhile, reaction from advocates for women\u2019s\u2019 health and reproductive freedom are responding to the Governor\u2019s regrettable decision. This is from the ACLU of North Carolina:\n\nGov. McCrory Signs New Abortion Restrictions, Breaking Campaign Promise Again RALEIGH \u2013 On Friday, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed HB 465, a bill that will triple the mandatory waiting time for abortion care to 72 hours, making North Carolina only the fifth state in the nation with such a lengthy forced delay. During his 2012 campaign for governor, McCrory vowed to sign no further restrictions on abortion access. \u201cFor the second time, Governor McCrory has broken his promise to sign no new restrictions on abortion access in our state, making it clear that he does not respect a woman\u2019s ability to make her own personal health care decisions,\u201d said Sarah Preston, acting Executive Director of the ACLU of North Carolina. \u201cThis shameful law will do nothing to help women in North Carolina. Instead, it will force a woman to endure an unnecessary and potentially harmful delay before receiving the care that she and her doctor have decided is right for her.\u201d In 2013, McCrory signed a bill that authorized severe and medically unnecessary restrictions on women\u2019s health clinics that provide abortions A forced waiting period is not necessary because a woman who has decided to have an abortion has already carefully considered her decision. New polling shows that most Americans identify as pro-choice and that seven in 10 Americans say that a woman who has decided to have an abortion should be able to do so without additional hurdles. Medical experts say that these bills do not help women. Instead, they can push abortion later into pregnancy and subject women to stigma and shame. These bills have no medical basis, and medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose these types of laws.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "McCrory Signs New Abortion Restrictions, Breaking Campaign Promise Again RALEIGH \u2013 On Friday, North Carolina Gov.\n\u201cThis shameful law will do nothing to help women in North Carolina.\nDuring his 2012 campaign for governor, McCrory vowed to sign no further restrictions on abortion access.\nNot surprisingly, the Guv didn\u2019t issue any kind of special statement to accompany his decision to approve the bill.\nInstead, they can push abortion later into pregnancy and subject women to stigma and shame."}
