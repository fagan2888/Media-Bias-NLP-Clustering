The Panama City Rescue Mission is hosting its annual Thanksgiving meal today, and Paris took us there to learn about how it's part of a bigger cause.

This free dinner is an annual event that the Panama City Rescue Mission offers every Thanksgiving to the many pepole in our area who are homeless or can't provide a Thanksgiving feast for their family. Rescue Mission doors will open at 11AM for those who plan to come out and get a hot, festive meal.

The Rescue Missions serves over 300 people Thanksgiving dinner every year. It costs them $1.92 per person to fund this meal, but they give it away for free to help those in need.

Although the Mission serves meals 365 days a year, they try to make it extra special for the holidays. This is part of a nationwide program call the Great Thanksgiving Banquet which aims to make everyone feel like they have not been forgotten on Thanksgiving.
