Gruber admits to including \"tortured\" language in the ACA to be obtuse so Americans who are too stupid to understand it, would allow its passage. Adriana said ignoring this major story is media bias and malpractice.\n\n\"The Gruber videos are extremely newsworthy, in fact it's been trending on Twitter all week. How can the networks including the NYT's ignore it?\" she said.\n\nLook for Adriana's columns in the Herald and catch her on \"Trending Now\" on Herald Radio weekdays from 1-3 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "parsely-page": "{\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bostonherald.com\\/herald_radio\\/2014\\/11\\/adriana_cohen_talks_gruber_coverage_on_fox\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"1064652468\",\"title\":\"Adriana Cohen talks Gruber coverage on Fox\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-14T21:30:00Z\",\"authors\":[\"Boston Herald staff\"]}", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Adriana Cohen talks Gruber coverage on Fox"}, "og": {"image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery/public/blog_posts/photo%201%20%2815%29.JPG?itok=trAjUzzM", "title": "Adriana Cohen talks Gruber coverage on Fox"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597309570500616}, "viewport": "maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Look for Adriana's columns in the Herald and catch her on \"Trending Now\" on Herald Radio weekdays from 1-3 p.m.\nAdriana said ignoring this major story is media bias and malpractice.\n\"The Gruber videos are extremely newsworthy, in fact it's been trending on Twitter all week.\nBoston Herald Radio Host and columnist Adriana Cohen appeared on Fox & Friends today to discuss bias in the mainstream media, illustrated by the minimal coverage they've allotted to multiple bombshell videos that have surfaced from Jonathan Gruber, the MIT chief architect of the Affordable Care Act.\nGruber admits to including \"tortured\" language in the ACA to be obtuse so Americans who are too stupid to understand it, would allow its passage."}
