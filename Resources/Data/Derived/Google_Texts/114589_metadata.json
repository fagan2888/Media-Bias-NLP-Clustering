We played poker. We gathered \u2019round Friday nights with our loose change in hand, swapping pennies for poker chips and bored looks for game faces. We played for hours, learning new poker games and strategies, but the biggest lesson wasn\u2019t knowing when to fold or that a flush beats a straight. It was learning to make the most of what we were dealt.\n\nJust exchanging coins for chips was an experience, fishing pennies from my piggy bank and receiving stacks of antique tokens in different colors. Ah, the life of a gambler.\n\nDad had an affinity for change, with a seemingly endless supply, while Mom dug coins from the bottom of her garbage-bag-like purse, unearthing nickels and dimes caked with a combination of tobacco, makeup and purse lint.\n\nPoker forced us to look each other in the eye, if only to get a hint of the cards the others held. Our family never paid closer attention to each other than when pennies were on the line. Victory depended on being able to discern if that smirk on my sister\u2019s face was high school high-jinks or a hidden pair of aces.\n\nEveryone bluffed from time to time, taking advantage of the opportunity to lie and get away with it. Mom always knew when we didn\u2019t have the cards, but folded anyway, not wanting to take unfair advantage. She had watched our faces so many times when we told her we hadn\u2019t broken the lamp or we were at a friend\u2019s house that she could recognize every line and gesture of dishonesty.\n\nMom seldom bluffed, but if she did, nobody called her on it. It was inconceivable that she would deceive us. We were young and naive, not understanding that parents were equally deceptive. They just had better poker faces.\n\nDad introduced new poker games such as Midnight Baseball Rained Out and always commented while dealing, with a \u201ctwo, no help\u201d and a \u201cclub, possible flush.\u201d It\u2019s possible he did it to help us understand the game, but more likely Dad enjoyed, as most fathers do, describing the world around him as if he were a radio sports commentator, explaining what others couldn\u2019t see.\n\nHis running comments became the backdrop for numerous other conversations. Some were to gain insight into a player\u2019s hand, while others were to gain knowledge into us. By channeling all of our energy into maintaining the perfect poker face, we became susceptible to questions that fell below our gambling radar. I may have hid the fact that I was bluffing, but failed to conceal how my day went at school.\n\nWe were just happy to be gambling like adults. Being the youngest, I was always torn between the purchasing power of the penny and not wanting to miss a single hand. My older siblings felt like high rollers on the Vegas strip as they learned lingo such as \u201cfull boat,\u201d \u201ctrips\u201d and \u201cladies,\u201d raising Dad\u2019s bet with a nonchalant flick of the wrist and the steely-eyed gaze of a professional gambler. I tried to mimic that gaze and might have succeeded if I weren\u2019t busy crying because I\u2019d lost the last hand.\n\nConversations were different on poker night, as was the atmosphere. It was like spying on our parents. We heard about their day instead of the other way around. My dad told jokes he heard at the office. They usually had complicated storylines that built up to an even more convoluted punch line like, \u201cPardon me, Roy. Is that the cat that ate your new shoes?\u201d delivered to the \u201cChattanooga Choo Choo\u201d melody.\n\nThe deal went around the table as we each took turns calling the shots. We named the game, dealt the cards and slowly transitioned power from parents to kids. We learned to read faces, understand the odds and make decisions based on limited information. We weren\u2019t just following rules, but defining them as we became gamblers.\n\nI still play cards on Friday nights, but I miss the complicated jokes, tobacco-infused nickels and parents I can no longer bluff.\n\nThe cards haven\u2019t changed, still 52 of them, but I am different and the ante seems to get higher every year.\n\nSpeaking of 52, I want to say happy birthday to my beautiful wife. The best bet I ever made.\n\n\u2014 Christopher Kunz is a Neenah resident.
