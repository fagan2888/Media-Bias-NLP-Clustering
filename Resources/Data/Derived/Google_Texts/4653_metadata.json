He was killed in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Dec. 26.\n\nTwo days earlier, a coalition air strike in Syria killed Charaffe al Mouadan, a Syria-based Islamic State member with a direct link to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the coordinated bombings and shootings in Paris on Nov. 13 which killed 130 people, Warren said.\n\nMouadan was planning further attacks against the West, he added.\n\nAir strikes on Islamic State's leadership helped explain recent battlefield successes against the group, which also lost control of a dam on a strategic supply route near its de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria on Saturday.\n\n\"Part of those successes is attributable to the fact that the organization is losing its leadership,\" Warren said.\n\nHe warned, however: \"It's still got fangs.\"\n\n\"EXCITED ABOUT THIS VICTORY\"\n\nThe Iraqi army's seizure of the center of Ramadi on Sunday is its first major victory against the hardline Sunni Islamists that swept through a third of Iraq in 2014, and came after months of cautious advances backed by coalition air strikes.\n\nThree mortar rounds landed about 500 meters (0.3 miles) from Prime Minister Abadi's location during his visit, security sources said. The prime minister was not in danger but was forced to leave the area, they said.\n\nArriving by helicopter in the shattered city west of Baghdad, Abadi traveled in a convoy of Humvees and met soldiers at the main government complex captured by counter-terrorism forces on Monday, where he planted the tri-color Iraqi flag.\n\nHe had announced the visit to Ramadi himself on Twitter and declared Thursday a national holiday in celebration, even though security forces must still remove explosives planted throughout the city and clear out fighters in some densely built-up areas.\n\nRamadi was the only city to have fallen under Islamic State control since Abadi took office in September 2014.\n\n\"He is excited about this victory, because he managed to remove this blot from his historical record as commander-in-chief of the armed forces,\" said Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based analyst who has worked with the Iraqi government.\n\nThe retaking of Ramadi suggested Abadi's strategy of heavy U.S. air support while sidelining the Shi'ite militias could be effective. The militias have served as a bulwark against Islamic State but drawn objections from Washington.\n\n\"Ramadi is an example that the regular army wishes to promote for upcoming battles of liberation,\" Hashimi said.\n\nCoalition spokesman Warren said casualties to Iraqi forces during the battle for Ramadi were in the low double digits. He and Iraqi officials put Islamic State casualties in the hundreds.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm those estimates.\n\nLONG ROAD TO MOSUL\n\nThe government has designated the mostly Sunni city of Mosul, 400 km (250 miles) north of Baghdad, as the next target for Iraq's armed forces.\n\nBut Finance Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters the army would need the help of ethnic Kurdish Peshmerga fighters to retake the largest city under the control of Islamic State, home to rival religious and ethnic groups.\n\n\"Mosul needs good planning, preparations, commitment from all the key players,\" Zebari, a Kurd, said on Monday in Baghdad.\n\n\"Peshmerga is a major force; you cannot do Mosul without Peshmerga,\" he said, referring to the armed forces of Iraqi Kurdistan, an autonomous northern region close to Mosul.\n\n(Writing by Stephen Coates; Editing by Mark Bendeich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S.-led forces have killed 10 Islamic State leaders in air strike", "title": "Islamic State suffers double blow as Ramadi falls, leaders killed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/29/Islamic-State-suffers-double-blow-Ramadi-falls-leaders-killed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-ramadi_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/29/Islamic-State-suffers-double-blow-Ramadi-falls-leaders-killed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-ramadi_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S.-led forces have killed 10 Islamic State leaders in air strike", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The militias have served as a bulwark against Islamic State but drawn objections from Washington.\nRamadi was the only city to have fallen under Islamic State control since Abadi took office in September 2014.\nCoalition spokesman Warren said casualties to Iraqi forces during the battle for Ramadi were in the low double digits.\nHe and Iraqi officials put Islamic State casualties in the hundreds.\nBAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S.-led forces have killed 10 Islamic State leaders in air strikes, including individuals linked to the Paris attacks, a U.S. spokesman said, dealing a double blow to the militant group after Iraqi forces ousted it from the city of Ramadi."}
