So while it was first announced as, \u201cOne way to end violence against women? Stop taking lovers and get married,\u201d with the subhead, \u201cThe data show that #yesallwomen would be safer hitched to their baby daddies,\u201d the piece soon became, \u201cOne way to end violence against women? Married dads,\u201d with the subhead, \u201cThe data show that #yesallwomen would be safer with fewer boyfriends around their kids.\u201d\n\nShockingly, people stayed pretty mad about the whole thing. Because the headline was hardly the only problem. Rather than present the social science with the heavy dose of qualifiers, context and skepticism deployed by the the actual researchers who produced it and the experts who have grappled with it, writers W. Bradford Wilcox and Robin Fretwell Wilson \u2014 a professor of psychology and a professor of law, respectively \u2014 decided to go all in and argue that women should stop being so promiscuous and/or selective about whom they legally bind themselves to if they don\u2019t want to be raped or violently abused. Because apparently marriage contracts and diamond rings have the power to turn violent men into not violent men?\n\nNow both of these writers are going to call this a misrepresentation of their argument. They will probably say that they are just presenting social science and data as it stands and not trying to turn it into a behavioral proscription, despite the fact that the piece is exactly that.\n\nAnd here are the reasons why these excuses will be bullshit.\n\nThe piece leaves out everything that actually makes the presence of a husband or father in the home a sometimes positive indicator when it comes to physical and sexual abuse. Here is one of the experts Wilcox and Fretwell Wilson referenced in a passing link \u2014 without actually going into any detail about \u2014 on what\u2019s actually more important than the mere presence of fathers and husbands in the home:\n\nDavid Finkelhor, a professor at the University of New Hampshire and director of its Crimes against Children research center, said that how a father relates to his family matters more than his mere presence in reducing sexual abuse. \u201cI do think the quality of the parental relationship is the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an open, secure and communicative relationship with at least one parent is important.\u201d\n\nAnd here are Jenny Murphy-Shifflet and Scott Berkowitz \u2014 two other experts on sexual abuse linked to but not quoted \u2014 on the same:\n\nMurphy-Shifflet said fathers can be role models for their children. \u201cModel good, healthy relationships with their partners,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s important that children grow up in homes where they see adults being respectful.\u201d Berkowitz said how fathers relate to their children can play a vital role in reducing and preventing sexual abuse. \u201cA kid who has a good relationship with their parents is, hopefully, more likely to let their parent know if someone is mistreating them,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some geniuses have found the way to turn violent men away from violence: Marriage contracts and diamond rings!", "title": "Washington Post\u2019s domestic violence mess: Horrendous column needs more than a headline change", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Some geniuses have found the way to turn violent men away from violence: Marriage contracts and diamond rings!", "title": "Washington Post\u2019s domestic violence mess: Horrendous column needs more than a headline change", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/11/washington_posts_domestic_violence_mess_horrendous_column_needs_more_than_a_headline_change/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/11/washington_post_hires_conservative_blogger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some geniuses have found the way to turn violent men away from violence: Marriage contracts and diamond rings!", "title": "Washington Post\u2019s domestic violence mess: Horrendous column needs more than a headline change", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/11/washington_post_hires_conservative_blogger.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #yesallwomen, Domestic abuse, Editor's Picks, Gender, Marriage, Media Criticism, Rape, Violence, Washington Post, women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb918\"", "article_summary": "So while it was first announced as, \u201cOne way to end violence against women?\nThe piece leaves out everything that actually makes the presence of a husband or father in the home a sometimes positive indicator when it comes to physical and sexual abuse.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s important that children grow up in homes where they see adults being respectful.\u201d Berkowitz said how fathers relate to their children can play a vital role in reducing and preventing sexual abuse.\n\u201cI do think the quality of the parental relationship is the most important thing,\u201d he said.\nStop taking lovers and get married,\u201d with the subhead, \u201cThe data show that #yesallwomen would be safer hitched to their baby daddies,\u201d the piece soon became, \u201cOne way to end violence against women?"}
