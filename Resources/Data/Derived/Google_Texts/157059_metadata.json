As the article describes, collecting is above all an act of love. Collecting for investment alone is a lot of work and it rarely pays well. It should be viewed as a hobby first and an investment second. Only when a potential financial benefit is combined with the \u201cpsychological return\u201d of holding collectibles does the expected payoff make sense.\n\nNoted economic researchers Elroy Dimson and Christophe Spaenjers published a paper on collecting that provides insight into long-term returns of some collectibles. Their paper, \u201cThe Investment Performance of Art and Other Collectibles,\u201d compared the returns of art, stamps and violins from 1900 through 2012. These collectibles have a lot of historical price data available because they have been trading at auction houses and through dealers for decades.\n\nThe study found that, on average, art, stamps, and violins have appreciated in value at an annual rate of 6.4% to 6.9% in nominal terms, and 2.4% to 2.8% adjusted for inflation. I found it interesting that the three categories of collectibles all returned close to the same real return, although they got there over different return paths. The average return of all three categories is higher than government bonds, bills and gold over the same period, and significantly lower than common stock returns.\n\nThe stated performance does not include transaction costs, storage, or insurance\u2013and it\u2019s important to recognize how these impact long-term returns in collectibles markets. Commissions alone can be very expensive. Auction houses charge a buyer\u2019s premium of 12%\u201325%, depending on the purchase price. Private dealers often mark up items by 100% and bargain from there. I have a little experience on these matters having dealt in antiques during my college years. I only bought items that I believed would sell for double my purchase price. Setting this high margin saved me a few times when I made an error on an item because I was able to recoup most of my capital when I discovered I had paid too much.\n\nDespite the costs to acquire and maintain collectibles, they provide a psychological benefit that financial assets cannot provide. Investors will forgo the higher financial returns from equities and other intangible assets for the pleasure of owning art, coins, and other rare or appealing objects. The emotional return of owning collectibles is quite substantial, according to Dimson and Spaenjers.\n\nI can relate to this idea. My home is decorated with clocks, glassware and artwork I purchased many years ago and decided not to sell. I enjoy looking at these items and telling stories about how I acquired them. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that many of them are also worth considerably more today than what I paid for them. That said, I\u2019m not counting on them to fund my retirement.\n\nRick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing.
