On what would typically be a normal Friday at North Bergen High School, junior David Vaiza was one of the roughly 50 percent of students who played hooky â€” not because he didn't want to go to class, but because he feared for his life.

"My parents told me not to take a chance with my life," said junior David Vaiza. "School's not more important than my life. My mom is still going to try to fight (being marked absent) because there's no point in really going to school if it's going threaten your life."

Vaiza and plenty of other students stayed away after a threat found on a desk Tuesday that read "gonna shoot up the school" on Friday, June 6 (yesterday). He noted that even though he felt "it probably wasn't going to happen," he wasn't going to take any chances.

The school district took the threat seriously, with the students that did show up being greeted by metal detectors and a beefed-up police presence. Additionally, students were not allowed to bring in backpacks and were required to clear out their lockers on Thursday.

"When I got to school (I was scared)," said freshman Abigail Lascano, "and I was a little paranoid, but there were a lot of cops so it was really safe."

Students who didn't attend school yesterday were marked as absent, a school official said.Several students said they felt safe throughout the day, but didn't feel the environment was conducive to learning.

"In class we didn't even learn anything because there was no point since there was no one in class," said sophomore Cassandra Hernandez.
