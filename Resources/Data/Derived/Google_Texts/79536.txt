WebMD is up 106 percent this year. Its CEO David Schlanger speaks about the company's transition to mobile, and shares his thoughts on Obamacare.

With a share price up 104 percent year to date and a new mobile app that saw 17 million downloads since its release two weeks ago, WebMD appears to have a healthy diagnosis ahead of it.

"We certainly provide a really comprehensive health and wellness experience, so it's not just really around disease and condition, but it's that plus healthy lifestyle, healthy living," CEO David Schlanger said on CNBC's "Fast Money." "We really view health as an everyday activity."

WebMD stock closed at $29.49 per share, down 0.24 percent.

Asked whether the trend toward mobile would eat into WebMD's revenues, Schlanger counted on healthy desktop web traffic. "We actually view mobile as an incremental opportunity for us," he said.

"We have ample page-view inventory on PC to satisfy our current revenue expectations," he said, adding that "very little mobile" revenues represented growth potential.

WebMD could be facing new competition in the online health space from Google, which announced the launch of Calico, "a new company that will focus on health and well-being, in particular the challenge of aging and associated diseases."

Schlanger said that he didn't see the new venture as a true competitor.
