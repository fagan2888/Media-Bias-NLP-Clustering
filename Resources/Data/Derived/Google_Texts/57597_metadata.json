By statute, a death gratuity is considered a gift.\"\n\nThat raises a question for the government watchdogs at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington: \"Why is the government throwing money at a multimillionaire?\"\n\nIn a post on CREW's website, Daniel Schuman says the situation is \"even more galling\" when you think about the choice it represents.\n\n\"Congress just voted to cut food stamps for poor children,\" Schuman says, referring to the nutrition bill passed in the House on Thursday. \"The self-serving attitude that the death gratuity embodies places members of Congress above the public they are elected to serve. The last place this giveaway belongs is in legislation intended to contain only the essential measures to keep the government open.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are many things House Republicans liked about the government continuing resolution.
