Advertisement\n\n\n\nOver the last year and a half, the number of patients seeking treatment for serious injuries or illnesses at Chico Immediate Care has noticeably increased.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had heart attacks, dropped lungs, gunshot wounds, seizures, meningitis,\u201d said Dr. Brad Smith, owner of the clinic for nearly 30 years, during a recent interview. And while he acknowledged that his clinic is designed for exactly that\u2014quickly addressing urgent health problems\u2014he said many of those patients would have benefited from preventative medicine, but simply didn\u2019t have access to it.\n\nAlso, those in dire need of attention are usually mixed in with others seeking treatment that falls distinctly within the realm of primary care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become ridiculous\u201450 percent of the people who come into our clinic are there for something they should go to a primary care doctor for,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have someone with a cut on his arm waiting to get sewn up behind three other people who are there to get their blood pressure medication refilled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the result of the primary care shortage.\u201d\n\nA lack of primary care practitioners is a national issue\u2014a study conducted by the Association of American Medical Colleges projected there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors by 2020, accounting for the millions of people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act\u2014and the trend is very much a problem here in Chico. About 20 years ago, there were about 30 private primary care physicians in Chico, Smith said. Since then, there has been natural attrition due to doctors dying, retiring, moving elsewhere, or transitioning to hospital-based care.\n\nThe problem is they haven\u2019t been replaced. By his latest count, there are about half as many primary care providers in town these days.\n\nAs a result, Chico Immediate Care has increasingly served as a safety net for those who can\u2019t find a regular doctor. Smith said it\u2019s common for patients at the clinic to say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a doctor. I\u2019ve called every practice within 30 miles, and not one of them can take me.\u201d\n\nAnd so Smith decided to take things into his own hands. Just last week he opened a new clinic in Chico\u2014Premiere Primary Care.\n\nThe shortage of primary care practitioners in the Chico area was a situation many in the local medical community saw coming, said Dr. Roy Bishop, CEO of Argyll Medical Group in Chico, which he founded in 2001.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any large, integrated health care systems that can put in the necessary capital to build clinics, recruit doctors and get decent contracts with insurers,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Bishop and Smith identified low insurance reimbursement rates as the biggest obstacle for attracting new primary care providers.\n\n\u201cWe need more primary care doctors in the community,\u201d Bishop said, \u201cbut the current business model is not going to bring them here.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Bishop\u2019s current contract with a private insurer reimburses him at 90 percent of Medicare\u2019s rate, which is already so low that many physicians won\u2019t accept it as payment. \u201cAnd that\u2019s after a huge fight,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was a solo practitioner, rather than part of Chico\u2019s biggest primary care group, they would try and pay me 60 or 70 percent [of the Medicare rate]. It\u2019s truly awful.\n\n\u201cMost young doctors want a salary and benefits and they don\u2019t want to take any business risks,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe old model, where doctors were self-employed, is dying simply because the reimbursements controlled by the government and insurers are so low it\u2019s no longer a viable business.\u201d\n\nSmith agreed, adding that there\u2019s little incentive for medical school graduates to open their own practices, given that entering a specialty field is often far more lucrative\u2014no small consideration given the massive student loan debts most med students accrue. Further, the logistical aspects of running a primary care office such as meeting federal and state mandates, tracking paperwork and managing an office can be daunting.\n\nBishop is doing his part. In an effort to address the issue, he and other area physicians have formed the California North State Independent Practice Association (IPA), which aims to bargain collectively with insurers for better rates. Successfully doing so might allow the IPA to attract more primary care physicians to Chico.\n\nIn a perfect world, providing primary care wouldn\u2019t be such a hard sell, Bishop said. After all, it can be a rewarding field.\n\n\u201cI enjoy the contact with patients and entire families, looking after them for many years and doing my best for them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes I feel like I spend half my time looking after patients and the other half fighting the system.\u201d\n\nPremiere Primary Care, which shares a building with Enloe Prompt Care off Bruce Road, is staffed by two physicians new to Chico. (Smith said he was able to recruit them through \u201cdumb luck\u201d more than anything.) Based on the number of appointments in the first week, he believes it will be operating at max capacity within two months\u2014despite not having advertised at all.\n\nFurther, Smith is already planning on opening two similar clinics, another in Chico and one in the Paradise area. He said he\u2019ll open the second Chico clinic as soon as he\u2019s able to staff it.\n\nIndeed, now that he\u2019s established an infrastructure\u2014including an electronic health record system on a cloud server that allows doctors at any of Smith\u2019s clinics to access patient files\u2014opening new clinics is purely a matter of recruiting primary care physicians. He knows as well as anyone that it won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\u201cBut I got very frustrated and tired of seeing nobody do anything about primary care in Chico,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit here and watch this train run off the end of the track, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s going.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Howard Hardee.
