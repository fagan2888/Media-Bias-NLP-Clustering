This individual, who will report directly to MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros, will develop and lead programs that will help the system find the root causes of patients\u2019 health risks and \u201cupstream our intervention to make the biggest impact,\u201d according to an email from Boutros.\n\n\n\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t MetroHealth\u2019s first foray in the population health arena.\n\n\n\nAs Medicaid eligibility expanded under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and before that, through an experimental waiver in Cuyahoga County \u2014 the health system has retooled itself to manage the health care of these challenging populations. Some of those efforts include the usual targeted outreach to high-risk patients. Other efforts include offering patients transportation and even legal assistance.\n\n\n\nThe health system has also taken over the local care coordination efforts for CareSource, a nonprofit Medicaid managed care plan, and launched a Medicare accountable care organization.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The senior vice president, who will report directly to MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros, will develop and lead programs that will help the health system find the root causes of patients' health risks.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "The senior vice president, who will report directly to MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros, will develop and lead programs that will help the health system find the root causes of patients' health risks.", "title": "MetroHealth to hire SVP of population health", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150801/NEWS/150739926/metrohealth-to-hire-svp-of-population-health", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-08-01T04:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T14:49:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/11"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6f2\"", "article_summary": "The phrase \u201cpopulation health\u201d might be clich\u00e9 to many working in health care today, but for The MetroHealth System, it\u2019s a way of doing business.\nSo much so, in fact, that the health system is hiring for the newly created position of senior vice president of population health.\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t MetroHealth\u2019s first foray in the population health arena.\nAs Medicaid eligibility expanded under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and before that, through an experimental waiver in Cuyahoga County \u2014 the health system has retooled itself to manage the health care of these challenging populations.\nThe health system has also taken over the local care coordination efforts for CareSource, a nonprofit Medicaid managed care plan, and launched a Medicare accountable care organization."}
