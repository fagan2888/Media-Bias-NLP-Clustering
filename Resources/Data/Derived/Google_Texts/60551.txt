CORINTH – Felix Hayes caught seven passes for 101 yards and a touchdown Friday in Baldwyn’s football playoff loss to East Webster.

Saturday, he flashed his growing basketball weaponry in a 56-48 win against Lexington, Tennessee, in the Lighthouse Classic.

Hayes, a 6-foot-3 junior forward, scored 15 points, made shots inside and out, crashed the boards and muscled away loose balls.

“It definitely got me in shape. I know that much. I haven’t done that much running in a long time,” Hayes said of the nip-and-tuck game.

Senior point guard Conner McKay scored 15 points. Coby Agnew added 14. Baldwyn (3-0) kept Lexington (0-3) off the board in the second half until midway through the third quarter. Tylan Johnson and Christian Linton scored nine each in the loss.

McKay hit 5-of-6 free throws in the fourth quarter. Agnew hit all eight of his attempts in the game.

Alcorn Central wins early

In an 8:30 a.m. start, Alcorn Central senior forward Blake McIntyre scored 21 points and was named Player of the Game in a 67-41 win over Jumpertown.

Jumpertown 6-foot-7 senior center Dalton Hanna led the Cardinals with 14 points.

Isom lifts Hickory Flat

Hickory Flat senior guard Randtail Isom showed a knack for leaping and scoring. Isom, who impresses with elevation on his jumper, scored 18 points in the Rebels’ 56-53 win over Kossuth.

Kennedy Dye had a late driving layup and a 3 that cut Hickory Flat’s 31-23 halftime lead to two, but had to attempt a tying 3-pointer from beyond halfcourt. Kossuth senior guard Rick Hodum scored a game-high 19.

Gwyn evens up Warriors

Corinth went 1-1 in the Lighthouse thanks to a 47-41 win over Christ Presbyterian, Tenn. Antares Gwyn, a 6-foot-2 2016 forward had 20 points and 14 rebounds.
