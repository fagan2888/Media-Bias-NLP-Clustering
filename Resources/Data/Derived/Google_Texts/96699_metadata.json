Green, this season and has a collection of keepsakes on hangers in his closet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got eight to 10 hanging up and eventually I\u2019m going to get them signed and put up in my basement in frames on the wall,\u201d Johnson said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when I first started doing it.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t expect the next time to be Monday night after Detroit (7-6) hosts the Baltimore Ravens (7-6) in a possibly pivotal matchup as both teams hope to close the month well enough to be in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, but I don\u2019t know any of those guys very well,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI usually know before the game if it\u2019s going to happen. I knew I was going to trade jerseys with A.J. because we train together in the offseason. Sometimes, I\u2019m just a fan of the guy and we\u2019ll switch jerseys.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fitting ritual for the Lions\u2018 most humble star player since Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders simply handed or tossed footballs to officials after scoring more than 100 times from 1989-98.\n\nJohnson has more of an aw-shucks personality than a look-and-listen-to-me persona that many players have and have had at his position.\n\nBrown said it was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to swap jerseys with Johnson last month. The Steelers standout has been looking up to Johnson since 2007 when he was a freshman at Central Michigan and the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL draft was starting to show glimpses of his potential.\n\n\u201cHaving the chance to play football in Michigan, you heard a lot about Megatron,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan ever since. Had a chance to go see him play once when I was in college. What a great opportunity to come out here and watch him work.\u201d\n\nWhen Johnson does his job for all to watch in the NFL\u2019s weekly showcase game, the defending Super Bowl champions and their fans may not like what they see.\n\nRavens rookie Matt Elam praised the 28-year-old Johnson on Wednesday, but also took what was taken as shots, calling him \u201cpretty old,\u201d and saying the plan was to \u201cmake him uncomfortable,\u201d by getting physical.\n\n\u201cSometimes you usually know the point where to keep your mouth shut,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s a rookie. He\u2019ll learn. Hopefully this Monday.\u201d\n\nThe last time an NFL player uttered anything remotely construed as criticism of him going into a game against Detroit was in October when Dallas receiver Dez Bryant said he could do anything Johnson could do.\n\nJohnson shrugged it off responded with his play. He had 14 receptions for 329 yards, the most by an NFL player in regulation, and a score to help the Lions win 31-30.\n\nBaltimore quarterback Joe Flacco said Elam\u2019s comments made him shake his head, wondering why the safety said what he did.\n\n\u201cYou just kind of look at him and say, `Dude. What are you thinking? It\u2019s Calvin Johnson, man,\u2019\u201d Flacco said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just funny that he put himself in a situation like that.\u201d\n\nJohnson might get the last laugh when Matthew Stafford throws a deep ball to Johnson in Elam\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cYeah, we got to test him out,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe two-time All-Pro has 1,351 yards receiving _ ranking second in the NFL, trailing Cleveland\u2019s Josh Gordon by 49 yards. He has caught 12 touchdown passes, behind only New Orleans tight end Jimmy Graham.\n\nJohnson broke one of Jerry Rice\u2019s single-season records last year with 1,964 yards receiving. He also tied the Hall of Famer\u2019s personal mark with an NFL-leading 122 receptions.\n\n\u201cHe transcends the position and is one of the greatest players of our time,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cHe is spectacular and he is a great person. I think he represents Detroit and the organization extremely well. I just think the world of him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/larrylage", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calvin Johnson gives friends in the NFL and other players he admires the shirt off his back _ literally.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Calvin Johnson gives friends in the NFL and other players he admires the shirt off his back _ literally.", "title": "Lions WR Calvin Johnson gives jerseys off his back", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/15/lions-wr-calvin-johnson-gives-jerseys-off-his-back/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/12/lions-johnsons-jerseys-footballjpeg-07549.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/12/lions-johnsons-jerseys-footballjpeg-07549.jpg", "description": "Calvin Johnson gives friends in the NFL and other players he admires the shirt off his back _ literally.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lions WR Calvin Johnson gives jerseys off his back"}, "Author": "LARRY LAGE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Calvin Johnson, NFL, Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11a7\"", "article_summary": "The Detroit Lions superstar has exchanged jerseys with fellow receivers, Pittsburgh\u2019s Antonio Brown and Cincinnati\u2019s A.J.\nDETROIT (AP) - Calvin Johnson gives friends in the NFL and other players he admires the shirt off his back _ literally.\nHe had 14 receptions for 329 yards, the most by an NFL player in regulation, and a score to help the Lions win 31-30.\nJohnson has more of an aw-shucks personality than a look-and-listen-to-me persona that many players have and have had at his position.\nBrown said it was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to swap jerseys with Johnson last month."}
