Lawmakers are taking unprecedented measures \u2014 the invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Corker-Menendez bill, and even a letter to Tehran to stop it. None of this would be necessary if the U.S. Senate had done its job instead of rubber-stamping John Kerry\u2019s nomination as secretary of state.\n\nIn January 2013, Mr. Kerry plainly warned Senate Foreign Relations Committee members \u2014 the same people now leading the charge against the Iran deal \u2014 that he intended to support Mr. Obama\u2019s end run around the Constitution because \u201cthey\u2019ve got to consider some other ways of getting things done.\u201d Sens. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican, Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, and John McCain, Arizona Republican, all heard Mr. Kerry\u2019s statement firsthand, ignored it and voted for him, offering effusive praise for their former Senate buddy. Now they are getting what they should have seen coming.\n\nToo bad the U.S. Senate abdicated its responsibility. It has final say on presidential appointments, but our senators would rather go along and get along than make sure nominees will follow the Constitution.\n\nHave the senators learned their lesson? This month, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on the nomination of Loretta Lynch as the next attorney general \u2014 the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official. During a Judiciary Committee hearing in January, Ms. Lynch indicated she thought Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions to rewrite immigration laws were \u201creasonable.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz calls her views \u201cdisqualifying\u201d and says the Senate has a choice: defend the rule of law or \u201cconfirm an attorney general who has candidly admitted she will impose no limits on the president whatsoever.\u201d Ensuring that top government officials are committed to the U.S. Constitution is a no-brainer.\n\nThat\u2019s what Sen. Jim Risch, Idaho Republican, tried to do at Mr. Kerry\u2019s confirmation hearing. The U.S. Constitution requires that treaties be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, something Mr. Obama foresees he cannot get. He calls the possible deal with Iran an \u201cagreement.\u201d Presidents have always made \u201cagreements\u201d without Senate approval, but none of the importance and duration of the Iran deal. \u201cTo allege that this doesn\u2019t have all of the marks of a treaty is an insult to everybody\u2019s intelligence,\u201d says Mr. McCain now. But at the hearing, he was mum about the point.\n\nOnly Mr. Risch pressed Mr. Kerry, insisting that calling it an agreement, not a treaty, amounted to an \u201cend run around the Constitution,\u201d that reflected a dangerous \u201cends justify the means\u201d mentality. With masterful obfuscation, Mr. Kerry said maybe things could get done in \u201cthe regular order\u201d \u2014 meaning constitutionally \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t guarantee it. \u201cIt would depend.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to Feb. 24, when Mr. Kerry returned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a budget hearing. When Mr. Menendez and Mr. Corker pressed him for information about the Iran negotiations, he stonewalled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into the details of where we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWorse, Mr. Kerry said there should be no \u201cformal approval process\u201d by Congress. \u201cThis is the president\u2019s prerogative.\u201d Mr. Kerry threw the Senators a few crumbs, conceding that though the president can suspend sanctions against Iran, permanently removing them would require a vote in Congress.\n\nA vote, but not the two-thirds majority of the Senate that the Constitution requires for treaty approval. That is why the Senate\u2019s effort at curbing the president \u2014 the Corker-Menendez bill \u2014 is a shameful retreat. The bill says Mr. Obama must submit a final Iran arms deal to Congress within 60 days for hearings and a vote, and bars the president from suspending sanctions against Iran in the meantime. This puts the burden on Congress to cobble together a veto-proof majority, instead of the president having to win over two-thirds of senators. That\u2019s not what the Founders intended.\n\nThe Senate failed to do its job during John Kerry\u2019s confirmation hearings, and now the nation faces the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. Senators treat these hearings as media opportunities and quibble over getting their 10 minutes on camera instead of asking tough questions. In fact, they request that answers be kept short so as not to infringe on their own time. It\u2019s hardly the deliberative body the Framers envisioned to provide \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on critical issues.\n\n\u2022 Betsy McCaughey is author of \u201cBeating Obamacare 2014\u201d (Regnery, 2014) and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is struggling to thwart President Obama's attempt to strike a nuclear deal with Iran on his own, in violation of the Constitution.
