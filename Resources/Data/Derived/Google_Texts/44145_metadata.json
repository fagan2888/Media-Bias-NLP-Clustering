But it also may have the longer term effect of extending legal fights for years.\n\nMany conservative groups have characterized President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of Congress.\n\nIndustry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure.\n\nBusinesses worry any unchecked expansion of rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. The court agreed to some extent.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said the \"EPA's rewriting of the statute was impermissible.\"\n\nBut the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end, since EPA can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases.\n\n\"EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,\" said Scalia.\n\nThe agency responded positively to the decision.\n\n\"Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal-fired plants. And the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry.\n\nObama earlier this year announced new rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted him to act.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing Obamacare reforms, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally married same-sex couples for federal purposes.\n\nThe high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nThe justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles.\n\nDefining \"air pollutant\" within the context of greenhouse gases and the ability of the EPA to exercise its regulatory authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- was the issue here.\n\n\"Today the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a stern rebuke to the President,\" said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. \"It is a resounding defeat for those, like the President, who would use unelected bureaucracies to override the will of the people.\"\n\nTexas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases were reviewed by the court.\n\nA coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years.\n\nThis is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term.\n\nThe justices earlier this year allowed the EPA to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, and requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions.\n\nMany business groups had hoped the conservative majority would limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases.", "pubdate": "2014-06-23T15:08:48Z", "author": "By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases.", "pubdate": "2014-06-23T15:08:48Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/23/justice/scotus-greenhouse-gases/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140602163924-coal-plant-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "justice", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140602163924-coal-plant-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/23/justice/scotus-greenhouse-gases/index.html"}, "keywords": "justice, Court slows EPA on emissions, but largely backs rules - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2014-06-23T18:34:50Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccb2\"", "article_summary": "Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years.\nAnd the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry.\nThe government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal-fired plants.\nIndustry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure.\nThe justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles."}
