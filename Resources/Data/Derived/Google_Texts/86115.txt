Reason-Rupe has a new survey and report out on millennials—find the report here.

Millennials’ enthusiasm for President Obama has waned since he captured 60 percent of their vote in the 2012 presidential election. Still, a majority—52 percent—says they approve of his job performance, while 48 percent disapprove. Intensity is not in the president’s favor, with nearly twice as many strongly disapproving (21%) as strongly approving (13%).

While it’s not surprising that three-fourths of Democrats approve and three-fourths of Republicans disapprove of President Obama, politically independent millennials disapprove of President Obama 53 to 46 percent. A majority (56%) of Caucasian millennials disapprove, but majorities of African-American (69%), Asian (59%), and Latino (56%) millennials approve of the president’s job performance.

Looking at Congress, millennials are equally as favorable to Democrats as the President (53%), but over 59% of them disapprove of Congressional Republicans. This contrast helps frame one of the report’s larger themes—that part of what explains millennials’ affinity to contemporary liberalism is their distrust of the current GOP.
