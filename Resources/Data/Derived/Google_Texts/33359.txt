Emilie Lamb, 39, is a middle-class woman who suffers from Lupus, a chronic illness. She voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, hoping Obamacare would benefit her. Tuesday night, she’ll watch the State of the Union as the special guest of Rep. Marsha Blackburn.

She is now working a second job to cover a calculated $6,000 increase in out-of-pocket health care costs per year, according to a new ad by the conservative Americans for Prosperity.

She was forced to purchase a more expensive plan after her old policy with CoverTN was canceled. The federal government had denied CoverTN’s request for a waiver to grandfather her plan into Obamacare three times.

Even with a small federal subsidy, her premiums increased from $57 to $373 per month.

“Instead of helping me, Obamacare has made my life almost impossible,” she says. “I am very disappointed in Barack Obama as a president. He made promises he didn’t keep, and that’s disheartening.”

Watch Emilie tell her story:
