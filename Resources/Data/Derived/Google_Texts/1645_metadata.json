Individual plans with higher deductibles and lower premiums will be popular.\n\nMeanwhile, similar market incentives are at work at the provider level.\n\n\u201cThe central force shaping the change in our healthcare delivery system is clearly emerging: The system will be value-based and providers will be expected to deliver cost-effective, high-quality outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Michael Karpf, executive vice president of UK Healthcare. \u201cTo transition to this value-based system, most experts agree that the system must move from the current fee-for-service reimbursement model to another approach that shifts risk to providers.\u201d\n\nHospitals, clinics and others that achieve better health outcomes will be paid better. Medicare has announced it will stop paying for care given patients readmitted to a facility within 30 days for the same problem \u2013 facilities will eat the cost of unsuccessful treatment.\n\nFinancial models are changing.\n\n\u201cWe are changing our financial model in Kentucky to compensate providers for quality outcomes versus paying for each medical service that\u2019s provided,\u201d said Jeff Bringardner, Kentucky president for Humana, a $40 billion health and wellness company based in Louisville. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a positive response from doctors and hospitals because it mirrors their shift into accountable care.\u201d\n\nHumana and Norton for the past three years have been conducting one of four national pilot programs seeking to develop best practices for accountable care organizations.\n\nSeeking clarity amid Obamacare confusion\n\nWith the Oct. 1 deadline to begin implementing some of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s major provisions, many in the Kentucky business community are still wondering what the impact on their operations will be. Political opponents of the Affordable Care Act continue to strongly oppose it and call for its repeal, even though the U.S. Supreme Court upheld its general legality last year. The Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives has held at least 40 votes to overturn Obamacare.\n\nIn July, the Obama administration delayed by one year the mandate set to come into effect in October that employers must report whether they meet the 50 full-time employee (FTE) threshold that requires them to offer healthcare plans to workers \u2013 and show that they do, indeed, offer health insurance plans that is strong enough and within ACA cost guidelines.\n\nGiven this environment, The Lane Report decided to ask a selection of Kentucky healthcare sector leaders for their views on what will happen over the next six to 12 months.\n\nNo one expects a repeal of the ACA, although the enforcement practicalities of some provisions as currently structured have been questioned \u2013 e.g., making the IRS the policeman who must enforce mandatory insurance coverage by collecting tax penalties \u201cis suspect,\u201d said John Hackbarth, chief financial officer for Owensboro Health.\n\n\u201cThe IRS already has a poor track record on enforcing unpaid taxes,\u201d Hackbarth said. \u201cAdd the non-covered penalty to the mix and therein lies another element of poor government enforcement with higher government administrative costs and little to no increased revenue to offset the cost of the program.\u201d\n\nRegarding healthcare reform, he said, Owensboro Health customers continue to ask, \u201cIt is really law?\u201d along with \u201cWhat does it mean to me?\u201d\n\nKentucky healthcare leaders may not agree with all the provisions of the federal law, but they strongly back the need for significant healthcare reform.\n\n\u201cThe financing system for American healthcare is fundamentally dysfunctional. It has to change,\u201d said Norton Healthcare CEO Stephen Williams. \u201cAm I an advocate of everything that\u2019s in the Affordable Care Act? I assure you I am not. But the absolute necessity for financial change is there, and most anybody in healthcare the last 20 to 30 years would subscribe to that notion.\u201d\n\nUK Healthcare\u2019s Karpf agrees.\n\nBigger systems trend will continue\n\n\u201cThe healthcare system in the United States must change because of unsustainable costs and limited access to care,\u201d Karpf said.\n\nU.S. healthcare does offer the best services, Williams said, \u201cbut the system doesn\u2019t work well. It\u2019s too expensive. There are access issues. Folks are going to hospital emergency rooms to get primary care. We all know intuitively it\u2019s inefficient, so there\u2019s great frustration on many levels about the system. Fundamentally we do have the best \u2013 we set the standard for quality \u2013 but we have a lot of things that need to be fixed.\u201d\n\nOne key reform goal is shifting the financial model from fee-for-service to fee-for-outcomes \u2013 healthier patients and populations will generate the most revenue rather than increasing the volume of tests and procedures conducted and medicines prescribed.\n\n\u201cHospitals will respond in different ways,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the federal debate over budget deficits have accelerated the change process. Healthcare providers must understand their strategic goals and identify the necessary resources to achieve them.\u201d\n\nOver the next 12 months, Karpf predicted that healthcare providers \u201cof all types will continue to formalize existing and new relationships with both providers and payors to forge virtual or real networks\u201d whose goal is better outcomes.\n\nUK Healthcare for several years has been partnering with other providers, including Louisville-based Norton Healthcare and entities in nearby states to grow a regional network. It seeks to provide care efficiently close to home when possible or refer more serious cases to larger facilities that can develop into specialty-procedure centers of excellence.\n\nKarpf has explained the approach repeatedly the past few years as UK Healthcare built a new $800 million medical center that opened last year. To develop expertise in complex lifesaving services such as major organ transplantation, providers have to draw patients from a geographic footprint with a population large enough to generate those cases \u2013 and if Kentucky does not have centers of excellence facilities, its residents must leave to receive care.\n\n\u201cHowever, there must be an appreciation that these relationships are challenging to establish and manage, and will evolve over time,\u201d Karpf said. UK Healthcare has spent 10 years \u201crevamping its organizational and operational model and developing a single corporate support group to serve the hospital, College of Medicine, the faculty practice plans and ambulatory services. UK developed a common vision and strategy by coordinating four simultaneous planning processes \u2013 financial, facilities, strategic and academic. This structure is critical to facing the changing landscape of healthcare.\u201d\n\nLouisville-based Baptist Health includes seven acute-care facilities from Paducah to Corbin and manages a large Elizabethtown hospital. Within the past year it added the former Trover system in Madisonville and consolidated its branding.\n\n\u201cThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will drive hospitals to expand the care networks, including physician practice acquisition,\u201d Baptist CEO Stephen Hanson said. \u201cThere will be a continuation of mergers and consolidations to control costs and improve operational efficiencies.\u201d\n\nKentuckyOne Health (KOH) came into existence in early 2012 as another large regional network when Louisville-based Jewish Hospital and St. Mary\u2019s HealthCare merged with Lexington-based St. Joseph\u2019s Health System, a six-hospital subsidiary of Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). University of Louisville Hospital and the James Graham Brown Cancer Center were able to join later, and Denver-based CHI is investing $320 million into the deal, much of it going to improve operations at UofL, which provides the most indigent care in the state.\n\nSystems adding access points for new patients\n\n\u201cOver time, we expect to see more and more people with access to health insurance, which is very positive,\u201d said Ruth Brinkley, CEO of Kentucky-One Health. \u201cHow people access that care is the next question.\u201d\n\nKOH is increasing the number of access points for care in the commonwealth, Brinkley said. Areas of the state face doctors shortages, she said, explaining that this is one reason KOH has partnered with UofL, which has a medical school.\n\n\u201cKentuckyOne Health is developing a strategy to offer more primary care providers in the state, as well as increasing opportunities with telemedicine programs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be able to treat patients as close to home and at the most cost-effective and high-quality setting that is possible.\n\nPutting enough access points in place will help achieve the population health goals that are a concern for KOH, which has a focus on the underserved and vulnerable.\n\n\u201cCollectively, KentuckyOne Health facilities are providing more charity care than anyone else in the state, and University of Louisville Hospital continues to provide more charity care than all the other Louisville hospitals combined,\u201d Brinkley said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018gap\u2019 between the uninsured and the insured is a concern,\u201d she said. \u201cThe assumption is that everyone will have insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but it has been estimated that even after full implementation, 10 percent of Kentucky residents will still be without insurance. We will still need to serve those patients.\u201d\n\nLexington Clinic, a multispecialty medical group that sees more than 2,000 Central Kentucky patients a day, expects many of the currently uninsured to be covered as of Jan. 1 and to begin coming to medical offices rather than emergency rooms, said Dr. Andrew Henderson, CEO.\n\n\u201cWhile this injection of newly insured patients will exacerbate the issue of primary care access, it also offers the opportunity for patients to receive preventive and ongoing maintenance of healthcare issues rather than crisis management,\u201d Henderson said.\n\n\u201cAs insurance coverage expands, we will continue to see increasing premiums, deductibles and co-pays, which place a heavier financial burden on our patients. This added financial responsibility will force many patients to be selective of services, and will determine whether or not patients make, or keep, their appointments. Healthcare organizations need to be sensitive to this increased burden and continue refining best practices to ensure they provide responsible care that is of value to the patient.\u201d\n\nThey also need to be aware, he said, of patient worries that reform will force them to change doctors or dictate services and reassure patients that their care is top priority and their needs will be met regardless of what changes take place.\n\n\u201cIt is essential that healthcare leaders surround themselves with knowledgeable, forward-thinking people to help lead their organizations through the ongoing changes,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWe must be open to new ideas and opportunities as the world of healthcare continues to evolve.\u201d\n\nMarket forces urge taking risk to cut costs\n\nHealthcare is going to become more competitive, according to Ramsey at Bluegrass Family Health, because the shift to individual insurance from group plans means many patients will be more cost-conscious. There are increasing avenues by which patients can compare costs (see article on page 30).\n\nThe health insurance industry will be more competitive, too, as a result.\n\n\u201cInstead of being sold B2B (business to business), it\u2019s going to be B2C \u2013 business to consumer,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s a new dynamic.\u201d\n\nHe compared the coming change to the travel industry.\n\n\u201cHow many people use a travel agent today?\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cAlmost none. They do it themselves. It\u2019s consumer driven.\n\nBy the end of 2014, Ramsey expects 55 to 60 percent of Kentucky\u2019s population will have individually obtained insurance. Medicaid, which is expanding in the state, will cover 27 to 28 percent of the population, and Medicare another 20 percent.\n\nThe rise of the individual insurance product presents marketplace opportunities, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see different risk-takers in the marketplace. You will see employers and employees who will be bigger risk-takers,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThey will choose higher deductibles because of the cost of premiums.\u201d\n\nWhile the individual insurance product is growing, large employers\u2019 group plans will continue to play a large role for many Kentuckians, with millions of dollars at stake.\n\nHigher deductibles guarantee lower premium costs \u2013 and avoid the new health insurance premium tax \u2013 but risks higher out-of-pocket costs for services if they are needed. To manage the need for services, employers will add onsite clinics and medical managers, Ramsey said, and providers will sell these services, perhaps on an hourly basis.\n\nOpportunity: Managing employee health\n\nIn the past year, Baptist Health has created a new division called Baptist Health Employer Solutions to fill this need. Humana has introduced Humana Vitality.\n\n\u201cAt Humana, we\u2019ve tried to tackle the trend from a different perspective by encouraging people to get healthy and stay healthy,\u201d Bringardner said. \u201cOne of the ways we\u2019ve done this is through integrated care \u2026 centering on individual members and their primary care physicians. We\u2019re engaging members through a variety of platforms, such as our wellness rewards program \u2013 HumanaVitality. HumanaVitality and other integrated care programs include sophisticated data analytics that allow members \u2013 and their supporting medical teams \u2013 to address gaps in care and develop a plan for a long, healthy life.\n\n\u201cWe are incentivizing providers to manage their patients\u2019 health. That\u2019s because putting the individual at the center of the health system yields better medical results and improved affordability for everyone,\u201d Bringardner explained.\n\nHumana and Baptist Health are themselves large employers that bear significant costs for their workers\u2019 healthcare.\n\n\u201cAs a large employer in Kentucky, focused on the health and well-being of our own associates, Baptist Health recognized the challenges that the rising direct and indirect costs of unhealthy employees pose to the bottom line,\u201d said Traci Elliott, executive director of Employer Solutions. \u201cIn response, Baptist Health created a division called Baptist Health Employer Solutions, focused on delivering products and services to employers that improve quality and overall costs. The services and products center around narrow networks, wellness and population management, on-site clinics and medical home models. The demand from employers is increasing and our business will continue to grow across the state as we bring value and proven solutions to the table.\u201d\n\nMark Green is editorial director of The Lane Report.
