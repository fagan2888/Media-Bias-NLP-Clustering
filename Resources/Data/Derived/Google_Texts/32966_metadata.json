While it\u2019s true this \u201cpackage\u201d discusses how zero tolerance policies are bad policy, a lot this guidance is all about making sure school discipline isn\u2019t being disproportionately applied based on race. From the Department of Education\u2019s \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter:\n\nAlthough African-American students represent 15% of students in the CRDC, they make up 35% of students suspended once, 44% of those suspended more than once, and 36% of students expelled. Further, over 50% of students who were involved in school-related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Hispanic or African-American. The Departments recognize that disparities in student discipline rates in a school or district may be caused by a range of factors. However, research suggests that the substantial racial disparities of the kind reflected in the CRDC data are not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color. \u2026 Indeed, the Department\u2019s investigations \u2026have revealed racial discrimination in the administration of student discipline. For example, in our investigations we have found cases where African-American students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race than similarly situated white students.\n\nSo a significant amount of this documentation is about making sure school discipline decisions are not discriminatory. There are even flow charts for those educational professionals who need a more visual guide to understanding that giving a minority student harsher discipline than a white student for the same infraction is racist. You can read the letter here (pdf).\n\nPart of the reason for the focus on race (besides the statistical evidence) is because it\u2019s an area where the federal government does have the authority to intervene in public school operations. These guides are essentially a diplomatic way of saying, \u201cDo this, or face federal sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Education does also delve into the issue of overdiscipline as well, noting, \u201cOne study found that 95 percent of out-of-school suspensions were for nonviolent, minor disruptions such as tardiness or disrespect.\u201d Secretary of Education Arne Duncan goes on to note that students tossed out of school \u201cmay be unsupervised during daytime hours and cannot benefit from great teaching, positive peer interactions, and adult mentorship offered in class and in school.\u201d Well, he seems to be making a lot of assumptions about the kind of good teaching and mentorship a student may get from adults in a school that\u2019s quick to suspend kids for minor infractions.\n\nThe Department of Education\u2019s \u201cguiding principles\u201d for school discipline may be read here (pdf). Sorry to be negative, but perhaps put any hopes to rest that much will come from the Department\u2019s recommendations. This document could have been written by anybody with half a brain, other than the parts that are written entirely in educational bureaucratic jargon, possibly by a computer program (\u201cEngage in deliberate efforts to create positive school climates\u201d and \u201cPromote social and emotional learning to complement academic skills and encourage positive behavior\u201d). There probably is very little in this guide that school officials won\u2019t already claim that they\u2019re doing. It is good that they\u2019re discouraging schools from referring non-criminal disciplinary issues to law enforcement, something Los Angeles schools are now starting to turn away from. But ultimately, this looks like a bunch of guidelines that will lead to the formation of school committees (funded with federal grants, perhaps?) that put more rules into place that will be pointed to the next time an official does something stupid like suspend a kid for chewing his Pop Tart into the shape of a gun. Can anybody provide an example of American jurisprudence where the institution of additional rules resulted in less callously managed punishment? Why should we expect any different from schools?\n\nWhat really needs to happen for significant change is that school districts need to be worried about the consequences to them for poorly managed school discipline. That\u2019s why the Department of Justice\u2019s emphasis on racial discrimination and the possibility of sanctions or lawsuits is so prominent \u2013 the DOJ has a stick to beat school districts with should they not comply. As for the \u201czero tolerance\u201d nonsense, giving parents more choice and power on where their children attend school can serve as a useful pressure point to encourage school administrators to put an end to their petty tyrannies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Solving bad bureaucratic school behavior with more of the same", "title": "Obama Administration Targets School \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 Policies \u2013 Mostly Because They\u2019re Racist, Not Because They\u2019re Stupid and Terrible", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/09/obama-administration-targets-school-zero", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13892840961003.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yesterday the Departments of\nJustice and Education released what they are referring to as a\n\u201cschool\ndiscipline guidance package\u201d that the media is \ndescribing as an effort to clamp down on overzealous school\n\u201czero", "title": "Obama Administration Targets School \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 Policies \u2013 Mostly Because They\u2019re Racist, Not Because They\u2019re Stupid and Terrible", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13892840961003.jpg", "creator": "@sshackford", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Nanny State", "published_time": "2014-01-09T16:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda530\"", "article_summary": "What really needs to happen for significant change is that school districts need to be worried about the consequences to them for poorly managed school discipline.\nSo a significant amount of this documentation is about making sure school discipline decisions are not discriminatory.\nYesterday the Departments of Justice and Education released what they are referring to as a \u201cschool discipline guidance package\u201d that the media is describing as an effort to clamp down on overzealous school \u201czero tolerance\u201d punishment policies.\nThe Departments recognize that disparities in student discipline rates in a school or district may be caused by a range of factors.\nWhile it\u2019s true this \u201cpackage\u201d discusses how zero tolerance policies are bad policy, a lot this guidance is all about making sure school discipline isn\u2019t being disproportionately applied based on race."}
