It\u2019s a mistake to see China\u2019s construction projects in the Spratly Islands as much out of the ordinary: They aren\u2019t. It\u2019s another mistake to miss the larger implications of the tension that has arisen over the past couple of weeks.\n\nThere are a lot of dimensions to this latest round of trans-Pacific friction. It\u2019s about\n\nterritorial sovereignty, undersea resources, secure sea-lanes, and the projection of Chinese power. How these are ordered up depends on who\u2019s doing the talking.\n\nRelated: If US Interferes in China\u2019s Land Grab, \u2018War Is Inevitable\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s southerly neighbors, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, grow more nervous with every bucket of sand and coral the Chinese shape into solid ground. Washington is none too pleased, also.\n\nAt the moment, the responses to China\u2019s notably assertive stance on the status of the long-disputed Spratlys are two:\n\nNeighboring nations, supported by assorted scholars, attorneys, and diplomats, raise legal arguments: China\u2019s claims to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, they say, have questionable grounding in international law, if any. The artificial islands may not be illegal, but they entitle China to nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington makes a familiar security-and-stability argument, insisting China puts both at risk. At a security conference in Singapore 10 days ago, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter demanded \u201can immediate and lasting halt\u201d to the reef- reclamation project. It\u2019s hard to see what, if anything, lies behind the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s toughening language, but, as the Russians say, words are actions.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Chief Urges End to Island Building in South China Sea\n\nChina\u2019s islands-from-nothing create challenges that must be answered. One, the Spratlys\u2019 status under the U.N.\u2019s Law of the Sea and other relevant legal codes has been left unresolved for decades. Beijing has no case whatsoever that unilateral action in this circumstance is constructive.\n\nTwo, nobody from Beijing to Washington thinks it\u2019s a good idea to destabilize a region that is (a) in flux and fragilely balanced, and (b) essential to its trade-oriented economies, China\u2019s most of all. Again, China\u2019s determination to take a deservedly influential place in the Pacific isn\u2019t served so long as what it does induces anxiety elsewhere in Asia.\n\nTwo questions, simply posed but not at all simple, have to be answered now.\n\nFirst, what are China\u2019s intentions as it emerges as a regional and global power? For too long we\u2019ve trotted out leftover Cold War prejudgments no longer of any use.\n\nSecond, what are Washington\u2019s purposes? This column has argued that when it looks across the Pacific it lives in the past and can\u2019t see straight.\n\nRelated: US Hopes China Island Building Will Spur Asian Response\n\nIt was a Filipino fisherman trawling off the Spratlys who first spotted \u201cthis huge Chinese ship sucking sand and rocks from one end of the ocean and blasting it to the other using a tube.\u201d That was in October 2013. Since then, China has created about 2,000 acres of new land atop reefs above or below sea level depending on the tides.\n\nWe\u2019re taking this activity too seriously. The antidotes are history and precedent.\n\nFive nations\u2014the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei\u2014lay claim to the Spratlys, and several have erected primitive fortifications or shelter on land reclaimed from the sea. The argument that China is different because it is creating new land instead of building out from shorelines is important only to maritime lawyers.\n\nGoing further back, Japan took an atoll 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, called it an island, and claimed sovereignty in 1931. The U.S. re-recognized Okinotori Island as Japanese in 1968. Its land consists of three concrete blocks protruding slightly above the waves, on the basis of which Tokyo claims a surrounding EEZ\u2014an exclusive economic zone\u2014of 154,000 square miles. Beijing doesn\u2019t even recognize Okinotori as an island, to say nothing of the EEZ.\n\nGet clear of the legal thickets and the core problem is clearer. The rest of East Asia is nervous about China\u2019s emergence as a power, but this reflects its size and old alignments, not any evidence of ill intent. Of the latter, there is none.\n\nRelated: US-China Clash of Disputed South China Sea\n\nIn response to Secretary Carter\u2019s demand in Singapore, Adm. Sun Jianguo, a senior military official, asserted that Beijing was primarily concerned with fulfilling its \u201cinternational responsibilities and obligations\u201d\u2014meaning, in this case, assuming a role in maintaining maritime security. In my read, taking up such duties reflects China\u2019s genuine desire to earn recognition as a responsible power. Anyone who knows the Chinese understands the importance they attach to this in numerous contexts.\n\nThat conference in Singapore was especially revealing of Washington\u2019s reading of China\u2019s intentions. Carter read straight from the Cold War playbook, in my view, and this habit is getting more than unproductive: It\u2019s this we must take more seriously now: It\u2019s starting to suggest potential dangers.\n\nCiting an airstrip already under construction on newly built acreage, Carter\u2019s perspective was old-school strategic: Beijing\u2019s intent is military control of the seas. \u201cIt is unclear how far China will go,\u201d the defense secretary said, plainly playing to the region\u2019s uncertainties.\n\nRelated: China Blames US for Stoking Tension in South China Sea\n\nChinese officials and analysts see old habits and discrimination in these remarks, and they have a case. Let\u2019s not forget: Current tensions over a situation many years in the making began when a U.S. jet entered the Spratly\u2019s airspace as a challenge to China\u2019s sovereignty claim.\n\n\u201cWe will remain the principal security power in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come,\u201d Carter said when he stopped at Pearl Harbor en route to Singapore. The worrisome aspect of this statement is simply put: It is wholly unrealistic.\n\nWashington\u2019s conundrum across the Pacific, setting aside many differences, is not unlike its current stance toward Russia: It can either accept a former adversary as a partner with common interests, as both Beijing and Moscow propose, or it can stand against both to no positive outcome.\n\nIn the Pacific case, true security lies in necessarily protracted negotiations to resolve the many conflicting claims to maritime sovereignty now besetting the region. This is to be taken more seriously. But Washington has done next to nothing to engender such diplomacy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are two useful ways to view the current dispute over", "title": "Behind the Tensions Over China\u2019s Artificial Islands", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Opinion/2015/06/08/Behind-Tensions-Over-China-s-Artificial-Islands", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05272015_Chinese_Navy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Opinion/2015/06/08/Behind-Tensions-Over-China-s-Artificial-Islands", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05272015_Chinese_Navy.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There are two useful ways to view the current dispute over", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc05b\"", "article_summary": "There are two useful ways to view the current dispute over the artificial islands China is building atop reefs in much-contested zones of the South China Sea.\nIt\u2019s a mistake to see China\u2019s construction projects in the Spratly Islands as much out of the ordinary: They aren\u2019t.\nLet\u2019s not forget: Current tensions over a situation many years in the making began when a U.S. jet entered the Spratly\u2019s airspace as a challenge to China\u2019s sovereignty claim.\nRelated: Pentagon Chief Urges End to Island Building in South China SeaChina\u2019s islands-from-nothing create challenges that must be answered.\nRelated: If US Interferes in China\u2019s Land Grab, \u2018War Is Inevitable\u2019China\u2019s southerly neighbors, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, grow more nervous with every bucket of sand and coral the Chinese shape into solid ground."}
