Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is in an unenviable spot. Few congressional Republicans are as vulnerable in 2016 as the far-right Wisconsinite; he hasn\u2019t developed much of a legislative record; and polls show him trailing former Sen. Russ Feingold (D) in next year\u2019s rematch.\n\nJohnson also referred during a recent radio interview to \u201c idiot inner-city kids ,\u201d though he later said he was being sarcastic.\n\nYesterday, however, American Bridge released a new video with a recent Ron Johnson quote that stood out as especially interesting.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s resonating about Donald Trump, I\u2019d like to think, some things is appealing about my candidacy here in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nObviously, the grammar and syntax are a mess, but the point seems clear enough: Johnson apparently sees himself in the Trump-esque mold.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a positive development \u2013 for the senator or his party.\n\nAt a certain level, perhaps this was inevitable. When one candidate rockets to the top of state and national Republican polling, it stands to reason that some GOP candidates, especially those facing tough re-election fights, would effectively tell voters, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just like that guy!\u201d\n\nFor Johnson, in particular, this must be especially tempting, since the far-right senator has a habit of making some pretty embarrassing comments. Why say, \u201cI\u2019m a clumsy, undisciplined politician,\u201d when you can say, \u201cI\u2019m appealing in the same way Donald Trump is\u201d?\n\nBut this is a risky strategy. Trump, a deeply unpopular national figure, is already dominating the Republican conversation in ridiculous ways, and he\u2019s even had some influence over the GOP\u2019s policy agenda.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Sen.
