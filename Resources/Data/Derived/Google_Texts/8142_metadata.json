Pete Sessions\u2019 strategy for becoming the next U.S. House majority whip involves touting his insider experience, while casting himself as an outsider.\n\nAs my colleague Sylvan Lane reported Monday, Sessions is pitching his stint as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee as proof that as whip, he could unify a fractured conference.\n\nIn 2010, when Sessions led the NRCC, Republicans netted a whopping 63 House seats.\n\nHe is now the chairman of the House Rules Committee, one of the most influential assignments in Congress.\n\nBut the Dallas Republican knows he can\u2019t win the whip race by touting his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which was largely built as an ally of outgoing Speaker John Boehner.\n\nBoehner was heavily criticized by tea party conservatives for, among other things, not killing the Affordable Care Act or defunding Planned Parenthood. Anyone perceived as a friend \u2014 or clone \u2014 of Boehner will have a tough time winning votes among the House\u2019s tea party faction.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s edition of Lone Star Politics on KXAS-TV (NBC5), Sessions said the Boehner-led House was moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI would be the trouble guy that comes in and fixes this and puts this back together. The American people cannot win if Republicans, the majority party, cannot get it together.\u201d\n\nBoehner announced his resignation Sept. 25. The new speaker will be elected Oct. 29. Afterward, that person will schedule the elections for the rest of the leadership, including majority whip.\n\nSessions is running against Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the current chief deputy whip, and Reps. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Dennis Ross of Florida. The winner will replace the current whip, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who is running for majority leader as Republican Kevin McCarthy looks to move up to speaker.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which candidate has the advantage among House Republicans dissatisfied with the current leadership. That could be why Sessions is now taking swipes at Boehner, his ally.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction. I believe we need another direction,\u201d Session said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be member-driven, and we\u2019ve got to decide if we\u2019re going to work together.\u201d\n\nSessions said he expects a close race for whip. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be down to the end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be decided by a matter of three or four votes.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC5 political reporter Julie Fine, Sessions summed up the race with an observation reminiscent of the late Yogi Berra:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not behind, but I have a lot of ground to cover,\u201d he said.\n\nNOTES\n\nFundraisers blossom on Texas-OU weekend\n\nTexas-OU weekend brings more than a renewal of the Red River football rivalry, more than huge crowds at the State Fair.\n\nIt\u2019s also a time for political fundraising, lots of it.\n\nBetween Thursday and Sunday there are more than 30 fundraisers for politicos throughout the state.\n\nWant to catch several events in one setting? Camp out Friday at the Warwick Melrose Hotel, where there will be at least 14 receptions for various elected officials.\n\nTo my critics: Show me the barbecue!\n\nTwo weeks ago, I noted that barbecue in Memphis and Kansas City was better than the tasty offerings found in Texas. That drew outrage from an assortment of readers and so-called aficionados, including my friend R.G. Ratcliffe, who writes for Texas Monthly.\n\n\u201cCredibility, my man, should not rest on a platter of meat unless you are arguing which Texas town has the best,\u201d Ratcliffe wrote on Facebook.\n\nDemocratic strategist Harold Cook replied: \u201cThis piece may make Gromer the best reporter I know who is dead to me.\u201d\n\nThen Ratcliffe chimed in: \u201cIt\u2019s a basic misunderstanding. There is Texas barbecue and then there is Memphis and KC style smoked meat, not barbecue.\u201d\n\nOK, R.G. Show me, don\u2019t tell me, the awful mistake I made. I\u2019m willing to meet you, Cook and anyone else to taste what you call the best barbecue in the land.\n\nAnd remember, a person cannot live by brisket alone.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Dallas Republican is touting his experience in the House leadership, but also casts himself as an outsider.", "og": {"description": "The Dallas Republican is touting his experience in the House leadership, but also casts himself as an outsider.", "title": "Pete Sessions turning inside-out in majority whip race", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20151005-pete-sessions-turning-inside-out-in-majority-whip-race.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20151005-pete-sessions.ece/BINARY/original/Pete+Sessions", "height": 683}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-06T04:32:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-06T04:19:03Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Pete Sessions turning inside-out in majority whip race\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20151005-pete-sessions-turning-inside-out-in-majority-whip-race.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20151005-pete-sessions.ece/BINARY/original/Pete+Sessions\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2468299\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-06T04:19:03Z\", \"section\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"author\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20151005-pete-sessions.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Pete+Sessions", "publishtime": "2015-10-06T04:19:03Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Rep.
