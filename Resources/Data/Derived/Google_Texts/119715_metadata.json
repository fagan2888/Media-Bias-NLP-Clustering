Clifford Case in the primary. He lost the general election to Democrat Bill Bradley and another attempt at the Republican Senate nomination in 1982.\n\nWith 99 percent of the vote counted, Bell had 41,274 votes to Pezzullo\u2019s 36,909. The race was called by The Associated Press just after 11 p.m.\n\nHowever, Pezzullo tonight said he would not concede.\n\n\"There are provisional, mail-in, and military ballots still to count in many counties,\" he said in a statement. \"As a veteran myself, I want those ballots counted, and based on the results in the few counties that have released those numbers, the election is still yet to be decided.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview before the race was called, Bell said the tight battle \"reminds me of the first primary I was in.\"\n\nBoth Bell and Pezzullo said they looked forward to taking on Booker in November.\n\n\"The Republican Party is a major party in New Jersey,\" Bell said. \"It won the last gubernatorial race by 22 percentage points. So anything can happen.\"\n\n\"Last year, (Booker) had all the advantages. He was a celebrity and he had tremendous fund-raising capabilities and he only (won by) 12 percent of the vote,\" said Pezzullo. \"This year he has to deal with the fact he has supported every failed program of the Obama administration and every failed Democratic program. The Republicans are coming off a massive win with their governor and they\u2019d like to take their country back.\"\n\nBut calling the Republican nominee an underdog would be an understatement.\n\nBooker has nearly $3 million in campaign cash on hand, while the latest reports available show Bell raising about $90,335 for his primary campaign, including a $30,000 loan from himself. Pezzullo took in barely more than $6,210.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me in advance that I would spend $90,000 on voter contact, I would have said for someone who\u2019s been absent for 30 years, that\u2019s not going to be enough,\u201d Bell said.\n\nNew Jerseyans haven\u2019t elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since Case in 1972 \u2014 the man Bell beat six years later.\n\nAnd Booker polls well.\n\n\"Unless Cory Booker has plans to strangle a man with his bare hands or something like that, (the Republcian candidate) doesn\u2019t have a chance,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nThere had been some talk among Republicans of fielding a tough challenge to Booker in November.\n\nIn last year\u2019s special election for the seat following the death of Democrat Frank Lautenberg, Booker beat Republican Steve Lonegan by a healthy margin, but not as wide as many thought it should have been given the state\u2019s Democratic tilt.\n\nBut over the winter, top tier potential Republican candidates like state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. (R-Union), Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) and state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) announced they wouldn\u2019t run. The party then turned to a not-well-known assemblyman who at least held elected office: Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerset). He also declined.\n\nSo instead, Republicans were left with four candidates who normally would be at the fringes of a GOP primary.\n\nMurray said while New Jerseyans sometimes elect Republican governors, the state\u2019s voters are far more hesitant to pick send a Republican for the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"There are a lot of moderate and independent voters that may be fiscally conservative but don\u2019t like the message that\u2019s come out of the Republican Party over the past couple of decades, the focus on social issues like abortion,\" Murray said. \"And New Jersey, just by the fact that we\u2019re so densely populated and diverse, kind of has a knee jerk reaction against social conservatism.\"\n\nBell, 70, moved to Virginia in 1983 and stayed there until this year, when he rented an apartment in Leonia. He most recently worked as director of policy at the conservative American Principles Project.\n\nBell said he ran to make sure the public hears about two issues: returning the dollar to the gold standard and do away with the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of charging no interest on federal government debt.\n\nThat message, Bell said, resonated with everyday voters more than political insiders.\n\n\"I think a lot of people who predicted I wouldn\u2019t win, which was virtually everybody, underestimated the difference between party activists \u2014 the type of people who are on the county committees \u2013 and the typical voters,\" Bell said. \"The typical voters were very open to the message I had in this race. I got a lot of resonance on it.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 5 things we learned from Tuesday's primary elections\n\n\u2022 NJ Republican primary to take on Booker is fight between little-knowns and unknowns\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Matt Friedman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2014-election-us-senate, 2014-elections, cory-booker, news", "title": "Jeff Bell to face Cory Booker after winning Republican U.S. Senate primary", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Jeff Bell tonight won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate for the second time", "title": "Jeff Bell to face Cory Booker after winning Republican U.S. Senate primary", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/jeff_bell_to_face_cory_booker_after_winning_republican_us_senate_primary.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/15073745-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Bell tonight won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate for the second time", "title": "Jeff Bell to face Cory Booker after winning Republican U.S. Senate primary", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/15073745-large.jpg", "creator": "@MattFriedmanSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, June 04, 2014,  4:13 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, June 03, 2014, 11:20 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Jeff Bell tonight won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate for the second time"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf96\"", "article_summary": "He lost the general election to Democrat Bill Bradley and another attempt at the Republican Senate nomination in 1982.\nRELATED COVERAGE\u2022 5 things we learned from Tuesday's primary elections\u2022 NJ Republican primary to take on Booker is fight between little-knowns and unknowns\u2022 More Politics\n\"The Republican Party is a major party in New Jersey,\" Bell said.\nTRENTON \u2014 Jeff Bell tonight won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate for the second time.\nNew Jerseyans haven\u2019t elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since Case in 1972 \u2014 the man Bell beat six years later."}
