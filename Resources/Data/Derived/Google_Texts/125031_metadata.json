The cycling event is held annually and attracts over 9,000 cyclists from across the Nation and worldwide, according to perimeterbicycling.com.\n\nKrause was contacted via Facebook by James Stout, who works with a non-profit organization called AYUDA (American Youth Understanding Diabetes Abroad) and is a professional cyclist with Type 1 Diabetes.\n\n\u201cI worked with a nonprofit and was well aware of the Type 2 Diabetes issue on the reservations and with the Native American people,\u201d said Stout, who has trained in Tucson and participated in four El Tour de Tucson.\n\nKrause said 25 percent of Pascua Yaqui tribal members have diabetes. \u201cThis community is suffering from diabetes, but they don\u2019t have to suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bikers were a mix of diabetics and nondiabetics. The Pascua Yaqui Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Program provided the bikes and riding gear for each participant (which they were allowed to keep).\n\n\u201cWhen someone finishes something like this they have bonded with the bikes and deserve to keep them,\u201d Krause said.\n\nA majority of the participants completed the 38 mile stretch. There were two participants who did not complete the tour because they witnessed a cyclist get struck by a car. According to the Arizona Daily Star, John S. Henderson, 59, was struck from behind and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\u201cThose two riders were a bit shaken up and it is unfortunate that they had to witness that,\u201d Krause said.\n\nDespite the unfortunate tragedy, there was positive energy among the participants.\n\nFor Lisa Grajeda (Pascua Yaqui) and her husband Serigio Grajeda this was the best experience they had ever had. Neither of them have diabetes, but it runs in both sides of their families.\n\n\u201cWe did the 38-mile stretch and this was our first time doing anything like this,\u201d said Lisa Grajeda, fitness supervisor for the Pascua Yaqui Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Program.\n\nPrior to the race, they went through training and even bought a bike cocoon so their 3-year-old son could partake in the training.\n\n\u201cThe last eight mile stretch was tough, it felt like someone had put chili in our muscles,\u201d Grajeda said. \u201cBut we kept each other motivated and we tried to focus on the beautiful views.\u201d\n\nGrajeda originally decided to ride for her parents. Her mother beat cancer this year and her father survived a heart attack. But she also did it to spend quality time with her husband. \u201cWe have to show our son a healthy lifestyle,\u201d she said.\n\nKrause, Stout and others welcomed all the riders at the finish line and took photos.\n\n\u201cI normally don\u2019t stick around after I finish a race, but I\u2019m glad I did, so I could see everyone finish,\u201d Stout said. \u201cRiders were smiling, people were crying, hugging their families-very emotional and a lot of joy.\u201d\n\nKrause plans to do it again next year.\n\n\u201cJust because you are diabetic doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be healthy and ride a bike,\u201d Krause said. \u201cYou can take control of your life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tour de Tucson Riders Biked for Better Life", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/24/el-tour-de-tucson-brings-bike-riders-pascua-yaqui-tribe-together-152858", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/el_tour_de_tuscon_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "El Tour de Tucson Brings Bike Riders From Pascua Yaqui Tribe Together"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-24T11:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/24/el-tour-de-tucson-brings-bike-riders-pascua-yaqui-tribe-together-152858", "dc": {"title": "El Tour de Tucson Brings Bike Riders From Pascua Yaqui Tribe Together"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "El Tour de Tucson Brings Bike Riders From Pascua Yaqui Tribe Together"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41c5\"", "article_summary": "For Lisa Grajeda (Pascua Yaqui) and her husband Serigio Grajeda this was the best experience they had ever had.\n\u201cWe tried to do it previously, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201dEl Tour de Tucson was presented by Casino Del Sol Resort, owned and operated by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe.\nThe Pascua Yaqui Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Program provided the bikes and riding gear for each participant (which they were allowed to keep).\nThirty Pascua Yaqui tribal members helped promote a healthy lifestyle and diabetes awareness late last month.\n\u201cThis was the first time we had successfully organized anything like this,\u201d said Apryl Krause, Manager of the Pascua Yaqui Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Program."}
