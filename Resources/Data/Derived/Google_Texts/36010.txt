Sunday evening may have belonged to Miss America pageant winner Betty Cantrell, but another recipient of the organization’s accolades was award-winning singer-actress Vanessa Williams. In 1983, the future “Ugly Betty” star became the first African-American to wear the Miss America crown, but was eventually forced to resign her title after nude photos of Williams were published in Penthouse magazine.

After performing the aptly titled song “Oh, How the Years Go By” (video above) during last night’s Miss America telecast, pageant judge Williams was joined onstage by the organization’s CEO Sam Haskell, who delivered an on-air apology to the once-tarnished beauty queen:

“You have lived your life in grace and dignity,” said Haskell, “and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984 when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today’s organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Ms. Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you will always be.”
