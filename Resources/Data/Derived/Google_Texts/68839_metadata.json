Accountable care organizations \u2014 designed to reward health care providers for keeping their patients healthy \u2014 seem like the logical answer to such a mission. But are accountable care organizations formed between private insurers and health care delivery systems actually being held accountable?\n\nAs of January, more than 600 ACOs existed across the public and private sectors \u2014 up by more than 200 since January 2013. In that time, provider groups, not-for-profit community groups, practice management companies and other organizations increasingly have sponsored ACOs \u2014 with providers leading the way.\n\nThe number of U.S. residents who are part of an ACO rose from about 13.6 million at the end of 2012 to about 18.2 million by January. Most patients in ACOs are \u201cattributed,\u201d or assigned, to the organization based on the primary care provider they use. In some cases, patients might not even be aware that they are part of an ACO.\n\nRather than eliminating fee-for-service, ACOs change the payment system by creating incentives for health care providers to offer more efficient treatment by rewarding them for meeting specific benchmarks, such as preventing hospital readmissions and appropriately managing patients\u2019 chronic diseases. Unlike HMOs, ACO patients are free to see outside providers at any time without paying exorbitant fees.\n\nPrivate ACOs on the Rise\n\nIn some regions of the U.S., large health care systems are working to buy private physician practices in an attempt to form ACOs. In addition, many large private insurers across the country \u2014 including Aetna, Anthem and Blue Shield in California \u2014 are jumping onto the ACO bandwagon. Insurers say they can ensure ACOs are successful by providing data tracking on patients, enabling better evaluations of the care provided.\n\nMeanwhile, some large multispecialty provider groups already had networked with local hospitals to form an ACO even before the health reform law came along. Kelly Devers, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said those groups now \u201care going to dust off the existing structures they had in place.\u201d\n\nFarzad Mostashari, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former National Coordinator for Health IT, told California Healthline that \u201cACO arrangements with commercial plans can be more flexible and customized to the organization\u2019s particular circumstances, assets and needs.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the Catch?\n\nThe increasing number of commercial ACOs might indicate that most industry players think accountable care is the way to go to increase care quality and reduce health care costs. However, while Medicare ACOs must meet quality measures outlined by CMS, organizations between private insurers and health systems are not held to the same standards.\n\nRobert Cimasi, CEO of Health Capital Consultants, in his book \u201cAccountable Care Organizations: Value Metrics and Capital Formation\u201d writes that \u201ccommercial ACOs could potentially have extreme variation of quality measures among individually agreed upon contracts.\u201d (But Cimasi also notes that some commercial ACOs could adopt voluntary standardized measures \u2014 such as those used to seek accreditation by the National Committee on Quality Assurance.)\n\nIn addition, Mostashari noted that such organizations also have greater \u201cvariability between different payment models\u201d and the \u201cdifficulty of managing different requirements for providers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, health economists say the care model could have one major pitfall: fewer independent providers. A larger market share for big health systems that have formed ACOs ultimately could lead to fewer choices for patients.\n\nAnother catch is that by reducing patients\u2019 use of health care services, providers\u2019 revenue decreases. Health care consultants also say that incentive payments for ACOs could fall short of start-up costs.\n\nAre Private ACOs Working?\n\nHarold Miller \u2014 president and CEO of the Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement and executive director of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform \u2014 said that health care consumers and payers still need to be sold on the end game. Both commercial and Medicare ACOs \u201cwill need to prove that the overall health care product they\u2019re creating does work better and costs less in order to encourage patients and payers to buy it,\u201d Miller said.\n\nPatient engagement will be key to ACOs\u2019 operations. In a commentary in JAMA Internal Medicine, Paul Ginsburg with the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy argues that while the ACA laid out how ACOs are paid and how they interact with patients, it \u201cessentially left beneficiaries out of the equation, not offering incentives to choose an ACOor to commit \u2014 even softly \u2014 to its health careproviders.\u201d He adds, \u201cThis absence may severely undermine the potential of this approach to improve care and control costs.\u201d\n\nCMS\u2019 Pioneer ACOs likely will begin seeing results \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 this year and that could be a big indicator of whether the ACO model is worth pursuing. David Muhlestein, director of research at Leavitt Partners, in a Health Affairs Blog post said the importance of the Pioneer ACOs\u2019 results \u201ccannot be understated.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with California Healthline, Ginsburg said that a lot of industry stakeholders also will be looking to Medicare\u2019s ACO model because it has not changed since it was introduced in 2011. However, he noted that \u201cany lack of success will be taken by many as an indication that the model needs to change rather than a conclusion that ACOs do not work.\u201d\n\nHowever, Muhlestein said, \u201cMany organizations that have considered pursuing accountable care contracts are eager to observe how their peer institutions perform.\u201d Therefore, private payers looking to enter into an ACO contract would get the most encouragement from other commercial ACOs finding success.\n\n\u201cConsistently positive results will help these organizations that are sitting on the sidelines to decide to move toward value-based payments,\u201d Muhlestein said, adding, \u201cOrganizations that are considering accountable care will be best helped by seeing success in similar organizations.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, according to Muhlestein, negative or ambiguous results \u201cwill not only discourage potential ACOs from forming, but will lead to existing ACOs abandoning their current value-based contracts.\u201d\n\nGinsburg added that measuring the success of any ACO is a challenge because the model is continuously changing and adapting. \u201cBy the time research is completed to assess the initial models, they will have been refined substantially, throwing into question the relevance of the evaluation work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future of ACOs\n\nGiven the challenges and potential pitfalls, the question is: Are ACOs worth the risk to their creators? Most experts agree that the ACO model in general is set to expand in coming years.\n\nGinsburg told California Healthline that he expects the trend of ACO growth \u201cto continue for some time, although it is possible that other types of contracts between payers and providers will replace them.\u201d\n\nMuhlestein said of ACOs: \u201cWith continued government support \u2026 and considerable growth in the number of organizations becoming ACOs, the prospect of ACOs becoming the dominant model in care delivery seems very real.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with AHRQ, Stephen Shortell, dean of UC-Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health, said, \u201cThe spread of ACOs across the country needs to be accelerated\u201d by \u201cencouraging widespread changes in payment by insurers\u201d and \u201cby encouraging more mature ACOs to share lessons learned with those still developing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mostashari said, \u201cWe have to take the long view, and be focused on iterating, evolving, and improving the concept, rather than seeking summary judgment,\u201d noting that \u201cit took the better part of a decade to understand the impact of Part D and Medicare Advantage.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s what other stories are making news on the road to reform.\n\nACA opponents spend big to oppose the health law: Lauren Fox writes in U.S. News & World Report\u2018s \u201cThe Ballot 2014\u201d that opponents of the ACA have spent a combined $418 million disparaging the law \u2014 nearly 15 times as much as supporters have spent on campaigns promoting it.\n\nOpen enrollment and congressional nominees: NPR\u2019s Renee Montagne and Scott Horsley discuss what effects \u2014 if any \u2014 results from the ACA\u2019s first open enrollment period will have on midterm elections being held in several states.\n\nSay goodbye to \u2018Obamacare?\u2019 President Obama says that opponents will stop using the ACA nickname once the law proves successful, Katie Zezima reports in the Washington Post\u2018s \u201cPost Politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountable care organizations formed by private insurers and health systems face different requirements and challenges than those regulated by CMS.
