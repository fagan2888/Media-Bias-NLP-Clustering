Hobby Lobby. For that case, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, allowing the company an exemption from the ACA mandate to offer health insurance coverage of certain kinds of contraception.\n\nThe ruling opened up the floodgates of a debate on whether businesses and insurers have the right to refuse coverage of medical contraceptive methods based on religious beliefs.\n\nBut religion doesn\u2019t always--or even usually--dictate women\u2019s views on contraception. In particular, a new study out of the University of Michigan and published last month in the international health journal Contraception finds a woman\u2019s religious faith rarely predicts her opinions on policies that impact reproductive health care.\n\nThe study, based on a survey of women of various faiths, found that the majority of Protestant and Catholic women polled -- 66% and 63%, respectively -- favored insurance coverage of contraceptives. This is a higher rate than even those women who did not identify as religious, of whom only 59% favored contraception coverage.\n\n\u201cThe study\u2019s results are in line with similar polling on Catholic voters,\u201d says Katie Breslin, the domestic associate for Catholics for Choice . \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Catholics follow their consciences when it comes to reproductive healthcare.\u201d\n\nOverall, 56% of the women surveyed supported mandated health coverage of contraceptives and less than a quarter (23%) believed employers should be exempt from the law due to religion.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "A new polls finds most Catholic and Protestant women want contraception covered by health insurance--and don\u2019t believe employers should be exempt from offering it based on religious reasons", "author": "Laura Kiesel", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A new polls finds most Catholic and Protestant women want contraception covered by health insurance--and don\u2019t believe employers should be exempt from offering it based on religious reasons", "title": "Most Christian Women Support Health Insurance Coverage of Contraception", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/most-christian-women-support-health-insurance-coverage-of-contraception", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/birthcontrol.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/birthcontrol.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "date": "2015-04-17T05:33Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "contraception, birth control, Hobby Lobby, Affordable Care Act, pregnancy, religion, the Catholic Church", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "the Catholic Church", "published_time": "2015-04-17T05:33Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1320112"}, "guid": 13113566, "twitter": {"description": "A new polls finds most Catholic and Protestant women want contraception covered by health insurance--and don\u2019t believe employers should be exempt from offering it based on religious reasons", "title": "Most Christian Women Support Health Insurance Coverage of Contraception", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/most-christian-women-support-health-insurance-coverage-of-contraception", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/birthcontrol.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/birthcontrol.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "contraception, birth control, Hobby Lobby, Affordable Care Act, pregnancy, religion, the Catholic Church"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8d4\"", "article_summary": "For that case, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, allowing the company an exemption from the ACA mandate to offer health insurance coverage of certain kinds of contraception.\nThis is a higher rate than even those women who did not identify as religious, of whom only 59% favored contraception coverage.\nThe study, based on a survey of women of various faiths, found that the majority of Protestant and Catholic women polled -- 66% and 63%, respectively -- favored insurance coverage of contraceptives.\nIn particular, a new study out of the University of Michigan and published last month in the international health journal Contraception finds a woman\u2019s religious faith rarely predicts her opinions on policies that impact reproductive health care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Catholics follow their consciences when it comes to reproductive healthcare.\u201dOverall, 56% of the women surveyed supported mandated health coverage of contraceptives and less than a quarter (23%) believed employers should be exempt from the law due to religion."}
