Cmdr. Modder has been accused of failing to show \u201ctolerance and respect\u201d in private counseling sessions regarding issues pertaining to faith marriage and sexuality \u2013 including homosexuality.\n\nOn March 16 the Navy rejected Modder\u2019s claim that he was being singled out because of his Christian faith.\n\n\u201cIn your case, I find that your ability to express your religious beliefs during pastoral counseling has not been restricted or substantially burdened, Commanding Officer J.R. Fahs wrote in a memorandum to Modder.\n\nFahs wrote that Modder was relieved of his duties because he failed to \u201cuphold the core capabilities of chaplains\u201d \u2013 specifically \u201cunder the core capability of \u2018care,\u2019 you have the duty to be sensitive to the religious, spiritual, moral, cultural and personal difference of those you serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour inability to comfort and counsel in a manner that was respectful of the counselee while maintaining dignity and professionalism\u2026led to you being relieved of your duties,\u201d he wrote.\n\nModder, who is endorsed by the Assemblies of God, had been reassigned from his chaplaincy responsibilities at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, S.C. pending the outcome of the military\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe highly decorated, 19-year military veteran previously served in the Marine Corps and was once the force chaplain of the Navy SEALs.\n\nAttorney Michael Berry is representing Chaplain Modder. Berry works for Liberty Institute, a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases. He said they categorically deny all of the military\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Navy is telling Chaplain Modder \u2013 you have to choose between disciplinary action or following your religious beliefs,\u201d Berry told me. \u201cBecause Chaplain Modder chose his religious beliefs, his commanding officer threatened him with career-ending punishment.\u201d\n\nThey plan on appealing the commander\u2019s decision.\n\nMeanwhile, the chaplain\u2019s plight has drawn support from across the nation \u2013 including high profile political figures like Mike Huckabee and religious leaders like Franklin Graham.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in American when military chaplains have to choose between being true to their faith and keeping their jobs,\u201d Graham wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nLTG (Ret.) Jerry Boykin, who now serves as executive vice president at the Family Research Council, said a chaplain isn\u2019t worth anything if he isn\u2019t allowed to minister and counsel according to his faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Navy has to decide whether it wants a chaplain corps or social workers only,\u201d Boykin told me. \u201cIf they want a chaplain corps then they have to be prepared for chaplains to be chaplains.\u201d\n\nMore than 60,000 Americans have signed an FRC petition calling on Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus to drop the charges against the chaplain.\n\nModder\u2019s troubles started shortly after a married gay officer was assigned to be his assistant. The young officer had been working for the chaplain for about a month when he began peppering him with questions about homosexuality. Not too long afterwards, the officer filed a five-page complaint \u2013 clearly upset about Modder\u2019s views on same-sex relationships and homosexuality.\n\n\u201cHis five-page letter of complaint was unconscionable,\u201d Modder told me. \u201cIt was insulting and devastating.\u201d\n\nAnd to many \u2013 it appears the chaplain may have been the target of a set-up by the young officer.\n\n\u201cThe first act of this brand new officer is to deliberately set up Chaplain Modder,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cDoes this give you comfort as an American who depends on the U.S. Navy for national security? To know that we have leaders who would do something like this?\u201d\n\nIt is puzzling why a gay officer would continuously seek the counsel of a chaplain who clearly held to the Bible\u2019s teachings on both homosexuality and marriage.\n\nIt would be like a vegetarian getting upset at a barbecue joint for not serving tofu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five months ago the Navy called him the best of the best.
