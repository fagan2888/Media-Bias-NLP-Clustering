REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n4256954\n\nDemocratic Senators\u2019 attempt to nullify the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Hobby Lobby and force religious employers to pay for every type of contraceptive coverage required by Obamacare failed to pass a cloture vote Wednesday.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Mark Udall, failed to pass a vote Wednesday afternoon, as expected. The Senate voted 56-43 against invoking cloture on the legislation.\n\nThe bill would have effectively annulled the Supreme Court ruling by making it impossible for employers to claim exemption from Obamacare\u2019s full contraceptive mandate through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nRepublican Senators Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Mark Kirk voted to advance the bill, but it still failed to attract the 60 votes needed to move forward.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby several weeks ago, deciding that Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate violates closely held companies\u2019 religious freedom under Congress\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners, who provide employees 16 of 20 types of birth control required by the Obamacare mandate, were religiously opposed to several types of emergency contraception.\n\nRepublicans decried Senate Democrats for attempting to force a bill that would curtail the religious freedom of religious employers.\n\n\u201cThe majority has put their finger to the political wind and all they want is a show vote,\u201d said Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. \u201cIt\u2019s the first freedom mentioned in the Bill of Rights \u2014 you\u2019d think everyone here would be on the side of upholding it.\u201d\n\nMajority Leader Harry Reid charged that Republicans are impeding women\u2019s access to health care.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow Congressional Republicans or five men on the Supreme Court to reverse measures that have improved women\u2019s access to affordable health care, including contraception,\u201d Reid said in a statement after the vote.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chuck Schumer also claimed after the failed vote that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that employers don\u2019t have to buy employees all types of contraception blocked health care for women.\n\nEven liberal commentators have hit Democrats for inaccurate statements about the Hobby Lobby ruling. The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker Glenn Kessler has dinged Hillary Clinton, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, and a host of other top Democrats for suggesting the Hobby Lobby ruling made certain types of contraception illegal.\n\nRepublican Senators are introducing their own rival legislation this week, which will simply affirm that employers are not allowed to block employees from obtaining legal, FDA-approved contraceptives.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Democratic Senators' attempt to nullify the Supreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby and force religious employers to pay for every type of contraceptive coverage", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic Senators' attempt to nullify the Supreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby and force religious employers to pay for every type of contraceptive coverage required by Obamacare failed to pass a c", "title": "Senate Dems Fail To Overturn Supreme Court Hobby Lobby Ruling", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/16/senate-dems-fail-to-overturn-supreme-court-hobby-lobby-ruling/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It's the first freedom mentioned in the Bill of Rights'", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/16/senate-dems-fail-to-overturn-supreme-court-hobby-lobby-ruling/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg"}, "title": "Senate Dems Fail To Overturn Supreme Court Hobby Lobby Ruling Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-16 15:26:02", "sailthru.title": "Senate Dems Fail To Overturn Supreme Court Hobby Lobby Ruling", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "chuck schumer,harry reid,obamacare,orrin hatch,supreme court", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "chuck-schumer,harry-reid,obamacare,supreme-court,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "Democratic Senators' attempt to nullify the Supreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby and force religious employers to pay for every type of contraceptive coverage required by Obamacare failed to pass a c", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd99a\"", "article_summary": "Even liberal commentators have hit Democrats for inaccurate statements about the Hobby Lobby ruling.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby several weeks ago, deciding that Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate violates closely held companies\u2019 religious freedom under Congress\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nRepublicans decried Senate Democrats for attempting to force a bill that would curtail the religious freedom of religious employers.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s fact checker Glenn Kessler has dinged Hillary Clinton, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, and a host of other top Democrats for suggesting the Hobby Lobby ruling made certain types of contraception illegal.\nThe bill would have effectively annulled the Supreme Court ruling by making it impossible for employers to claim exemption from Obamacare\u2019s full contraceptive mandate through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act."}
