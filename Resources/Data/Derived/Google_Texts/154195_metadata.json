A German psychiatrist (Rod Taylor) has the bright idea to kidnap an in-the-know American major (Garner), knock him out and, when he awakes, convince him the war has long since ended.\n\nAnd so a groggy Garner comes to in what appears to be an Allied hospital. The first thing he notices: His hair has gone a bit gray. Then he spots a newspaper dated 1950. He\u2019s understandably confused, but the shrink and a nurse (Saint) calmly explain that he\u2019s been in the hospital suffering from amnesia for six years. What\u2019s more, the lovely nurse is actually his wife!\n\nSo far so good. But the shrink has been warned by his Nazi bosses that he\u2019s got just 36 hours to make Garner reveal details of the D-Day invasion. That turns out to be long enough for Garner to discover the ruse, thanks to one damning detail the Nazis overlooked \u2013 and, naturally, for Garner and Saint to fall in love for real.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nI saw 36 Hours at age 10 the week it opened in 1965, when my dad took us to a show at Radio City Music Hall. This was back when the Music Hall put on lavish musical stage productions before each film, featuring a full orchestra, jugglers and production numbers choreographed by Peter Gennaro.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: While I vaguely remember some bits of the stage show, 36 Hours remains burned in my memory, even though I have not seen it in nearly 50 years. (It\u2019s been available only sporadically on DVD and video-on-demand).\n\nI\u2019ve read that the film medium can put viewers in a semi-dream state in a way that live performances simply cannot. Maybe that\u2019s why I remember James Garner and Eva Marie Saint in a desperate clinch so much clearer than I do the Rockettes high-kicking across the Great Stage.\n\nThere are probably good reasons why 36 Hours never appears on lists of great D-Day movies. But I see it\u2019s airing on Turner Classic Movies at 1 p.m. July 14.\n\nI might have to take that afternoon off.\n\nPhoto: Metro Goldwyn Mayer\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Seventy years ago, 150,000 Allied troops stormed ashore at Normandy.
