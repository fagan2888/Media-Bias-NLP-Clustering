And here I thought that the folks over at The National Review were the smartest of the wingnut lot. William F. Buckley, Jr., the intellectual racist, must be turning over in his grave.\n\nSarah Palin blaming the media and Obama for her daughter\u2019s potentially criminal behavior I can understand. Let\u2019s face it, she is not too bright. But this kind of rhetoric coming from a so called intellectual is surprising.\n\nI never heard of Jim Geraghty before, and after reading what he had to write for National Review I am glad I didn\u2019t.\n\nThis genius actually said that Barack Obama is to blame for the NFL\u2019s domestic violence problem.\n\n\u201cJim Geraghty, an editor at the conservative National Review wonders if it\u2019s possible that the recent scandals rocking the NFL might in some way be traced to President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cDoes our president just reflect a broad cultural trend in the behavior of leaders,\u201d Geraghty wrote Monday, \u201cor does he set the tone from the top?\u201d\n\nFrom there, Geraghty goes on to chronicle a number of national scandals, like the IRS\u2019s alleged targeting of conservative groups and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodel\u2018s botched response to a rash of misconduct within the league:\n\n\u2026 Goodell told CBS This Morning he never saw the second tape of Rice striking his wife before Monday. He said, \u201cwhen we make a decision we want to have all the information that\u2019s available. When we met with Ray Rice and his representatives it was ambiguous about what actually happened.\u201d Friday afternoon, he announced the league would be making a new effort in dealing with unacceptable player conduct . . . by forming a special committee. \u2026\n\nThe country feels deeply betrayed by its governing and economic elites. Enter Obama. He\u2019s elected. \u2026\n\nAnd you know what we got. Stimulus waste; State Department employees on paid leave over Benghazi; \u201cAt this point, what difference does it make?\u201d; the VA, where the secretary belatedly discovered an \u201cunacceptable lack of integrity within some of our veterans health facilities,\u201d Obamacare, where Kathleen Sebelius let the president go out and say things about the website she knew weren\u2019t true, and still kept her job for several months. The NSA.\n\nGeraghty concludes: \u201cThe message has been sent, far and wide: Accountability is for suckers.\u201d [Source]\n\nJust wow.\n\nLet\u2019s give conservatives a gold medal for the shark jumping event in the clueless Olympics.\n\nMy man even threw in a Benghazi reference for good measure. He made sure that there is enough red meat for all the hungry ODS sufferers out there.\n\nI can only hope that their coverage under Obamacare will help them pay for a cure.\n\n*Pic from debatepolitics.com\n\nhttp://field-negro.blogspot.com/", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "The Field Negro", "description": "This ODS (Obama derangement syndrome) is no joke.
