Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina is campaigning in eastern Iowa for the first time since her debate performance boosted her in the polls.

The businesswoman is on the campaign trail in Dubuque.

"I think one of the great challenges before us now, citizens, we must take our government back," said Fiorina.

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO spoke to a crowd of about 200 at the University of Dubuque -- a town hall meeting hosted by Dubuque County Republican Women.

"She is a candidate who does not hesitate to tell it like it is, and does not expect your vote just because she's a woman," said Becky Conlon, chair of the Dubuque County GOP Women.

She took questions from the audience and spoke about economic growth, saving small businesses, and repealing the affordable care act.

She also addressed House Speaker John Boehner announcing his resignation from Congress.

"Speaker Boehner is a good man, I think him for his service, but every leader has a season and now it is a season for a new leader."

She continued by saying leadership isn't about talk, it's about producing results.

Carly Fiorina's next campaign stops are Saturday in Iowa City, followed by Arlington. She'll be tailgating at the University of Iowa football game.
