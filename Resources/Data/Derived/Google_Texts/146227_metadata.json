It is increasingly attracting some of the biggest names in aviation, including Boeing Co. in South Carolina, Airbus in Alabama, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. in Georgia and GE Aviation in North Carolina.\n\nAerospace companies are taking a cue from the auto industry and moving their manufacturing operations to Southern states. The region\u2019s lower costs, generous state incentive packages and right-to-work laws that make it hard for unions to organize are motivating these companies to choose the South.\n\nFour Southern states are among the top 10 states in aerospace job growth between 2007 and 2012, with South Carolina far ahead of the others, thanks to Boeing. Aerospace jobs in South Carolina jumped by more than 600 percent over that time period, from 865 workers to 5,685 workers, said Amy Holloway, president of Avalanche Consulting of Texas, who analyzed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nRelated: Public-Private Partnerships Boost State Infrastructure\n\nNorth Carolina ranks second in aerospace job growth with a nearly 34 percent increase over the same period (see sidebar). Boeing selected North Charleston, S.C., in 2009 to make and assemble its 787 \u201cDreamliner\u201d aircraft, in large part because of the $900 million in tax breaks and other incentives the state offered over 30 years. California, Connecticut, Kansas, Texas, and Washington state still have 65 percent of the country\u2019s nearly 500,000 aerospace jobs. But of those states, only Washington state has seen an increase in aerospace jobs since 2001, Holloway said.\n\nThe other states have either remained relatively unchanged or lost employment. California, for example, has lost more than 8,000 aerospace jobs since 2002, including Lockheed Martin, which moved its corporate headquarters to Washington, D.C. Besides opening its plant in South Carolina, Boeing in 2012 announced it was closing its Wichita, Kansas, plant and moving that production to Oklahoma, Texas and Washington state, affecting more than 2,100 workers.\n\nJobs States Want\n\nU.S. manufacturing jobs in general were waning even before the recession, with employment shrinking by 22 percent between 2002 and 2012. The aerospace sector grew 7 percent over that same period. Even with the fiscal austerity in Washington, D.C., sales in the aerospace industry grew 41 percent from 2002 to 2012, driven largely by military and international sales, Holloway said.\n\nAnd the sector is expected to grow. Boeing projects a demand for 35,000 new planes by 2032. Airbus projects building more than 29,000 jets in the same period.\n\nStates are fighting to land these jobs. Boeing, the world\u2019s largest aerospace company, sparked a bidding frenzy among states last year when a workers\u2019 union in Washington state rejected the company\u2019s contract offer and the company started looking elsewhere to make its 777X jet. Missouri, for example, held an emergency special legislative session in December 2013 and approved a $150 million a year economic incentive package to lure Boeing there.\n\nWashington kept the project after the union decided to accept the offer after all, including freezing pensions and changing to a 401(k) plan. But the significant incentives being offered reflect the importance of these jobs to states. \u201cThese are crown jewel industries. States are not wrong to value them inordinately,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.\n\nJobs in aerospace are considered \u201cadvanced\u201d industries, meaning they are high in research and development, they employ and train a variety of well-paid workers and help foster regional and national economic prosperity. \u201cThe South has been turning itself upside down to create effective systems to attract these companies,\u201d Muro said.\n\nWorkforce Development Key\n\nThe auto industry\u2019s strong presence in the South has helped the region compete for aerospace jobs, in part because of the number of suppliers there that can provide goods to both sectors. The lower cost of living in some areas and a military presence whose technologies and expertise are aviation-focused also help attract aerospace companies.\n\nRelated: Airbus in America - Foothold (and Jobs) in Alabama\n\nHourly compensation rates in general averaged $27 in Southern states in 2013, compared to $30 nationally. In the aerospace industry, labor costs in Washington are among the highest in the country. The mean annual salary of an aerospace machinist in Everett, Wash., was $53,500, compared to $45,500 in Charleston, S.C., and $42,500 in Kinston, N.C., according to a 2009 consultant's report. The report also said that the \"frequency and high costs of work stoppages, fairly or unfairly, reflect negatively on Washington\" in attracting aerospace work.\n\nStates in the South and Midwest also had the least expensive areas to live in 2013. But a qualified workforce is one of the most important considerations of companies looking for plant locations.\n\nIn previous years, California, Kansas and Washington state all had educational institutions that provided aerospace companies with a stream of engineers and technicians with the know-how for such complex work, explained Sujit M. CanagaRetna, a fiscal policy manager at the Council of State Governments, who has studied the issue in a new report. These states still can offer the expertise, but other states are offering to provide specialized training, including those in the South.\n\nAs Stateline has reported, states have offered billions of dollars in tax breaks to lure companies, and many of these incentive packages have extensive worker training provisions.\n\n\u201cEntire workforce training costs are often borne by the state and local governments,\u201d CanagaRetna said. Southern states that underwrite aerospace industry training include:\n\nAlabama: The $158 million in incentives promised in 2012 for Airbus to locate its first American manufacturing facility in Mobile includes $52 million to build a 40,000-square-foot, on-site center where workers are trained at state expense.\n\nNorth Carolina: Of a nearly $250 million incentive package the state offered in 2008 for Spirit AeroSystems to locate in Kinston, $136 million is for workforce development. This includes a new Aerospace Manufacturing Readiness program at nearby Lenoir Community College.\n\nSouth Carolina: Besides the $900 million in tax breaks and other incentives the state is expected to provide Boeing, it also is spending $33 million for worker training. Several high schools near the Boeing facility now offer aerospace classes.\n\nGeorgia: The state agreed to provide nearly $30 million in incentives including job training to encourage Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. to expand its operations in Savannah.\n\nThe Union Question\n\nLow rates of unionization in the South and the many right-to-work laws there that make it harder for workers to organize have played a part in some companies\u2019 decisions.\n\nOf the nine states that had union membership ratesbelow 5 percent in 2013, seven were in the South. North Carolina had the lowest at 3 percent, followed by Arkansas (3.5 percent) and Mississippi and South Carolina (3.7 percent each).\n\nBoeing got into hot water with the federal government with its decision to move a 787 airplane production line from a union facility in Washington state to its nonunion facility in South Carolina.\n\nRelated: Did Lower Safety Standards Help Boeing 787 Take Off?\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board in 2011 charged that Boeing violated federal labor law because the company selected South Carolina to retaliate against previous strikes by the International Association of Machinists Union in Washington. Boeing refuted the charges, saying the decision to place the assembly line in North Charleston was based on several factors, including a favorable business environment and \u201csignificant financial incentives.\u201d\n\nThe union agreed to drop its objections in 2012 after it reached a deal with Boeing that a new 737 aircraft would be produced in Washington state.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is among several Republican governors who contend their states\u2019 lack of unions is a major selling point for companies considering moving or expanding, and that organized labor is not welcome. \u201cWe don\u2019t have unions in South Carolina because we don\u2019t need unions in South Carolina. \u2026My job is to keep kicking them out,\u201d she said earlier this year.\n\nGary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Massachusetts, said the lack of unions is \u201cone of many factors, but it\u2019s still an important factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Turn Chattanooga into Detroit\u201d was a rallying cry of opponents of organized labor in the recent union vote at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., a tactic some said was effective as workers rejected a unionization drive by the United Auto Workers union. Detroit is currently in bankruptcy proceedings, the largest municipality in U.S. history to enter Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\nThe AFL-CIO called the Chattanooga vote \u201ca minor setback, and not a permanent defeat.\u201d\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute , a conservation think tank, argues that since the recession ended in June 2009, more than two jobs have been created in right-to-work states for every one job created in states with unions.\n\nThe absence of unions is not the only factor appealing to companies. \u201cClearly labor costs matter,\u201d Brookings\u2019 Muro said, but so does access to supply chains, a skilled workforce and technology innovation.\n\nNew Jobs in the South\n\nOther aerospace firms that have recently expanded or relocated to the South:\n\nHonda Aircraft Co. expects by the end of 2015 to add more than 400 new jobs at its R&D facility in Greensboro, N.C., which currently employs more than 750.\n\nRolls-Royce created a new aircraft parts manufacturing facility in Crosspointe Centre, Va., in 2012, creating 140 jobs.\n\nDassault Falcon Jet Corp. announced in 2013 plans to expand its \u201ccompletion\u201d center in Little Rock, Ark., that could add 300 jobs to the estimated 1,800 workers there.\n\nEmbraer, the Brazilian aerospace conglomerate, broke ground in Melbourne, Fla., in 2012 for a new technology center to employ 200 engineers and added 50 manufacturing jobs last year with a new hanger manufacturing facility at Jacksonville Florida International Airport.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The South is home to auto giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Nissan Motor Co.", "title": "Aviation\u2019s Biggest Names, Bucking Unions, Fly South", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Aviation-s-Biggest-Names-Bucking-Unions-Fly-South", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04032014_Boeing_Airplane_Assembly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Aviation-s-Biggest-Names-Bucking-Unions-Fly-South", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04032014_Boeing_Airplane_Assembly.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The South is home to auto giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Nissan Motor Co.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t have unions in South Carolina because we don\u2019t need unions in South Carolina.\nNorth Carolina had the lowest at 3 percent, followed by Arkansas (3.5 percent) and Mississippi and South Carolina (3.7 percent each).\nJobs States WantU.S. manufacturing jobs in general were waning even before the recession, with employment shrinking by 22 percent between 2002 and 2012.\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Kansas, Texas, and Washington state still have 65 percent of the country\u2019s nearly 500,000 aerospace jobs.\nBut of those states, only Washington state has seen an increase in aerospace jobs since 2001, Holloway said."}
