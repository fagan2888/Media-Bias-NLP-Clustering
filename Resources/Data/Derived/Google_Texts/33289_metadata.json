Republicans want to undo that law, at least temporarily, while a bipartisan panel reviews the measure.\n\nRepublicans say the law is riddled with problems, such as conflicting residency deadlines between state and local races. Their main gripe, though, is same-day voting registration, which makes voting more convenient for people who forget to register but could also make it more difficult to determine who\u2019s eligible to vote in an election. Republicans point out that voters could go to any precinct in the state, declare an intent to move there and then cast a ballot in a local election.\n\n\u201cCitizens don\u2019t want their elections to be free-for-alls,\u201d said Rep. Libby Szabo, R-Arvada.\n\nThe state Libertarian Party joined Republicans Monday in their call to revisit the elections law. Party chairman Jeff Orrok unsuccessfully sued over the law\u2019s conflicting residency requirements last year.\n\nHowever, Democrats who control both chambers of the Legislature insist the elections law is sound. The conflicting residency requirements, they say, can be fixed with a bill that has already cleared the House and awaits consideration in the Senate.\n\nDemocratic sponsors insist the bill does nothing more than resolve residency requirement conflicts for local clerks. The bill is \u201cdesigned to ensure that special districts, like fire districts or school boards, have some certainty in the law of how they conduct their elections,\u201d said Jessie Ulibarri, D-Denver and a sponsor of the bill.\n\nTwo Republicans who originally signed on to the bill have withdrawn support, saying they can\u2019t be part of the measure because it leaves intact same-day registrations and other voting changes they oppose.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be part of a bill that says in many ways (the elections overhaul) was good policy,\u201d said Rep. Carole Murray, a Republican and former clerk of Douglas County.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nHouse Bill 1164: http://bit.ly/LIqfYV", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado GOP wants to nix same-day voter registration", "title": "Colorado GOP wants to nix same-day voter registration", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/03/colorado-gop-wants-to-nix-same-day-voter-registration/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T13:12:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-03T13:12:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8026\"", "article_summary": "Their main gripe, though, is same-day voting registration, which makes voting more convenient for people who forget to register but could also make it more difficult to determine who\u2019s eligible to vote in an election.\nThe Republican proposal includes a two-year \u201ctime out\u201d on the new law, which added same-day registration and a requirement that ballots go by mail to all registered voters.\nHowever, Democrats who control both chambers of the Legislature insist the elections law is sound.\nDENVER\u2014Colorado Republicans on Monday launched their bid to undo a new elections law that allows same-day registration, saying they\u2019re still not convinced the change isn\u2019t a recipe for possible voting fraud.\nRepublicans say the law is riddled with problems, such as conflicting residency deadlines between state and local races."}
