The former Secretary of State was the first out of the box on what became Obamacare. She is, in fact, Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grandmother, is what I like to tell people about her.

And Joel Pollack thought that that was, that was a way for Hillary to be distancing herself from Obamacare. Her husband out there presenting himself and the Clinton brand as pragmatic and opposed to some of the unpopular parts of the bill.\n\n\n\nHEWITT: But Jake Tapper, does that work? If we remember correctly, Ira Magaziner and Hillary cooked up an even more complicated, even less market-oriented disaster of an Obamacare bill back when it was Hillarycare. Can she possible distance herself from this fiasco?\n\n\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, first of all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure she would distance herself from your description of if then. But I mean, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting question. You go back and look at the \u00e2\u20ac\u212293-\u00e2\u20ac\u212294 debate, the Clinton bill was an employer mandate. And the Republicans, not all of them, but Bob Dole and the mainstream establishment Republicans were pushing the individual mandate. Now Obama has embraced the individual mandate after, and you might remember this during the Democratic primaries, Hillary was supporting it and Obama was against it. But now Obama has the individual mandate. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. And again, this is just Joel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory. I mean, Hillary Clinton hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said anything about Obamacare. And if I were her, I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the bill has had more time to play out and have the kinks worked out. And obviously, the coverage that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been experiencing since October 1st is not going to be the coverage that it has in perpetuity.\n\n\n\nHEWITT: So Jake, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got 40 seconds left. When she finally comes out and answers questions, the first questions are about Benghazi, and the second questions are about Obamacare/Hillarcare. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the third question? Is there a third question? Or does it all depend upon Benghazi and Obamacare?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I think her tenure at the State Department. And I think NSA wiretapping. I think she will now be tagged with the legacies, positive and negative, of not just her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration, but Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. And she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to have to reconcile herself to distancing herself and embracing parts of both and carving a new path.
