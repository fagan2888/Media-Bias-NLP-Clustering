But some police forces use the equipment as a form of crowd control, which has angered critics who say Americans shouldn\u2019t be treated like enemy combatants.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the military equipment police have been getting from the Pentagon:\n\nArmored tactical vehicles\n\nATVs provide cover for military troops who are taking heavy fire from enemy forces, and some are specially designed to protect soldiers from roadside bombs.\n\nMost police forces don\u2019t have to worry about roadside bombs, but may use these vehicles in shootouts with drug cartels and raids where they are attacked with assault weapons.\n\n\u201cGunfire can damage or destroy a squad car very easily,\u201d said Sam Paredes, executive director of the conservative Gun Owners of California. \u201cBut bullets don\u2019t even mar the paint on ATV\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRich Roberts, a spokesman for the International Union of Police Associations, said that \u201cin a riot, it doesn\u2019t take but a few men to actually roll a car, including a police cruiser, but they\u2019re not about to roll over an armored vehicle.\u201d\n\nBut in Ferguson, many people criticized the use of the vehicles, which they said sent a signal of intimidation and force to people who wanted to exercise their right to free speech.\n\nAR-15 rifles\n\nAR-15 rifles are military-grade assault weapons that are used to return enemy fire on the battlefield, particularly against opposing shooters who have barricaded themselves.\n\nPolice use these \u201cpatrol rifles\u201d to clear houses they are searching and in shootouts with heavily armed criminals.\n\nDeltoid armor\n\nDeltoid armor is worn by troops to protect them from enemy fire.\n\nLike a modern-day suit of armor, they are more durable than the typical bulletproof vests that police officers wear, because they are meant to withstand shots from assault weapons.\n\nNight vision goggles\n\nNight vision goggles are used by the special forces to raid enemy compounds in the dark of night, such as when the Navy SEALs killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nPolice can use them while raiding the homes of drug dealers and suspected terrorists, or in other dark environments where they can\u2019t see very well.\n\nLong-range acoustic devices\n\nLRADs are sonic weapons use by troops to discombobulate enemy forces with loud piercing noises.\n\nOn the battlefield, LRADs are used to repel would-be attackers who may be armed with assault rifles or rocket-propelled grenades. They have also been used effectively by ships at sea against on-coming pirates.\n\nPolice forces can use these non-lethal devices in a similar fashion as tear gas to disperse crowds during riots.\n\nGrenade or tear gas launchers\n\nOn the battle field, these launches can be used to fire grenades from great distances.\n\nFor police, they can be used to fire tear gas to disperse crowds at riots and as they prepare to raid buildings and homes where terrorists or criminals may be hiding out.\n\nTear gas was used on demonstrators in Ferguson.\n\nPolice argue the devices allow police to throw tear gas at the enemy from a distance, while they stay safely out of harm's way.\n\n\u201cRemember, if you can reach your target with a hand-thrown device, they can throw it back at you,\u201d Paredes said.\n\nKA-BAR style fighting knives\n\nThese knives are used by troops in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.\n\nPolice can use them for similar purposes, but they are also an \u201call-around handy tool\u201d that can be used to cut seat belts, shut off gas lines and for many other emergency situations, Paredes said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Here's a look at some of the military equipment police have been getting from the Pentagon.", "description": "Here's a look at some of the military equipment police have been getting from the Pentagon.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Here's a look at some of the military equipment police have been getting from the Pentagon.", "title": "Seven pieces of military equipment the Pentagon is giving to local police", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy-defense/215306-seven-pieces-of-military-equipment-the-pentagon-is-giving-to-local-police", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/1_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy-defense/215306-seven-pieces-of-military-equipment-the-pentagon-is-giving-to-local-police", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-17T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Technology, Law enforcement, Military equipment,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T10:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy-defense/215306-seven-pieces-of-military-equipment-the-pentagon-is-giving-to-local-police", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Here's a look at some of the military equipment police have been getting from the Pentagon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Seven pieces of military equipment the Pentagon is giving to local police"}, "dcterms.title": "Seven pieces of military equipment the Pentagon is giving to local police"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a88\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTSince the 1990s, the Pentagon has provided local police with more than $5 billion worth of military equipment it no longer needs, such as assault weapons, body armor and even tactical vehicles.\nGrenade or tear gas launchersOn the battle field, these launches can be used to fire grenades from great distances.\nPolice forces can use these non-lethal devices in a similar fashion as tear gas to disperse crowds during riots.\nLong-range acoustic devicesLRADs are sonic weapons use by troops to discombobulate enemy forces with loud piercing noises.\nPolice argue the devices allow police to throw tear gas at the enemy from a distance, while they stay safely out of harm's way."}
