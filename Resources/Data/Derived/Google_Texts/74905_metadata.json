What\u2019s more, a primary care doctor can help monitor conditions like high blood pressure that may not necessarily cause symptoms, but raise your risk of stroke and heart attack, said Fourre.\n\nAnd if you see a doctor over a period of years, that doctor is better equipped to detect abnormalities in things like thyroid nodules, moles and heart murmurs that could be warning signs of larger issues, said Intermed family doctor Allyson Howe, M.D., who is also a specialist in sports medicine. \u201cWhen I get to know someone over time, I can recognize changes in them.\u201d\n\nThat means you can manage your health issues before they become emergencies, and avoid the emergency room altogether.\n\nAnd when you do have a medical emergency, having a primary care doctor can help ensure that you get the highest-possible quality of care, Fourre added. Without one, it might take longer for the ER docs to take your medical history and track down records from the patchwork of providers you have seen in the past. As a result, expensive medical tests may have to be unnecessarily repeated, he said.\n\nAlso, having a doctor who knows you can reduce the stress you\u2019ll have when you do have an emergency.\n\n\u201cThe primary care doctor is going to be there before an emergent issue, so you\u2019re not going to be trying to navigate the insurance company website while you\u2019re also dealing with a health issue,\u201d said Emily Brostek, executive director for Maine Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a nonprofit health advocacy group.\n\nThat said, the process of finding a doctor can be daunting. These tips can make the process easier.\n\nTALK TO YOUR INSURER\n\nContact your insurer to find out which providers are in the network under your policy, says Brostek. Under most policies, you can see a doctor who is outside your network, but you will pay more out of pocket. And you may be less likely to go on a regular basis, if you know it\u2019s going to cost more, says Howe. If you\u2019re confused about your network, call your insurer. You can also contact the free helpline managed by Maine Consumers for Affordable Health Care at 1-800-965-7476.\n\nGET COVERAGE\n\nNot insured? Don\u2019t know if you qualify for Medicaid? Reach out to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which administers MaineCare, Maine\u2019s Medicare program. Call 855-797-4357 or go to www.maine.gov/dhhs.\n\nYou can also contact Consumers for Affordable Health Care for assistance enrolling in MaineCare, or finding programs to help with health care and prescription costs. Call the group\u2019s hotline or check out its guide to Maine health care at www.mainecahc.org.\n\nASK AROUND\n\nAsk people you trust for recommendations, such as friends and other doctors, Fourre suggests. If a friend raves about a doctor\u2019s good bedside manner, that\u2019s important information. \u201cHaving a doctor that listens and communicates well isn\u2019t just nice, it\u2019s critical to successful care,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a vast amount of errors around communication.\u201d\n\nRelated Read more from Healthy Maine Magazine\n\nLOOK FOR BOARD CERTIFICATION\n\nFind out if the doctor is board certified in his or her specialty. While certification is voluntary, \u201cboard certification requires stringent testing to make sure each physician meets the standards of the specialty,\u201d said Fourre.\n\nKNOW YOUR OPTIONS\n\nThere are a variety of primary care doctors to meet your needs. Family doctors provide care for children and adults. Pediatricians treat children, but not adults. Internists treat adults, but not children. Osteopathic physicians treat children and adults. (Osteopaths are doctors who have all the same training and qualifications as medical doctors, but take a holistic approach to treatment.)\n\nCONSIDER YOUR OWN PRIORITIES\n\nDo you want to see the same provider each time? A smaller practice might be the best fit. Pick a larger practice if it\u2019s more important to ensure that you have a large-enough team of doctors for you to get a same-day sick visit for your child. Convenience should be a priority, said Howe. \u201cIf you\u2019re driving 60 miles to see a doctor, you\u2019re less likely to come in and build that relationship.\u201d\n\nGO FOR AN INTERVIEW\n\nBefore you commit to a primary care doctor, set up an appointment to meet and find out if it\u2019s a good fit, said Angela Cole Westhoff, executive director Maine Osteopathic Association.\n\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME WITH THE DOCTOR\n\nWrite down your questions ahead of time, and give that list to the doctor at the outset of the appointment, so that you can be sure to address everything on it, suggested Howe. Be sure to bring along any medical records and test results you have, as well as any medications and supplements that you\u2019re taking. Before you go, make note of your medical history, any symptoms you might be having and any major stressors that might be affecting your health.\n\nTRUST YOUR GUT\n\nAbove all, \u201cpay attention to your own experience,\u201d said Fourre. Put a premium on communication, and a feeling that you have been heard, as it\u2019s imperative to the quality of care. Personal comfort level matters a lot, said Westhoff. \u201cIf you have something that\u2019s not clearing up or getting better, the patient needs to be comfortable saying that.\u201d Fit is one of the biggest issues, so take it seriously, said Lisa Letourneau, M.D., executive director of Maine Quality Counts, a nonprofit that advocates for patients. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be honest with your primary care provider about your needs, and how they can best support you in making decisions about your health,\u201d she said. If the fit doesn\u2019t feel right \u201cit\u2019s OK to be honest about that and find someone who better meets your needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Use these tips to make finding a primary care provider easier.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Use these tips to make finding a primary care provider easier.", "title": "You need a doctor, but finding one isn't always easy - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/819068_421065-20160129_markfourre_.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2016-03-18T09:10:55-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/18/need-a-doc-of-course-you-do/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Use these tips to make finding a primary care provider easier.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/819068_421065-20160129_markfourre_.jpg", "title": "You need a doctor, but finding one isn't always easy - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health", "tag": "Healthy Maine Magazine", "published_time": "2016-03-18T14:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T09:10:55-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You can also contact Consumers for Affordable Health Care for assistance enrolling in MaineCare, or finding programs to help with health care and prescription costs.\n\u2022 Maine Consumers for Affordable Health Care can help you find coverage, understand your coverage, enroll in Medicaid, and find help with health care and prescription costs.\nMore information THESE NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS have online databases that you can search to find primary care doctors near you who are board-certified in their specialties.\nCall the group\u2019s hotline or check out its guide to Maine health care at www.mainecahc.org.\nMaineafp.org \u2022 The Maine Osteopathic Association has a searchable database that allows you to find a doctor near you."}
