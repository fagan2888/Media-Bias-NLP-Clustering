They can\u2019t win on the issues, so they\u2019re trying to scare and confuse voters.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing that strategy play out right now in New Hampshire. Democrats are spreading myths that a recent Supreme Court decision protecting Americans\u2019 religious freedom threatens women\u2019s ability to access birth control.\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. And Granite Staters deserve to know the facts about what this decision really means.\n\nFirst and foremost, women will continue to be able to access the contraceptives of their choice. Although Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has tried to suggest otherwise, the Hobby Lobby decision does not give all employers free rein to \u201cdeny coverage for birth control.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was about making sure that the government cannot force some employers to pay for health insurance that violates their religious convictions.\n\nUnder Obamacare, businesses with more than 50 employees are required not just to provide health insurance that includes coverage for all standard birth control.\n\nThe family that owns Hobby Lobby was fine with paying for nearly all forms of Obamacare-mandated birth control. But because of their religious beliefs, they felt they could not pay for coverage that includes drugs like the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill.\n\nRegardless of where we fall on the political spectrum, most Americans respect the incredible diversity of religious views we have in our country and agree we need to preserve and protect them.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby case simply protects Americans who have started businesses, many of whom are also women, from being forced to choose between violating their religious beliefs or being fined by the federal government for failing to comply with a mandate that they believe is morally wrong. Or they can pay a fine to drop health care coverage for their employees altogether.\n\nThere is nothing about the Hobby Lobby case that prevents a woman from making her own private medical decisions, or denies her access to contraceptives. Regardless of where a woman works, she will continue to be able to access any of these drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Democrats, led by Sen. Shaheen, are twisting the facts of the Hobby Lobby case. But we all know what they\u2019re trying to do. They can\u2019t run on their record of support for Obamacare, which is a disaster and deeply unpopular here in New Hampshire and across the country. So Democrats are desperately trying to create a diversion, and they\u2019re going back to President Barack Obama\u2019s false \u201cwar on women\u201d campaign playbook.\n\nVoters in New Hampshire won\u2019t be fooled. It\u2019s plain as day that the Hobby Lobby ruling won\u2019t take away birth control or prevent women from making their own decisions about what contraceptives they choose to use.\n\nJayne Millerick, of Bow, is former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Democrats are facing stiff head winds as they head into this fall\u2019s elections.
