More than three-quarters, 77.5 percent, of C-level executives said they have \u201cresource utilization programs in place to better control the use of expensive supplies and purchased services,\u201d the survey found. This was most pronounced among large hospitals, 87.1 percent, and integrated delivery networks , 82 percent, according to the survey.\n\nSimilarly, 60.8 percent use clinical quality programs to help reduce patient length of stay, with smaller hospitals leading the way at 75 percent and IDNs at 72 percent.\n\nCompliance with ACA mandates remains a top driver of costs for most respondents, but it, too, is lessening in importance, down from a high of 36.2 percent of respondents in spring 2012 to 23.2 percent this fall, the survey said. Legislative mandate costs are cited less frequently by large and mid-sized hospitals, which instead report labor as their primary cost driver. Executives also downplay ACA compliance when compared to labor costs, with just 13.3 percent reporting the ACA as a primary cost driver, as opposed to the 27.6 percent who cite labor.\n\nIncreasing labor costs may be associated with higher salaries needed to attract scarce primary care doctors. According to the survey, a shortage of primary care physicians remains a concern for 68.3 percent of executives, with the shortage concentrated in the northeast and mid-Atlantic and the southeast regions.\n\nLarge hospitals reported the sharpest primary care shortage, at 77.4 percent and IDNs, at nearly 80 percent. Likewise, both anticipated labor would be their main cost driver.\n\nIn addition, an increasing number of hospitals are shifting their focus to the voluntary programs within the ACA. In particular, 26 percent of respondents cited new care delivery and payment models such as ACOs and bundling, which is up from 14.3 percent a year ago. In part, this focus is creating new cost centers in hospitals, including the management of chronic, high utilization patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals still face a difficult road ahead with implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but the financial burden of reduced reimbursements and readmission penalties may be lessening while other pressures like consolidation and new care delivery models increase, according to a quarterly survey from Premier Inc.
