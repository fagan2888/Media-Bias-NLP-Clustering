The next, I was writhing on the slope in pain \u2014 having wrenched my right leg in an awkward, slow-speed fall. In the blink of an eye, I went from a healthy and independent 52-year-old to a trauma victim in need of a lot of expert help from a lot of people.\n\nWhat happened next gave me an upclose and personal view of a health care system that I\u2019m more accustomed to writing about \u2014 and sometimes criticizing \u2014 from afar. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe experience showed me U.S. medicine at its capable, caring best \u2014 and left me more convinced than ever that pushing hard for universal health coverage was the right thing for President Obama and Congress to do.\n\nThe crackerjack response began when Gore Mountain\u2019s ski patrol showed up within a minute or two of my fall. A dozen or more people \u2014 a mix of paid pros, volunteers and trainees \u2014 checked my vital signs before lifting me onto a sled and sliding me carefully down the mountain to a first-aid station.\n\nThere, a second team moved me to a gurney, removed my ski boots, prodded my damaged leg, took down my insurance information \u2014 and brought in my skiing chums for a visit.\n\nNext came an ambulance ride, courtesy of the local Johnsburg emergency squad, during which a friendly nurse kept me company in back and nagged the driver to take it easy on the bumps.\n\nForty-five minutes later, they rolled me into the emergency room at Glens Falls Hospital, where an X-ray confirmed that I had fractured my hip. Soon, a surgeon was offering to bolt it back together with three stainless steel screws \u2014 and breaking the news that I would be on crutches for the next six to eight weeks. He did the procedure the next day, and it seems to have worked as promised.\n\nMeanwhile, a small army of nurses, aides, orderlies, patient representatives, care coordinators, physical therapists and occupational therapists gently peppered me with kind attention.\n\nNow I know that a single fractured hip isn\u2019t a perfect window into our endlessly complex, very expensive and deeply flawed, health care system. But every now and then, it\u2019s worth tuning out the sky-is-falling crowd and appreciating what we\u2019re doing right in the age of Obamacare.\n\nSigns of reform in action were everywhere. Virtually everyone who approached me asked for my name and birth date and scanned a bar code on my ID bracelet \u2014 precautionary measures to avoid dangerous medication errors and other treatment mixups. The surgeon marked my injured hip with a felt-tip pen, to make doubly sure that he operated on the correct limb. Meanwhile, the staff was constantly using rubber gloves and hand sanitizer to guard against infections that have become a major cause of preventable illness and death.\n\nEven before I went under the knife, a care coordinator was quizzing me about the home I would be returning to in temporarily disabled condition. How many steps to the backdoor? On what floor are the bedrooms and bathrooms?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of discharge planning hospitals should be doing \u2014 to avoid seeing their patients bounce back a few days after checking out.\n\nThey helped me order equipment for navigating the bathrooms and putting on my socks. They outfitted me with crutches and a walker and trained me in their safe use. They set me up with appointments for visiting nurses and physical therapists.\n\nVirtually every caregiver was impeccably kind and considerate \u2014 never failing to ask how I was feeling, and always urging me to let them know when I needed anything.\n\nAlso crucial to my long-term well-being was my employer-sponsored health coverage, which should pay the bulk of the considerable tab.\n\nMillions of uninsured Americans do not have that luxury. In an emergency, they would be entitled to the same topnotch care I got \u2014 but then face bills that would drain their savings or push them to bankruptcy.\n\nWorse, they might delay seeking care for slower-moving medical crises, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis or cancer \u2014 and drastically shorten their lives as a result.\n\nFor all its flaws, the Affordable Care Act is slowly working to end this national shame by giving all Americans access to affordable health coverage \u2014 which is the right thing to do.\n\nNo one should have to live outside the safety net that was there for me when I needed it. whammond@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Bill Hammond", "twitter": {"description": "Hammond: My plunge into
