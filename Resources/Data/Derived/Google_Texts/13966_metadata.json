That\u2019s where the goverment steals your money or property and never proves you broke any law, and you can\u2019t get your money or property back. It\u2019s called \u201crobbery\u201d by every other definition, and most Americans, both liberal and conservative, would say Lynch belongs in prison for this. Two, she continues to protect her pal Joe Hynes, Brooklyn\u2019s utterly disgraced former district attorney, who broke a zillion laws for 24 years to protect serious criminals and frame innocent men. He broke more laws than you can count, but he\u2019s also been dinner partners with Lynch, so she won\u2019t touch him. Again, most Americans would say she belongs in prison for this, too. She took our paycheck and refused to do the job she was paid for or defend the Bill of Rights. That\u2019s theft, too. But we know how totally crooked government is, so she\u2019ll have no troubles with the Republicans or the Democrats. Because they\u2019re all total crooks. Uchena Shorey\n\nFighting like a girl\n\nMetuchen, N.J.: The plant\u2019s question at Hillary Clinton\u2019s press conference, asking her if there would be this uproar about her emails if she were a man, sounds like the same operative from the 2008 New Hampshire primary who shouted out, \u201cIron my shirt.\u201d Hillary Clinton as victim. When all else fails, play the gender card. It\u2019s what passes for accomplishments and policies with Hillary Clinton. Ron Perri\n\nThe same old Hillary\n\nBrooklyn: My 2016 presidential election prediction is that even if Hillary beats this email scandal and wins the nomination, she\u2019ll still fall in defeat to . . . Hillary Clinton! Johnny T. Sollitto\n\nComputer joke\n\nBrooklyn: Congress to Hillary: \u201cThanks for your server. \u201dMichael Balton\n\nBeauty tip\n\nNew City, N.Y.: Dear Hillary: While I deeply admire you and hope you run for President and win, I feel you should spruce up your look a bit. Visit a L\u2019Occitane en Provence boutique and try the Divine line of products. It will help your skin look renewed and less wrinkled, and you\u2019ll be fit to look like a President. Just a thought. Christine Ierardi\n\nPantsuit paradox\n\nBronx: Does Hillary Clinton even own a skirt or dress? How unsightly can her legs possibly be? Jim Theobald\n\nLetter of infamy\n\nOceanside, Calif.: The 47 GOP senators need to apologize for sending an open letter to Iran\u2019s leaders \u2014 behind the backs of the negotiators and President Obama \u2014 which could have endangered the U.S., Israel and others. This was an obvious ploy, once again, to undermine the President and unravel an agreement that was close to being reached regarding nuclear weapons. It could also have interfered with Iran\u2019s current assistance, along with other Middle East forces, in destroying ISIS. Iran\u2019s foreign minister stated that the letter was a \u201cpropaganda ploy.\u201d If it had been Democrat senators who did this, the GOP and Fox News would be yelling, \u201cTreason!\u201d Sharlene White\n\nBroadcast standards\n\nFranklin Square, L.I.: In his column of March 1, \u201cTruth Be Told . . .,\u201d TV Editor Don Kaplan states, \u201cBrian Williams has a higher standard to meet than Bill O\u2019Reilly\u201d because O\u2019Reilly \u201cis nothing more than an opinionated talk-show host.\u201d However, on every broadcast of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s evening program, the slogan \u201cThe spin stops here\u201d is mentioned. As long as O\u2019Reilly continues to use that slogan, and we are led to believe he will not condone any \u201cspin\u201d on stories, he must be held as accountable to the truth as Williams. Marilyn Miller\n\nBroadcast standards II\n\nFlushing: There should be a dress code for the people on TV. Men should wear suits and ties and the women should put away the sleeveless dresses until the winter is over. Dress for the season. Evelyn Zorovich\n\nGet rid of this word\n\nHollis: It really annoys me to hear the N-word being used by anyone, especially from individuals of my race, such as African-Americans and African-Caribbeans, and, of course, individuals from other ethnic groups. I\u2019m troubled by the rising use of the N-word and other slurs directed at black people, such as the University of Oklahoma fraternity and an almost octogenarian woman there using racial wording as \u201csupposedly\u201d part of a song lyrics. How about many members of my race (adults and even prepubescent youngsters) just stop with the N-word as a regular part of their daily vocabulary? This should include African-American radio and TV broadcasters and figures in sports and the arts joining in by calling to the end of the use of this word by everyone; friends and family too. So, my people, let\u2019s not get bent out of shape when we hear nonblacks use a word that was created by other people to define our African ancestors, as they \u2014 white folks \u2014 also need to take heed and chastise members of their own group. Ali-Abdul Perez\n\nGood Bramhall\n\nNorfolk, Va.: Bramhall\u2019s March 9 Ringling Bros./SeaWorld cartoon made our day. It\u2019s so wonderful and so right. It\u2019s on our bulletin board now. Thanks so much for seeing the clear connection, the absolute analogy, and making sure others see it too. Ingrid Newkirk, president, PETA\n\nRebate the taxpayers\n\nFloral Park: City Controller Scott Stringer states that the city will have an extra $1.6 billion in cash over the next two years. Rather than put this in the general fund, this financial bonanza should be used for homeowner tax rebates which would help middle-class taxpayers like us, who are raising four young sons (ages 8-13). We appreciated the $400 rebate in past years by Mayor Bloomberg. This should be a priority for Mayor de Blasio! Jennifer and Gary Costanzo\n\nShow your face\n\nEast Hanover, N.J.: How nice to see a terrorist revealed! The killers of ISIS hide behind their head coverings. Might they be ashamed of their behavior? Oh, that we could unmask all of them and be rid of such atrocities. Chetty Angelino\n\nSlighting Joan\n\nNorthport, L.I.: I\u2019m still annoyed that there was no mention of Joan Rivers\u2019 passing at the Oscars. Who compiled the list \u2014 friends of Johnny Carson, or left-wing Democrats? She didn\u2019t commit suicide or die of an alcohol or drug overdose, or of natural causes. RIP Joan (and also the Oscars!) Marguerite Boutin\n\nBad medicine\n\nHicksville, L.I.: To Voicer Diane Hombach: Obviously you were not affected by the Affordable Care Act in a negative way, as were millions of Americans, otherwise you would be singing a different tune. And what \u201cfolks with brains\u201d are you referring to? I could have sworn Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cWe will have to pass it to know what is in it.\u201d The law was based on lies which has financially impacted the working and middle class the hardest. The rich can afford it, and the poor barely pay for it. That means, once again, those in the middle gets screwed by the man, because we are the ones who are subsidizing the ACA. And soon we will be poor and then we can all be on the welfare rolls. Your party robs the working man blind, Ms. Hombach. Anybody with a paycheck is fair game for liberals \u2014 all in the name of social equality. John Gelormino\n\nKancel the Kardashians\n\nWashington Township, N.J.: Kim Kardashian can\u2019t act, can\u2019t dance, can\u2019t sing, but she can make an ass of herself. Richard O\u2019Brien\n\nDitto\n\nBethpage, L.I.: Shame, shame on America for caring, watching or spending money on anything involving the Kardashian family. They are zero talent media hounds. Richie Peterson\n\nLove it or leave it\n\nManhattan: I am not sure if President Obama loves America, but if he does love her, he sure has a funny way of showing it. Nicholas D. DeCurtis\n\nZapping ratepayers\n\nFlushing: On Friday while driving, I spotted two Con Edison vehicles on the New Jersey Turnpike getting off at Exit 11. I believe Con Edison wants a rate increase so the people of New York can pay for their vehicles traveling out of New York.
