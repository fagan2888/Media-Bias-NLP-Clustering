It is precisely because of the prudent, conservative, risk-averse approach we take on a day-to-day basis that when someting like SARS comes along, the government is able to step in and do what needs to be done.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that it is important to to take a \u201clonger-term prudent approach past one electoral cycle\u201d as the thing at stake was the \u201csocial public good\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Channel NewsAsia", "description": "MP Dr Janil Puthucheary and NCMP Gerald Giam had a verbal sparring match over the issue of MediShield in Parliament.", "title": "MediShield and Obamacare comparison not valid: MP", "url": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/parliament/news/medishield-and-obamacare/1124264.html", "image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/1028760/1401203308000/large16x9/640/360/parl-dr-janil-puthucheary.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MP Dr Janil Puthucheary and NCMP Gerald Giam had a verbal sparring match over the issue of MediShield in Parliament.", "creator": "John Leong", "image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/1028760/1401203308000/large16x9/640/360/parl-dr-janil-puthucheary.jpg", "title": "MediShield and Obamacare comparison not valid: MP", "site": "@channelnewsasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 101910072318, "pages": 93889432933}, "keywords": "Janil Puthucheary,Member of Parliament,Gerald Giam", "google-site-verification": "S0yL8sQsy_hpjPPSI01shSSGsQKcZfwYH8ByhAITpBE", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 1124264, "publishtime": "2014-05-27T23:23Z"}, "mdc-keywords": "Gerald Giam"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8154\"", "article_summary": "The comparison with Obamacare drew criticism from Dr Puthucheary, who did not believe it was valid to compare a public social insurance scheme like MediShield with the private, for-profit insurance environment in the US.\n\u201cThe intellectually honest thing to do is to compare risks versus risks, benefits versus benefits, worst-case scenario against worst-case scenario; not to cherry-pick the benefits of your proposal against the potential risks of the proposal in front of you,\u201d he said.\nMr Giam maintained that a not-for-profit social insurance scheme like MediShield should have a much higher loss ratio than a commercial insurance scheme, adding that it is now relatively easy to project likely payouts based on the way medical expenses are trending.\nSINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Dr Janil Puthucheary and Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Gerald Giam had a verbal sparring match over the issue of MediShield in Parliament today (May 27).\nDr Putucheary argued that premiums were higher than payouts because Singapore\u2019s population is ageing."}
