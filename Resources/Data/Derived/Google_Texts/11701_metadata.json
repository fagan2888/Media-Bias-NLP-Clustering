You see it in things like the rise of inflation trutherism; you also see it in the inability of many on the right to accept the reality that Obamacare really has covered a lot of previously uninsured Americans.\n\nAnyway, the latest line I\u2019ve been hearing is that the decline in uninsurance isn\u2019t really about the ACA, it\u2019s just the improving economy. Now, the same people who say such things tend to deny that the economy is really improving, too \u2014 Obamacare was supposed to be a job killer, so it must be killing jobs. But never mind. What about claims that the improving economy is the real story?\n\nThe answer is in two parts. First, the decline in the number of uninsured is too steep, too perfectly timed with the coming of the ACA to make sense in such terms. Uninsurance was rising until late 2013, despite a recovering economy, then suddenly fell off a cliff just as the ACA went into full effect. Not a coincidence.\n\nSecond, we are now at a point where a much smaller fraction of Americans are uninsured than we\u2019ve seen in a long time, maybe ever. Even in 2000, with unemployment very low and health costs relatively moderate, Census data show that around 16 percent of Americans aged 18 to 64 were uninsured; meanwhile, the HRMS data, which are consistent with multiple other sources, show uninsurance among that group at about 10 percent, and just 7.5 percent in Medicaid expansion states.\n\nI know this program was supposed to be a dismal failure. But, you know, it isn\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150624165924, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 24, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Persistence of ACA Denialism ( 20150624 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "No, it\u2019s not the economy.", "title": "The Persistence of ACA Denialism", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/the-persistence-of-aca-denialism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "No, it\u2019s not the economy.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 24, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1435179564, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2015-06-24T20:59:24-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20150624205924, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150624, "pdate": 20150624, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "No, it\u2019s not the economy.", "title": "The Persistence of ACA Denialism", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/the-persistence-of-aca-denialism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/the-persistence-of-aca-denialism/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Persistence of ACA Denialism", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Anyway, the latest line I\u2019ve been hearing is that the decline in uninsurance isn\u2019t really about the ACA, it\u2019s just the improving economy.\nWhat about claims that the improving economy is the real story?\nUninsurance was rising until late 2013, despite a recovering economy, then suddenly fell off a cliff just as the ACA went into full effect.\nFirst, the decline in the number of uninsured is too steep, too perfectly timed with the coming of the ACA to make sense in such terms.\nNow, the same people who say such things tend to deny that the economy is really improving, too \u2014 Obamacare was supposed to be a job killer, so it must be killing jobs."}
