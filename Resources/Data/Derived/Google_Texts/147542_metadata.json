Well, sort of. Danny Vinik sends us to the latest from Schiff, who made a big splash in 2008-2009 predicting runaway inflation if not hyperinflation; he was a favorite of Glenn Beck\u2019s.\n\nAnd in his new piece Schiff lays out the analytical issue very clearly:\n\nMainstream economists (who hold sway in government, the corporate world, and academia) argued that as long as the labor market remained slack, inflation would not catch fire. My fellow Austrian economists and I loudly voiced the minority viewpoint that money printing is always inflationary-in fact, that it is the very definition of inflation. \u2026 The truth is that high levels of unemployment are historically correlated with higher inflation and low levels of unemployment with lower inflation. That is because an economy that more fully utilizes labor resources is more productive. More production brings down prices. In contrast, an economy that does not fully employ its citizens is less productive, and its government is more prone to pursue misguided inflationary policies to stimulate the economy.\n\nOK, leave aside the business about defining money-printing as inflation; guys, nobody cares. But what Schiff says very clearly is that according to his worldview, rolling the printing presses should cause inflation (by the normal definition) even in a depressed economy, and that high unemployment should in fact make inflation higher, not lower.\n\nHe has that exactly right: the central dispute is between those who see depressions as the result of inadequate demand, implying that inflation will fall and that printing money does nothing unless it boosts employment, and those who see depressions as the result of maladapation of resources or something \u2014 anyway, something on the supply side \u2014 who predict that running the printing presses will lead to runaway inflation.\n\nHow could you test those rival views? Why, how about having a huge slump, to which central banks respond with aggressive monetary expansion? And that is, of course, the test we\u2019ve just run. And everywhere you look, inflation is low, verging on deflation.\n\nSo we\u2019ve just run the Schiff test \u2014 and his brand of economics, by his own criteria, loses with flying colors. And that goes for just about all anti-Keynesian doctrines: we ran as close to a clean experiment as you\u2019re ever going to get, and the answer is no.\n\nNow, just about everyone on that side insists that it\u2019s not true, that sinister bureaucrats are smuggling away the inflation evidence and burying it in Area 51. That tells you a lot about who we\u2019re dealing with. But at least Schiff states the issue clearly before refusing to admit error.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141122121645, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 22, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Wisdom of Peter Schiff ( 20141122 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "No, seriously, almost.", "title": "The Wisdom of Peter Schiff", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "No, seriously, almost.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 22, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1416676605, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T17:16:45-05:00"}, "utime": 20141122171645, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141122, "pdate": 20141122, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "No, seriously, almost.", "title": "The Wisdom of Peter Schiff", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Wisdom of Peter Schiff", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20ab\"", "article_summary": "So we\u2019ve just run the Schiff test \u2014 and his brand of economics, by his own criteria, loses with flying colors.\nDanny Vinik sends us to the latest from Schiff, who made a big splash in 2008-2009 predicting runaway inflation if not hyperinflation; he was a favorite of Glenn Beck\u2019s.\nAnd that is, of course, the test we\u2019ve just run.\n\u2026 The truth is that high levels of unemployment are historically correlated with higher inflation and low levels of unemployment with lower inflation.\nBut at least Schiff states the issue clearly before refusing to admit error."}
