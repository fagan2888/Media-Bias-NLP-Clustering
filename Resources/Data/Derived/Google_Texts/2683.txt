Integris is announcing that they will be the first healthcare organization in Oklahoma to join the Mayo Clinic Care network.

That will mean a lot for Oklahoma families faced with a Cancer diagnosis or other difficult to diagnose conditions, as they will no longer have to travel out of state to take advantage of Mayo Clinic resources.

The collaboration will open all of the Mayo clinicâ€™s state of the art resources to Integris doctors.

Lacie Lowry will have more tonight on what this all means for the future of healthcare in the state.
