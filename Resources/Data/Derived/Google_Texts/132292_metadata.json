They fear retaliation from their assailants and complications from a long drawn out trial process, or they\u2019re pressured to drop the cases by friends, family, and the abusers themselves.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s important to understand this particular situation,\u201d Rita Smith, Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, told ThinkProgress. \u201cThere\u2019s already been such notoriety. If I were her, I would have concerns as well about moving forward.\u201d\n\nBut there is some hope \u2014 at least in Florida \u2014 that charges can be brought against George Zimmerman without Shellie\u2019s involvement. In that state, an appeals court held \u201cthe decision to prosecute does not lie with the victim of a crime.\u201d Rather, the state\u2019s attorney decides whether or not to review a case.\n\nDomestic violence laws vary immensely based on where a victim lives. \u201cThere are states that will incarcerate a woman for not participating\u201d in a trial against her abuser, Smith said. In other states, a victim doesn\u2019t need to be heard from at all.\n\nFederally, there have been no moves to standardize a victim\u2019s involvement in bringing charges against their abusers. \u201cThe only way we\u2019d have a national law about this is if it\u2019s crimes committed on national lands or tribal lands,\u201d Smith pointed out. \u201cThe only way the federal government would get involved would be if civil rights were being violated.\u201d\n\nThe federal government does bar domestic abusers from obtaining firearms, but the law is porous at best, and many abusers are still successful in obtaining a deadly weapon. Domestic violence victims also lack federal protections against employment discrimination and access to housing.\n\nBut as with these other gaps in protections for domestic violence victims, there is no obvious logic for why victims should have to be involved in prosecutions if they feel it makes them unsafe. \u201cThey prosecute murders all the time without a quote-unquote witness,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey can do it without victims too\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"If I were her, I would have concerns as well about moving forward.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"If I were her, I would have concerns as well about moving forward.\"", "title": "Florida Can Prosecute George Zimmerman Even If His Wife Doesn\u2019t Press Charges", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/09/2594431/zimmerman-domestic-violence-law/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/0Domestic-Violence_ari_3615533270_-e1342105799680.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"If I were her, I would have concerns as well about moving forward.\"", "creator": "@ARStrasser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/0Domestic-Violence_ari_3615533270_-e1342105799680.jpg", "title": "Florida Can Prosecute George Zimmerman Even If His Wife Doesn\u2019t Press Charges", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/0Domestic-Violence_ari_3615533270_-e1342105799680.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/0Domestic-Violence_ari_3615533270_-e1342105799680.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-09T19:25:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Florida Can Prosecute George Zimmerman Even If His Wife Doesn\u2019t Press Charges CREDIT:On Monday, the wife of Trayvon Martin\u2019s killer, George Zimmerman, called 911.\nWhile the details of this altercation are still unknown, too often, victims of domestic violence drop or opt not to press charges.\nDomestic violence victims also lack federal protections against employment discrimination and access to housing.\nIf I were her, I would have concerns as well about moving forward.\u201dBut there is some hope \u2014 at least in Florida \u2014 that charges can be brought against George Zimmerman without Shellie\u2019s involvement.\nBut as with these other gaps in protections for domestic violence victims, there is no obvious logic for why victims should have to be involved in prosecutions if they feel it makes them unsafe."}
