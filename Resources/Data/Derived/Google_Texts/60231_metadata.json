Jim Gerlach.\n\nOn Friday, Trivedi\u2019s campaign announced that he had earned a spot in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s (DCCC) Red-to-Blue program. The program highlights top Democratic campaigns across the country and brings with it the support and resources of the DCCC.\n\n\u201cManan Trivedi has a proven record of serving his community and his country, both as a physician and Iraq War veteran, and he has shown he knows how to put together a strong and disciplined campaign,\u201d said DCCC Chairman Steve Israel in a statement. \u201cVoters in this district want to elect a moderate problem-solver like Manan Trivedi, and do not want a Tea Party Republican whose views are outside the mainstream and who will continue Washington Republicans\u2019 obsession with boosting special interests and the ultra-wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrivedi is a Berks County physician. This is Trivedi\u2019s third shot at the 6th district seat, which has been looked at by Democrats as a possible win in November following Gerlach\u2019s retirement announcement in January.\n\n\u201cIt has been truly humbling to receive such overwhelming support from the voters of Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th Congressional District,\u201d Trivedi said. \u201cEarning a spot in the Red-to-Blue program is a testament to the hard work of all the voters who have joined our grassroots campaign to stand up for middle class families and create good paying jobs in Pennsylvania. It is because of those shared values that not only will this campaign will continue to grow, but together we\u2019ll be able to set the course for a better direction.\u201d\n\nTrivedi was also supported by the New Democrat Coalition, a national group of moderate Democrats at the end of May.\n\nCostello, Chester County Commissioner, was also recognized by the national party, becoming a \u201cYoung Gun\u201d in the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s (NRCC) program in early May. The Young Guns program helps to provide candidates and their campaigns tools and resources.\n\nYoung Guns are considered the final level in the program and are established by showing a \u201cclear path to victory through his ability to build a formidable campaign structure and achieve important goals and benchmarks,\u201d according to the NRCC.\n\n\u201cRyan has outlined conservative principles that will grow jobs, stop the harmful effects of ObamaCare, and get Washington\u2019s spending under control,\u201d said NRCC Chairman Greg Walden in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week, Costello was visited by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan at a NRCC fundraiser, according to his spokesperson Pete Peterson.\n\nPeterson noted the fundraiser was a closed event at a private residence. PoliticsPA reported that the congressman and former vice-presidential nominee had made a surprise visit to the 6th district to talk about \u201cthe importance of electing Ryan Costello.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressman Paul Ryan came to the district to provide his support because he knows Ryan Costello will be a bipartisan leader who will work to protect taxpayers and help businesses create jobs,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cCongressman Ryan joins other Republican leaders who have already come to the district to support Costello, including Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Congressman Greg Walden. There is a lot of local excitement and national buzz about Costello based on the early strength of his campaign, which includes a recent survey showing Costello with a double digit lead in the race.\u201d\n\nCostello was also recognized by MSNBC host and NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd at the end of May, being named a Pennsylvania Rising Star.\n\nThe race has become closely watched throughout the country after Gerlach announced in January 2014 that he will not seek reelection.\n\nThe 6th District covers a large part of Chester County, and portions of Berks, Montgomery and Lebanon counties.\n\nFollow Daily Local News staff writer Kendal Gapinski on Twitter at @KendalGapinski and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/KendalAGapinski.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, West Chester Politics news, PA Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Costello, Trivedi congress race gets national attention", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20140607/NEWS/140609735", "image": {"width": "1958px", "identifier": "http://local.dailylocal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailylocal.png?052016", "height": "1025px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Costello, Trivedi congress race gets national attention"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailylocal.com", "description": "After a relatively quiet primary season in Chester County, candidates seeking the open 6th Congressional District seat have begun to attract national attention as they head toward November\u2019s general election.", "title": "Costello, Trivedi congress race gets national attention", "url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20140607/NEWS/140609735", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailylocal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailylocal.png?052016"}, "site": "@wcdailylocal", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563329788", "iphone": "id525116294", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailylocalnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, West Chester Politics news, PA Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "After a relatively quiet primary season in Chester County, candidates seeking the open 6th Congressional District seat have begun to attract national attention as they head toward November\u2019s general election."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce473\"", "article_summary": "The 6th District covers a large part of Chester County, and portions of Berks, Montgomery and Lebanon counties.\nCostello, Chester County Commissioner, was also recognized by the national party, becoming a \u201cYoung Gun\u201d in the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s (NRCC) program in early May.\n\u201cIt has been truly humbling to receive such overwhelming support from the voters of Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th Congressional District,\u201d Trivedi said.\nBoth Democratic candidate Manan Trivedi and Republican candidate Ryan Costello have been recognized by the national parties in their bid to earn the seat currently held by outgoing U.S. Rep.
