New research shows mom has been reaping the benefits of breastfeeding too, by possibly lowering her breast cancer risk as well as her prognosis if she's diagnosed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at the association of breastfeeding on risk of breast cancer but on the [question]: If you breastfed early on and developed breast cancer, what is your prognosis?\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Marilyn Kwan, a research scientist with Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Division of Research in Oakland, Calif., according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nKwan and her research team studied more than 1,600 women who had breast cancer, and found those who breastfed had an overall 30 percent lower risk of recurring breast cancer. If a woman breastfed, she also had a 28 percent reduced risk of dying from her breast cancer. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, reaffirms previous findings that found breastfeeding lowers the risk of developing breast cancer in the first place.\n\n\"If a woman breastfeeds, she reduces her risk of developing breast cancer by about five percent to 10 percent, although other factors come into play,\" such as the number of children she gave birth to, Kwan said. \"We think this is one of the first [studies] to examine the role of breastfeeding and breast cancer outcomes \u2014 prognosis and survival.\u201d\n\nThe researchers still have to investigate deeper in order to find the exact cause and effect between breastfeeding and breast cancer. But researchers have found links between breastfeeding and luminal A subtypes of breast cancer \u2014 the most common subtypes \u2014 including tumors known as estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding for about six months, during which time mothers not only lower breast cancer risk but also the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cThe message has been getting out about the value to babies of breastfeeding. It really needs to get out about the value to the mom,\u201d Dr. Susan Kutner, a breast surgeon at Kaiser\u2019s San Jose hospital and chairwoman of Kaiser\u2019s Northern California\u2019s Breast Care Task Force, told the Chronicle. She did not participate in the study. \u201cThere\u2019s so much we still don\u2019t know. But when breast cells are able to do what they\u2019re supposed to do, they\u2019re fulfilling their function.\u201d\n\nSource: Kwan M.
