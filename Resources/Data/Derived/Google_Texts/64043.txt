IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Iowa football media day was held on Saturday as the team prepares for the 2015 season.

The best way to describe Hawkeye football the last three seasons is average at best, as they've gone 19-19 in their last 38 games. It will be year No. 17 for head coach Kirk Ferentz, which might be the most important of his career.

At media day on Saturday, Ferentz discussed moving past the team's disappointing loss to Tennessee in the TaxSlayer Bowl last year.

"That's the great thing about sports you get a chance to get back up on your feet and do something about your last experience or things you weren't happy about," Ferentz said. "We didn't have to call Dr. Phil or anything like that for our football team, we are just trying to work a little harder, smarter, and get better at things that really determine successful outcomes."

Hawkeye players, including linebacker Josey Jewell, also commented on the loss to the Volunteers and their mindset going forward.

"I still don't think we are over that one," Jewell said. "I think that'll still go throughout this year, just knowing how much better we can be and how much work we've put in over this offseason. We are ready to go this year."

Iowa's season opener is less than a month away as they'll take on Illinois State on Sept. 5. The Redbirds are ranked second in the preseason FCS rankings.
