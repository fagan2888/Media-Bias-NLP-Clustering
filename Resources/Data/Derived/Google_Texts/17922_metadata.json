That amount is up significantly from the report\u2019s finding in 2012 of $588.6 million in net income.\n\nEvery two years since 1997, independent market analyst Allan Baumgarten of Minneapolis has produced the \u201cOhio Health Market Review\u201d to take a sweeping look at the Buckeye State\u2019s health-care economy. He has published similar reports in 11 other key states.\n\nAmong his other findings for 2014:\n\nLocal hospital systems have been on a building binge even though the number of days that patients stay in the hospital has dropped. In 2008, the occupancy rate was 68.7 percent; in 2014, it was 67.4 percent.\n\nTriHealth had the highest occupancy rate at 74.4 percent, with Bethesda North the highest of all at nearly 82 percent. The occupancy rate at UC Health hospitals was 67.1 percent, and at Mercy Health\u2019s five hospitals Greater Cincinnati, the rate was 63.9 percent. At Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, the rate was 71 percent.\n\nMedicare covered 42.6 percent of inpatient days. Other payers, mostly commercial insurers, covered 32.3 percent of inpatient days.\n\nStatewide, enrollment in Medicaid health-maintenance organizations hit 2.4 million in 2014, including more than 600,000 recipients added under the Medicaid expansion.\n\nWith more people enrolled in Medicaid, the federal program covered more impatient days at local hospitals: In 2013, the number was 234,000 days; in 2014, 269,000 days.\n\nEnrollment in individual HMO plans grew by almost 100,000 in 2014.\n\nHMO profitability has declined. Statewide, HMOs had net income of $171.2 million in 2014, or 1.1 percent of premium revenues \u2013 a sharp drop from 2012\u2019s net income of $243 million, or 2.5 percent of premium revenues.\n\nHospitals are devoting more effort in strategic alliances, such as the Healthcare Solutions Network joining TriHealth and St. Elizabeth Healthcare.\n\nCOMPARING GROWING IN INCOME\n\nHere's a look at changes in net income at Greater Cincinnati hospital systems, according to \"Ohio Health Market Review\":\n\nTriHealth: $145,217,102 (2014); $48,654,547 (2012)\n\nMercy Health: $93,623,285 (2014); $105,429,004 (2012)\n\nUC Health: $30,379,848 (2014); $22,806,330 (2012)\n\nSt. Elizabeth Healthcare: $102,858,920 (2014); $122,556,546 (2012)\n\nThe Christ Hospital: $88,324,673 (2014); $50,785,512 (2012)\n\nCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center: $172,400,000 (2014); $128,748,579 (2012)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1UR3K1h", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "'The Ohio Health Market Review' examines the state of the health care economy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "'The Ohio Health Market Review' examines the state of the health care economy", "title": "Report: Cincinnati hospital profits up in 2014", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/01/14/report-cincinnati-hospital-profits-up-2014/78739080/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'The Ohio Health Market Review' examines the state of the health care economy", "creator": "@enquirer", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/562b03236463cf0288dad7c652e6a58efdf2e91e/c=1291-0-3883-2592&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "title": "Report: Cincinnati hospital profits up in 2014", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Cincinnati Medical Center", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Cincinnati Medical Center", "title": "Report: Cincinnati hospital profits up in 2014", "author": "Anne Saker", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7acf404c9ef148e3a11df79ad0ba17faf85d9e14/c=1793-0-3737-2592/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a977efa900178093e3db3f86178a60a47a83008/c=1291-0-3883-2592/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4b2afe37a5c2efb54ff44f59c6c39c6106e6dfc/c=436-0-3883-2592/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e54471f8f657314e10e5d52fe59dda111ab2432/c=0-0-3883-2194&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-01-14T11:29:33.637000-05:00", "shorthed": "Report: Cincinnati hospital profits up in 2014", "articleid": 78739080, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cad4b6ae10a905b490e8d5ff3b3004920aa24dab/c=0-0-3883-2194/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f004cce097fece9eeb6d262b8596dd8a1b450a44/c=1808-0-3260-2592/local/-/media/2016/01/14/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635883677271420512-CHRIST-HOSPITAL-6.JPG"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "ohio health market review, allan baumgarten, uc health, trihealth, cincinnati children's hospital medical center, mercy health, medicaid, medicare, profits, inpatients, cincinnati enquirer, anne saker"}, "article_summary": "The occupancy rate at UC Health hospitals was 67.1 percent, and at Mercy Health\u2019s five hospitals Greater Cincinnati, the rate was 63.9 percent.\nThe report said hospitals in Greater Cincinnati had combined net income of $645.1 million in 2014, and the strongest margins were at The Christ Hospital, TriHealth and St. Elizabeth Healthcare.\nThat amount is up significantly from the report\u2019s finding in 2012 of $588.6 million in net income.\nAt Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, the rate was 71 percent.\nStatewide, HMOs had net income of $171.2 million in 2014, or 1.1 percent of premium revenues \u2013 a sharp drop from 2012\u2019s net income of $243 million, or 2.5 percent of premium revenues."}
