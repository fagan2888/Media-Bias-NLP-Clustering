In an interesting story in the San Jose Mercury News, Steve Corkran discusses the Raiders’ pass rush — perhaps their most celebrated accomplishment thus far in 2013 — and why it may not have the same effect against Peyton Manning and the Broncos.

Corkran describes the Raiders’ pass rush success as being a result of “their penchant for blitzing any player, in any situation, from a variety of angles,” an approach that might not work so well against Manning, who is tough to fool with the blitz and often succeeds in spite of it.



From the story:

(Oakland defensive coordinator Jason Tarver) realizes that the only way to succeed against Manning is to take calculated risks that manifest themselves in the form of well-disguised blitzes and sound pass coverage. That strategy worked well against the Colts’ Andrew Luck and the Jaguars’ Chad Henne. Tarver need only watch the tape from last season’s game against the Broncos in Oakland to see Manning’s skill at counteracting blitzes from the secondary. The Raiders threw a season-high 25 blitzes against Manning and the Broncos in the teams’ second meeting, with Manning completing 15 of 18 passes for 177 yards on those plays.

For some context: Manning has been blitzed 19 times this season, according to Pro Football Focus. Furthermore, not one of the three times he’s been sacked has occurred when he was blitzed. On those 19 dropbacks when blitzed, Manning has completed 10 passes, three for touchdowns, and he’s accrued a 129.6 QB rating. That’s nearly as good as his overall 131.1 QB rating.

This is not to say that the Raiders’ pass rush isn’t good — it is — or that it won’t plague Manning, especially with the lack of Ryan Clady on the offensive line. However, the Broncos will be Oakland’s toughest test in terms of the pass rush so far this season, and it will be interesting to see how that challenge manifests itself.
