Detroit Institute for Children closes outpatient clinics

The Detroit Institute for Children last week shut down three outpatient clinics serving 250 special needs children to focus more resources on the institute’s larger school program that provides services to more than 4,500 children.



“It was a difficult decision to make and filled with lots of emotion,” said Mike Rhoads, the institute’s director of school services. “The last couple years we had a reduction in the volume of patients relative to changes in the health care industry.”



Rhoads said the institute wants to expand its school services program. An advisory board composed of school principals and parents will make recommendations on what additional services are needed.



Some 27 employees, including 17 therapists, who staffed the outpatient clinics were laid off, said Marge Resmer LaRuffa, the institute’s COO. Clinic locations were in Detroit, Clawson and St. Clair Shores.
