Building a better mousetrap is one thing, but why try to improve upon the greatest thing ever created by God and man and pig? Bender said it was time for a paradigm shift. "What if God woke up one morning and there was a cow standing there instead of a pig. He would have created bacon out of that cow."



Whoa.

Schmacon won a 2014 food and beverage innovation award from the National Restaurant Association. The product tastes kind of like pork bacon, kind of like pastrami, with a smoky maple finish. Bender launched a Kickstarter campaign "to get Schmacon in the hands of thousands of people around the country that can go to their grocer and say, 'Please stock this Schmacon in my grocery store.'"

Bender said he almost gave up on the idea many times. The hardest part, he said, was convincing large manufacturing facilities to make the product for national sales, which he said will happen in the next six months.



"I love pork bacon, but I also love beef," he said, "so now we've got the best of two worlds."
