He is committed to finding the best candidate for vacant seat. Could it be him?\n\n\u201cNever say never,\u201d Burn said.\n\nFerlo cited his new district as the reason for his departure. Widely considered one of the most liberal members of the Senate, redistricting made the 38th senatorial district much more conservative and virtually unwinnable for Ferlo.\n\nGone are the Pittsburgh neighborhoods and Allegheny River mill towns that made the 38th district solid blue. In their place are deep red pockets in the North Hills of Allegheny County.\n\nThe new SD-38 is good for Republicans. Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama there by 6.4% there in 2012 despite losing the state overall by 5.4%. However, it\u2019s not a sure thing for the GOP. Sen. Bob Casey won the district by 0.6% and Kathleen Kane won by 5.8%.\n\nIf he runs, Burn would face State Sen. Randy Vulakovich (R-Allegheny). Despite his mostly party-line voting record, Vulakovich enjoys a good rapport with local Democratic officials and labor groups.\n\nJim Burn has been the chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party since his election in 2010. He served 12 years as Mayor of Millvale, and was elected to Allegheny County Council in 2005. Burn served as President of the County Council in 2011.\n\nAs state party chairman, he\u2019s attended Democratic National Convention events where he\u2019s built strong relationships with donors and supporters across the country.\n\nIf he does run, he may scare off Democratic primary challengers and turn the general election into a high profile race. Any other challenger for the seat would have a difficult time matching Burn\u2019s rolodex.\n\nClose ties to the Democratic party could also be a risk for him. Republican opposition researchers would find a treasure trove of material to work with. As a party spokesman Burn appeared on television numerous times to boost policies from the Affordable Care Act to abortion rights.\n\nIn 2013, Democratic party members voted to include call for a moratorium on natural gas drilling into the party platform. Burn opposed the move, but it would be difficult to squeeze such nuance into a 30 second campaign advertisement.\n\nNovember 19th, 2013 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 5 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Jim Burn, also a former Allegheny County Councilman, is being recruited for a bid in State Sen.
