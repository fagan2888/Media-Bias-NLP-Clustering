Utility companies in Georgia and South Carolina are building two similar plants in the United States using a very similar design. Since the project in China is father along, U.S. executives and safety regulators watch it closely.\n\nOfficials at China\u2019s State Nuclear Power Technology Corp. blame the delays on the late delivery of equipment from the United States. Westinghouse Electric Co. and project manufacturers are working to redesign a coolant pump for the plant.\n\nChinese officials are building a fleet of nuclear plants as they aim to produce a fifth of their country\u2019s electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.\n\n\u201cBecause it is the first of this kind in the world, it is normal to have some delay,\u201d said Guo Hongbo, director of the firm\u2019s general office. He was vague on how long the delays may last. \u201cIt is not a problem whether the delay is one year or two years. The technological breakthrough will be utterly valuable to the development of \u2026 world nuclear power.\u201d\n\nWestinghouse Electric Co. President Danny Roderick said the issues with the coolant pumps will be resolved before there\u2019s any impact in the United States.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see those delays at all,\u201d he said.\n\nPower plant owners and regulators in the United States have their own teams in China to monitor building efforts there. Chinese safety regulators have joined inspectors from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission when they review nuclear industry vendors, including the manufacturer of the reactor coolant pumps.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the benefits of not being one of the first-of-the-kind here,\u201d Southern Co. CEO Thomas Fanning said in an interview. \u2018We\u2019re picking up the benefits.\u201d\n\nMeeting deadlines is critical for projects in both countries. When nuclear plant construction slows down, building and financing costs can soar. That problem hobbled the nuclear industry during earlier rounds of building. Proponents had hoped the new projects in China and the United States would demonstrate nuclear plants can be constructed without blowing budgets.\n\nIf nuclear plants go massively over budget, the nuclear industry will find it nearly impossible in the short run to compete against much-cheaper gas-fired plants. U.S. utility executives who are building nuclear plants say the facilities reliably produce energy without emitting greenhouse gasses and run relatively cheaply once they are built.\n\nThe projects in the United States are already under cost pressure. Westinghouse Electric Co. and Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. expect construction of two new AP1000 reactors at Plant Vogtle in eastern Georgia will go three years beyond the approved schedule, according to financial filings. Southern Co., which owns a 46 percent stake in the plant, and the plant\u2019s other owners have not accepted that timeline.\n\nRegulators in Georgia estimate the latest delays could push Southern Co.\u2019s share of spending on the plant from $6.1 billion to more than $8 billion.\n\nA sister plant owned by SCANA Corp. and Santee Cooper in South Carolina has run into similar delays and cost overruns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. power companies struggling with the escalating costs of building nuclear plants are closely watching similar efforts in China, where officials are expecting delays.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "U.S. power companies struggling with the escalating costs of building nuclear plants are closely watching similar efforts in China, where officials are expecting delays.", "title": "Nuclear plants delayed in China, watched closely by US firms", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/nuclear-plants-delayed-china-watched-closely-us-fi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/30/e0ea5f33d4dbac046c0f6a7067002e06.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/30/e0ea5f33d4dbac046c0f6a7067002e06.jpg", "description": "U.S. power companies struggling with the escalating costs of building nuclear plants are closely watching similar efforts in China, where officials are expecting delays.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nuclear plants delayed in China, watched closely by US firms"}, "Author": "Ray Henry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Westinghouse Electric Co, China"}, "article_summary": "If nuclear plants go massively over budget, the nuclear industry will find it nearly impossible in the short run to compete against much-cheaper gas-fired plants.\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 U.S. power companies struggling with the escalating costs of building nuclear plants are closely watching similar efforts in China, where officials are expecting delays.\nProponents had hoped the new projects in China and the United States would demonstrate nuclear plants can be constructed without blowing budgets.\nU.S. utility executives who are building nuclear plants say the facilities reliably produce energy without emitting greenhouse gasses and run relatively cheaply once they are built.\nUtility companies in Georgia and South Carolina are building two similar plants in the United States using a very similar design."}
