Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor. But there are two Tim Wus, too. There\u2019s the Internet rock star who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and who\u2019s regarded as one of the leading legal scholars of the online age. And there\u2019s the first-time candidate who, in an interview, couldn\u2019t name one company at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, who didn\u2019t know that nanotechnology is upstate New York\u2019s great economic hope and who couldn\u2019t identify Fort Drum as the state\u2019s largest military installation. You might say these two very different candidates are duking it out in the race for lieutenant governor in New York State, but you would be wrong. Wu \u2013 running mate to Zephyr Teachout, the progressive lawyer who is challenging Cuomo \u2013 is bashing Hochul\u2019s brains in, while Hochul is shadowboxing with her opponent, refusing to even mention his name. And that\u2019s just one of many oddities in the first competitive Democratic primary for New York lieutenant governor in 16 years, which culminates Tuesday when, most likely, a small number of voters will trickle to the polls to decide between two very different pols. It\u2019s a race between a politician who sees herself partnering with Cuomo \u2013 and a free spirit who says that, if he\u2019s elected, he could end up investigating the governor. It\u2019s a race between a woman who raves about having attended the Erie County Fair hundreds of times and a guy who enjoys \u201cBurning Man,\u201d a weeklong counterculture festival in the Nevada desert that culminates in the burning of a gigantic wooden stick figure. And above all, the campaign appears to be a reflection of the divide between go-along, get-along upstate New York and New York City\u2019s increasingly progressive, turn-left-or-get-off-the-highway political and media culture. In other words, the line of battle in this race might as well be the Tappan Zee Bridge. Given that there are far more Democrats below that bridge than above it, political pros here privately say it\u2019s a battle that Wu has a chance to win.\n\nHochul\u2019s shifting stances Hochul\u2019s troubles come clearest in a video that the Teachout-Wu campaign posted to its website last week: a minute-long takedown of her political career called \u201cKathy Hochul, Debating Herself.\u201d \u201cBelieve me, as someone who had a progressive record,\u201d the 2014 Hochul says. Then the 2012 Hochul boasts: \u201cI\u2019ve become very conservative in my voting record.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never backed down from our core Democratic values,\u201d the 2014 Hochul says. And then the 2012 Hochul reminds us: \u201cI broke with the party many, many times.\u201d And on and on. The video reflects larger issues that are not mentioned, most notably gun control, on which Hochul has, well, adjusted her position. As a Democratic member of Congress representing the most Republican district in New York State in 2011 and 2012, Hochul supported legislation making it easier to carry guns over state lines and opening federal lands to hunting \u2013 and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. But now she favors the SAFE Act, Cuomo\u2019s signature gun control legislation. Asked to explain, Hochul said: \u201cReasonable gun owners that I know would support background checks that have been proposed and getting certain guns off the streets,\u201d which is what the SAFE Act does. \u201cBut there are extremists who will say that, if you support the SAFE Act, you don\u2019t support the Second Amendment. I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d Hochul\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t sit well with Tom King, president of the New York Rifle and Pistol Association Political Victory Fund. \u201cWe usually grade incumbents based upon their actions in office. Using that criteria, Hochul would have earned an \u2018A\u2019,\u201d King said. But given her turnabout, King said: \u201cIf it makes her happy, we\u2019ll give Hochul an \u2018F\u2019 rating and tell everyone to support Tim Wu instead\u201d \u2013 even though Wu is a strong gun control advocate. Hochul finds herself with some explaining to do, as well, on immigration and health care. In 2007, while serving as Erie County clerk, she led a fight against driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented aliens. But now she embraces Cuomo\u2019s pro-immigration agenda. And while serving in Congress, she took several votes to limit parts of the Affordable Care Act. In one public appearance in 2012, she mistakenly said that she voted to repeal the health law entirely. Adding it all up, Hochul said: \u201cI believe that I did what I was elected to do in Congress, and that was represent my district, and I\u2019m proud of that. But within that context, there were core Democratic principles that I did not waver from. It would have been a lot easier for me to not have been 100 percent pro-choice in that district, or to not be for marriage equality. And I had many opportunities to vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and I never did.\u201d Wu looks at Hochul, though, and sees a conservative in disguise. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to misrepresent herself here,\u201d Wu said. Carrying that message across New York City and to its many left-leaning media outlets, Wu has managed to turn a grossly underfunded campaign into a serious challenge. Yet he\u2019s traveled far less in upstate New York, and in an interview in his family\u2019s comfortable apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea last week, it showed.\n\nQuiz is revealing Told that The Buffalo News wanted to ask him 10 questions about upstate New York, Wu replied: \u201cOh, dear. Oh, dear.\u201d Wu could not answer six of the first eight questions \u2013 at which point an aide cut off the questioning. \u201cI think we\u2019ve already flunked this test,\u201d Wu said. Did he ever. He couldn\u2019t identify HarborCenter, Buffalo Sabres owner Terry Pegula\u2019s signature downtown development project. He couldn\u2019t identify Barry Snyder, the Seneca Nation of Indians leader who\u2019s gone toe to toe with governor after governor on taxation and gambling issues. And he couldn\u2019t describe the \u201cgarbage plate,\u201d Rochester\u2019s everything-but-the-statins mess of a signature dish. In contrast, Hochul correctly answered seven of 10 detailed questions posed to her about downstate New York and the tech industry, Wu\u2019s specialty. Told of Wu\u2019s performance on the quiz, Michael V. Haselswerdt, a political scientist at Canisius College, was aghast. \u201cNot only doesn\u2019t he know; he obviously doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Haselswerdt said. Wu\u2019s lack of detailed knowledge of upstate New York did not, however, stop him from criticizing the \u201cBuffalo Billion,\u201d Cuomo\u2019s infusion of state aid to pump up the local economy, which Wu said might not be big enough or managed properly. \u201cMy No. 1 concern with Buffalo Billion is that it has the perception of being in some sense the governor\u2019s largesse, the governor\u2019s helping of selected companies,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have studied it carefully enough to say this was a mistake or that was. But I think there is a perception that the process for selecting projects is not as impartial as it could be.\u201d Hochul, in contrast, is a loyal supporter of Cuomo\u2019s economic development effort. \u201cI can look out the window of my home in Buffalo and see the physical transition, but also the intangible psychological impact it\u2019s had,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I could not have anticipated the fruits of the governor\u2019s effort being borne out so quickly.\u201d The candidates\u2019 contrasting views on the Buffalo Billion only hint at their radically different politics, which come clear both when they describe their visions for the role of lieutenant governor as well as when they hit the campaign trail. Hochul sees herself taking on some top issues as assignments from the governor, such as his women\u2019s equality agenda, while overseeing his regional economic development councils and taking on some issues of personal interest, such as veterans affairs. \u201cThe governor called me and said: \u2018Kathy, will you be my partner?\u2019 \u201d she told voters in Brooklyn. \u201cI thought about it for about two seconds, and I said yes. This is where I belong.\u201d In contrast, when asked if he saw the lieutenant governor as a partner with the governor, Wu said: \u201cNo, not really. I think we could share ceremonial duties, if need be, but no. But I see it as not being a partnership.\u201d As lieutenant governor, Wu wants to serve as the state\u2019s \u201cpublic advocate,\u201d shining a light on problems that other state officials would rather ignore. For example, Wu said he might focus on the Time Warner-Comcast merger and its effect on consumers \u2013 or public corruption. After Cuomo shut down his Moreland Commission investigation of public wrongdoing when investigators appeared to be looking at figures close to the governor, \u201cI was sort of surprised that there weren\u2019t state-level hearings or inquiries,\u201d Wu said. So the lieutenant governor could end up investigating the governor? \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Wu said. In other words, then, Hochul is the classic insider while Wu is the classic outsider.\n\nDisparate campaign styles Hochul\u2019s campaign days are packed with visits to senior centers and subway stops, where she never stops smiling and never stops shaking hands. At her side often are key political figures from the state or city, such as former Gov. David Paterson and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. By doing so, Hochul said she\u2019s managed to build relationships with downstate constituencies that didn\u2019t know her well when the campaign started. \u201cThose relationships are going to be very strong, and it\u2019s going to be seen in turnout on primary day,\u201d she said. Wu, meanwhile, sticks heavily to news conferences and interviews with left-leaning media outlets, though he\u2019s campaigned extensively in the city\u2019s Asian neighborhoods and on the Internet, where he\u2019s turned his social media followers into campaigners. \u201cTo all supporters: JOB #1 today & weekend is getting the word out \u2013 people need to hear about the campaign. Promise you\u2019ll tell 5 friends!\u201d Wu tweeted Friday to his 9,983 followers \u2013 which is more than four times as many as Hochul has. Hochul and Wu may be very different now, but they started in similar places. They\u2019re both children of strivers. Hochul\u2019s father began his adult life in a trailer and ended up as CEO of Computer Task Group, one of Buffalo\u2019s first big tech companies, while her mother was a Southtowns community activist who served as her daughter\u2019s inspiration. Wu, meanwhile, is the son of two accomplished medical researchers, one from Taiwan and the other from England, who were working in Washington, D.C., when their son was born. Some of their childhood experiences were similar, too. Hochul, now 56, recalls loving \u201cCommander Tom\u201d on WKBW when she was a child. And Wu, who is now 42, moved to Toronto with his family when he was young and recalled that his favorite station growing up was Buffalo\u2019s Channel 29 \u201cbecause it played the most cartoons.\u201d Soon, though, their lives diverged. Hochul was a political animal from the start, working in Erie County politics as a teenager and serving as a student leader at Syracuse University. Wu, meanwhile, developed a teenage fascination with computers and the law that propelled him through McGill University and Harvard Law School. Hochul got a law degree at Catholic University and served as a congressional aide before returning to Hamburg to raise a family. Only later did she start a real political career that peaked with her upset win in a May 2011 congressional race in the conservative district linking the Buffalo and Rochester suburbs. In Washington, she briefly became a rising Democratic star, only to lose her 2012 re-election bid to former Erie County Executive Chris Collins after the district lines were redrawn to make it even more Republican. But she left with plenty of friends in Washington. \u201cTo know Kathy Hochul is to like Kathy Hochul,\u201d Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, second-ranking Democrat, said during her tenure there. Wu, meanwhile, traveled from a clerkship under U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer to a stint in Silicon Valley to a law professorship at Columbia. His greatest fame, though, came through his coining of the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2013 the idea that the Internet should remain free and open and that service providers should not favor particular content or customers \u2013 and the publication of his 2010 book \u201cThe Master Switch.\u201d The book won rave reviews, with progressive hero Arianna Huffington calling it \u201ca must-read for all Americans who want to remain the ones deciding what they can read, watch and listen to.\u201d Given their very different personal histories, perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that Hochul and Wu come off as very different personalities as well. Hochul is invariably warm, striving to portray herself as the middle-class, middle-America mom that she is. For example, she noted that she recently tried fried cookie dough at the Erie County Fair, one of her favorite annual events. When she and her husband moved back to Hamburg to raise a family, \u201cI made sure our new home was walking distance to the fair,\u201d she said. \u201cNeedless to say, I love the fair.\u201d Wu, meanwhile, is a friendly intellectual juggernaut who, when provoked, speaks as passionately about keeping the Bills in Buffalo as he does about his concern about the concentration of private economic power. He\u2019s also clearly a product, in part of Silicon Valley. Precampaign photos of Wu show a shaggy-maned fellow who would not be out of place at \u201cBurning Man,\u201d where 60,000 or so people gather annually for a survivalist celebration of art and self-expression where no money is exchanged, \u201cIt\u2019s out of this world,\u201d said Wu, who has attended Burning Man several times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK \u2013 In the eyes of Tim Wu, there are two Kathy Hochuls: the pro-gun, anti-immigrant conservative who served as a Democratic member of Congress from Western New York, and the conservative who\u2019s masquerading as a progressive gun control advocate and champion of immigrants in hopes...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "NEW YORK \u2013 In the eyes of Tim Wu, there are two Kathy Hochuls: the pro-gun, anti-immigrant conservative who served as a Democratic member of Congress from Western New York, and the conservative who\u2019s masquerading as a progressive gun control advocate and champion of immigrants in hopes... - The Buffalo News", "title": "An upstate-downstate clash for lieutenant governor  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/an-upstate-downstate-clash-for-lieutenant-governor-20140906", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20140906/CITYANDREGION/140909239/AR/0/AR-140909239.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2201\"", "article_summary": "This is where I belong.\u201d In contrast, when asked if he saw the lieutenant governor as a partner with the governor, Wu said: \u201cNo, not really.\nSo the lieutenant governor could end up investigating the governor?\nYou might say these two very different candidates are duking it out in the race for lieutenant governor in New York State, but you would be wrong.\nAndrew M.
