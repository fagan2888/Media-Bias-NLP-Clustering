NEW YORK (MainStreet) Â— Eric Dickens smoked pot for the first time in high school when he was 17 years old. By the time he was 20 years old, he was smoking regularly. Now at 28 years old, the music promoter still uses cannabis.

"Marijuana is a drug, but it's not as bad as alcohol," Dickens told MainStreet. "People have been educated and realize that in comparison to other drugs, it's not as harmful."

Addiction experts beg to differ.

"We are increasingly concerned that regular or daily use of marijuana is robbing many young people of their potential to achieve and excel in school or other aspects of life," said Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). "We know from recent research that marijuana use that begins during adolescence can lower IQ and impair other measures of mental function into adulthood."

Experimenting with marijuana is nothing new but the pot today is not the same as during the Woodstock era.

"The potency of marijuana has dramatically increased," said Garth Laster, associate director with Ashcreek Ranch Academy in Toquerville, Utah, which caters to troubled teen boys. "In the 1990s the THC level was around 3%; in our day at least 15%."

Complicating potency is the money that's made from the sale of legal marijuana.

"Many people are unaware that the marijuana industry markets to create chronic users just like the tobacco industry so be mindful of these issues and talk to your kids so they can make educated choices if and when they arrive at legal age of use," said Joel Edwards, executive director with Morningside Recovery, an addiction rehab and mental health treatment center in Newport Beach, California.
