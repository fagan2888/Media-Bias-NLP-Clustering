Errors can violate taxpayer rights \u201cand result in improper disclosures of taxpayer information,\u201d according to the auditor.\n\nTIGTA\u2019s audit last year found that the IRS improperly withheld FOIA-requested information from taxpayers in 11.3 percent of the reviewed cases.\n\nIn addition, sensitive taxpayer information was inadvertently disclosed in 13 FOIA requests, or about 21 percent of the cases reviewed.\n\nThe 2014 audit came at a sensitive time for the IRS, which faced lawsuits from conservative watchdog groups due to the agency\u2019s failure to turn over emails and other information tied to the IRS scandal involving tax-exempt status for right-of-center groups.\n\nWhile the number of backlogged information request cases increased for a second straight year, TIGTA\u2019s most recent audit found that agency responses \u201cwere timely.\u201d\n\nThere are no timeframes under which the IRS must respond to taxpayers\u2019 Internal Revenue Code information requests, but the IRS has established guidelines of responding within 30 business days.\n\nTIGTA found that the IRS took more than 30 business days to respond in 24.5 percent of the information requests reviewed.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new audit shows that the IRS improperly withheld information from requesters under the Freedom of Information Act 12.3 percent of the time.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new audit shows that the IRS improperly withheld information from requesters under the Freedom of Information Act 12.3 percent of the time.", "title": "Audit: IRS Fails Transparency Test on Over 1 in 10 FOIA Requests", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150930_IRSFOIA_Kittle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KS4BJs"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new audit shows that the IRS improperly withheld information from requesters under the Freedom of Information Act 12.3 percent of the time.", "title": "Audit: IRS Fails Transparency Test on Over 1 in 10 FOIA Requests", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150930_IRSFOIA_Kittle.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-10-08T16:39:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "irs,transparency,irs scandal,freedom of information act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99f6\"", "article_summary": "The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, the IRS\u2019 auditor, reviewed a statistically valid sample of 65 FOIA requests and found eight requests for which the tax collector improperly withheld information.\nTIGTA found that the IRS took more than 30 business days to respond in 24.5 percent of the information requests reviewed.\nIn addition, sensitive taxpayer information was inadvertently disclosed in 13 FOIA requests, or about 21 percent of the cases reviewed.\nTIGTA\u2019s audit last year found that the IRS improperly withheld FOIA-requested information from taxpayers in 11.3 percent of the reviewed cases.\nTIGTA also found that the IRS did not release 7.3 percent of the Internal Revenue Code information requests reviewed\u2014information that should have been open to the requester."}
