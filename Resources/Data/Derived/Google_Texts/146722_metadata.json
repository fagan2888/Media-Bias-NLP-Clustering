Analyst Denise Chai downgraded the stock to the lowest underperform rating, after being at the highest buy rating for the last 18 months. She cut her stock price target to $32, which is about 3% below current levels, from $45. Chai said she is worried that same-store sales could turn lower through year end, given a mixed product cycle, and that the company's continued reinvestment in the business is offsetting cost-cutting efforts. She also sees limited catalysts to boost valuation. \"We believe [Best Buy] will continue to increase capital return and perform well relative to the industry, but if [second-half comparable-store sales] are negative, as we forecast, shares and the multiple are at risk,\" Chai wrote in a note to clients.
