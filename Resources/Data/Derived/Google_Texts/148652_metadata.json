That\u2019ll help.\n\nOMG! Barack Obama just gave the internet to the enemies of freedom!!!!\n\nOr least that\u2019s what former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin tells me in her latest online outpouring.\n\nYup, the failed vice-presidential candidate and now Fox News shill and all-American reality TV star has been turning her forensic attention to detail on the decision by ICANN to develop a new governance model for the internet.\n\nNow I\u2019m prepared to bet you a whole super-sized moose burger with extra Freedom Fries on the side and a vat of that sugar-packed fizzy gloop that Palin loves so much that the former governor hadn\u2019t even heard of ICANN until someone told her about it.\n\n(I dare any interviewer who somehow gets past the minders to ask her what a domain name actually is!)\n\nJust in case she hasn\u2019t read her briefing notes, ICANN \u2013 the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \u2013 is the non-profit organization that\u2019s been in charge of handing out domain names and Web addresses for the entire Internet since 1998.\n\nOf course \u2013 as with so many politicians \u2013 lack of understanding isn\u2019t going to stop her making her views known or seeking to make political capital. (See Blood Libel as classic Palin-ite example of this in practice.)\n\nThis is not for everyone?\n\nWhat\u2019s top of Palin\u2019s outrage list this week is the thought that someone other than the United States will manage the internet, following the decision by the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to let its contract with ICANN to operate key domain-name functions expire in September 2015 and requiring the organization to develop a new global internet governance model.\n\nIn the current post-NSA, rest-of-the-world-paranoid-about-US-control-of-the-net climate, you might think that this is actually a sound political and diplomatic move to reassure allied nations around the world that the US government really does want clean up its act.\n\nIn fact, according to Palin, the reality is that this is all about Obama handing a new weapon to America\u2019s enemies:\n\n\u201c[This] is nothing more than a gift to authoritarian regimes who seek to stifle the freedom the Internet gives to voices around the world fighting for basic human rights. No amount of Obama/liberal media spin can justify this.\u201d\n\nNow i was kinda under the impression that the US government had been spying on its own citizens quite a bit and that Palin regarded this as authoritarian in the extreme, so I\u2019m a bit confused as to why letting Washington hold on to control would be such a good thing.\n\nNevertheless she goes on:\n\n\u201cEvidently relinquishing America\u2019s control of the Internet via our ICAAN control of domain names was what Obama meant when he led his adoring followers in those strange, kind of creepy chants of \u2018Yes We Can.\u2019\u201d\n\nOh that\u2019s most amusing. It\u2019s \u2018I can\u2019 v \u201cWe can\u2019, do you see? Gosh, that\u2019s biting satire at its best. Step aside, Tina Fey!\n\nPalin concludes her thesis:\n\n\u201cSurrendering our control of the Internet is a colossal foreign policy error with long term negative repercussions for freedom.\u201d\n\nYeah, cos it\u2019s just America\u2019s internet, isn\u2019t it Sarah?\n\nDear god, coming only weeks after Sir Tim Berners-Lee reminded us on the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web that \u201cThis is for everyone\u201d, this attention-seeking politico would be so much better advised to stick to convincing yet more financial backers that she\u2019d actually have the attention-span to run for President.\n\n(Will she, won\u2019t she? Here\u2019s the answer: no, she won\u2019t. Too much like hard work. But there\u2019s a lot of air time to be had in the meantime.)\n\nInstead we get her contribution to some hysterical overreaction to what is a remarkably simple decision.\n\nICANN has been under fire for years due to what many \u2013 the good guys included, former governor Palin \u2013 have felt was an unhealthily close relationship with the US government.\n\nPost-Snowden, that sentiment has been all the more vocally articulated. Everything has changed.\n\nNot just a US issue\n\nBy the way, too close a relationship with any government would be problematic. This isn\u2019t a US-only issue. But that\u2019s been factored in.\n\nICANN\u2019s contract with the NTIA to operate the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions dates back to 1999, but as ICANN CEO and President Fadi Chehad\u00e9 has emphasized this past week that the understanding has always been that the partnership would be temporary.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cThis is historic, because it marks a point of maturity in ICANN, the ICANN community and the global Internet community. The decision of the United States government to do this at this point is truly a triumph of the multi-stakeholder model.\u201d\n\nDespite the claims of the armageddon pedlars and political carpet-baggers, the ground rules for a new global governance model have been laid down:\n\nThe transition away from the NTIA contract must have \u201cbroad community support\u201d from Internet users, governments and companies.\n\nIt must \u201cmaintain the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet Domain Name System\u201d.\n\nIt must also be built on openness and transparency.\n\nCrucially the new governance structure must not be government-led or inter-government led \u2013 which I imagine is a pretty big downer for several forces in Brussels at the European Commission as they plot their own Euro-Internet.\n\nLawrence E. Strickling the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator, states explicitly:\n\n\u201cWe have been clear throughout this process that any transition plan must meet the conditions of supporting the multi-stakeholder process and protecting the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet. \u201cI have emphasized that we will not accept a proposal that replaces NTIA\u2019s role with a government-led or an inter-governmental solution. \u201cUntil the community comes together on a proposal that meets these conditions, we will continue to perform our current stewardship role.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Senator John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, recognizes the move as an important step towards global governance, noting that since ICANN\u2019s inception:\n\n\u201cThe US has been committed to transitioning management of the Internet\u2019s domain name system to an independent entity that reflects the broad diversity of the global Internet community.\u201d\n\nAnd now it\u2019s delivering on a long-term commitment \u2013 which is more than a half-term quitter governor from Alaska can boast of.\n\nVerdict\n\nLet\u2019s get real \u2013 there will be zero short-term impact on US business (or anyone\u2019s business) from this decision. In fact, more damage has been done to US business overseas by the Snowden revelations of what the US was up to with its snooping program.\n\nThis is just a long term plan that\u2019s coming to fruition at last because the changing nature of the internet and its global importance demands change.\n\nYes, the timing is undoubtedly politically opportune for the US despite protestations from Washington that this is unconnected with Mr Snowden and his antics.\n\nIt is a concession to the rest of the planet, but post-NSA, the US needs to be seen to be cleaning up its act online.\n\nFrom the point of view of the rest of the planet that former governor Palin can\u2019t see from her house \u2013 I know, I know, that was Tina Fey, but it\u2019s stuck \u2013 this is a good move by the US and one that should be applauded.\n\nTime to move on.\n\nAll eyes will now be on the ICANN meeting in Singapore next week \u2013 by which time the fickle tongue of Sarah Palin will no doubt have found some other soundbite to be up in arms about.\n\nYou betcha!", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Why we don't let Sarah Palin govern the internet.
