(All others: Keep Out!)\n\n\u201cPeople join Mensa for many reasons, and if this is your reason, go ahead and take the next step,\u201d states the American Mensa website. Only people with IQs in the 98th percentile or higher can participate in the service, dubbed \"Mensa Match,\" so if you don\u2019t know where you stand, the synergistic business partnership will be happy to provide a standardized test. Meanwhile, if you already hold memberships in both Match.com and Mensa, you will be able to pin a special \"Mensa badge\" to your online profile, signaling your interest in hooking up with someone who has an equally high and equally validated IQ score. Woohoo!\n\n\"Eighty percent of singles rate intelligence as one of the most important factors when looking for a partner, finally proving that brainpower is the ultimate aphrodisiac,\" Match.com President Amarnath Thombre told ABC News. One positive outcome to this partnership is everyone, including those without the mental credentials, may receive some bona fide scientific data about falling in love.\n\nRelationship Advice\n\nAccording to Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who serves as chief scientific adviser for Match.com \u2014 who'da thunk Match.com was so classy, am I right? \u2014 three specific traits are linked with long-term relationship happiness: positive illusion, empathy for the other person, and the ability to control your own emotions. In her special interview with American Mensa, she describes the study in which she found and verified these specific traits. \u201cWe put people into the brain scanner in China and then we went back, four years later, to find out who was still in love,\u201d she said. By using questionnaires and an fMRI, she and her research partners noted how in-love romantics showed greater activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region linked with positive illusions (focusing on the good and ignoring anything you dislike about your partner); the mirror neurons, a brain region linked with empathy; and several brain regions linked with the ability to control emotion.\n\nYet, she also has found, \u201cwhen you fall in love with somebody, brain regions labeled \u2018decision making\u2019 begin to shut down,\u201d and this is the reason, she suggests, people may fall in love with what your ordinary self might label the wrong person: the married guy, say, or the pregnant woman living with her boyfriend. She draws her conclusions about the lovelorn from her annual study, \u201cSingles in America.\u201d\n\nHowever, what surprised her most were the answers she received to the ageless question, \u201cWhat do you judge a person by?\u201d She provided a lot of boxes for people to check, including a person\u2019s hair, the car they drive, the technology they use, and then encouraged them to respond with their true, \u201cright off the bat\u201d appraisal of someone new. \u201cBoth years, a huge number of both men and women [noted they] judge somebody, foremost, by their teeth and their grammar,\u201d she said.
