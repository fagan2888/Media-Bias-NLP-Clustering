Graham said her husband, a lawyer working for state law enforcement, has influenced her support of gun ownership rights.\n\nBLUE DOG BATTLEGROUND\n\nGraham spent much of her childhood in the district while her father served in the state capital in Tallahassee. She still lives in the district's liberal anchor, packed with college students and black voters.\n\nThe 14-county district stretches west to Panama City, a conservative stronghold along a stretch of oceanfront some call the Redneck Riviera.\n\nThe small towns in between should decide the race, experts say. This is where Graham must win back so-called blue dog Democrats - white southern voters who now favor conservatives.\n\nHer father did well with the group, which his supporters dubbed \"Graham Crackers,\" said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee.\n\n\"Gwen Graham is trying to resurrect that coalition among liberal Democrats and conservative blue dog Democrats, but the question is, Can she do it?\" he said. \"I think it's an uphill battle.\"\n\nBoth national parties already are airing political ads in a district that has been trending Republican in national races, but where voters continue to support some moderate Democrats.\n\nSoutherland's campaign is highlighting Graham's ties to President Barack Obama and fellow Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, both of whom are unpopular in the district.\n\nAn attack ad launched this month by National Republican Congressional Committee, which reserved $900,000 for the race, took up that theme.\n\n\"We recognize Senator Graham's record, but this race is not about Bob Graham,\" said Southerland spokesman Matt McCullough. \"Steve has got a record of fighting for this district.\"\n\nYet Bob Graham, 77, who plans to temporarily relocate to north Florida to support his daughter, is hard to ignore on the campaign trail.\n\nHis daughter has revived his trademark workdays, toiling along typical residents at a barbershop, a food truck and a goat farm.\n\nOn the campaign trail earlier this month, father and daughter shared a canoe down the Apalachicola River, with Gwen Graham steering in the back.\n\nThe next day, the extended Graham family passed out white balloons in the Wausau Possum Festival parade. At the event's colorful auction, Gwen Graham followed a local political tradition of holding up a prized possum on the stage.\n\nDuring the eight-day \"Grilling with the Grahams\" campaign tour, her father dished barbecue and mingled with voters in different towns.\n\n\"I happen to have the best role model in my father,\" Gwen Graham said. \"He is really, really proud to see me running.\" (Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: GOP Women In Congress GOP Women In Congress\n\n1 of 23 Sen.
