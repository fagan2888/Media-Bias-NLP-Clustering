Former Family Circle Cup champion Jelena Jankovic, who was the 9th seed in this year's renamed Volvo Car Open, had to withdraw on Sunday due to a right shoulder injury.

"I'm very disappointed that I had to withdraw from this event." Jankovic said in a statement. "It is one of my favorite events on the tour. I really tried my best to recover and be ready to play, but unfortunately I still need more time to do the rehabilitation. I look forward to hopefully coming next year and being healthy. Hopefully in a week, I can start hitting balls. It's still too fresh and too risky at the moment to be playing at a high level. And if I'm going to go on court, I'm going to play 100% and I want to show my best. Under this condition, I can not do that so I'm really disappointed. I'm sad that I won't be able to play in front of so many fans that I have here."

Since she withdrew prior to a schedule being released, her position in the draw is taken by the 13th seed, Irina-Camelia Begu. The next player to be seeded, Eugenie Bouchard, will take the vacated 13th seed position and a qualifier or lucky loser takes the position created by this move.

Petra Cetkovska has also withdrawn with a right thigh injury, but as she is not seeded her position will be filled by a qualifier or lucky loser.
