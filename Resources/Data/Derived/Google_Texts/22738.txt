Even liberal comedian Jon Stewart doesn’t buy President Barack Obama’s attempts to backtrack on his ‘if you like your insurance, you can keep it’ promise, calling his signature healthcare law the “Affordable Horror Story.”

On his show Tuesday night, Stewart played clips of Obama’s repeated guarantee while he campaigned for the Affordable Care Act. The host mocked the president for pronouncing the punctuation — “period” — in his speeches and asked if he wanted to clarify those remarks.

“Want to add any caveats to that?” Stewart asked. “Because it sounds kind of definitive.”

Stewart then played part of the president’s speech earlier this week, during which he attempted to claim he always said you could keep your health care only if the insurance company didn’t change it.

“No, no, no, no, no, no,” Stewart protested. “What you said was, ‘You can keep it, period.’ Now what you said there was more like, ‘You can keep your healthcare plan ellipses, comma, because it may no longer meet the minimum requirements or your insurance company might stop offering individual plans or some other odd bureaucratic unintended offshoot, period, emoticon denoting a combination of embarrassment and arrogance.'”

Despite calling out the president for lying, Stewart also went on to criticize Obama’s opponents for claiming that Obamacare is worse than it actually is.
