Vice President Joseph R. Biden filled in for President Obama this week for the White House’s weekly radio address, touting Obamacare in an effort to convince customers to sign up for health insurance just weeks before the enrollment deadline.

“I know this is the time of year when we make resolutions to take care of our health. Whether it’s joining a gym, or eating healthier. But there’s one thing you can do right now that will also make a big difference in your health, that is getting quality, affordable health insurance through the affordable care act,” Mr. Biden said.

He touted increasing enrollment numbers, low cost, and medicare benefits under the affordable care act before imploring new members to sign up now.

“Everyone is beginning to realize what millions of you already know. The affordable care act is working. And we’re just getting started because there are millions more of you who can get quality and affordable health insurance if you sign up before February 15 of this year.”

The health care focused weekly address comes just after the employer healthcare mandate took effect on New Year’s Day.

Companies with more than 100 full-time workers must offer affordable health insurance to at least 70 percent of their staff or face a hefty penalty tax.

The employer mandate was supposed to take effect in 2014, but the Obama administration delayed it until this year.

The fine for companies that do not comply with the mandate is $174 a month times the number of full-time employees, minus 80 workers.

If a company offers insurance that is not considered affordable or comprehensive then the employer must pay $261 a month for each employee who received subsidized coverage on an individual exchange, CNN Money reported Friday.
