At the very least, you\u2019d take down the plagiarized material after being busted for plagiarism two weeks ago.\n\nSo, your new health care plan would be original, since you are running on how much you know about health care. You certainly wouldn\u2019t steal your health care plan from a primary opponent, whom you had criticized for being a JD not an MD. Someone you had accused of having \u201cno credibility on this very important issue.\u201d\n\nYou also would not steal some more from Karl Rove, even if tempted because he\u2019s been on such a fail streak for the last few years and you love to ride the coattails of losers.\n\nThat is, unless you were a Republican pediatric neurosurgeon named Monica Wehby running on obstinacy and obstruction as the Republican Senate candidate in Oregon, in which case, plagiarism may be sort of a plus.\n\nAndrew Kaczynski found the second round of plagiarism and wrote about it for BuzzFeed:\n\nThe Oregon Senate candidate\u2019s first health care plan copied from a Karl Rove survey; her new plan includes copied sections from her primary opponent. She\u2019s a doctor\u2026 The Oregon Republican Senate candidate plagiarized her health care plan, again. In a weird twist, Monica Wehby\u2019s new health care is also plagiarized \u2014 but even stranger, it\u2019s plagiarized from her primary opponent Oregon Rep. Jason Conger, whom she criticized repeatedly during the primary on health care.\n\nWehby goes on to prove that getting an MD doesn\u2019t mean a person can understand policy any more than getting a JD means a person should be tossed into the operating room to do brain surgery on a 12 year old child \u2014 especially not after being brainwashed by science deniers. It is equally horrifying to see people who do not even follow or understand the law running to write the laws. (Plagiarism is the theft of intellectual property.)\n\nThere are actually things to know when legislating. Like, how to read a bill. How to comprehend a bill. How to put a bill or law in context. Hint: Know some facts, know some history, be unwilling to make up your own just because you love Karl Rove.\n\nIn an op-ed for Register Guard , BuzzFeed notes Wehby wrote (er, plagiarized):\n\nIt would start with two main goals: make real the guarantee that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan \u2014 in short, keep the promise that Merkley and Obama made and broke.\n\nFor the love of God, will someone explain to Republicans and the media that the reason the plans were no good anymore is because they were not good enough to meet the new standards under Obamacare? If you liked that old less than the current plan so much, it\u2019s possible that you might have brain damage, in which case, Monica Wehby \u2018s credentials say she is qualified to help you.\n\nShe just can\u2019t help herself. But then, that was suggested earlier when Wehby was accused of stalking her ex boyfriend and entering his home without permission and harassing his employees. Her ex was contemplating getting a protection order against her, so plagiarizing is sort of a meh incident. Luckily for her, he\u2019s big into Republican politics, so he\u2019s keeping his mouth zipped.\n\nAren\u2019t these the sort of qualifications we want in the Senate? Thanks, GOP. Luckily for the country, polls have her trailing her Democratic opponent, Jeff Merkley.\n\nShe is, however, yet another example of why the Republican Party can\u2019t be trusted in positions of great importance like the Senate, let alone the White House. Wehby is but one in a continuing trend of conspiracy-oriented, reality-challenged candidates the GOP is attracting. This is what happens when you will take anyone who is willing to sell your lies. Eventually you end up with a party full of con artists and unstable true believers.\n\nA double plagiarizing neurosurgeon running on health care that she steals from people she has criticized as being clueless about health care.
