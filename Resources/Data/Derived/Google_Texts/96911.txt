Thomas Aquinas College officials said Monday they are looking forward to discussing options for birth control coverage that honor their religious beliefs and allow the government to accomplish its goals.

The federal Affordable Care Act requires employers to offer health insurance that covers birth control services, including contraception, sterilization and medications such as the "morning after" pill.

The small Catholic college in Santa Paula, along with other plaintiffs, has filed a suit that went to the Supreme Court, saying they should not have to offer birth control coverage because it violates their religious beliefs.

On Monday, the Supreme Court returned the suit to the lower court of appeals, taking no position on the case. Instead, the court asked the two sides to continue pursuing a solution that would be less restrictive but meet the government's mandate.

"We're looking to see if both ends can be achieved, and it looks very possible for us," said Thomas Aquinas College spokeswoman Anne Forsyth.
