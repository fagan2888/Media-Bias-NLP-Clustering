A core mutual fund. Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar\u2019s eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.\n\nThere are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.\n\nValue investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks\u2019 potential.\n\nGrowth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth. The ability to grab market share or expand new markets is a hallmark of these stocks. They often have higher than average P-E and price-book values as growth investors tend to be willing to pay up for companies able to achieve rapid growth.\n\nJohn Hancock Large Cap Equity has both types of stocks in its recent top holdings. Sandy Sanders and Walter McCormick have managed the $3.7 billion fund since 2011 and Jonathan White since March this year.\n\nFacebook (FB) has grown earnings at a 70% annual pace for the past three years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that its earnings will climb 18% this year and 33% next year. By comparison, the S&P 500\u2019s EPS growth is expected to be -1.03% for 2015 and 8.90% for 2016, notes Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ.\n\nThe stock has climbed 24% this year, near an all-time high, and is trading at about 51 times trailing 12-month earnings or three times the level of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market.\n\nOracle (ORCL) used to be a growth stock, but its annual earnings growth pace has been a subdued 3% the past three years and 9% the past five years. Its stock is 21% off its 52-week high and is trading at 14 times earnings, or about 20% less than the S&P 500\u2019s P-E. Earnings of the developer of database systems are seen falling 5% this year fiscal year, which ends in May, but rising 10% next year. It\u2019s got a dividend growth rate of 28% and a dividend yield of 1.6%.\n\nJohn Hancock Large Cap Equity is a top-performing core fund, having risen an average annual 10.6% the past 10 years vs. 7.86% for the S&P 500. This year, the fund has handed investors a 4% gain vs. the broad stock market index\u2019s 0.27% gain.\n\nThe average core fund tracked by Morningstar rose an average annual 9.05% the past 10 years but is down 2% this year.\n\nFollow Doug Rogers on Twitter: @IBD_DRogers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Take some growth stocks, put them in with some value stocks, and what do you get?
