This day alone accounted for the majority of Amarin's 37% monthly gain. The new data from the ANCHOR and MARINE trials showed that using Vascepa capsules significantly reduced remnant-like particle cholesterol levels in patients with triglyceride levels in excess of, or equal to, 200 mg/dL and 500 mg/dL. This also included patients that had received statin therapy. This is a solid finding considering that remnant-like particle cholesterol is one of many factors attributed to higher cardiovascular health risks.\n\nIn addition to Amarin's new data release, the company's third-quarter earnings results, while missing the mark slightly in terms of net loss, demonstrated a significant reduction in cash outflow from the year-ago period ($19.9 million versus $44.8 million), and highlighted 12% sales growth in Vascepa, which is currently approved to treat patients with high triglyceride levels equal to or in excess of 500 mg/dL.\n\nNow what: Amarin shareholders haven't witnessed very many good months lately, and I'm still not convinced they'll see many more. Having the Food and Drug Administration require a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study (the REDUCE-IT trial) before it'll consider expanding Vascepa's usage to patients in the much larger 200 mg/dL to 499 mg/dL triglyceride level category pretty much dooms Amarin to ongoing losses for at least the next three years until the data is available in 2018. The end result I suspect is going to be Amarin seeking financing sooner rather than later, even with aggressive cost-cutting.\n\nThe concern here is that even if Vascepa gets its label expanded by 2018 or 2019, the market for cardiovascular risk-mitigating products might look wholly different. If anything I'd expect it to be far more competitive. With each passing day the window of opportunity closes a bit more for Amarin, and given that I'd suggest keeping a very safe distance away from this stock.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:14", "date": "2014-12-01T19:14:00Z", "description": "Amarin shares rocket higher in November after the company released exciting new data on Vascepa.
