Lauren has a rare disease called Rett syndrome, which limits the ability of her muscles to function properly. ( Courtesy: Brady Family )\n\nLauren Brady, a Whittier resident, has lived all her 19 years with Rett syndrome, a rare neurological illness that can cause seizures and limits muscle movement. She can\u2019t speak, needs a feeding tube and uses a wheelchair to get around.\n\n\u201cIt affects her from head to toe, but we don\u2019t let all of that get in our way,\u201d her mother, Sherri Brady said this week. \u201cLauren has lots of friends; she goes horseback riding. Next weekend she\u2019s going on a ski trip.\u201d\n\nThat Lauren can even contemplate those activities is testimony to a $2.9 billion a year state program, California Children\u2019s Services, her mother said. The program provides specialized care to some 180,000 children and young adults who suffer from a range of complicated, debilitating illnesses including Rett syndrome, sickle cell anemia, cancer, cerebral palsy, hemophilia and more.\n\nIn recent years, Sherri Brady and other parents of children in the program have lived in fear that the care of their kids could be disrupted \u2014 at what they see as a great risk of physical and emotional harm. That\u2019s because the state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services ultimately wants to move all the children into managed care.\n\nBut the first phase of that move, which would have targeted just under one-fifth of the children beginning next January, is now on hold. The state Assembly\u2019s influential budget subcommittee voted earlier this week to shelve it and send the department back to the drawing board. The Senate\u2019s budget subcommittee is expected to endorse that ruling next week.\n\nThis means all of those children will be able to keep seeing the same providers and get the same services they\u2019ve been receiving \u2014 at least for now.\n\nThat\u2019s a big relief to their parents, who fear that in managed care their children could lose relationships with the caregivers who know them best and could face difficulty getting appointments with specialists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that the legislators did this,\u201d said Sherri Brady. But she knows her battle isn\u2019t over.\n\nThe state has been under pressure for years to restructure the program both to improve the care it delivers and reduce its cost, according to a study by the California Health Care Foundation.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of it,\u201d Brady said. We\u2019ve been fighting it and we\u2019ll keep fighting it.\u201d\n\nBrady has trouble understanding why the state wants to move the kids into managed care. \u201cTo make a change that could be harmful for individuals who already live with such harm, that\u2019s just not right,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer Kent, director of the California Department of Health Care Services, testified to the Assembly subcommittee that the first-phase proposal to move nearly 20 percent of the the kids into managed care plans would provide them with better care.\n\n\u201cOne of the key components is because (California Children\u2019s Services) is a program around a condition rather than a child, the different payers don\u2019t look at the whole child,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe want to better manage the care of these children across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nUnder managed care, health plans are paid fixed rates to cover and coordinate nearly all health care services for patients.\n\nKent told legislators the department\u2019s plan was \u201cbudget-neutral,\u201d meaning it would result neither in savings nor additional costs for taxpayers.\n\nNearly half the cost of the program, or about $1.4 billion, is paid for out of the state\u2019s general fund, according to Kent\u2019s department.\n\nAbout 70 percent of children in the program get benefits from Medi-Cal, the state-federal health coverage program for people with low incomes. The other 30 percent have private insurance, but the state helps pay for some of the care not covered by their insurers. The federal and county governments also pick up a portion of the tab.\n\nAssuming the Senate subcommittee concurs with its Assembly counterpart, the health department will be instructed to develop a new proposal requiring what is known in Capitol lingo as \u201cenabling legislation,\u201d and ultimately floor votes in both houses. The process is expected to take a long time, though nobody can say how long.\n\nChild advocates fear that the ultimate outcome will be the same \u2014 the kids will end up being moved into managed care.\n\n\u201cThe assumption has always been that the state wants to move all of the kids,\u201d said Yvette Baptiste, executive director of the Eastern Los Angeles Family Resource Center in Alhambra, which helps children with developmental disabilities and their families.\n\nBefore the Assembly subcommittee voted, its staff had recommended rejecting the department\u2019s plan out of concern that the children\u2019s quality of care could be compromised.\n\nThe Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office agreed, as did a conga line of children\u2019s advocates, providers and families, who all appeared at the hearing to urge the legislature to scrub the proposal from the calendar.\n\nCalifornia Children\u2019s Services, established in 1927, is one of the oldest public health programs in the nation.\n\nThe subcommittee chairman, Tony Thurmond, D-Richmond, said that given the program\u2019s longevity and the apparent satisfaction of the children\u2019s families, he didn\u2019t want to change it.\n\n\u201cIf this is one of the oldest programs around and it\u2019s something we can hold up as a shining example of how to do things right, then let\u2019s not mess with it,\u201d Thurmond said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was music to the ears of Lisa Finnie and her 14-year-old son Jaheen of Brentwood, 45 miles east of Oakland. Jaheen struggles with a rare medical condition that sometimes causes brain fluid to leak from his skull.\n\nSince he was 3, Jaheen has had six surgeries and survived seven bouts of life-threatening meningitis caused by the defect. He has had periods of blindness, and at one point was in a coma for a month.\n\nBut right now, Jaheen can see just fine. His only outward signs of the condition are faulty hearing and a face that droops a bit on one side.\n\n\u201cI kind of smile on one side right now,\u201d Jaheen explained. \u201cI\u2019m learning how to get this side of my face up,\u201d he said, touching his left cheek.\n\nHis mom Lisa credits the Children\u2019s Services program with helping her family survive and thrive, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Emelyn Lacayo of Hayward, the mother of a seven-year-old daughter, Mia, who has cerebral palsy, bone deformities and is also believed to suffer from a rare condition called Cockayne syndrome.\n\n\u201cThe doctors thought she wouldn\u2019t live past a year, but she\u2019s almost 8 now,\u201d Lacayo said.\n\nA possible transition into managed care worries Lacayo, because Mia might lose one of her key specialists.\n\n\u201cOur biggest fear is that Mia would fall through the cracks,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw us into managed care. These are kids who need the specialty care.\u201d\n\nLacayo says the state has long wanted to replace this high-need, high-cost program, and she was heartened when the subcommittee applied the brakes to the plan that would have started to do that. But she understands the fight has only been put off for another day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re okay for now, but we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThe moral of the story is, these kids are expensive, yes \u2014 but they need that care,\u201d Lacayo said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t choose to have these conditions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents are worried the care of their kids would be disrupted \u2014 at what they see as a great risk of physical and emotional harm.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"State Won't Move Fragile Kids to Managed Care -- For Now\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/17\\/state-wont-move-fragile-kids-to-managed-care-for-now\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-17 11:26:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-17 11:26:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":161038,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/fragile-kids_brady_770.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Parents are worried  the care of their kids would be disrupted \u2014 at what they see as a great risk of physical and emotional harm.", "title": "State Won\u2019t Move Fragile Kids to Managed Care \u2014 For Now", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/17/state-wont-move-fragile-kids-to-managed-care-for-now/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/fragile-kids_mia_370.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,medi-cal,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services ultimately wants to move all the children into managed care.\n\u201cWe want to better manage the care of these children across the spectrum.\u201dUnder managed care, health plans are paid fixed rates to cover and coordinate nearly all health care services for patients.\nWe\u2019ve been fighting it and we\u2019ll keep fighting it.\u201dBrady has trouble understanding why the state wants to move the kids into managed care.\nChild advocates fear that the ultimate outcome will be the same \u2014 the kids will end up being moved into managed care.\nA possible transition into managed care worries Lacayo, because Mia might lose one of her key specialists."}
