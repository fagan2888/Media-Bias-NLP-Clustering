A former researcher from Cambridge University, Ivan Petyaev, invented a new type of dark chocolate in a UK-based laboratory that goes beyond the average touted heart-health benefits and ups the ante by promising younger, healthier skin unlike any other natural source.\n\nJust one 7.5-gram piece of the seemingly magic chocolate packs in more antioxidants than 100 grams of regular dark chocolate and 300 grams of Alaskan salmon. During clinical trials, 50- to 60-year-old participants ate a piece a day of the 70 percent dark chocolate \u201cEsthechoc\u201d and watched it boost blood supply and reduce inflammation to the skin within four weeks \u2014 resulting in healthier skin. Sugar levels are low enough for it to be safe for diabetics, and each piece of edible goodness adds up to only 38 calories, making it a safe choice for moderate consumption.\n\n\"In terms of skin biomarkers, we found it had brought skin back to the levels of a 20- or 30-year-old,\" Petyaev, who invented the chocolate at Lycotec, told The Telegraph. \"So we\u2019ve improved the skin\u2019s physiology. People using it claimed that their skin was better, and we can see that the product is working to slow down aging.\"\n\nThe newly invented skin-tightening chocolate treat will be revealed to food industry leaders at the Global Food Innovation Summit in London next month. Two patents for the recipe have been granted in the United States and European Union, and three additional patent applications are pending in 35 countries. It\u2019s about to take over the industry, but it isn\u2019t likely chocolate candy bars will be a threat to their profit margin. They\u2019ll be competing with the skin care giants, providing a delicious option to a smoother, glowing complexion. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the beauty market, at beauty spas and salons,\u201d Petyaev said.\n\nExample of Esthechoco packaging for consumers.

Polyphenols are special antioxidants, which lower the risk of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases, and certain types of cancer, and are found in fruits, vegetables, teas, wine, cocoa, and other naturally occurring plants.\n\nThey infused the antioxidant, astaxanthin, which is what keeps goldfish gold and flamingos pink, according to Petyaev. Its unique approach to skincare will attract initial buyers with wrinkles and a sweet tooth, but only long-term results will be able to keep the product line afloat. Packages will be sent with a daily piece individually wrapped in a three-week supply, and the price tag is almost guaranteed to be higher than your average chocolatey treat. Dermatologists warn consumers to purchase with caution when approaching a beauty bar or find a product that seems too good to be true.\n\n\u201cThere is a potentially sound scientific base to this although it is obviously early days,\u201d Nutritionist Dr. George Grimble from the University College London, told The Telegraph. \u201cThere needs to be further clinical trials to show that it is safe, but astaxanthin has been shown to have antioxidant effects and low toxicity, so from that respect it seems promising. Using dark chocolate is quite clever. As a nutritionist, I am generally in favor of dark chocolate. So it\u2019s got a good track record in terms of the science, but it is too early to say what the long-term benefits might be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chocolatier, scientists, amplify, skin, tightening, benefits, dark, chocolate, new", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Younger skin with a daily dose of a new chocolate invention may be the new beauty craze.", "title": "Newly-Invented Dark Chocolate Could Make You Look Younger", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chocolatier-scientists-amplify-skin-tightening-benefits-dark-chocolate-new-323280", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/chocolate-your-skin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Younger skin with a daily dose of a new chocolate invention may be the new beauty craze.", "title": "Newly-Invented Dark Chocolate Could Make You Look Younger", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chocolatier-scientists-amplify-skin-tightening-benefits-dark-chocolate-new-323280", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/chocolate-your-skin.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/chocolate-your-skin.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-23T17:37:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-23T17:37:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Younger skin with a daily dose of a new chocolate invention may be the new beauty craze."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0772\"", "article_summary": "Just one 7.5-gram piece of the seemingly magic chocolate packs in more antioxidants than 100 grams of regular dark chocolate and 300 grams of Alaskan salmon.\nAs a nutritionist, I am generally in favor of dark chocolate.\nUsing dark chocolate is quite clever.\n\"In terms of skin biomarkers, we found it had brought skin back to the levels of a 20- or 30-year-old,\" Petyaev, who invented the chocolate at Lycotec, told The Telegraph.\nThe newly invented skin-tightening chocolate treat will be revealed to food industry leaders at the Global Food Innovation Summit in London next month."}
