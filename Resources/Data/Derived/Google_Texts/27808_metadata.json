On Dec. 16, 2008, three months after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the Fed slashed its rate on overnight loans to banks to between 0 and 0.25 percent \u2014 the first time it had dropped the rate below 1 percent.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,\u201d the official statement from the Federal Open Market Committee said at the time. \u201cIn particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 3 Biggest Winners from the Fed\u2019s Rate Hike\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n\u201cFor some time\u201d was right. As in indication of just how long it\u2019s been, consider this, from Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group:\n\n\u201cThe last time the Fed embarked on a rate hike cycle in June 2004, Hoobastank\u2019s song \u2018The Reason\u2019 was #1 on Billboard\u2019s chart. \u2018Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u2019 premiered in the theaters. \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 was more than halfway through its run and \u2018Friends\u2019 ran its final episode. The Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship that month with Chauncey Billups as the MVP. Ronald Reagan passed away. Ken Jennings also started his 74-game winning streak on the game show \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, after seven years \u2014 and after buying trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds and mortgage-backed securities to help stimulate the economy and support the housing market \u2014 the Fed has finally decided it\u2019s time for those \u201cexceptionally low\u201d interest rates to rise. The era of easy money stimulus is over.\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nRates remain at historically low levels and Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep rates below where they might normally be for an extended period of time. They did so again in their statement Wednesday. \u201cThe Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,\u201d the statement said.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s the Fed Rate Hike Means for Your Money\n\nFed officials\u2019 new forecasts for interest rates at the end of 2016 stayed at 1.4 percent, the same as they were in September, implying four more quarter-point increases next year \u2014 but the median estimate for 2017 dropped to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent and the outlook for 2018 fell to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent.\n\nThat path forward may not be as smooth as the projections suggest.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the risk that things go wrong is greater than things going well,\u201d BNP Paribas economists noted yesterday. They see only a 30-percent chance that the Fed \u201cpulls off the perfect tightening cycle,\u201d one in which economic growth steadily accelerates without a spike in inflation above the Fed\u2019s targeted 2-percent annual rate.\n\nOne and Done?\n\nThe BNP team ascribes higher odds, 45 percent, to a \u201cswing and a miss\u201d scenario, in which the economy either struggles, leaving the Fed no room to continue raising rates, or inflation rises, forcing the central bankers to hike rates faster than they\u2019ve signaled. And the economists place 25-percent odds on a \u201crun for the hills\u201d scenario, in which the economy slumps even as inflation rises.\n\nRelated: 10 Things That Will Cost More in 2016\n\n\u201cWe see the risks to the outlook as tilted toward a near-term hiccup, which forces the Fed to pause its normalization plans or perhaps even reverse course,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBoockvar sounded a similar note: \u201cI still think we\u2019ve just seen the only rate hike we\u2019ll get in this recovery and the next one won\u2019t come until during the expansion after the next recession.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last time the Fed stuck to a promise to take it easy \u2014 the \u2018measured\u2019 pace of tightening in 2004-to-06, it ended badly,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote to clients, \u201cand we have no confidence that the serene glide path for the economy envisaged by the Fed and, especially, the markets, will be achieved this time either.\u201d\n\nIf or when the economy does swing back into recession, the downturn might still signal how far we\u2019ve come since 2008. \u201cThis tightening, like that one, will end in recession eventually,\u201d Shepherdson wrote this week, \u201cbut this time around we expect a garden-variety business cycle downturn rather than a massive financial crash and a near-death experience for global capitalism. Extraordinary meltdowns require extraordinary economic imbalances, but the finances of banks, businesses and households are all now in much better shape than in 2007, when the strains in the markets leading to the crash of 2008 first began to appear.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years, that counts as progress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "That path forward may not be as smooth as Fed officials' projections suggest.", "title": "The Fed Raises Interest Rates: What Could Go Wrong", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/16/Fed-Raises-Interest-Rates-What-Could-Go-Wrong", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11192012_money_stack_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/16/Fed-Raises-Interest-Rates-What-Could-Go-Wrong", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11192012_money_stack_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "That path forward may not be as smooth as Fed officials' projections suggest.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rates remain at historically low levels and Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep rates below where they might normally be for an extended period of time.\n\u201cIn our view, the risk that things go wrong is greater than things going well,\u201d BNP Paribas economists noted yesterday.\nThe BNP team ascribes higher odds, 45 percent, to a \u201cswing and a miss\u201d scenario, in which the economy either struggles, leaving the Fed no room to continue raising rates, or inflation rises, forcing the central bankers to hike rates faster than they\u2019ve signaled.\nAs in indication of just how long it\u2019s been, consider this, from Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group:\u201cThe last time the Fed embarked on a rate hike cycle in June 2004, Hoobastank\u2019s song \u2018The Reason\u2019 was #1 on Billboard\u2019s chart.\nAnd the economists place 25-percent odds on a \u201crun for the hills\u201d scenario, in which the economy slumps even as inflation rises."}
