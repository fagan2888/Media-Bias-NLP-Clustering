UnitedHealthcare cites disappointing Obamacare enrollment numbers and flexibility within the ACA giving individuals the ability to easily switch insurers as factors contributing to its dismal financial projections. According to USA Today, the announced withdrawal of this large health insurer \u201cdealt a major blow to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare is a major broker in Colorado\u2019s health insurance system, offering plans both in and out of the Obamacare exchange. But recent developments with the state\u2019s biggest Obamacare provider, Colorado HealthOP, may force UnitedHealthcare to make an earlier-than-planned exit.\n\nIn October, state regulators shut down Colorado HealthOP due to cash shortfalls, but it was expected at that time that all claims would be paid through the end of 2015. The cooperative would reportedly continue to pay claims for 83,000 customers despite the failure of the federal government to reimburse them. Insurance brokers in Colorado, such as UnitedHealthcare, helped recruit many who signed up with HealthOP for their medical coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is a key function of the Division of Insurance to make sure that insurance carriers are financially stable enough to pay the claims of their policyholders,\u201d state Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar said in a statement. \u201cWhile Colorado HealthOP can continue to pay claims for the rest of 2015, we cannot allow it to sell or renew policies on the exchange for 2016.\u201d\n\nBut approximately six weeks before year\u2019s end, on the same day that UnitedHealthcare announced its potential pull-out, The Denver Post reported that brokers participating in HealthOP would not receive payments for the remainder of the year. The stoppage of payments through the end of the year may lead to a loss of $2 million, according to the Post\u2014 never to be recovered by the participating brokers. It appears that since the closure of HealthOP was divulged last month, many members simply stopped paying their premiums while others rushed to obtain medical treatment before their insurance expires at the end of the year.\n\nAlthough Colorado\u2019s umbrella Obamacare system, Connect for Health Colorado, has 10 other insurance providers which will remain in the marketplace during 2016, the number of failing Obamacare insurance plans is mounting. As of Oct. 16, one-third of co-ops and insurance plans created under the ACA plan to fold by the end of the year. 50 percent of Obamacare co-ops are suffering serious financial losses.\n\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of President Obama\u2019s latest attempt to boost ACA enrollments in 20 selective cities with high uninsured populations. One of those cities is Denver. The city with the highest number of enrollments by the Dec. 15 deadline will receive a visit from the president.\n\nIf UnitedHealth retreats from Obamacare\u2019s state exchanges, 540,000 Americans will possibly be forced to find another ACA provider.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "UnitedHealthcare's unexpected announcement that it may have to abandon state Obamacare exchanges could be expedited in Colorado.", "title": "Will Colorado HealthOP's collapse cause earlier exit of UnitedHealthcare? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/shutterstock_256194577.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/248379/unitedhealthcare-obamacare-colorado/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Colorado HealthOP,ObamaCare,UnitedHealthcare", "published_time": "2015-11-20T10:26:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "UnitedHealthcare's unexpected announcement that it may have to abandon state Obamacare exchanges could be expedited in Colorado.", "title": "Will Colorado HealthOP's collapse cause earlier exit of UnitedHealthcare? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/shutterstock_256194577.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "UnitedHealthcare's unexpected announcement that it may have to abandon state Obamacare exchanges could be expedited in Colorado."}, "article_summary": "But recent developments with the state\u2019s biggest Obamacare provider, Colorado HealthOP, may force UnitedHealthcare to make an earlier-than-planned exit.\nInsurance brokers in Colorado, such as UnitedHealthcare, helped recruit many who signed up with HealthOP for their medical coverage.\nAlthough Colorado\u2019s umbrella Obamacare system, Connect for Health Colorado, has 10 other insurance providers which will remain in the marketplace during 2016, the number of failing Obamacare insurance plans is mounting.\nIn October, state regulators shut down Colorado HealthOP due to cash shortfalls, but it was expected at that time that all claims would be paid through the end of 2015.\nUnitedHealthcare cites disappointing Obamacare enrollment numbers and flexibility within the ACA giving individuals the ability to easily switch insurers as factors contributing to its dismal financial projections."}
