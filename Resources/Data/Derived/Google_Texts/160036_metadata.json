From Martin, Mr. Woolfenden said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see any response,\u201d but he saw the boy\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI saw his hair had been singed,\u201d Mr. Woolfenden told the jury, haltingly, as he choked back tears. \u201cI saw that his eyes were rolled in the back of his head and his mouth was agape.\u201d And he saw \u201can immense amount of blood.\u201d\n\nClosing its case in the penalty phase of the trial, the government left the jury an image that has come to define the heinousness of the bombings: the killing of a little boy. The jury convicted Mr. Tsarnaev on April 8 of all 30 counts against him in connection with the 2013 bombings, which killed three people and injured 264. It also convicted him of killing an M.I.T. police officer. Now the same jury, is weighing whether to sentence Mr. Tsarnaev, 21, to death or to life in prison.\n\nPushing for death, the government called 17 witnesses over three days as it sought to convey the magnitude of Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s crimes. Prosecutors called on wounded survivors and relatives of the dead as they painted portraits of lasting devastation and the pain at the center of so many lives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe survivors included Marc Fucarile, 36, who wheeled himself to the witness stand on Thursday. He has lost one leg and may still lose the other, which has not healed properly. His body remains riddled with BBs and shrapnel, a piece of which is lodged in the right atrium of his heart. He has endured more than 60 surgical procedures and takes more than 70 pills a day.\n\nBut amid all the havoc and the sorrow, the government has elevated the story of Martin Richard, the youngest victim. Mr. Tsarnaev placed the bomb three and a half feet from the boy, and it shattered his small body to pieces. At each important juncture in the trial, the government has put Martin\u2019s death front and center; his father, Bill, testified during the first phase.\n\nOnce Mr. Tsarnaev was convicted, however, and the trial moved to the sentencing phase, Bill and Denise Richard wrote an open letter asking prosecutors to drop the death penalty. The Richards did not object to it per se, but they feared the endless appeals process would keep them from moving on with their lives.\n\nThe Richards\u2019 stance complicated the government\u2019s strategy. Having relied so thoroughly on them to make its case, the government clearly viewed them as their strongest argument for the death penalty and expected them to be part of their closing. But one question hovering over the government\u2019s case was whether prosecutors could still use Martin\u2019s death to advocate the death penalty even though the boy\u2019s parents had disagreed so publicly with their goal and refused to take the stand to help them accomplish it. Prosecutors answered that question Thursday. But the Richards were absent.\n\nThe government used video, audio and photographs to set the scene. It put on a trauma surgeon, David King, who had reviewed Martin\u2019s autopsy report. He testified that Martin did not die instantly but that his intestines were pulled and twisted and that he felt a \u201cprimal, very disturbing kind of pain.\u201d\n\nAnd it put on Mr. Woolfenden, one of 17 spectators at the marathon who lost at least one leg, as its final witness. He had his own harrowing story to tell, of his injury and his fear that his son would die. But, as the jury learned Thursday, he was also a witness to Martin\u2019s death.\n\nHe told the jury that he locked eyes with Denise Richard as her son lay dying.\n\n\u201cI placed my hand on her back,\u201d he said. \u201cDenise turned to me for a moment and asked me if I was O.K. I said yes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She then turned back to Martin.\n\nThe jurors, many looking drained, were left with the death of Martin Richard. On Monday, the defense is to begin telling them why they should spare Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s life.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150423212325, "twitter": {"description": "The state rested in the penalty phase of the trial against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted in the 2013 Boston bombings.
