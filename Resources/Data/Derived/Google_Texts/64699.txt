The polarizing life of Ted Cruz just became a bit stranger and possibly more dangerous as the Senator has now received death threats.

While a Daily Beast contributor Dean Obeidallah tweets about Ted Cruz and John McCain fighting in an old-fashioned duel, Cruz received an actual threat via twitter.

Law enforcement officials are investigating a threat against Cruz by a person identifying himself as Troy Gilmore Jr., posted on Twitter:

“Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home address in Houston…

The author of the threat uses the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 and identifies himself as having served in the U.S. Army and Navy…

“What goes around comes around CRUZ!!” the person wrote.

At about 5:30 pm on Friday, @ArmyVet54 posted another apparent threat, urging that Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a street wise [sic] lesson”.

The person posted Cruz’s home address several other times this month and repeatedly used threatening language.

“Anyone else hoping Ted Cruz and John McCain settle their feud in an Aaron Burr-Alexander Hamilton style duel? Id be rooting for John McCain,” Dean Obeidallah tweeted.

Meanwhile in San Antonio returned home to a rousing welcome in Texas on Saturday after his attempt to derail Obamacare with a shutdown of the federal government. The standing ovatio lasted for eight minutes.

“After two months in Washington, it’s great to be back in America,” Cruz joked in speaking to a crowd of about 750 people in a packed downtown San Antonio hotel ballroom.
