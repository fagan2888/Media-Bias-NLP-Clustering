He\u2019s learned to trust those survival skills.\n\nBut, when I met him, he was rattled. He was waiting in line for a tuberculosis test. He takes the disease seriously.\n\n\u201cI worry about it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just never know when you\u2019re going to come in contact with the wrong person, somebody who could be a carrier.\u201d\n\nA scourge in much of the world, tuberculosis has long been seen in this country as a relic of the past. In 2011, the most recent year for which national statistics are available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported slightly more than three cases per 100,000 people.\n\nBut TB persists among the homeless. And on LA\u2019s Skid Row, where crowding and unsanitary conditions help spread the disease, it\u2019s made an alarming advance.\n\nSince 2007, officials have identified some 94 cases in the area, 77 of them among the homeless. Half of those cases have been reported in the last two years. So far, 17 people have died, said Robert Kim-Farley, director of communicable disease control and prevention for the Los Angeles County health department.\n\nIn February, county, state and federal health authorities announced a coordinated effort to contain a persistent outbreak in the downtown neighborhood dotted with cardboard shanties and tent encampments.\n\nKim-Farley said through a genetic analysis, researchers have established that a unique strain of tuberculosis is centered on Skid Row, and is being passed from person to person there. With intensive medication, TB is curable. But authorities estimate that more than 4,500 people may have been exposed to the disease.\n\nThe challenge is to find out who they are and to get them to agree to treatment. That\u2019s where the UCLA School of Nursing\u2019s Public Health Center fits in.\n\nHomeless people can be suspicious or even fearful of government efforts to hep them, Kim-Farley said. \u201cSo these community providers that are known and trusted by the community are very important.\u201d\n\nOne recent morning a UCLA team visited the Union Rescue Mission in the heart of Skid Row and set up a table laden with test kits in the Mission\u2019s dayroom.\n\nOf the 15 men who lined up for tests, most said they\u2019ve heard little about the outbreak and were only getting tested because it\u2019s mandatory for anyone staying in the Mission dormitory for five days or more.\n\nBut, Matthew Morales was an exception. He knew the risks.\n\n\u201cYou have people coughing right in your face down here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of those sanitary wipes to try to kill bacteria, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help much with something like TB. So, when I get a chance like this to make sure I\u2019m OK, I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d\n\nAndy Bales, the Mission\u2019s chief executive, said a lot of people are both worried and poorly informed.\n\n\u201cEarly on, I talked to a woman on the street about coming in, and she said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to come in to the Mission. I might get TB,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s certainly more at risk being on the street than she is at the Mission where people are screened and people are receiving health care. But the information gets lost, and people become misinformed.\u201d\n\nMary Marfisee, the Health Center\u2019s medical director, said she and her students are doing all they can to disseminate facts, and to test as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOur people at the Mission know who\u2019s there every day, so if they see somebody they don\u2019t know, they ask them if they want a test,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Health Center also enlists the aid of medical students from a program jointly run by the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine and Drew University that trains physicians to serve the homeless and poor.\n\nThird-year Drew student Cara Quant said she\u2019d never seen a positive TB test before she started at the Mission. So far, out of the 100 people she\u2019s helped to screen, four results have come back positive, Quant said.\n\nMarfisee said before county officials announced the outbreak in February, she sometimes had trouble obtaining treatment for homeless people known to have been exposed to tuberculosis but whose infection remained \u201clatent,\u201d or largely asymptomatic. Since then, county health officials and Skid Row community providers have started to work together, including jointly developing a treatment regimen that can be completed in weeks instead of months. That\u2019s much better suited to a transient population, Marfisee said.\n\nThe UCLA team includes medical assistant Antonio Vera, who was homeless and a patient at the clinic before Marfisee encouraged him to go to school to train for his current job with the university.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very astute and sensitive to people\u2019s needs,\u201d Marfisee said. \u201cThey may come by for a TB screening, but often, within a couple minutes, Antonio\u2019s able to pick up on some other health condition that needs attention, and we\u2019re able to attend to that, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to get out of here, just like I did,\u201d Vera said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I pursued the knowledge of case management, so I could help them climb up the ladder and get out of this hole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his four months on Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, Matthew Morales says he\u2019s learned what clothes to wear so he doesn\u2019t stand out too much, how to keep clean, how to", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Student Nurses Fight to Curb TB on LA's Skid Row\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/09\\/19\\/student-nurses-fight-to-curb-tb-on-los-angeles-skid-row-tuberculosis\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-19 10:33:21\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-09-19 10:55:51\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":15051,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/09\\/SkidRowTB1-e1379375456727.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In his four months on Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, Matthew Morales says he\u2019s learned what clothes to wear so he doesn\u2019t stand out too much, how to keep clean, how to travel light.
