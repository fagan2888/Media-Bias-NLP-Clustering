The leading buyer is for-profit Prime Healthcare.\n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office is hearing testimony at each of the six hospitals this week before it approved or denies the sale. Because the hospitals are owned by a non-profit, the state is tasked with making sure the sale to a for-profit company benefits the public interest.\n\nUnions are divided over whether Prime is the right candidate for the job.\n\nSEIU United Healthcare Workers West began waging a campaign against Prime Healthcare eight months ago. They rallied a long list of California lawmakers and advocates to oppose the sale.\n\n\u201cThere has never been the breadth or the depth of opposition to any hospital transaction in the history of California,\u201d says Dave Regan, union president.\n\nSEIU\u2019s main concern with Prime taking over is the threat of bankruptcy. Prime has indicated it is willing to restructure to bring order to the hospitals\u2019 finances. This could put union members\u2019 pensions at risk of being slashed.\n\n\u201cThe workforce, in terms of retirement benefits, would be totally unprotected,\u201d Regan says.\n\nThen, after months of publicly fighting the sale, SEIU confronted a new opponent last fall: another union.\n\nThe California Nurses Association declared its support of the sale to Prime in October. The union struck its own deal with Prime that includes a promise to maintain current staffing levels and to fully fund nurses\u2019 pensions and retiree health benefits.\n\n\u201cRetirees don\u2019t want to worry about having to go to Walmart to get a job,\u201d says Jacqualine Gammage-Rogers, a nurse at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, one of the hospitals included in the sale. She\u2019s planning to retire in the next five years.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to walk away with my pension to maintain my life and my style of living,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to make some changes, but I want to make sure that I don\u2019t have to eat cat food once I retire.\u201d\n\nThe California Nurses\u2019 Association and SEIU have a tumultuous history. The two unions have clashed over how to negotiate with hospitals.\n\n\u201cThey have been known to ally with each other,\u201d says Joanne Spetz, UC San Francisco professor of economics. \u201cLately, it seems like they\u2019ve been working against each other more frequently.\u201d\n\nTensions have risen when the two unions have bargained separately in the same hospital, with CNA representing nurses and SEIU-UHW representing technicians and other vocational health care workers. Each is willing to make very different kinds of trade-offs.\n\nSEIU has made deals recently to secure its right to organize within hospitals, usually by making certain concessions to management.\n\n\u201cSEIU will come to an agreement of what will be on the bargaining table and what won\u2019t \u2014 then agree there will be representation without elections,\u201d Spetz says. \u201cCNA has not been willing to negotiate that way.\u201d\n\nSeveral other unions have taken a position on the sale, with nurses from SEIU Local 121 RN in favor, and nurses from the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals opposed.\n\nSpetz says the attorney general\u2019s office \u2013 and consumers \u2013 need to be cautious about the union politics and rhetoric in their review of the sale. The attorney general must confirm or reject the deal before February 12.\n\nThe hospitals included in the sale are: Seton Medical Center in Daly City; Seton Coastside in Moss Beach; O\u2019Connor Hospital in San Jose; Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy; St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles; and St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The powerful California Nurses Association and the SEIU are on opposite sides of the proposed sale of 6 safety-net hospitals.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"It's Union vs. Union in Proposed Hospital Sale\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/01\\/06\\/its-union-vs-union-in-proposed-hospital-sale\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-06 17:01:26\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-09 15:11:39\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23353,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Health Care Workers\",\"Hospitals\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/01\\/OConnor_Hospital_Exterior_2-e1420591762331.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The powerful California Nurses Association and the SEIU are on opposite sides of the proposed sale of 6 safety-net hospitals.", "title": "It\u2019s Union vs. Union in Proposed Hospital Sale", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/01/06/its-union-vs-union-in-proposed-hospital-sale/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/01/OConnor_Hospital_Exterior_2-640x334.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health care workers,hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The hospitals included in the sale are: Seton Medical Center in Daly City; Seton Coastside in Moss Beach; O\u2019Connor Hospital in San Jose; Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy; St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles; and St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood.\nThe California Nurses Association declared its support of the sale to Prime in October.\n\u201cThere has never been the breadth or the depth of opposition to any hospital transaction in the history of California,\u201d says Dave Regan, union president.\nSpetz says the attorney general\u2019s office \u2013 and consumers \u2013 need to be cautious about the union politics and rhetoric in their review of the sale.\nThen, after months of publicly fighting the sale, SEIU confronted a new opponent last fall: another union."}
