But I\u2019ve never seen it done by a president himself to the extent that it\u2019s been done by this president. He does it regularly, it\u2019s part of how he operates. For all the controversy that his presidency entailed, I never saw George W. Bush do that. I mean, there are ways to do it where you say things like, \u2018Those who say this, and my opponents say that, or there are people in the other party who say this.\u2019 But with Obama, this is a staple. This is how he rolls. This is what he does.\u201d\n\nHume said there is no way of knowing if things will cool down so that an agreement on the current impasse can be reached. He added that the agreement will likely be unsatisfactory for both sides.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody knows what the answer to that is,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t. I mean, I think it\u2019s, I think this is as ugly as I\u2019ve ever seen it, and I think it\u2019s not going to end anytime soon. And I don\u2019t see an early way out of this, unless, unless one thing happens. And the current impasse will end in some crude and unsatisfactory way, probably for all sides. But the question really is, when do we get to some moment where if things are settled, and the Republicans either succeed in their objectives of undoing Obamacare, and that happens, or the Democrats finally establish that this is how things are going to be and they win? But somebody, you know, we have divided government. The people have elected, you know, the people haven\u2019t chosen one side or the other in this fight.\u201d\n\nHewitt suggested that while this president has been very good scoring electoral victories, he has not been as successful in scoring political victories. But Hume questioned that idea, pointing to the 2010 midterm election in which the Democrats suffered heavy losses.\n\n\u201cBut I would challenge your premise that he\u2019s good at beating Republicans,\u201d Hume said. \u201cHe\u2019s good at winning elections, but you know, if he was so good at beating Republicans, he would have done a lot better in that midterm, wouldn\u2019t he? And he didn\u2019t. And that was, and you know, you hear the argument made by the president all the time that there was, that the other side in this Obamacare debate should shut up, because this is settled law, and there was an election held that affirmed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the truth is that this election, this presidential election wasn\u2019t very much about Obamacare, and the reason is that Mitt Romney, although he said over and over again that he was going to stop it in its tracks, it wasn\u2019t the central issue in his campaign,\u201d Hume continued. \u201cHis campaign was rooted in the idea that the economy was bad, that people would not ratify that, and that he was therefore, Romney, running downhill while President Obama was running uphill. And it turned out that President Obama might indeed have been running uphill, but he ran uphill all the way to re-election.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "'With Obama, this is a staple.
