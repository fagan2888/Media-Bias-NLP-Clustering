The economy was weak, Americans were dissatisfied, and still Republicans lost to President Obama, unable to raise turnout or peel enough voters from the Democratic coalition.\n\nFrom the higher view of history, however, this was typical. Absent a disaster\u2014war, recession, or preferably both\u2014it\u2019s hard to beat an incumbent president. In 1948, Harry Truman had the turbulent aftermath of a war, but also a blistering economy. He won. In 1956, Dwight Eisenhower had steady growth and relative peace. He won with a landslide. Lyndon Johnson, running in Kennedy\u2019s stead, won on the strength of the president\u2019s memory and a healthy economy, and Richard Nixon\u2019s second term was a feat of strong growth, despite the war in Vietnam. Ronald Reagan, like Eisenhower, had growth and relative peace, as did Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. George W. Bush was mired in a souring war, but the economy was just strong enough to fill the sails of his presidency. Overall, between the end of the World War II era and the present, just three men\u2014Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush\u2014have failed to win a full eight years in the White House on their own feet as candidates. (Gerald Ford is a special case.)\n\nWhat\u2019s truly unusual in American politics is the threepeat. After two terms, voters tend to move on to the other party, either as a correction, or just to try something different. The three exceptions, in the 20th century, were the 1920s\u2014when a presidential death and a presidential retirement gave us 12 years of Republican governance\u2014the \u201930s and \u201940s\u2014where Democrats held the White House through 20 years of depression and war\u2014and the 1980s, when Republicans held it through the end of the Cold War and into the 1990s.\n\nAs extremely novel events, those periods changed the political landscape. The moderate, more internationalist Republican Party that emerged out of five terms of Democratic leadership and New Deal economic policy was markedly different than the conservative one that governed through the 1920s, while the Democratic Party took a right turn after losing to Reagan and George H.W. Bush in three consecutive contests.\n\nWhich brings us to the present. Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein says\u2014with some hyperbole, but not much\u2014that Republicans should just disband the party if they can\u2019t beat Hillary Clinton. \u201cAll she has going for her,\u201d says Klein, after a negative review of her campaign speech on Saturday, \u201cis the hope that pushing the right buttons on identity politics and promising new government benefits, Americans will overlook what they don\u2019t like.\u201d She\u2019s so bad, he says, that if Republicans can\u2019t \u201cnominate a formidable candidate to put against a Democrat with lots of baggage,\u201d they might as well \u201cthrow in the towel.\u201d\n\nClearly, Klein is exaggerating. But he nods to something that\u2019s true: If Republicans lose in 2016\u2014and give Democrats a rare and coveted third term\u2014the party will have to change. Indeed, it will change, and the force will come from within the GOP, from groups and interests that would rather have power than purity. And that\u2019s especially true if a conservative candidate like Gov. Scott Walker loses, because then, conservatives can\u2019t lean on purity\u2014\u201cMitt Romney/John McCain wasn\u2019t conservative enough\u201d\u2014to explain a loss.\n\nAnd a loss is a big deal. After all, what does 12 (or 16) years out of the White House mean for a political party? It means you can\u2019t reverse key policies\u2014like the Affordable Care Act\u2014without a huge backlash. It means you don\u2019t have a stamp on the federal bureaucracy\u2014your hires have either left or retired\u2014and you\u2019ve lost your step on the federal judiciary. It means a less friendly Supreme Court\u2014with consequences that stand for decades\u2014and it means less influence on the international stage. In short, it\u2019s a disaster.\n\nNow, I sit on the left of American politics, and from here, it looks like Republicans have to move away from their base. Americans aren\u2019t liberal, but they don\u2019t want the hard conservatism of the past six years, and they aren\u2019t for the exclusion\u2014of immigrants, of LGBT Americans\u2014that\u2019s come from some of the loudest voices in the GOP coalition. But that\u2019s a self-interested diagnosis. Just as possible is a GOP that stays in its place on government and the economy\u2014tax cuts and a smaller welfare state\u2014but adopts a more cosmopolitan outlook that pulls right-leaning voters from emerging groups like Latinos and Asians.\n\nOn the other end, there\u2019s a GOP that moves left on government\u2014but becomes more culturally conservative\u2014or one that stays where it is in most places but tries to outflank the Democratic Party on issues outside the left-right divide, like criminal justice reform.\n\nWhether or not you think these are plausible paths for the GOP\u2014in one way or another, they reflect options on the table in this election cycle\u2014is less important than the reality of the party\u2019s position; if it loses, it will buckle to pressure for reform.\n\nIf there\u2019s a caveat\u2014something to keep events from \u201cbreaking the fever\u201d of the party\u2019s conservative movement\u2014it\u2019s if Republicans nominate a more moderate candidate like Jeb Bush or Gov. John Kasich. Then, as with nominees past, conservatives could ignore the loss, and keep pressing for the same old losing formula.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Why a Hillary Clinton victory would be good news for Republican moderates", "Description": "Beating the GOP could be the best thing Hillary Clinton can do for conservatives", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Slate", "author": "Slate", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "For Republicans , the 2012 election was a bitter experience.
