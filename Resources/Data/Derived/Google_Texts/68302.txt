I am so proud to be a Hawkeye! The fans at the Rose Bowl showed the type of class that only could come from the dear people of my home state when they cheered the team after their defeat to Stanford. Believe me, I know you would never see that happen at any other university. I live right outside of Columbus, Ohio, and being a Hawkeye in Buckeye country isn't always easy, yet I proudly have my Iowa decal on my car.

To the football coaches and to the team, I hope you can be proud of an outstanding year!

P.S.Tell the wrestling team to please beat the Ohio State University Buckeyes!
