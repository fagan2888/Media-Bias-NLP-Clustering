For employers, the mandate entails a multi-step process that culminates in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filing that came into play at the beginning of this year.\n\n\u201cThe reporting requirements fall under the IRS, but it\u2019s all about the [health insurance] coverage offered and which employees take the coverage,\u201d said Christine Pollack, vice president of government affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA).\n\nIn fact, the Shared Responsibility Employer Mandate can determine how, or even if, a convenience store business needs to file.\n\nDETAILS DEFINED\n\nCompanies with 50 or more full-time employees throughout a calendar year are considered to be an applicable large employer (ALE), and must fulfill the employer mandate. For ALE entities, the distinction between full and part time becomes a critical factor. Under ACA regulations, a full-time employee is defined as anyone who clocks in at least 30 hours per week on average.\n\nBobby & Steve\u2019s Auto World, headquartered in Eden Prairie, Minn., consists of eight c-stores and car washes, as well as auto repair and tow truck businesses, all of which rely on Bobby & Steve\u2019s Auto World Holdings LLC to handle corporate duties, such as administering benefits, including health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of locations that have blended together into a control group, and that could be considered an applicable large employer. Then we have a couple of them that waiver up and down between the 50 full-time employees. It will be interesting to see, once all the hours are in at the end of the year, what it will look like for five or six stores,\u201d explained Melissa Schlinger, director of human resources.\n\nNot surprisingly, the 30-hour distinction has compelled some c-stores to reformulate staff classifications.\n\nDue to its size, Casey\u2019s General Store Inc. has been through the ACA reporting procedure once before. Companies with 100 or more full-time employees were required to file proof of healthcare coverage for the 2014 tax year. The government delayed the employer mandate for businesses with 50-99 employees until this year.\n\n\u201cCasey\u2019s considers an employee full time when they work 35 or more hours per week. Thus the definition provided by the regulations for full-time healthcare eligibility created much more internal work and consideration,\u201d said Bill Walljasper, senior vice president and chief financial officer. The Ankeny, Iowa-based c-store chain operates more than 1,900 sites in 14 states and more than half of its 33,873 employees qualify as part-time.\n\n\u201cWe have such a large part-time workforce that tracking eligibility\u2026was much more challenging than the other reporting requirements,\u201d Walljasper said.\n\nMore specifically, for the 2015 tax year, larger employers are required to offer coverage to 95% of full-time staff, and companies in the smaller category must meet a 70% threshold, which is set to increase to 95% this year.\n\n\u201cWe have been tracking work hours for over a year to see how we could be affected by the \u2018look back\u2019 (offering coverage to those regularly working 30 hours or more) once we\u2019re outside the safe-harbor period,\u201d said Walljasper.\n\nSafe harbors help companies determine if their employer-sponsored health insurance plans qualify for the ACA\u2019s affordability standard. According to the IRS, health insurance costs must be less than 9.5% of the individual\u2019s annual household income.\n\nAccording to the IRS Website, \u201can employer may choose to use one or more of the safe harbors for all of its employees or for any reasonable category of employees, provided it does so on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees in a category. If an employer offers multiple healthcare coverage options, the affordability test applies to the lowest-cost self-only option available to the employee that also meets the minimum value requirement.\u201d\n\nFOLLOWING FORM\n\nCompanies must complete IRS Form 1094-B, Transmittal of Health Coverage Information Returns, and Form 1095-B, Health Coverage. Form 1095-B contains the requisite information, including the filer\u2019s identifying data, names of insurance issuers and a listing of individuals covered.\n\nAny business submitting 250 or more returns is required to file electronically.\n\nAdditionally, the law compels companies to supply employees with a hard copy of this information, which began Feb. 1, 2016. Workers can grant employers permission to receive the forms electronically.\n\n\u201cThat might sound simplistic, but it\u2019s not. It can be tedious and burdensome,\u201d said RILA\u2019s Pollack. \u201cHopefully, everyone has been keeping monthly records of who accepts the basic employer-sponsored coverage. I would tell employers to go to the IRS Website first so they can become familiar with the law. The data points are laid out there.\u201d\n\nIndustry analysts and c-store owners and executives point to the administrative aspects as perhaps the most problematic in meeting ACA reporting requirements. At Bobby & Steve\u2019s Auto World, Schlinger chose a payroll firm to help her navigate the process.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came on board two years ago, the payroll and HR systems weren\u2019t talking to each other. What I knew about the ACA at that point was that these systems had to talk,\u201d Schlinger said. \u201cI researched new payroll and HR systems to house the information and I chose ADP. ADP also has an ACA package that links time and attendance into the module. It pulled together the information to extract the reporting data.\u201d\n\nNoncompliance can result in penalties of $100 for each return failure, not to exceed $1.5 million per year. Fines are also applied for failure to disseminate individual payee statements.\n\nDespite enlisting a vendor with subject matter expertise, Schlinger still anticipates a steep learning curve as she experiences the process for the first time.\n\n\u201cI know they will be coming back to me at some point with questions,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThat hurdle is yet to be seen, but I\u2019m happy right now knowing we\u2019re this far into the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in effect, most convenience stores are ready to follow suit.
