They have denounced Obama\u2019s Clean Power initiative to slow the rate of growth of emissions as another example of executive overreach that will kill jobs and undermine the economy.\n\nRelated: Obama: climate change an economic, security imperative\n\n\"I don't think we're out of step with public opinion wanting jobs, wanting economic growth, weighing the costs and the benefits,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told reporters. Billionaire Donald Trump, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, on Monday berated Obama from calling climate change one of the greatest existential threats to the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\n\"I think one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard in politics -- in the history of politics as I know it, which is pretty good, was Obama's statement that our No. 1 problem is global warming,\" Trump said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nRelated: Climate Summit: Can Obama Convince 130 Countries to Reduce Carbon Emissions?\n\nAs Paul Waldman of The Washington Post noted yesterday, nowhere else in the world is there a political party representing half the electorate that seems so \u201cadamantly opposed to doing anything to address climate change.\u201d\n\nOnly a few GOP presidential candidates \u2013 such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and former New York governor George Pataki -- have declared that climate change is a huge problem that needs action. But they are so far behind in the polls that few are listening to their pleas.\n\nTrump and the other top tier Republican candidates are primarily global warming skeptics who are unwavering in their opposition to tough government regulations on industrial polluters who are contributing mightily to the problem.\n\nHere is where the top six GOP presidential candidates stand on the issue:\n\nRelated: Obama: This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nDonald Trump - The billionaire real estate mogul has long scoffed at scientists\u2019 warnings of the high risks of climate change and ridiculed President Obama\u2019s major push in the U.S. and overseas to try to ratchet down global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn September, Trump told CNN, \u201cI believe in clean air, immaculate air, but I don\u2019t believe in climate change.\u201d He has written off extreme weather patterns as simply the vagaries of weather. On Monday, he called Obama\u2019s assertion that global warming is one of the greatest threats to the U.S. the \u201cdumbest things\u201d ever said. Then yesterday, he complained that all Obama wants to talk about is \u201cclimate change,\u201d during an interview with Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily.\n\nRelated: Obama Warns of Costly Public Health Crisis Spurred by Climate Change\n\nBen Carson - The retired neurosurgeon is another skeptic who has directly challenged climate-change science, saying that \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be either cooling or warming going on,\u201d and that \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d\n\nCarson, who enjoys broad appeal among evangelical Christians, denounced the use of climate change as \u201can excuse not to develop our God-given resources.\u201d He is a severe critic of Obama\u2019s federal regulations for cracking down on industrial carbon emissions. And he argues that the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cshould be told to work in conjunction with business, industry and universities\u201d to find the most \u201ceco-friendly\u201d ways of developing our natural resources.\n\nRelated: Obama and Critics Battle Over Climate Change Costs\n\nMarco Rubio - The Florida senator took a hard line last year against climate change science, complaining in an interview with ABC News that scientists had been highly selective in choosing a \u201chandful of decades of research\u201d as evidence of a longer-term trend \u2013 and blaming it almost entirely on manmade emissions.\n\n\u201cI do not agree with that,\u201d he declared.\n\nHe softened his stand a little in April, when he told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d \u2013 somewhat nonsensically, \u201cI believe climate is changing because there\u2019s never been a moment when the climate is not changing.\u201d But regardless of the cause, Rubio declared during the Republican presidential debate in September, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government we\u2019re under wants to do\u201d with job-killing regulations.\n\nRelated: Did Kasich Just Do an About-Face on Climate Change?\n\nTed Cruz - The freshman Texas senator and darling of the GOP\u2019s right wing rarely minces his words, especially on the topic of climate change. Last August, Cruz insisted in a speech that facts don\u2019t support climate change and that \u201cpower-hungry politicians\u201d like Obama are using it as an excuse to control the lives of the American people.\n\n\u201cIf you look at satellite data for the last 18 years, there\u2019s been zero recorded warming,\u201d Cruz told a group of conservative said a speech to 450 donors to the political network organized by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. \u201cThe satellite says it ain\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nCruz insisted that government engineers were doctoring the data to falsify changes in the climate. \u201cThey\u2019re cooking the books,\u201d he told the audience in California. \u201cThey\u2019re actually adjusting the numbers\u2026. Enron used to do their books the same way.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush - As is so often the case with the former Florida governor, Bush has struggled to enunciate clear-cut views on climate change, and what ought to be done about it.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Bush has taken a number of nuanced positions on climate change, although each time he voiced skepticism about the extent of the problem \u2013 and the role of industry in exacerbating the situation.\n\n\"The climate is changing; I don\u2019t think anybody can argue it\u2019s not. Human activity has contributed to it,\" Bush told Bloomberg BNA. But in May he said it is \u201carrogant\u201d to claim that the science on the issue is settled, an argument he has been using since 2011.\n\nThen in June, he declared, \u201cThe climate is changing, whether men are doing it or not. That was followed in August by his statement, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the highest priority I don\u2019t think we should ignore it, either.\u201d\n\nFiorina Takes on Trump in a Brave Battle of the Sexes\n\nCarly Fiorina - The former Hewlett-Packard CEO concedes there is a problem, but insists that U.S. efforts to combat climate change should be approached through technological innovation and not regulations.\n\n\u201cHere we have a bunch of liberals and people in the EPA who are willing to sacrifice other people\u2019s lives, other people\u2019s livelihoods at the altar of their ideology,\u201d she told Fox News.\n\nFiorina has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of an international climate change agreement -- like the one being hammered out in Paris -- because \u201cwe will not have a harmonized regulatory regime.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While President Obama was concluding a two-day stint at an internation", "title": "Where The Top Six GOP Presidential Candidates Come Down on Climate Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Where-Top-Six-GOP-Presidential-Candidates-Come-Down-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10292015_GOP_Debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Where-Top-Six-GOP-Presidential-Candidates-Come-Down-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10292015_GOP_Debate.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While President Obama was concluding a two-day stint at an internation", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz - The freshman Texas senator and darling of the GOP\u2019s right wing rarely minces his words, especially on the topic of climate change.\nFiorina has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of an international climate change agreement -- like the one being hammered out in Paris -- because \u201cwe will not have a harmonized regulatory regime.\u201d\nRelated: Did Kasich Just Do an About-Face on Climate Change?\nThen yesterday, he complained that all Obama wants to talk about is \u201cclimate change,\u201d during an interview with Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily.\nBillionaire Donald Trump, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, on Monday berated Obama from calling climate change one of the greatest existential threats to the U.S. and the rest of the world."}
