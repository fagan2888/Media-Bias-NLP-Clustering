I remember the first time I decreed myself a \u201ccunt\u201d\u2014it was on the street following a performance of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues.\u201d My friend shushed me, but I called it out loud and proud. \u201cI\u2019m a cunt!\u201d Until that point, I had only heard a man use that word. The experience was freeing.\n\nMaybe, then, it should be no surprise that the word \u201cmisandry\u201d has found itself a following in the pop-culture vernacular. (While misogyny is the hatred of women, misandry is the male equivalent. Or as Merriam-Webster bluntly puts it: \u201cThe hatred of men.\u201d) Why misandry, and why now? The word is common in men\u2019s rights circles and appears to be the result of a backlash against increasingly public discussions of hate crimes against women and rampant Internet misogyny. This might sound like a sweeping statement\u2014rampant Internet misogyny\u2014but the truth is there is so much hate towards women on the Internet that it\u2019s not about finding examples, it\u2019s about narrowing down examples.\n\nI could tell you about the rape threats against Zerlina Maxwell, or the death and rape threats against Anita Sarkeesian of Feminist Frequency. I could mention the misogynist hurricane of cruelty that vandalized Sarkeesian\u2019s Wikipedia page and manipulated her Google search results to read \u201cAnita Sarkeesian is a feminist video blogger and cunt.\u201d\n\nGo to Reddit or 4chan, or even YouTube. Go to Craigslist, read the comments on the CHVRCHES Facebook page, or look up the name Stella Creasy and you\u2019ll find more of the same kind of verbal abuse, the same attacks, the same kind of threats. Men\u2019s rights activists tend to cry misandry whenever these problems are pointed out\u2013and now women, proudly or in jest, are starting to use the term themselves. Even women who like men (I like my husband, my father, my brother and my son very much, for instance) can see why women might use the word misandry. Because maybe, outside of the Rampant Internet Misogyny, they have, at one point in their life, endured some abuse by a man. Maybe it was a dude, or a bunch of dudes, who treated a woman badly in her 20s. Or maybe, it was just the whole of men\u2014you know, The Patriarchy.\n\nMen understand this. This includes my husband, who, when I told him I was writing this story, said: \u201cYeah, men suck.\u201d This doesn\u2019t make him a self-hating man, this just makes him a man who understands the problems men can cause.\n\nAnd because ladies, even the most riotous of ladies\u2014after all, this generation\u2019s interest in crafts started under the Riot Grrrl movement, where girls first embroidered \u201cfeminist\u201d on pillows and formed knitting groups called \u201cStitch \u2019n Bitch\u201d\u2014like being girlish and tough, the misandry message has evolved in the form of arts and crafts. Check Etsy for the word misandry and you\u2019ll find super-cute pom-pom knit hats with \u201cmisandry\u201d emblazoned between rows of hearts. You\u2019ll also find lavender and white heart-shaped misandry hair barrettes, a plastic misandry necklace and a misandry-adorned heart-shaped felt brooch with beads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to the rampant misogyny of the Internet, feminists are putting \"misandry\" on shirts, hats and jewelry", "title": "Fighting sexism with cross-stitch: The rise of misandry crafts", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In response to the rampant misogyny of the Internet, feminists are putting \"misandry\" on shirts, hats and jewelry", "title": "Fighting sexism with cross-stitch: The rise of misandry crafts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/27/fighting_sexism_with_cross_stitch_the_rise_of_misandry_crafts/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/misandry_crafts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In response to the rampant misogyny of the Internet, feminists are putting \"misandry\" on shirts, hats and jewelry", "title": "Fighting sexism with cross-stitch: The rise of misandry crafts", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/misandry_crafts.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hayley Krischer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Crafts, Editor's Picks, Feminism, misandry, misandry crafts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Crafts, Editor's Picks, Feminism, misandry, misandry crafts, Life NewsThe word \u201ccunt\u201d has been in our lexicon for a while now, reclaimed by a host of feminist activists.\nCheck Etsy for the word misandry and you\u2019ll find super-cute pom-pom knit hats with \u201cmisandry\u201d emblazoned between rows of hearts.\nMaybe, then, it should be no surprise that the word \u201cmisandry\u201d has found itself a following in the pop-culture vernacular.\n(While misogyny is the hatred of women, misandry is the male equivalent.\nYou\u2019ll also find lavender and white heart-shaped misandry hair barrettes, a plastic misandry necklace and a misandry-adorned heart-shaped felt brooch with beads."}
