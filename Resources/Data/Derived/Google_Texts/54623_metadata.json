Paul Lee, R-Dothan, said the Retirement Systems of Alabama take up between $940 million and $960 million of the General Fund budget each year at about 63-percent funding. RSA encompasses the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Alabama (ERS), the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (TRS) and Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF).\n\n\u201c That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the shortfall we\u2019re in in all the other areas \u2013 the system is not producing the actuaries expected to make sure the payments are made,\u201d Lee said during a legislative update meeting at the Dothan Area Chamber of Commerce on Monday.\n\n\u201c\u2026 If it was 90-percent funded, you\u2019re talking about $400 million or $500 million less. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not going to fund it and you\u2019re not going to get your retirement. We\u2019re going to do that. \u2026But $960 million is what we have to do just to keep it at 63-percent funding.\u201d\n\nAccording to RSA\u2019s annual 2014 report, revenues from TRS, ERS and JRF were $5.55 billion and made up of 12.81 percent of employee contributions, 20.66 percent of employer contributions and 66.53 percent of investment income.\n\nAn Alabama Policy Institute publication showed that as of September 30, 2014, RSA\u2019s TRS, ERS and JRF held assets of $29.4 billion and liabilities of $44.6 billion, resulting in an unfunded liability of $15.2 billion.\n\nRSA had an estimated 339,000 members in 2014. Total claims expense in 2014 was $1.25 billion, according to the report.\n\nState Rep. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, said the Public Education Employees\u2019 Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) requested $23 million from the Education Trust Fund, which he said \u201cwas great\u201d compared to what was expected.\n\nChesteen said the 18-percent cost of living adjustments for retirees that were given between 2004 and 2006 are a $1.2 billion unfunded liability.\n\n\u201c That is a $1.2 billion unfunded liability we just cannot sustain, but we do want to make sure that we try to take care of the health insurance needs for retirees with no COLAs\u2026to at least address the needs.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, said the last time the retirement system was at 100-percent funding was in 2001, when the Legislature\u2019s contribution to RSA (according to API) was $334 million. He said some big reforms were made in 2011 when the Legislature opted not to give cost of living adjustments anymore to retirees and to restrict the age to draw retirement to a minimum age of 62 for employees who started work after January 2013.\n\n\u201c We made significant changes but it\u2019s going to take a long time before you can finally see that in the retirement system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c With retirement it\u2019s not like taking a jet ski and turning it around on the dime. It\u2019s like a big ship we\u2019ve got to turn around.\u201d\n\nIn addition to discussing retirement issues, the three legislators talked about efforts for workforce development and career technical courses.\n\nClouse also gave a review of last year\u2019s session and a general update on the current session to residents who attended. Clouse said last year was the toughest budgeting experience he has in his 21 years in office.\n\nClouse said the Proration Prevention Account established in 2011provided a \u201ccushion\u201d in the education budget by taking the average of the last 15 years of the budget and spending that amount while carrying the surplus over to the next year.\n\n\u201c Because of that we haven\u2019t had pay raises in the last four or five years. Employees and retirees have had to pay more in health insurance, but we\u2019ve \u2026instilled discipline in that spending process and formed a budget \u2026,\u201d he said.\n\nClouse said hiking the cigarette tax up 25 cents, from 42.5 cents to 67.5 cents per pack, as part of about $165 million in new revenue measures for the state\u2019s total 2016 General Fund budget of $1.76 billion, is about half of what the state needed.\n\nHe said an internet sales tax discussed in Congress could potentially add revenue to the state and local municipalities.\n\nClouse said at least some of the $10 million would go toward hiring pardon and parole officers to get nonviolent offenders out of the prisons. He said $16 million was allocated to that effort beginning this month.\n\nClouse said multiple agencies have tightened their budgets in a variety of ways.\n\n\u201c We can still keep the train on the track if the agencies just stay with what they have, but we know for sure the prisons are going to need at least $10 million more for the prison reform we passed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c But I think the big issue like it was last year, like it\u2019s going to be this year and like it\u2019s going to be the next few years is Medicaid.\u201d\n\nClouse said it is possible the Affordable Care Act might be repealed if a Republican wins a presidential race and has a Republican Congress, which would likely lead to the funding of some other type of low-income health insurance like Medicaid..\n\nClouse said he was unsure the state will be able to fund regional care organizations designed by the Legislature three years ago to coordinate the health care of Medicaid patients in each region.\n\n\u201c We\u2019re in a holding pattern and we may be lucky just to level fund Medicaid,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next legislative update meeting at the Dothan chamber is set for 7:30 a.m. Monday, March 14.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Dothan Eagle", "description": "While Medicaid and prisons \u2013 which absorb more than half Alabama\u2019s General Fund budget \u2013 remain tense topics for decision-making in the legislative session, a local legislator said issues with Alabama\u2019s pension system are why the other programs experience shortfalls.", "title": "Legislators talk retirement, Medicaid issues in upcoming session", "url": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/local/legislators-talk-retirement-medicaid-issues-in-upcoming-session/article_b8af5010-ce8b-11e5-a7e3-9b998507e788.html", "image": {"width": 1121, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/b3/db3c3468-ce8b-11e5-816a-5bbfd29e4382/56b8d4899bdfe.image.jpg?resize=1121%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dothaneagle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@DothanEaglebiz"}, "description": "While Medicaid and prisons \u2013 which absorb more than half Alabama\u2019s General Fund budget \u2013 remain tense topics for decision-making in the legislative session, a local legislator said issues with Alabama\u2019s pension system are why the other programs experience shortfalls.", "fb": {"app_id": 127957210797}, "keywords": "local,editors_pick,spotlight,top_story", "google-site-verification": "FxOwTsXWtkxruLdkniwmNFEqAZKSYYIapDcokfzL5E4", "news_keywords": "local,editors_pick,spotlight,top_story"}, "article_summary": "RSA encompasses the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Alabama (ERS), the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (TRS) and Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF).\nI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not going to fund it and you\u2019re not going to get your retirement.\n\u201c We made significant changes but it\u2019s going to take a long time before you can finally see that in the retirement system,\u201d he said.\nWhile Medicaid and prisons \u2013 which absorb more than half Alabama\u2019s General Fund budget \u2013 remain tense topics for decision-making in the legislative session, a local legislator said issues with Alabama\u2019s pension system are why the other programs experience shortfalls.\nState Rep.
