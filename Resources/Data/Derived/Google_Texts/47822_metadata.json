Consumers scrolling through the health plan options on the insurance marketplaces in a few states this fall may come upon plans whose name \u2014 Leap Diabetes Plans \u2014 leaves no doubt about who should apply.\n\nOffered by Aetna in four regions next year, the gold-level plans are tailored for the needs of people with diabetes. They feature $10 copays for the specialists diabetics need such as endocrinologists, ophthalmologists and podiatrists, and offer free blood sugar test strips, glucose monitors and other diabetic supplies. A care management program with online tools and coaching helps people manage their condition day-to-day. The plans also offer financial incentives, including a $50 gift card for getting an A1c blood test twice a year to measure blood sugar levels and a $25 card for hooking up a glucometer or biometric tracker to the Aetna site.\n\n\u201cIt was a good time to design a product that was a little more personalized, as opposed to generic,\u201d says Jeff Brown, vice president of consumer product, network and distribution at Aetna. \u201cWe saw diabetes as a compelling need, and a growing need.\u201d\n\nAetna is debuting the diabetes plans next year in four markets: Charlotte, N.C., Phoenix, Ariz., Northern Virginia and southeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the diabetes plans are a good buy for people with diabetes. The cut rates for specialist visits only apply if they\u2019re related to diabetes care, not for other conditions someone may have. Meanwhile, coverage for medications, which may cost consumers hundreds of dollars every month, is no different in the diabetes plans than in other gold plans.\n\nIn Arlington, Va., for example, the Aetna Innovation Health Leap Gold Diabetes plan with a $3,500 deductible for an individual has an estimated monthly sticker price of $379. Non-diabetes related specialist visits cost $100, preferred brand-name drugs cost $50 and the out-of-pocket maximum is $3,500. Is that a better buy than the $371 Kaiser Permanente gold plan with a zero deductible and $6,350 out-of-pocket maximum, where all specialist visits are $40 and preferred brand-name drugs cost $30? That will depend on the individual.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Insurance,Insuring Your Health,Syndicate,Arizona,Diabetes,north carolina,Pennsylvania,Virginia", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Aetna is rolling out a special gold-level plan for 2016 that is aimed at providing better care for people with diabetes in the hopes of keeping them healthier\u2014and their costs down.
