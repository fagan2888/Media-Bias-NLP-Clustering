But a new study claims that those guidelines were built on little to no evidence, and that we should live in a world in which butter and cheese are not shunned.\n\n\u201cDietary recommendations were introduced for 220 million U.S. and 56 million UK citizens by 1983, in the absence of supporting evidence from randomized control trials,\u201d the study states. These old guidelines aimed to reduce fat consumption to 30 percent of total energy intake, and also lower saturated fat consumption to 10 percent of total energy intake. But the authors of the study, who were from Scotland and the U.S., examined old research and found no differences in outcomes between patients who maintained the reduced-fat diet, and those who didn\u2019t, they state.\n\n\u201cThe outcome is that there is no difference in overall deaths whatsoever,\u201d Zo\u00eb Harcombe, the lead author of the study, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program. \u201cThey were identical in the intervention and control groups with 370 deaths a piece and there was no statistical difference in heart deaths.\u201d Harcombe argued that when people reduce their fat consumption, they actually increase the number of carbohydrates they eat instead.\n\nHealth experts have long been trying to figure out what\u2019s been causing the obesity epidemic. For years, many have believed that eating high-fat foods, drenched in butter, bacon, or melted cheese, were to blame. But Harcombe argues that saturated fat isn\u2019t the culprit.\n\nButter is filled with important nutrients, like vitamins A, E, and K2, as well as calcium, phosphorus and potassium. Though the majority of butter\u2019s calories are fat calories, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re bad for you; the saturated fat found in butter often contributes to \u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d or HDL. Cheese, meanwhile, has similar healthy aspects to it, containing minerals and vitamins like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamin A, in addition to its fat content.\n\nBut as with anything, there\u2019s a fine line between healthy consumption of fats and dangerous consumption of fats. Extreme amounts of fat can lead to high cholesterol and heart problems, which are known to contribute to obesity.\n\nAnd of course, the new study has its downfalls \u2014 and since its publication in the journal Open Heart, it has fueled a debate among health experts and nutritionists. While the study claims fat isn\u2019t responsible for the obesity epidemic, others disagree. Some nutritionists state that it\u2019s already well-known that butter and cheese can be good for you \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t take away from the message that eating high amounts of saturated fat can still cause harm.\n\n\u201cThis paper is not critical of current advice on saturated fats but suggests that the advice was introduced prematurely in the 1980s before there was the extensive evidence base that exists today,\u201d Dr. Alison Tedstone, Public Health England\u2019s chief nutritionist, said. \u201cThe advice issued by Coma (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy) in 1991 confirmed that eating too much saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of heart disease.\u201d\n\nJudith Wylie-Rosett, a professor of epidemiology and population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association (AHA), told TIME that more rigorous research could be carried through to improve guidelines, even if current ones weren\u2019t necessarily completely lacking in evidence. \u201cWe are not doing our best by the consumer at the moment,\u201d she told Time. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to restrict fat to below 30 percent of daily calories, but do we want to allow up to 70 percent? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThis may leave us with more questions than answers. Though in the time being, remember that while not all butter and cheese is bad \u2014 it\u2019s often how much you eat that really matters. Steering away from processed foods will naturally provide you with a well-balanced diet, giving you room to use butter in making vegetables or morning eggs.\n\nSource: Harcombe Z, Baker J, Cooper S, Davies B, Sculthorpe N, DiNicolantonio J.
