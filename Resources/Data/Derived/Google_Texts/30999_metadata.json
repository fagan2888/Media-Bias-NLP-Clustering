(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) October 4, 2015\n\nThousands attended the 58th annual Turkey Shoot, Chicken Dinner and Fall Festival on St. Joe Hill in Sellersburg, Ind., on Sunday.\n\nSt. Joseph Hill Catholic Church hosted the event for 57 years before it merged with St. John\u2019s Catholic Church earlier this year, forming a new parish with two campuses. The event is now officially titled the St. John Paul II Catholic Church Turkey Shoot on St. Joe Hill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mouthful,\u201d said event co-chair Margaret Popp Tschaenn with a laugh. \u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty much just calling it the St. Joe Turkey Shoot like always.\u201d\n\nTschaenn and her sister, Darlene Popp Coleman, have co-chaired the festival \u2014 the church\u2019s biggest fundraiser each year \u2014 for 20 years.\n\n\u201cOur raffle presales were up 30 percent this year,\u201d said Father Tom Clegg, pastor of the parish. \u201cAnd last year they set a record.\u201d\n\nWith the combining of the two churches, the volunteer base has grown as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got well over 600 \u2014 almost 700 \u2014 volunteers working,\u201d Clegg said.\n\nWhile the event is called a turkey shoot, not a turkey was in sight, except for the frozen ones handed out as prizes to the shooters taking part in the event. Guests lined up with their shotguns for each round, aiming at a paper target across the parking lot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come up here every year since I was ten years old or so,\u201d Anthony Graf of Sellersburg said Sunday, after winning a turkey.\n\nJackson Ehringer, 10, attended with family members, including his cousin Jonathan Fleeman \u2014 a newly graduated private in the Marine Corps.\n\n\u201cI just started shooting last year,\u201d Ehringer said. \u201cI\u2019ve been squirrel and deer hunting.\u201d\n\nFleeman has been shooting longer, but said he doesn\u2019t hunt. \u201cI just like shooting targets,\u201d he said.\n\nScott Rodman and Andy Kiel made a trip down from Indianapolis for the day to shoot at targets and eat.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been wonderful,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cThe food was incredible. I\u2019ll be stuffed the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nThe chicken dinners are a favorite with more than 2,500 meals served each year with fresh fried chicken, homemade desserts and made-from-scratch chicken and dumplings.\n\nGames of chance, quilt raffles, food booths, kids activities, bingo, and a cake wheel were also featured in the day\u2019s activities.\n\nDon Fusting, 82, says he has attended every one of the St. Joe Turkey Shoots.\n\n\u201cI just love it,\u201d said the Louisville resident. \u201cWhen we first started coming in was in a church basement with hot dogs and chili. And they shot at a real turkey.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1LcHvAV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Guests lined up with their shotguns for each round, aiming at a paper target across the parking lot.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Guests lined up with their shotguns for each round, aiming at a paper target across the parking lot.", "title": "Sellersburg \u2018turkey shoot\u2019 event brings huge crowd", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/10/04/sellersburg-turkey-shoot-event-brings-huge-crowd/73218690/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Guests lined up with their shotguns for each round, aiming at a paper target across the parking lot.", "title": "Sellersburg \u2018turkey shoot\u2019 event brings huge crowd", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Pope John Paul II", "gci-categories": "Persons/Pope John Paul II", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Sellersburg \u2018turkey shoot\u2019 event brings huge crowd", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fd588f0f44b12068efa2339672115e3a8a4c410/c=200-0-600-533/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/638654ae1d20bc87a2eaa76ee81d38cdcabce667/c=134-0-667-533/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68ca7fed1fb4a9555a427c22d66fa056de2620b5/c=44-0-755-533/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c938dc92fc3a3ca9191e7d52655363c522c8fd01/c=0-42-800-492&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-04T23:06:22.760000-04:00", "shorthed": "\u2018Turkey shoot\u2019 event brings huge crowd", "articleid": 73218690, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91663fb702b52330025b57acd219649a8481db29/c=0-42-800-492/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/759890191a377e8eda26af666bd1e40795443d57/c=250-0-550-533/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/B9319106710Z.1_20151004194153_000_GDBC4M4GE.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "sellersburg, southern indiana, festivals louisville, turkey shoot"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda252\"", "article_summary": "The event is now officially titled the St. John Paul II Catholic Church Turkey Shoot on St. Joe Hill.\nAnthony Graf of Sellersburg lines up his shot during the St. John Paul II Catholic Church Turkey Shoot at St. Joe Hill was held at the St. Joe campus in Sellersburg on Sunday.\nWhile the event is called a turkey shoot, not a turkey was in sight, except for the frozen ones handed out as prizes to the shooters taking part in the event.\nDon Fusting, 82, says he has attended every one of the St. Joe Turkey Shoots.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty much just calling it the St. Joe Turkey Shoot like always.\u201dTschaenn and her sister, Darlene Popp Coleman, have co-chaired the festival \u2014 the church\u2019s biggest fundraiser each year \u2014 for 20 years."}
