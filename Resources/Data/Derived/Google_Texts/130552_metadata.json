Here are 14 of His Most Epic Pop Culture Moments.\n\nSign Up for Newsletter\n\nPresident Barack Obama turns 53 today (August 4), and for someone in his age bracket, he is pretty in-tune with what happens in today's pop culture. Whether he is texting his pal Jay Z, delivering a hilarious speech at the Correspondents' dinner, or joking around with comedienne Ellen Degeneres, he has been a part of some of today's most talked-about moments.\n\nObviously, it is not easy to be the leader of the free world, but when he isn't addressing the union about the Affordable Health Care Act, job stability or international events, he makes it look pretty cool.\n\nIn celebration of America's smoothest president since Bill Clinton, here are \"14 of President Obama's Most Epic Pop Culture Moments.\"\n\n1) When he brushed the \"Dirt Off of [His] Shoulder\" in 2008.\n\nDuring his first presidential campaign, he dealt with a lot of hate from Hilary Clinton and other frontrunners. He had the perfect response and hip hop culture immediately fell in love.\n\n2. When he shouted out Young Jeezy at the 2012 White House Correspondent's Dinner.\n\n3. When he appeared on Funny or Die with \"Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis.\" (What should we do about North Ikea? **Dies Laughing**)\n\n4. All of the jokes from the 2014 White House Correspondents' Dinner. (\"MSNBC is here. They're a little overwhelmed, they've never seen an audience this big before.\" **Ohhhh Burn**)\n\n5. Pretty much anytime he's around Jay and Bey.\n\n8. When Jay Z revealed that he has the President's personal number, and texts him during his one-time Twitter Q&A on July 9, 2013 and in his controversial song Open Letter.\n\nB.O.: Hov, song wasn't funny.\n\nJay: **Jigga Laugh**\n\nHere's what he said in his interview with Hot 97 of chatting with Obama: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve spoken to [Obama] on the phone and had texts\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s happened and it\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s a regular guy as well. He\u2019s very heavy into sports so a lot of his analogies end in sports\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this is reaching National Security, but when he was getting elected the second time, he was like, \u2018Fourth quarter, just gimme the ball.\u2019\u201d\n\n9. And this, Obama said in response to all of the Cuba trip drama.\n\n10. His hilarious comeback when Ellen told him that she broke his record for retweets with her Oscar's Super Selfie.\n\n(2 minute mark)\n\n11. In the same interview, he revealed how he would handle Sasha and Malia if they ever came home with tattoos.\n\n(Watch at 4 min and 15 sec)\n\n\n\n12. When he laughed off the offer to \"Puff, Puff, Pass\" in Denver, Colorado.\n\nUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\n13. When he was spotted taking selfies with Michelle, Sasha and Malia at the 2012 Inauguration.\n\n14. And FINALLY-- This epic moment. (**For the ladies**)\n\nHappy 53rd President Obama.
