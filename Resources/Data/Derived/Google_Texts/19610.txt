Is the partisan rancor over the Affordable Care Act finally starting to calm down?

Not a chance. Republicans and Democrats are as far apart as ever.

The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation has been tracking public attitudes toward the ACA since the law’s enactment in 2010. In its latest survey, which was conducted earlier this month, 75% of Democrats supported the law with 51% calling for it to be expanded. An almost equal percentage of Republicans, 73%, were opposed to it with 56% calling for repeal.

Independents were close to evenly split, with 41% favoring the law and 44% opposed.

These differences seem to reflect deeper divisions in attitudes about health care. For Democratic voters, the issue they were most eager to hear the presidential candidates discuss was access for the uninsured. For Republicans, the issue that attracted the most interest was the ACA. Independents were most eager to hear about rising costs.

Medicare came in a distant fourth for all groups, suggesting a lack of interest in reform.

Despite the partisan split, overall public opinion of the ACA turned more negative in the latest survey. Close to half of the respondents, 49%, were unfavorable, and 38% were in support.

As the public divide over the ACA remains as wide as ever, the Supreme Court seems evenly split as it deliberates over the fourth challenge in five years to an aspect of the law.

We can expect more twists and turns in the debate over Obamacare as the presidential campaign continues.
