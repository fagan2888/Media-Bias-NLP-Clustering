No one else in the party has gotten sick. ( Daniel Alexander-Head via Flickr )\n\nA child from Los Angeles County is recovering from a case of the plague, state health officials reported Thursday.\n\nThe child was hospitalized after visiting Stanislaus National Forest and camping at Yosemite National Park\u2019s Crane Flat Campground. No one else in the child\u2019s group became sick, officials said.\n\nNo other information about the child was released.\n\n\u201cCases of plague in California are very rare,\u201d said Vicki Kramer, chief of the vector-borne disease section of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \u201cEvery year, however, we do detect animals with plague in California, particularly at higher elevations. We\u2019ve found it in 49 [of California\u2019s 58] counties.\u201d\n\nPlague is an infectious bacterial disease carried by squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents as well as their fleas. The fleas \u201cprefer to live on rodents,\u201d Kramer said, so generally don\u2019t pose a threat to people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only when the rodents die that they may seek an alternative host, such as a person,\u201d she said. But a person would need to come into very close contact with the rodent to become infected.\n\nTo avoid this close contact, keep your distance from wildlife.\n\nDr. Danielle Buttke is with the U.S. Public Health Service and is currently in Yosemite investigating the outbreak, along with CDPH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.\n\n\u201cNever touch or feed wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to approach them, give them their space.\u201d In particular, steer clear of animals acting strangely, because it is more likely that the animal is sick.\n\nOther protective measures that CDPH recommends include:\n\nNever touch sick or dead rodents\n\nAvoid walking, hiking or camping near rodent burrows\n\nWear long pants tucked into socks or boot tops to reduce exposure to fleas\n\nSpray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas\n\nKeep wild rodents out of homes, trailers, and outbuildings and away from pets\n\nThe initial symptoms of plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen glands. Plague is treatable in the early stages with prompt administration of antibiotics.\n\nThe CDPH says there have been no known cases of human-to-human infection in California since 1924. The last human case of plague in the state was in 2006.\n\nSasha Khokha and Kerry Klein contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plague cases are rare -- the last reported case in California was in 2006.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Child Who Had Camped at Yosemite Recovering From the Plague\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/06\\/los-angeles-child-recovering-from-the-plague-yosemite\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-06 16:32:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-06 17:42:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":57870,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/5106360964_ee756148af_o-e1438903259840.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Plague cases are rare -- the last reported case in California was in 2006.", "title": "Child Who Had Camped at Yosemite Recovering From the Plague", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/06/los-angeles-child-recovering-from-the-plague-yosemite/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/08/5106360964_ee756148af_o-1440x654.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "( Daniel Alexander-Head via Flickr )A child from Los Angeles County is recovering from a case of the plague, state health officials reported Thursday.\nThe child was hospitalized after visiting Stanislaus National Forest and camping at Yosemite National Park\u2019s Crane Flat Campground.\n\u201cCases of plague in California are very rare,\u201d said Vicki Kramer, chief of the vector-borne disease section of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).\n\u201cEvery year, however, we do detect animals with plague in California, particularly at higher elevations.\nWe\u2019ve found it in 49 [of California\u2019s 58] counties.\u201dPlague is an infectious bacterial disease carried by squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents as well as their fleas."}
