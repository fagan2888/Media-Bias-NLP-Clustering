CGI Federal is the U.S. arm of a Canadian company.\n\nTownes-Whitley and her Princeton classmate Michelle Obama are both members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni.\n\nToni Townes \u201985 is a onetime policy analyst with the General Accounting Office and previously served in the Peace Corps in Gabon, West Africa. Her decision to return to work, as an African-American woman, after six years of raising kids was applauded by a Princeton alumni publication in 1998\n\nGeorge Schindler, the president for U.S. and Canada of the Canadian-based CGI Group, CGI Federal\u2019s parent company, became an Obama 2012 campaign donor after his company gained the Obamacare website contract.\n\nAs reported by the Washington Examiner in early October, the Department of Health and Human Services reviewed only CGI\u2019s bid for the Obamacare account. CGI was one of 16 companies qualified under the Bush administration to provide certain tech services to the federal government. A senior vice president for the company testified this week before The House Committee on Energy and Commerce that four companies submitted bids, but did not name those companies or explain why only CGI\u2019s bid was considered.\n\nOn the government end, construction of the disastrous Healthcare.gov website was overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a division of longtime failed website-builder Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUpdate: The Daily Caller repeatedly contacted CGI Federal for comment. After publication of this article, the company responded that there would be \u201cnothing coming out of CGI for the record or otherwise today.\u201d The company did however insist that The Daily Caller include a reference to vice president Cheryl Campbell\u2019s House testimony. This has been included as a courtesy to the company.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama's Princeton classmate is a top executive at the company that earned the no-bid contract to build the failed Obamacare website.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama's Princeton classmate is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the failed Obamacare website.
