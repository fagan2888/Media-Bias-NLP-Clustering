And as long as we focus on the policies and the issues, we\u2019re going to be just fine. \u2026 The facts and the issues will speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nDressed casually in a black House of Representatives sweater fleece, the 47-year-old incoming House Oversight chairman repeatedly emphasized that he wants the committee to be different than it was under Darrell Issa, the media-friendly Republican congressman who is giving up the chairman\u2019s gavel this year after facing term-limits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Darrell Issa,\u201d Chaffetz said of his predecessor. \u201cI learned a lot. But I\u2019m a different person and I have a different approach. And everybody\u2019s going to put their stamp on things. And I can be as aggressive as anybody, but it doesn\u2019t need to be so personal.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thinks Issa went too far as chairman, Chaffetz replied: \u201cThere were several times when things got too personal, and I thought it was wrong.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring his desire for a change, Chaffetz said Issa will no longer sit on the committee and estimated that he will replace about 60 percent of Issa\u2019s committee staff.\n\nHe also promised more in-depth reports authored by the committee, and said he wants committee members \u2014 not just the chairman \u2014 doing television hits on their investigations.\n\n\u201cI want to see more of our members doing that. \u2026 It\u2019s not the Jason Chaffetz show,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Republican Steering Committee chose Chaffetz to replace Issa as chairman month, the California Republican gave his blessings to Chaffetz. \u201cCongressman Chaffetz is a valued colleague and demonstrated leader who will continue the work of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress,\u201d Issa said. \u201cI am looking forward to working with him on the transition and moving my focus to other responsibilities.\u201d\n\nUnder Issa, the committee has been a constant thorn in the side of the Obama administration, investigating things like the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal, the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi.\n\nChaffetz, whose office is decorated with memorabilia from his days as a placekicker for Brigham Young University, said Tuesday that \u201cobviously, the IRS and Obamacare are going to get a major portion of our attention.\u201d\n\nWhile Chaffetz said the committee will examine problems with embassy security, the congressman said the committee is done investigating Benghazi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything with Benghazi,\u201d Chaffetz said, referencing the new select committee in the House on the attacks and its chairman. \u201c\u201dat\u2019s all Trey Gowdy.\u201d\n\nBut Chaffetz suggested that it is still a topic that interests himself personally. \u201cI know how to whisper in Trey\u2019s ear,\u201d he said.\n\nThe incoming-chairman said embassy security \u201cafter Benghazi\u201d will be examined.\n\n\u201cOn-going concerns about embassy security, design and build is a huge, huge issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was working well with Colin Powell, and Hillary Clinton changed it. And it\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s a major threat to those people that serve over seas, and we\u2019re going to be doing a lot with that.\u201d\n\nHe said the committee will likely also further investigate things like the Secret Service, problems with the Freedom of Information Act and the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.\n\nDiscussing Obamacare, Chaffetz mentioned his desire to get more information from Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who infamously said the law was passed because of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is information that we need,\u201d Chaffetz said of Gruber. \u201cHe was obviously part of the inner circle of people often referred to as the architects of Obamacare. There was only a handful of people in the room with the president for an hour and a half talking about it, and he was one of them.Taxpayers paid for that information and I think we ought to be able to see it.\u201d\n\nSumming up his philosophy of the committee\u2019s broad role in oversight of the administration, Chaffetz said: \u201cThis is what we do in America. We are self-critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how we get things better,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019d be this tenacious if Mitt Romney was the president. It\u2019s the check and balance of government. It\u2019s the core function of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'Our job is not to attack the president'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Jason Chaffetz, set to become the House's top watchdog over the Obama administration next year, says he wants aggressive oversight of the federal government but doesn't want it to feel a", "title": "Jason Chaffetz Gearing Up To Become House\u2019s Top Obama Watchdog", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/16/jason-chaffetz-gearing-up-to-become-houses-top-obama-watchdog/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jason-chaffetz-trey-gowdy-reuters-e1412867422668.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Our job is not to attack the president'", "title": "Jason Chaffetz Gearing Up To Become House\u2019s Top Obama Watchdog Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/16/jason-chaffetz-gearing-up-to-become-houses-top-obama-watchdog/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jason-chaffetz-trey-gowdy-reuters-e1412867422668.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-16 17:07:02", "sailthru.title": "Jason Chaffetz Gearing Up To Become House's Top Obama Watchdog", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "darrell-issa,jason-chaffetz,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "darrell issa,jason chaffetz", "sailthru.description": "WASHINGTON -- Jason Chaffetz, set to become the House's top watchdog over the Obama administration next year, says he wants aggressive oversight of the federal government but doesn't want it to feel a", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jason-chaffetz-trey-gowdy-reuters-e1412867422668.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Darrell Issa,\u201d Chaffetz said of his predecessor.\nAfter the Republican Steering Committee chose Chaffetz to replace Issa as chairman month, the California Republican gave his blessings to Chaffetz.\n\u201cCongressman Chaffetz is a valued colleague and demonstrated leader who will continue the work of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress,\u201d Issa said.\n4411652WASHINGTON \u2014 Jason Chaffetz, set to become the House\u2019s top watchdog over the Obama administration next year, says he wants aggressive oversight of the federal government but doesn\u2019t want it to feel as \u201cpersonal\u201d as it has been in recent years.\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything with Benghazi,\u201d Chaffetz said, referencing the new select committee in the House on the attacks and its chairman."}
