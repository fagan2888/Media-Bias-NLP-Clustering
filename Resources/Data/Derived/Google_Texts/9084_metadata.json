Richard H. Black calls it a badge of honor to have been singled out as an enemy of the Islamic State in the current issue of its English-language magazine Dabiq, but the Loudoun County Republican says he feels for others targeted by the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the Christians in the Middle East and the American soldiers and their families that have been put on the ISIS hit list,\u201d Mr. Black told The Washington Times, using an acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cI am deeply concerned about the fate of Christians in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nMr. Black, who was made aware of his mention in the magazine\u2019s eighth edition via a courtesy call by the Virginia Capitol Police, is just the latest politician or analyst to find himself singled out in Dabiq as a \u201ccrusader\u201d trying to stop the ascent of the radical Muslim movement.\n\nThe new issue, distributed late last month, labels former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, a potential 2016 presidential hopeful, as \u201cthe Catholic crusader,\u201d and it dubs both Mr. Black and former CIA operative Gary Berntsen as \u201cthe American crusader.\u201d\n\nPrevious issues have gone after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, journalists and military analysts \u2014 usually quoting them touting the dangers posed by the Islamic State as a way of stressing the group\u2019s importance in international affairs.\n\nAnalysts say Dabiq is designed to be a recruiting tool for jihadists from the West. One issue contained an article justifying burning alive a Jordanian air force pilot who had been held captive by the group; other issues proclaimed military successes and jeered at far-flung nations, warning them not to get involved in the fight.\n\nThe objective of the \u201cIn the Words of the Enemy\u201d section in which the men are featured is to boost the morale of supporters and recruit Islamists who don\u2019t support the group, said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for the Clarion Project, an educational group that studies Islamist extremism and catalogs the magazine.\n\n\u201cThe last issue\u2019s section had a tone of defensiveness,\u201d Mr. Mauro said in an e-mail. \u201cISIS had just lost the battle in Kobani and the group could not claim victory there without losing all credibility, so they used the comments of enemies to point out its successes elsewhere and to minimize the setback without denying it.\u201d\n\nU.S. airstrikes and Kurdish troops in late January broke the Islamic State\u2019s months-long siege of the Syrian town of Kobani near Turkey\u2019s border. The terrorist group still controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the latest magazine, Mr. Black is quoted as saying he sees the fight in Syria as the \u201ccenter of gravity for Western civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it falls, then we will begin to see a very rapid advance of Islam on Europe and I think ultimately, potentially, the collapse of all of Europe,\u201d he said in a recent interview with the Russian news outlet RT.\n\nMr. Black said Tuesday that he sees his inclusion as confirmation that what he has said about the group is accurate.\n\n\u201cIf we topple Syria, we create a dangerous vacuum for ISIS and al Qaeda to fill,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cAnd if the [dreaded] black-and-white flag flies over Damascus, then Jordan will fall and Lebanon will fall in fairly short order.\u201d\n\nMr. Mauro said ISIS used Mr. Black\u2019s statement \u201cto argue that Syria should be the top priority of jihadists around the world because victory there would lead to the collapse of Europe and Western civilization.\u201d\n\nHe said the terrorists cited a quote from Mr. Santorum about the group\u2019s strength to argue that ISIS is getting stronger and more popular, and that their quoting Mr. Berntsen as saying the group is the most successful Sunni terrorist group in history was used \u201cto imply Allah\u2019s favor and to encourage supporters of other groups like al Qaeda to unite behind them.\u201d\n\nMr. Black, as a state senator, does not have the authority to directly influence U.S. foreign policy, but he attracted attention last year when he wrote a thank you letter to Syrian President Bashar Assad for his army\u2019s liberating and defending Christians in the area.\n\nMr. Santorum, for his part, said he was named by the group because he \u201ctold the truth about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went and used their own words, very clearly stated what their intention is, laid it right out there for the American public,\u201d Mr. Santorum said this week on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOn the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\u201d \u201cMost Americans know who they are. It\u2019s just we have an administration that refuses to identify them, and the problem with that is they\u2019re developing policies based on a false premise. And that means that as I said in that article, they\u2019re gonna get stronger, not weaker, because we\u2019re not doing what\u2019s necessary to defeat them.\u201d\n\nThe magazine quotes Mr. Santorum from a February appearance on Fox News in which he said the Islamic State is \u201cdead serious\u201d about expanding its \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as they hold ground and continue to expand that ground, more and more will come,\u201d Mr. Santorum said then. \u201cThe fact that we are delaying means that the caliphate continues to exist. They\u2019re not losing ground. They\u2019re not being discredited in the eyes of the Muslim world. They will get stronger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia state Sen. Richard H.
