Bush. I think they\u2019re both patriots,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cNow, you may not agree with their policies, you may think that they\u2019re not managing well. That\u2019s fine. Everybody has an opinion. But as human beings, I think they\u2019re both trying to do what\u2019s best for their country.\u201d\n\nHe added that he has to balance that opinion with a hard-nosed approach to interviews; for instance, while he said it\u2019s unfair for contributors or viewers to imply that Obama is trying to \u201csubvert\u201d the country, he\u2019s \u201cthe toughest guy on the block\u201d when it comes to holding the president accountable for his administration\u2019s missteps.\n\n\u201cIf you remember the Obama interview during the Super Bowl, I go, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you fire Kathleen Sebelius?\u2019 She screwed up Obamacare! Why is she still there? Why am I paying, you\u2019re paying, her salary? For what? She should\u2019ve been axed in day one,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t answer the question. I said to the audience, I said to him, \u2018You\u2019re not going to answer that, are you?\u2019 and he gives me the Obama smile. Then I have to move along. I can\u2019t pick up the water and throw it at him as some of the right-wingers want me to do. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he\u2019s in Los Angeles for an annual \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d broadcast from the Golden State to \u201ccause trouble, shake things up a little bit.\u201d Kimmel asked if people are happy to see him when he comes to L.A. every year.\n\n\u201cNo, not particularly.
