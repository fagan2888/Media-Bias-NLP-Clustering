The Florida Attorney General’s Office has rejected a request from Broward Health’s board to hold private meetings over investigations under way by the FBI and the state inspector general, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.

Broward Health General Counsel Lynn Barrett had told the board it could meet privately; she then sought confirmation from the attorney general’s office, which denied the request under Florida’s Sunshine Law.
