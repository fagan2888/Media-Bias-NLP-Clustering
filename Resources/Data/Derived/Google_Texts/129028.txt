John Waters, the iconic director whose films are widely considered hallmarks of LGBTQ culture, questioned the “radical” nature of Bruce Jenner’s male-to-female transition in an interview published in the Spectator in London on Thursday.

“The Bruce Jenner/Caitlyn thing is kind of old hat to me,” said Waters. “I had a transgender woman in Pink Flamingos. She had breasts and a penis. She got the operation that week. That was radical to me then.”

Waters also called attention to Jenner’s conservative politics and television work, and what he sees as the reluctance to criticize Jenner in the American media.

“Caitlyn’s a Republican, she’s on a reality show, and she’s a Kardashian. We can’t make fun of him or her?”

In the wide-ranging interview, Waters also discussed gay marriage, gun control, and the Affordable Care Act, and criticized young people for shaving their body hair.

“Young people don’t have crabs,” he said. “I went to court so you could see bush and now there isn’t any.”
