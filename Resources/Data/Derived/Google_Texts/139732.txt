A newly released report expects the U.S. pharmaceutical market will expand dramatically by 2020 due in large part to changes under the Affordable Care Act.



The analysis by research firm Global Data projects the market to rise from an overall value of $395 billion in 2014 to nearly $550 billion by 2020, an increase of almost 40 percent.



Although factors such as an aging population, rising health care expenditures and increasing rates of chronic disease will contribute to that growth, analysts said the 2010 Obamacare law already sparked an increase in spending on prescription drugs between 2013 and 2014.



"Around 20 provisions of the health care legislation are expected to have a direct or indirect impact on the volume of drug and biologic sales," said GlobalData Healthcare Industry Dynamics Director Joshua Owide.



Owide said the law's insurance coverage requirement in particular could bring up to 32 million formerly uninsured individuals into the market, which could generate an estimated $115 billion over a 10-year period.



Other individuals, meanwhile, could enter into new subsidized insurance programs and drive up prescription drug use.



The report also said the country's regulatory framework helped position the pharmaceutical industry for growth. Owide said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 41 new drugs last year, with 17 intended to treat rare diseases.



"Schemes such as the FDAâ€™s Fast Track Development Program and Breakthrough Designation accelerate the approval of novel drugs and add value to the market by meeting demand more quickly," Owide said.
