A Nashville, Tennessee native whose family has a history of high cholesterol and heart disease and whose grandfather died of a heart attack, \u201ccooking for me is all about substituting food that\u2019s healthier but retains all the flavor,\u201d Hall said.\n\nDuring a moderated interview with New Jersey-based freelance writer and Courier News Correspondent Susan Bloom, Hall, 50, discussed her past stints as a model and caterer as well as her big break on Top Chef, where the L\u2019Academie de Cuisine graduate wowed the likes of renowned chefs Jacques Pepin and Emeril Lagasse with her gumbo and pea dishes, respectively, and was invited back three seasons later to participate in the \u201cTop Chef: All Stars\u201d episode and was voted Fan Favorite. Though a highly competitive challenge, Hall said that the experience prepared her for her next big opportunity on The Chew, now in its fifth season. \u201cAll five of us on the show really like and respect each other and I\u2019m so grateful every day for the way the universe has taken care of me through the opportunities it\u2019s presented,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to noting how different spices can influence a basic dish, Hall discussed the similarities between many world cuisines and the ways in which food can bring people together, especially when it\u2019s prepared with love. \u201cI always say, \u2018if you\u2019re not in a good mood, the only thing you should make is a restaurant reservation,\u2019 \u201d she joked. The yoga devot\u00e9e also touted the benefits of exercise, encouraging audience members to participate in any form of activity they enjoy and can commit to. \u201cThe only way to remain active and sustain our lives as we age is through our health, and food is medicine,\u201d she said of the greens, vegetables, lean proteins and heart-healthy spices she recommends everyone opt for. \u201cWith the levels of hypertension and diabetes in our communities today, I feel that it\u2019s our job as chefs to show people how to eat responsibly without giving up great flavor,\u201d she said.\n\nHall then demonstrated the preparation of a cucumber-carrot slaw with crunchy rice noodles from her cookbook and engaged in a question-and-answer session with audience members before signing books for hundreds of attendees. The warm and inviting speaker, who resides in Washington, District of Columbia with husband Matthew and stepson Noah, is an active advocate on behalf of many charitable, environmental, and nutrition-based initiatives and revealed plans for the launch of her own restaurant, Carla Hall\u2019s Southern Kitchen, in New York City.\n\n\u201cCarla simply radiates joy and the audience enjoyed her upbeat, healthy, and loving approach to the art of cooking,\u201d shared Bloom of her interview with Hall. \u201cWhen it comes to serving up food with true heart and soul, I think the secret ingredient is Carla.\u201d\n\nThe event opened with a heart-healthy dinner and introductory comments by Anthony Cava, chief administration officer at RWJ Somerset, as well as hospital cardiologist Ranjita Sengupta, M.D., who discussed the heart-healthy benefits of engaging in regular exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, reducing sodium and sugar intake, and opting for the high protein and fiber offered by nuts, seeds and grains such as quinoa over high-carb foods like rice and bread. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to cut out everything \u2014 everything in moderation,\u201d Sengupta said. \u201cBut heart disease is preventable, so we need to be proactive about taking care of ourselves.\u201d\n\nAn annual event conducted by RWJ Somerset for more than 20 years, \u201cour heart-healthy community program each February helps promote greater awareness of heart disease and educates individuals on how to recognize the different signs and symptoms of heart attacks in men and women,\u201d said Serena Collado, director of community health at RWJ Somerset and the event\u2019s coordinator. \u201cAdopting healthy lifestyles and diets is essential to reducing risks for heart disease and prevention is key.\u201d Collado said that the selection of celebrity speakers at RWJ Somerset events is based on their stature in the field and ability to elevate and create awareness for different health issues. \u201cWe were delighted to welcome Carla Hall as the keynote speaker for our 2015 heart health program and know that her presence greatly assisted in promoting the role of a healthy diet in the prevention of heart disease,\u201d Collado said.\n\nThe event was one of 75-100 community outreach programs a year offered by RWJ Somerset, which has recently featured programs on nutrition with celebrity fruit and vegetable guru \u201cProduce Pete\u201d Napolitano, concussion management with hockey player Ken Daneyko of the New Jersey Devils, stroke prevention with actor Kevin Sorbo, healthful aging with Martha Stewart, and active lifestyles with Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Cheryl Burke. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to promoting awareness and to keeping our community healthy in a creative, engaging, and affordable way,\u201d Collado said. \u201cAudience feedback both at the events and afterwards has been very positive and if the information provided can help save a life, then we\u2019ve achieved our goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought tonight\u2019s event was fabulous,\u201d confirmed Bridgewater resident and event attendee Nancy Cullinan, who was excited to meet Hall during the book-signing session. \u201cMy family and I have been big fans of Carla\u2019s since her Top Chef days and the whole event was very entertaining and a lot of fun. It\u2019s also so important to raise community consciousness about heart health,\u201d she added, \u201cand we learned a lot.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the events offered through Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset (located at 110 Rehill Ave., Somerville), call 908- 685-2200 or visit www.rwjuh.edu.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1A6eKjI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Celebrity chef and The Chew star Carla Hall discusses how to cook with healthy ingredients and love at Robert Wood Johnson Somerset\u2019s annual heart health event in Bridgewater on Feb. 17.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Celebrity chef and The Chew star Carla Hall discusses how to cook with healthy ingredients and love at Robert Wood Johnson Somerset\u2019s annual heart health event in Bridgewater on Feb. 17.", "title": "Carla Hall wows crowd at heart health event", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/02/18/cooking-chef-carla-hall/23616029/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Celebrity chef and The Chew star Carla Hall discusses how to cook with healthy ingredients and love at Robert Wood Johnson Somerset\u2019s annual heart health event in Bridgewater on Feb. 17.", "title": "Carla Hall wows crowd at heart health event", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b53f6ab1194af9e6bfc7ab6190cf76033a9e21a/c=200-0-1400-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/02/18/B9316296832Z.1_20150218121506_000_GS2A08UDL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Carla Hall, Robert Wood Johnson Somerset, heart health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3d9\"", "article_summary": "Celebrity chef Carla Hall fields questions from interview moderator Susan Bloom at RWJ Somerset\u2019s heart health event in Bridgewater on Tuesday.\nCelebrity chef and The Chew star Carla Hall discusses how to cook with healthy ingredients and love at Robert Wood Johnson Somerset\u2019s annual heart health event in Bridgewater on Feb. 17.\n\u201cWe were delighted to welcome Carla Hall as the keynote speaker for our 2015 heart health program and know that her presence greatly assisted in promoting the role of a healthy diet in the prevention of heart disease,\u201d Collado said.\n\u201cCarla simply radiates joy and the audience enjoyed her upbeat, healthy, and loving approach to the art of cooking,\u201d shared Bloom of her interview with Hall.\nThough a highly competitive challenge, Hall said that the experience prepared her for her next big opportunity on The Chew, now in its fifth season."}
