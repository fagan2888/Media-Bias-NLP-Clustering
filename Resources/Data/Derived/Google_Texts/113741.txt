The Obama administration issued its 10th veto threat of the year Monday, promising to scuttle a House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The veto threat wasn't surprising -- Obama has long said he would defend his landmark legislative achievement with his veto pen if necessary.

But it continues to put the beginning of the 114th Congress into record-setting territory: nine veto threats against House bills, plus a verbal threat against an Iran sanctions bill being drafted in the Senate.

That makes more bills under threat of veto to begin the year since the Office of Management and Budget first started issuing formal positions on bills under President Reagan in 1985.

Monday's threat was also noteworthy in that most veto threats issued under in the Obama administration -- including the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline -- have said only that unnamed "senior advisers" would recommend a veto. Monday's threat against the Obamacare repeal said the president would veto the bill.

H.R. 596, sponsored by Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., would repeal the five-year-old health insurance law known as Obamacare in its entirety and set up a process to draft a replacement system.

"The Affordable Care Act is not only working, it is fully integrated into an improved American health care system," the OMB statement read. "The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class."

Obama has issued only two vetoes in the six years of his presidency.
