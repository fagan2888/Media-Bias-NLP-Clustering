In such a climate, the look and feel of a clinic \u2014 how the built environment and aesthetic quality of the space can shape the patient experience, for example \u2014 almost seems like an afterthought. When the fight is about keeping the doors open and the lights on, the possibility that a clinic might be beautiful as well as functional can feel a bit audacious.\n\nBut not to the women and men who work in our clinics or the patients they serve. And not to Lori Brown, an associate professor of architecture at Syracuse University who is currently working to transform the facade of Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic into something safe, functional \u2014 and extraordinarily beautiful.\n\nThe Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization is already a dazzling pink, and clinic owner Diane Derzis and clinic director Shannon Brewer-Anderson have invested a lot of time, resources and thought into making the clinic feel safe and welcoming to the women they serve. But the clinic is surrounded by a wide fence to keep out a regular collection of protesters. And in order to provide additional protection and privacy to patients and the people who work there, the fence is woven through with a thick black tarp. The impression from outside is something like the clinic is caught inside a massive garbage bag.\n\nBrown is working in collaboration with the clinic to change that. She put out a call for proposals on how to transform the exterior of the clinic, and will begin work after selecting the final design. In an event Brown organized in collaboration with the New School in New York City, designers shared ideas for walls of lush flora and vegetation and inflatable and interactive sound barriers that add an element of playfulness to an often tense and confrontational zone.\n\nShe wants the final design to serve the needs of the clinic and, as she told me when we talked last month, to affirm and support the women who inhabit the space. We talked about the project, what Brown views as a lack of engagement from her field on issues of political relevance, the relationship between the built environment and the patient experience and how space can be playful, beautiful, functional and safe all at once.\n\nOur conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHow did this project first come about?\n\nAs an architecture student who saw very few women within my academic experience, who was not taught by very many women and did not see very many women in positions of leadership while in practice in New York, I returned to academia [to teach] and thought, It hasn\u2019t really changed that much. Around the same time I began to think about what I could do academically and professionally, my students began to come to me and ask, Why aren\u2019t we learning about more women in our history and theory courses? It prompted me to do something. So part of this project was in response to them.\n\nI had started to look at the domestic space and the relationships between gender and occupation of the home. My experience at a practitioner had been in high end residential and commercial, so I wanted to start taking on subjects that had a far greater impact for the general public. The idea of looking at gendered space and the politics of abortion clinics became a very clear and obvious kind of space to select and study. But honestly, when I began this, I really didn\u2019t know what the trajectory of the project would be. It has expanded in ways that I had never had imagined, which is fantastic.\n\nOriginally, I thought that I\u2019d look at my local clinics and try to interview people who go there, who try to get through the protesters. But after receiving a \u201cno\u201d [from those clinics], it forced me to reconsider the scale that I should be looking at. I thought it was really important, but I wasn\u2019t clear yet on how, or why, or what trajectory it would take. As I started to zoom out, I started to realize that it wasn\u2019t only about the clinics, but the states issue, a whole area within the public realm and access points, as being really critical and something that architects should be engaged and talking about. Not only from the design side, but also from the legal side. Who creates building codes, how to become more instrumental in shaping the built environment.\n\nIt blossomed into something far greater than what I had originally conceived. Being able to interview all of these providers and owners, to see the experience in different clinics who had worked with architects and designers and see what a difference that made in so many aspects of the experience and the way the practice works. I found that so interesting.\n\nHow did you come to work with the Jackson clinic?\n\nWhen I saw the clinic in Mississippi and interviewed clinic owner Diane Derzis and clinic director Shannon Brewer-Anderson, it was so glaringly obvious that an architect and artists needed to be involved. It made me realize that it can\u2019t just be about Mississippi. This clinic is clearly now the focus, but I can imagine this becoming something where the architects start to work with clinics across the country. But that\u2019s a larger, longer-range potential goal of this.\n\nBut right now the focus is on Mississippi\u2019s clinic and what we can do to help create a better experience, actually, for all sides. I think architecture is really instrumental, and should be instrumental, in doing that.\n\nThe project feels very collaborative in spirit. It seems like you\u2019re working in Mississippi not just because of your interest in the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, but also because of their interest in you.\n\nThat\u2019s so true. I think it was also just kindred spirits coming together. When I first met Diane and we started talking, we really hit it off. She has an energy and a fight instinct. She\u2019s not willing to give up. The kind of ordeal that clinic is continuing to go through made it really interesting to me as a potential place to give something.\n\nOnce I visited and saw what she was talking about, it became even clearer that either I or someone else had to be involved in making that clinic, that space, that access, better. Aesthetically. Security-wise. Privacy-wise.\n\nAnd this heightened sense that something has to happen. Things can\u2019t stay the way they are. When I first saw it, fabric was woven through the fence. Just thinking of the women who had to go past that every day \u2014 you want the space to be honoring the decision they made. It just wasn\u2019t acceptable from an architect\u2019s point of view.\n\nThe project is about conceptualizing how to use that space, specifically the fence around the clinic. Your approach is open-source, accepting proposals from designers and design students about the possibilities \u2014 both aesthetic and functional \u2014 for the exterior of the clinic. What are some of the ideas that have come through so far?\n\nThere were a lot of great ideas that people submitted. There are some that I am really attracted to, but I also feel very strongly that it be something that the clinic and the people who work there have an active voice in. I\u2019ll say what I\u2019m interested in, but I haven\u2019t yet been able to discuss with them at length what has been proposed and what we\u2019re going to do with it. I appreciated some of the submissions that brought humor to it. That\u2019s not to belittle the issue, but there was a sense of playfulness that I think really helped alleviate or minimize the incredible stress that people experience as patients coming in and people who work there.\n\nOne that stands out was an inflatable kind of compound. It\u2019s clearly not worked out, but they would be able to monitor noise level and presence level and inflate and deflate as the intensity of protest and noise increased or decreased. The sense would be an almost moving object, an art piece. I really appreciate that there would be a technological aspect to it, a playfulness that engages the arts community that the clinic is located in.\n\nAnother one that I liked, and Diane liked too, was just a series of water elements around the clinic. Clearly that\u2019s a kind of crazy idea on one hand, but it would mitigate noise, it would limit visibility, there would be a cooling effect during the hot months of the year. As a conceptual idea, I really loved it. I think water and the sound of water has a restorative and calming effect. I think it would be so interesting to have that placed within the context of this kind of vitriol and sometimes hatred coming from one side of the fence.\n\nOthers dealt more with landscape, living and green walls that also had sound-dampening layers within them. Some were very beautiful walls that were sculptural and would really protect the clinic. Not necessarily a castle\u2019s fortress walls, but not that dissimilar conceptually.\n\nOne of the things we have to think about, and talk to the clinic about, is how much they want this to participate with the larger community and how much becomes about blocking out the protesters. In a very literal sense. How much is solid and enclosed and how much is about sending out a message to the community \u2014 and to the nation as well \u2014 that there are ways we can do this that are aesthetic and thoughtful but also get at the very serious concerns they have there.\n\nThere are such pressing safety and privacy concerns here, obviously.\n\nYou look at the security elements, and those are not very nice things to look at or pass by on a regular basis. I especially think of the people who work there every day. I think it would be so much better if we could make the clinic a zone of peacefulness, of security that could make their daily life better.\n\nAbortion clinics are already intensely politicized, but people work in these clinics and others are just there to get essential medical care. They don\u2019t necessarily conceive of themselves as engaged in a political battle when they walk in the door, or at least not every time. Your project is unfolding in collaboration with the Jackson clinic so I don\u2019t see a risk of doing anything that wouldn\u2019t meet their needs, but do you see any possible downside to wanting a design that would further politicize an already contested space?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Architect Lori Brown tells Salon about her work to remake the built environment in and around abortion clinics", "title": "Making abortion clinics beautiful: Meet the architect changing how we view them", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Architect Lori Brown tells Salon about her work to remake the built environment in and around abortion clinics", "title": "Making abortion clinics beautiful: Meet the architect changing how we view them", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/26/making_abortion_clinics_beautiful_meet_the_architect_changing_how_we_view_them/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/lori_brown.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Architect Lori Brown tells Salon about her work to remake the built environment in and around abortion clinics", "title": "Making abortion clinics beautiful: Meet the architect changing how we view them", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/lori_brown.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion rights, jackson women's health organization, lori brown, Mississippi, Ohio, syracuse university, Texas, the last clinic, the new school, TRAP laws", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Abortion clinics are already intensely politicized, but people work in these clinics and others are just there to get essential medical care.\nBut not to the women and men who work in our clinics or the patients they serve.\nThe idea of looking at gendered space and the politics of abortion clinics became a very clear and obvious kind of space to select and study.\nBut after receiving a \u201cno\u201d [from those clinics], it forced me to reconsider the scale that I should be looking at.\nI had started to look at the domestic space and the relationships between gender and occupation of the home."}
