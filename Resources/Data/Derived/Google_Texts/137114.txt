Parents in Northern California are irate that sex education instructors are asking their junior high students if they're ready to have sex.

Acalanes Union School District officials in Lafayette brought in Planned Parenthood employees to teach sex-ed classes, who asked students if they were ready for sex and asked them to examine their gender identity.

Brad Dacus of the Pacific Justice Institute says the school may be in violation of state laws that forbid students from being asked probing personal questions without the permission of their parents.

"This school district did not abide by that at all," he alleges.

The story was picked up by Fox News (see video below), which reported that a "Genderbread" diagram was used to teach about "agender," "bigender," and even "two spirit."

A worksheet handed out to students was named, "Sex Check! Are Your Ready For Sex?"

Dacus is representing upset parents and is holding the school district accountable.

The attorney warned that parents in other parts of the country need to find out if there's a Planned Parenthood in their community because they could wind up with the same situation in their schools.
