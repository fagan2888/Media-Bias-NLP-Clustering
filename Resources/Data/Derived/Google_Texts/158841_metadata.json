of falling behind Tasmania\u2019s to become the country\u2019s worst, a new report has found.\n\nThe SA economy has been ranked second-last in CommSec\u2019s State of the States report, ahead of only the island state.\n\nBut CommSec\u2019s chief economist Craig James said South Australia was suffering from a downturn in manufacturing, including the planned closure of the state\u2019s auto industry, while a weaker Australian dollar had made business tough for exporters such as winemakers.\n\n\n\nIn Tasmania, employment and housing construction rates are on the rise and the state could move past South Australia if trends continue.\n\nRelated: Tony Abbott's South Australia problem: on the front line of the Coalition's war to win back votes\n\n\u201cIn Tasmania the unemployment rate is moving in the right direction, housing is moving in the right direction,\u201d James told ABC radio on Monday.\n\n\u201cThat creates the risk that Tasmania could move its way up the leaderboard, especially when South Australia has unemployment at 15-year highs.\u201d\n\nSouth Australia\u2019s 8% jobless rate stands at a 15-year high while Tasmania\u2019s 6.2% is approaching a four-year low.\n\n\u201cMost states get their momentum from somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWestern Australia (is getting it) in the mining sector, NSW and Victoria at the moment are getting it from the housing sector.\n\n\u201cBut South Australia\u2019s really finding it hard to find that x-factor to drive the economy.\u201d\n\nJames said Tasmania\u2019s economy had been stimulated through state and federal government assistance in recent times and South Australia was in need of similar support.\n\n\u201cIt may need some of these courageous decisions like a payroll tax freeze \u2013 to try to get that momentum kick-started,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth Australia has shaped up as a key battleground in federal politics.\n\nThe abandonment of an election promise to develop Australia\u2019s next generation of submarines in Adelaide, the withdrawal of support for Holden and a lack of support for the state\u2019s extensive wind energy sector have all contributed to the Coalition\u2019s unpopularity in the state.\n\nThe shelving of BHP\u2019s $20bn Olympic Dam mining project and the loss of 380 jobs has also not helped secure business confidence in the state.\n\nBefore the change in leadership, Tony Abbott had sought improve the government\u2019s standing in the state by bringing forward defence projects worth tens of billions of dollars and safeguarding up to 2,500 shipbuilding jobs.\n\nThe state\u2019s Liberal opposition leader, Steven Marshall, said CommSec\u2019s report confirms South Australia\u2019s need for an immediate jobs stimulus.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur state needs jobs creation now, not in a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo create jobs in South Australia we need to lower taxes and reduce red tape to encourage business investment and economic growth.\u201d\n\nComment was being sought by AAP from premier Jay Weatherill.\n\nNew South Wales was ranked the best-performing economy for a fifth consecutive quarter because of its booming housing market, good retail trade figures and population growth.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The weakest state, Tasmania, is on the mend while a manufacturing
