Proponents typically say these policies are necessary to give pregnant women more time to think about such a serious decision.\n\nDozens of states have already enacted waiting periods. Traditionally, these laws have required a 24-hour wait between the counseling session and the abortion procedure \u2014 but now, lawmakers in several states are working to make the requirement even more stringent, lengthening their waiting periods to force patients to wait multiple days.\n\nThis week, for instance, North Carolina became the latest state to approve a 72-hour abortion waiting period. During the debate over the proposed three-day wait, some of the measure\u2019s sponsors explicitly said they hope lengthening North Carolina\u2019s waiting period from 24 hours to 72 hours will prevent some women from choosing abortion. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has already promised to sign it into law.\n\nOklahoma also approved a 72-hour wait this session, tripling the amount of time that patients must wait before scheduling their abortion appointment. \u201cThis legislation will help women get the information they need before making a decision they can\u2019t take back,\u201d Gov. Mary Fallin (R) said in a statement last month, when she announced her decision to sign the measure.\n\nLawmakers in North Carolina and Oklahoma are following in the footsteps of abortion opponents in a handful of other states \u2014 South Dakota, Utah, and Missouri \u2014 that have imposed three-day abortion waiting periods in recent years. South Dakota currently has the distinction of having the most radical waiting period law in the country; weekends and holidays are excluded from the state\u2019s official 72-hour period.\n\nOther states are indicating a willingness to impose longer waiting periods, too. This session, lawmakers in Tennessee and Arkansas opted to lengthen abortion patients\u2019 wait to two days, ensuring their states now have some of the toughest requirements in the country.\n\nElizabeth Nash, the senior states issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks state-level abortion laws, says there\u2019s a simple reason why abortion opponents are focused on longer waiting periods. At this point, they don\u2019t have many other options. At the end of last year, Nash told ThinkProgress that, in the aftermath of a record-breaking number of abortion restrictions enacted in red states, \u201cthe next step is to see how to make them more burdensome.\u201d\n\nJust this week, lawmakers in Texas \u2014 who have passed some of the harshest anti-abortion laws in the country \u2014 admitted that they\u2019re nearly out of ideas for new restrictions on the procedure. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming hard to do more things under what the Supreme Court has said is allowed,\u201d House State Affairs Committee chairman Byron Cook (R) told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nWaiting periods, however, are still within lawmakers\u2019 legal bounds. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 court decision that clarified the extent to which states may restrict abortion, upheld mandatory counseling sessions and waiting periods. The justices ruled that those policies don\u2019t constitute an \u201cundue burden\u201d that goes too far to limit women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nExtended waiting periods typically require patients to make two separate trips to an abortion clinic \u2014 which reproductive rights advocates say does place an untenable burden on low-income women who may not have the resources to take off work or arrange transportation. That position is grounded in research. One recent study that examined the effect of a 24-hour waiting period in Texas, for example, found that the policy was emotionally and financially difficult for patients. Nearly half of the respondents reported they spent an average of $146 on extra transportation and childcare to accommodate the two trips.\n\nResearch has also found that abortion patients don\u2019t actually need any more time to think through their decision. Nearly 90 percent of women report they\u2019re \u201chighly confident\u201d about having an abortion when they first seek out a clinic, and state-mandated counseling doesn\u2019t change their minds. Studies have confirmed that even though ending a pregnancy inspires mixed emotions, women do not regret their abortion procedures and overwhelmingly say that it was the right choice for them.\n\nThere has recently been some backlash to forced waiting periods. Last month, the Satanic Temple \u2014 a satirical group that works to expose the hypocrisy in broad \u201creligious liberty\u201d laws \u2014 announced that it is seeking a religious exemption to Missouri\u2019s 72-hour waiting period. The group says that a Satanist identified as \u201cMary\u201d is struggling to get to Missouri\u2019s only abortion clinic, and she should be allowed to bypass the three-day wait because it violates her deeply held religious beliefs about bodily autonomy.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A clear trend is emerging this session.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A clear trend is emerging this session.", "title": "Women Are Being Forced To Wait Longer And Longer To Get An Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/06/04/3666005/abortion-waiting-periods-states/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_143728234.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A clear trend is emerging this session.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_143728234-321x214.jpg", "title": "Women Are Being Forced To Wait Longer And Longer To Get An Abortion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_143728234.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_143728234.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T10:15:05+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c99\"", "article_summary": "Abortion waiting periods typically require women to receive state-mandated counseling about abortion, then wait a set amount of time before they may have their procedure.\nThis week, for instance, North Carolina became the latest state to approve a 72-hour abortion waiting period.\nHealth Women Are Being Forced To Wait Longer And Longer To Get An Abortion CREDIT: ShutterstockAmong the new abortion restrictions being imposed by GOP-controlled legislatures this session, a clear trend is emerging: New laws that significantly lengthen the period that women must wait before they\u2019re allowed to proceed with an abortion.\nOklahoma also approved a 72-hour wait this session, tripling the amount of time that patients must wait before scheduling their abortion appointment.\nResearch has also found that abortion patients don\u2019t actually need any more time to think through their decision."}
