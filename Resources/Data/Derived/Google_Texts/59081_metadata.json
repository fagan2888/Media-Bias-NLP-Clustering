Some of the questions, including those from Conservative Tea Party types were tough, because well Republicans haven't really been forced to answer them in the past. Surprising (or not) when it came down to it, the free-market evangelist referred many seeking help to federal programs.\n\nOne fellow concerned about the impact of the individual mandate that he believes, \u201crequires the government to infringe on everyone's civil liberties\u201d had to ask, \u201cIs there a Republican alternative that can make it easier for people with preexisting conditions to get health insurance?\u201d Great question! The answer Matthews provides is that Republicans support a state-based high risk pool and that, \u201cFederal legislation that created best practices would have been a good idea.\u201d So, you know like Common Core for Healthcare.\n\nOne questioner asked, \u201cWho regulates healthcare navigators in the state of Texas?\u201d to which Matthews falsely replied, \u201cUm, the groups that the administration gave money too.\u201d Not true, and he was corrected by an Abbott Policy Advisor who shared a link to the Senate Bill 1795 which applies state regulations on navigators and was passed during the 83rd legislative session.\n\nSomeday it may be Abbott answering the questions, but until then see how his advisor takes the heat from voters with serious questions about their health care in Texas\u2026\n\n\n\nWhen another asked what Abbott's plan was for the 25% of Texans who are left uninsured, Abbott's \u201cPolicy Analyst\u201d chimed in with, \u201cRepealing Obamacare will be a first step toward allowing Texas and other states to address our unique health care situation without federal interference.\u201d Of course before there was Obamacare, Texas' uniquely ranked at top of the nation's uninsured states, which the commenter aptly pointed out, \u201cRepealing Obamacare\u201d is merely a campaign slogan.\u201d\n\nThe back and forth question after question led Matthews to deride Medicaid in favor of the high-risk pool, eventually saying that there is a, \u201cbig debate among health policy people whether Medicaid is better than nothing.\u201d What Matthews is trying to say in so many words is that there is no Republican solution for the uninsured in Texas.\n\nOne man took an interesting approach asking, \u201cWhy does he [Abbott] think that Washington DC can run the Texas healthcare exchange better than us Texans?\u201d Mike Goldman an Abbott Policy Analyst, said the AG was opposed to Medicaid expansion and that refusing to enact a state-level health care, which he called \u201ccourageous,\u201d could, \u201cplace Texas in a better position to invalidate portions of Obamacare entirely.\u201d\n\nSo again the idea is to invalidate an existing law, not to provide health care alternatives for Texans who currently lack them. A woman presumably near retirement age asked what of those who do not qualify for Medicaid, can not afford insurance and whose spouse makes too much money for other government assistance programs. Matthews said the answer comes down to a need for \u201cflexibility\u201d but according to him when state's ask for it, \u201cthey immediately get shut down.\u201d Pressing through a strictly political response looking for a substantive policy answer, she asked, \u201cSo in the mean time do you have any resolution to my problem, I can't seem to get any where?\u201d The answer she received may not surprise you after all \u2014 the federal government. \u201cMy only suggestion is the Social Security office.\u201d said Matthews, and continued, \u201c\u2026please look into the Earned Income Tax Credit, a federal program designed to help lower-income working people financially. Some 20 million Americans or more get benefits from that program.\u201d\n\nTo sum it up, Abbott does not support expanding Medicaid or creating and operating our own health care exchange, yet wants more flexibility from the federal government. If you can not afford health insurance, or you don't have enough to put away in a Health Savings Account, check out the federal government and see what they have to offer! In the meantime the number one campaign issue will continue to be \u201crepealing Obamacare,\u201d and it says so right on his website.\n\nYou can read the entire discussion here.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter at @joethepleb.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Earlier this week Greg Abbott hosted a forum with Merrill Matthews on his website in which the controversial policy advisor answered questions regarding th", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Burnt Orange Report", "description": "Earlier this week Greg Abbott hosted a forum with Merrill Matthews on his website in which the controversial policy advisor answered questions regarding th", "title": "Even Greg Abbott&apos;s Advisors Lack Answers For Texas&apos; Uninsured", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/1460182_10152075218579802_501756082_n.png", "updated_time": "2013-12-12T22:36:06-05:00", "url": "http://www.burntorangereport.com/diary/14520/even-greg-abbotts-advisors-lack-answers-for-texas-uninsured", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Earlier this week Greg Abbott hosted a forum with Merrill Matthews on his website in which the controversial policy advisor answered questions regarding th", "creator": "@joethepleb", "image": "https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/1460182_10152075218579802_501756082_n.png", "title": "Even Greg Abbott&apos;s Advisors Lack Answers For Texas&apos; Uninsured", "site": "@bor", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1559290521009974}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BurntOrangeReport", "tag": "Texas", "published_time": "2013-12-12T22:30:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-12T22:36:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca, governor, greg abbott, health care, obamacare, texas, politics, burnt orange report"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2ca\"", "article_summary": "Surprising (or not) when it came down to it, the free-market evangelist referred many seeking help to federal programs.\nIn the meantime the number one campaign issue will continue to be \u201crepealing Obamacare,\u201d and it says so right on his website.\nSome of the questions, including those from Conservative Tea Party types were tough, because well Republicans haven't really been forced to answer them in the past.\nThe answer Matthews provides is that Republicans support a state-based high risk pool and that, \u201cFederal legislation that created best practices would have been a good idea.\u201d So, you know like Common Core for Healthcare.\n106 Flares Filament.io 106 Flares \u00d7Earlier this week Greg Abbott hosted a forum with Merrill Matthews on his website in which the controversial policy advisor answered questions regarding the state of Texas and the Affordable Care Act."}
