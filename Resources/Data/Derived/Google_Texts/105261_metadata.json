Many seniors who posted noted that they were dismissed by doctors when bringing up sexual topics or that they were nervous to bring them in the first place.\n\nSeniors who had little or no sexual education during their youth were able to become more comfortable discussing practices and concerns as a result of participating in the online communities, they also often said in posts. The availability of information and open conversation offers an opportunity, Berdychevsky said, that allows seniors to overcome difficulties with communicating sexual concerns to healthcare providers.\n\n\"Of particular interest was society's lack of acceptance of sexuality in older adulthood, the reasons for this ageist view and the importance of changing it,\" Berdychevsky said.\n\nThe study is published in the Journal of Leisure Research.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seniors are increasingly finding it easier to get sexual health information online because of a lack of acceptance of sexuality among them.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Seniors are increasingly finding it easier to get sexual health information online because of a lack of acceptance of sexuality among them.", "title": "Seniors find easier access to sexual health information online", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/06/10/Seniors-find-easier-access-to-sexual-health-information-online/7471433959453/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/7471433959453/2015/1/14339635742929/v2.1/Seniors-find-easier-access-to-sexual-health-information-online.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7471433959453/2015/i/14339635742929/v2.1/Seniors-find-easier-access-to-sexual-health-information-online.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Seniors are increasingly finding it easier to get sexual health information online because of a lack of acceptance of sexuality among them.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seniors find easier access to sexual health information online"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2004\"", "article_summary": "Many seniors who posted noted that they were dismissed by doctors when bringing up sexual topics or that they were nervous to bring them in the first place.\nThe study reviewed posts from 14 websites over a 1 year period, with the posts filtered for sexual keywords.\nThe availability of information and open conversation offers an opportunity, Berdychevsky said, that allows seniors to overcome difficulties with communicating sexual concerns to healthcare providers.\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill., June 10 (UPI) -- Seniors are increasingly turning to the Internet for sexual health information, finding sources, services and discussion forums that fill a need caused by an apparent lack of acceptance of sexuality among seniors, according to a new study.\n\"The popularity of sex-related discussions in seniors' online communities suggests that, in a reality of limited alternatives for open and direct sex-related communication, seniors are finding channels to satisfy their needs for information and support.\""}
