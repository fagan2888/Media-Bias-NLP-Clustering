The group said it staged a suicide car-bomb attack that killed 37 people in the capital Ankara on Sunday, according to a statement on its website. The target had been security forces but a large number of civilians were killed after police intervened, TAK said, and warned that further civilians losses in its attacks were inevitable.

TAK previously claimed responsibility for a separate car bombing in Ankara in February that killed 29 people. It says it split from the PKK, but experts say they are closely linked.
