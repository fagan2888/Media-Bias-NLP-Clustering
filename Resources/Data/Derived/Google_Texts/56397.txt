Travelers headed back to Denver on eastbound Interstate 70 hit traffic snarls that began by 1 p.m. in Georgetown on Saturday and lasted into the evening.

The Colorado State Patrol advised drivers to stay alert.

Heavy eastbound traffick on I-70 added 45 minutes of extra travel time from Silverthorne to Denver and C-470 at 5 p.m., CDOT said. The entire trip could take up to one hour and forty minutes.

Traffic app Waze had users reported westbound speeds of about 10 mph where traffic on U.S. 6 merges with I-70 and slow speeds past Idaho Springs.

Weather continued to cooperate for the roads with no snow expected in the mountains today.

CDOT had warned of heavy traffic this weekend as holiday travel winds down. A report on the agency’s COtrip.org site said travelers can expect “one hour delays or longer,” with the heaviest traffic headed back towards Denver on Saturday and Sunday afternoon and evenings.

Meanwhile, in Colorado Springs, state patrol troopers cleared a four-vehicle crash a little after 3 p.m. on northbound I-25 at County Line Road, according to tweets. Backups remained in the area.

State patrol suggested commuters take Colorado 83 or Colorado 105 if going north for the next hour or so.

Crashes in Douglas County were slowing traffic as of 3 p.m., as well, state patrol said.

Castle Rock State Patrol troopers said traffic along northbound I-25 has been a slow go all afternoon with crashes along bot sides of the county line.

Deputies attributed the slew of crashes to driving while distracted.
