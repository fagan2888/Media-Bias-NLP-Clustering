Tom Rice (R-SC)\n\nRep. Tom Rice (R-SC) wants Congress to take action against President Barack Obama for moving his administration in the direction of an \"imperial presidency.\" Rice introduced a House resolution that directs the chamber \"to bring action for declaratory or injuctive relief to challenge certain policies and actions taken by the executive branch.\" The resolution is cosponsored by a number of House lawmakers including Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), Tom Price (R-GA), Joe Wilson (R-SC) and Ted Yoho (R-TX).\n\nSpecifically, Rice wants to bring civil action against the administration in U.S. District Court for delaying some parts of Obamacare because delaying some parts of Obamacare is absolutely intolerable to Republicans (cough) and is a sign of incipient tyranny. There's also some stuff in there about Obama deporting too few immigrant children for Mr. Rice's tastes, though I suspect that one is in there primarily to appeal to the sadist vote.\n\nWhile I commend Mr. Rice on his commitment to batshittery, I will remind him that we are already very, very well stocked in the batshit members of Congress category\u2014see above list of cosponsors\u2014and will humbly suggest to him that getting people to give him proper credit for his own batshittery is going to be a tough slog. Perhaps a nice, tasteful clown suit would be in order, something that stands out a bit?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Rep.
