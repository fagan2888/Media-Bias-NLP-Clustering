Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough went off on Senator and non-2016 hopeful Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Thursday morning, arguing anybody could call for more funding of things like infrastructure and health research, but a real contender would also call for reforms unpopular with her own party.

“There are special interests that Elizabeth Warren needs to stand up to,” Scarborough said. “She loves standing up to the rich and powerful and the people that create jobs. Let her stand up to the people that stop reform.”

“I’m all for infrastructure funding,” he continued. “But is Elizabeth Warren going to be all for reforming stupid workforce practices that make us unproductive and make us waste so much money? Is she going to be for reforming the union stranglehold on Amtrak reform?…Are you willing to make the reforms that maybe your special interests in public education won’t like? Are you willing to make the reforms that your unions that run Amtrak won’t like? The answer’s always no.”

“Of all the people,” Warren fan Mika Brzezinski said.
