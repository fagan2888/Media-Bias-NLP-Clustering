Paul Ryan (R-WI) has been one of the primary architects of the GOP\u2019s ongoing crusade to repeal and replace Obamacare. Most recently, the Budget Chairman has indicated that Republicans will attempt to pass individual reforms to roll back the health law\u2019s provisions piece by piece.\n\nBut not all of Ryan\u2019s constituents agree with his position. On Wednesday, the Republican congressman was confronted by one such voter at a town hall in southeast Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cACA subsidies are a good thing,\u201d Michael Martincic, 64, of Oak Creek told Ryan, criticizing his Party\u2019s repeated attempts to get rid of the health reform law.\n\nMartincic works as a roofer and is currently paying $700 for his health insurance through his union. However, upon browsing Healthcare.gov \u2014 \u201cit was so easy to get on the site; the whole thing only took 15 minutes,\u201d Martincic told ThinkProgress afterward \u2014 he found that he qualified for subsidies and could be paying as little as $200 for coverage.\n\nMartincic also told Ryan about others who had been helped by Obamacare as well, including a friend with leukemia whose out-of-pocket expenses had been cut in half. At several points, the crowd clapped and cheered for him.\n\nNonetheless, Ryan defended his party\u2019s repeal votes \u2014 51 in total \u2014 noting that some of them only aimed to chip away at particular parts of Obamacare. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have 51 votes to repeal it altogether 51 times,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of this urban legend\u2026there are many pieces of this law that we went after.\u201d\n\nWatch it:\n\nRyan\u2019s own plan to replace Obamacare, the Patients\u2019 Choice Act, was unveiled back in 2009. Although that plan lacks some of the consumer protections in Obamacare, it also incorporates some of the same provisions that made it into the health law. Ryan admitted last year that Obamacare does include some ideas that Republicans \u201chave always been talking about.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t stopped him from repeatedly introducing budget proposals to repeal the law.\n\nMartincic said he and his wife are still deciding whether to go through with the insurance switch, but he\u2019s grateful to have the option. When ThinkProgress asked him whether he thinks Ryan sees the people like himself, who could benefit from Obamacare, Martincic shook his head. \u201cHe misses it.\u201d\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nMARTINCIC: What Obama did was get this law passed. Whether it\u2019s good, bad, or not, it got passed. It\u2019s actually helping some people grow, helped this other guy [with] medication. The Republicans\u2026.By myself\u2026I could actually\u2026get some kind of subsidy, which would help me\u2026\n\nRYAN: With the ACA, one thing I want to say is we didn\u2019t have 51 votes to repeal it altogether 51 times. I think that\u2019s sort of like this urban legend that we said, \u2018let\u2019s repeal it.\u2019 It\u2019s like we did a repeal vote on the whole law. There are many pieces of this law that we\u2019ve gone after\u2014several of them that were made into law, so please know\u2014I think even Democrats would acknowledge that there are a lot of problems with this law. And so we passed a lot of things changing this law\u2014several of which were made into law\u2014but I really do believe there\u2019s a better way to do it than with this health care law.\n\nMy argument is that I think there are better ways at dealing with these extremely important and legitimate problems, like people with preexisting conditions\u2014this is why I\u2019m a big fan of risk pools. We had the [??] system in Wisconsin\u2014it worked well, and then it had the federal government attached to it, so it was even more affordable for people with preexisting conditions. That was one of our proposals. So I do think that there are better ways of fixing this problem\u2014affordable coverage for everybody, including people with preexisting conditions that\u2019s a lot better than [this law]. It\u2019s going to hurt our hospitals, it\u2019s going to hurt Medicare, it\u2019s going to make people buy things they don\u2019t want to buy.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "This Wisconsin voter could end up saving $500 per month, thanks to Obamacare, and wants to know why his congressman is working hard to repeal it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "This Wisconsin voter could end up saving $500 per month, thanks to Obamacare, and wants to know why his congressman is working hard to repeal it.", "title": "Paul Ryan Gets An Earful From Constituent Who Will Save Hundreds Under Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/20/3416783/paul-ryan-constituent-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/paul-ryan-hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This Wisconsin voter could end up saving $500 per month, thanks to Obamacare, and wants to know why his congressman is working hard to repeal it.", "creator": "@smkeyes", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/paul-ryan-hands-321x214.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan Gets An Earful From Constituent Who Will Save Hundreds Under Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/paul-ryan-hands.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/paul-ryan-hands.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-20T09:01:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b42\"", "article_summary": "Health Paul Ryan Gets An Earful From Constituent Who Will Save Hundreds Under Obamacare CREDIT:RACINE, Wisconsin \u2014 Rep.
