(As I\u2019ve argued, the use of capital mobility as a cudgel against workers\u2019 organizing is all-too common, though it was an exceptional spectacle to see Republicans fighting full-throttle to bust a union drive while corporate management officially laid down arms.) Others may have voted \u201cno\u201d based on private conversations with lower-level managers, some of whom allegedly veered far from Volkwagen\u2019s official non-union-busting script. Some number presumably were philosophically anti-union from the start and remained so through the election\u2019s unexpected end. (As Cornell\u2019s Kate Bronfenbrenner notes, the South is no monolith, but the Chattanooga plant\u2019s demographics could be expected to offer a more daunting challenge than its less-white, less-male counterparts elsewhere in the region).\n\nA change in any of those variables could have been enough to flip the less-than-50 additional votes that the union needed to eke out a victory Friday night, and set the stage for the German-style \u201cworks council\u201d experiment that both UAW and VW declared themselves eager to pursue. But the UAW\u2019s failure to surmount them also illustrates the downsides of its high-profile emphasis on compromise, cooperation and conciliation with management. Along with attacks for allegedly bankrupting Detroit, the UAW was knocked for new-hire wages there that don\u2019t dramatically outpace VW\u2019s, and for pre-committing that a union contract wouldn\u2019t dampen any competitive advantage for the company.\n\nVW employee and \u201cNo 2 UAW\u201d website creator Mike Burton told In These Times\u2019 Mike Elk he was \u201cnot anti-union\u201d but \u201canti-UAW,\u201d and that \u201cWhat the UAW is offering, we can already do without them.\u201d Anti-union employee activist Mike Jarvis told the Washington Post\u2019s Lydia DePillis that he won over undecideds by pointing out a clause in the UAW\u2019s neutrality deal with VW stating that \u201cany future agreements shall be guided\u201d by considerations including \u201cmaintaining and where possible enhancing the cost advantages and other competitive advantages that VWGOA enjoys \u2026\u201d\n\nThat concession, along with union pressure from the U.S. and abroad, helped secure VW\u2019s agreement not to fight unionization \u2013 no small thing in a country where workers who organize can expect a gauntlet of threats, interrogations and firings, and where even those who win recognition are often stonewalled by revanchist bosses. While the law tells U.S. workers it\u2019s up to them whether to collectively bargain, under our creaky, craven legal regime, few companies actually recognize and bargain in good faith with unions unless they\u2019re enticed or coerced to. Different unions (and often the same union, sometimes in the same campaign) approach that task wielding different sticks and carrots \u2013 from mounting strikes or legal attacks, to proffering pro-business lobbying or pre-committing to cheaper contracts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans promising retribution, and a union promising deference, add up to a devastating union defeat", "title": "The right\u2019s union-busting disgrace: How it won Tennessee\u2019s high-stakes auto fight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans promising retribution, and a union promising deference, add up to a devastating union defeat", "title": "The right\u2019s union-busting disgrace: How it won Tennessee\u2019s high-stakes auto fight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/19/the_rights_union_busting_disgrace_how_it_won_tennessees_high_stakes_auto_fight/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bob_corker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans promising retribution, and a union promising deference, add up to a devastating union defeat", "title": "The right\u2019s union-busting disgrace: How it won Tennessee\u2019s high-stakes auto fight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bob_corker.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bob Corker, Editor's Picks, Labor, Tennessee, UAW, Union, union busting, United Auto Workers, Volkswagen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Bob Corker, Editor's Picks, Labor, Tennessee, UAW, Union, union busting, United Auto Workers, Volkswagen, Business News, News, Politics NewsThere\u2019s no shortage of culprits for the United Auto Workers\u2019 surprise defeat in last week\u2019s closely watched Volkswagen vote, in which Chattanooga workers rejected becoming the only unionized employees at a fully foreign-owned auto plant in the United States.\nBut the UAW\u2019s failure to surmount them also illustrates the downsides of its high-profile emphasis on compromise, cooperation and conciliation with management.\nSome number presumably were philosophically anti-union from the start and remained so through the election\u2019s unexpected end.\nOthers may have voted \u201cno\u201d based on private conversations with lower-level managers, some of whom allegedly veered far from Volkwagen\u2019s official non-union-busting script.\nDifferent unions (and often the same union, sometimes in the same campaign) approach that task wielding different sticks and carrots \u2013 from mounting strikes or legal attacks, to proffering pro-business lobbying or pre-committing to cheaper contracts."}
