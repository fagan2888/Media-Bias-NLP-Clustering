Sanders' campaign is expected to focus heavily on climate change, the growing gap between rich and poor and the contraction of America's middle class, which is shrinking even as corporations and the wealthy grow richer than ever. In 2013, he railed against a pro-corporate conservative agenda that is exacerbating the yawning gap between 'haves' and 'have-nots': \"The real issue here, if you look at the Koch Brothers' agenda, is, look at what many of the extreme right-wing people believe. Obamacare is just the tip of the iceberg. These people want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage, they want to privatize the Veteran's Administration, they want to privatize Social Security, end Medicare as we know it, massive cuts in Medicaid, wipe out the EPA, you don't have an Environmental Protection Agency anymore, Department of Energy gone, Department of Education gone. That is the agenda. And many people don't understand that the Koch Brothers have poured hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into the Tea Party and to other kinds of ancillary organizations to push this agenda.\" Recently, Sanders has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which he says will further harm America's middle class. \"If you want to understand why the middle class in America is disappearing and why we have more wealth and income inequality in America than we have had since the late 1920s, you have to address the issue of trade,\u201d Sanders told Vermont Public Radio in a recent phone interview. \"All of the major corporations want to continue with this trade policy. Wall Street wants to continue this trade policy,\" he added. \"The drug companies want to continue this trade policy. But organizations representing American workers and the environment do not want to continue the trade policy. They want new trade policies.\" President Barack Obama supports neoliberal economic policies, including TPP. Hillary Clinton also has a history of backing neoliberalism, pitting her squarely against Sanders and the handful of other progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is often mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential candidate despite her repeated declarations that she is not running.
