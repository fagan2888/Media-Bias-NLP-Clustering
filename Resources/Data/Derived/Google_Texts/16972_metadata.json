(Well, for those of you who live in the USA anyway.) Executive orders are much in the news lately, particularly given Speaker Boehner\u2019s pending lawsuit, but those are orders at the federal level, signed by the President. These are all available online and are fully searchable. What about the executive orders signed by the governors in each of the fifty states?\n\nAttkisson points us to a new study by The Sunlight Foundation which examines how well each state makes this information available to the public.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that although executive orders in many states are quite powerful, and while they\u2019re generally issued more infrequently than bills are passed, they\u2019re rarely subject to the same filing and publication requirements as other governing documents \u2014 proposed legislation, for example. Since executive orders are a matter of public record, all states must make them accessible to the public in some form \u2014 but, as we know, accessibility per the letter of the law and substantive openness are rarely one and the same.\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation used five criteria to measure how \u201copen\u201d these records are to the public.\n\nAre executive orders available online?\n\nAre orders uploaded in a timely fashion?\n\nIs the data presented in a commonly owned format (e.g. HTML or PDF)?\n\nIs the text machine-processable\u2014can you search and find text, or are they unsearchable scans?\n\nFor what period of time are executive orders available? For the current year? Current term? Previous governor\u2019s term? Since the beginning of time?\n\nFollow the link to look at the list, but the top and bottom rated states may be of interest. Each state received a grade ranging from A (most transparent) to F (least transparent). Seven states received an A:\n\nAlaska\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nTexas\n\nWashington\n\nFive states received an F:\n\nColorado\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii\n\nMississippi\n\nNevada\n\nI\u2019ve stared at this list for a while and there seems to be no rhyme or reason. Of course, that may be because some of these laws have been on the books for a while and they don\u2019t all get updated promptly. But it\u2019s still tough to find some metric whereby you wind up lumping Michigan and Washington into the same group with Texas and Kentucky. The other side of the coin is no better. What do Hawaii and Mississippi have in common?\n\nIn any event, feel free to look up your own state and see how you did. Shockingly, New York came in with a B. And it\u2019s true, I had very little trouble finding their data when I needed it. But in the 21st century, this information should be readily available to everyone in every state.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Pen but no phone", "title": "Secrecy of states on governors\u2019 executive orders", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/07/26/secrecy-of-states-on-governors-executive-orders/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "executive order, governors, transparency, U.S. states,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T23:01:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T20:53:11+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca42c\"", "article_summary": "Seven states received an A:AlaskaKentuckyLouisianaMichiganMinnesotaTexasWashingtonFive states received an F:ColoradoGeorgiaHawaiiMississippiNevadaI\u2019ve stared at this list for a while and there seems to be no rhyme or reason.\nExecutive orders are much in the news lately, particularly given Speaker Boehner\u2019s pending lawsuit, but those are orders at the federal level, signed by the President.\nWhat about the executive orders signed by the governors in each of the fifty states?\nAre executive orders available online?\nFor what period of time are executive orders available?"}
