Ho ho! Singer\u2019s got to go!\u201d The protests were organized by Not Dead Yet, a \u201cnational, grassroots disability rights group that opposes legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia as deadly forms of discrimination against old, ill and disabled people,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website.\n\nSinger states on his faculty page that \u201ckilling a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince about 1980, Singer has promoted public policy that would legalize the killing of disabled infants in the first month of life,\u201d Stephen Drake, a research analyst for Not Dead Yet, said in a press release. \u201cMore recently, he has expanded his position in the context of health care rationing.\u201d\n\nWatch: Disability activists call for Singer's resignation\n\nThe organization started an online petition calling for Singer\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe petition, which has over 800 signatures, lays out a series of demands for university and state officials, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). The petitioners demand that university officials at Princeton \u201cimmediately call for Professor Singer\u2019s resignation,\u201d and \u201cpublicly disavow Singer\u2019s statements that both devalue the lives of people with disabilities and advocate public policies that would end those lives.\u201d\n\nThe petition also demands \u201c[t]hat the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Chris Christie publicly denounce the lethal and discriminatory public health care policy advocated by Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer.\u201d\n\nThe petition argues that Singer\u2019s comments qualify as hate speech, and thus are not protected by academic freedom policies:\n\n\u201cFor those who may worry that Singer\u2019s words deserve the protection of academic freedom, Princeton\u2019s own policy on Respect for Others strikes a balance which the University has sadly ignored: \u2018As an intellectual community, [Princeton] attaches great value to freedom of expression and vigorous debate, but it also attaches great importance to mutual respect, and it deplores expressions of hatred directed against any individual or group.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than challenging Singer\u2019s advocacy as a form of hate speech, Princeton University has provided Singer with a prominent platform and increased access to US media and policymakers for 16 years, establishing itself as the home for the worst of overt \u2013 and deadly \u2013 bigotry against disabled people of all ages,\u201d the press release states.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @peterjhasson", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6597/Princeton.jpg", "description": "The activists took issue with Singer declaring in April that healthcare policy under Obamacare has already led doctors to kill disabled babies, an action he deemed \u201creasonable.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "The activists took issue with Singer declaring in April that healthcare policy under Obamacare has already led doctors to kill disabled babies, an action he deemed \u201creasonable.\u201d", "title": "Disability activists protest Princeton Prof. Peter Singer", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6597", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6597/Princeton.jpg", "height": 600}, "author": "Peter Hasson", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6597/Princeton.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",Peter Singer, Bioethics, Disability, Abortion, Right to Life, Pro Life, Peter Hasson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "published_time": "2015-06-16 10:21:32.0", "description": "The activists took issue with Singer declaring in April that healthcare policy under Obamacare has already led doctors to kill disabled babies, an action he deemed \u201creasonable.\u201d", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-06-16 10:21:32.0"}, "twitter": {"description": "The activists took issue with Singer declaring in April that healthcare policy under Obamacare has already led doctors to kill disabled babies, an action he deemed \u201creasonable.\u201d", "title": "Disability activists protest Princeton Prof. Peter Singer", "image": {"src": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6597/Princeton.jpg"}, "creator": "@peterjhasson", "site": "@campusreform", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdae7\"", "article_summary": "Disability activists take over Princeton, call for pro-euthanasia professor to resignScores of disability activists descended upon Princeton University last week to demand the resignation of Professor Peter Singer.\n\u201cMore recently, he has expanded his position in the context of health care rationing.\u201dWatch: Disability activists call for Singer's resignationThe organization started an online petition calling for Singer\u2019s resignation.\nThe petition, which has over 800 signatures, lays out a series of demands for university and state officials, including New Jersey Gov.\nThe activists took issue with Singer declaring in April that healthcare policy under Obamacare has already led doctors to kill disabled babies, an action he deemed \u201creasonable.\u201dThe activists, many of whom were in wheelchairs, blocked traffic and chanted \u201cHey hey!\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @peterjhasson"}
