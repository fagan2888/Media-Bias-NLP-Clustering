“Vampire Diaries” star Nina Dobrev wants to make a point and will take off her top to do it.





On her WhoSay account, the actress posted a pic of herself, holding a cardboard sign across her naked chest that read, "#getcovered," a reference to President Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Dobrev explained, "Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go and #GetCovered. Because w/o it, youre naked."

Nina's provocative take on the grassroots campaign has so far generated nearly 94,000 likes.

Other Hollywood celebs who've shown off their own homemade signs in support of Obamacare include Rosario Dawson, Connie Britton, Kerry Washington, and Kate Bosworth.
