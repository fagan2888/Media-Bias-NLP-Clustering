Because women practice religion in greater numbers than men, author Helen Alvare argues that \u201cgovernment\u2019s attack on religious freedom hurts women more than men.\u201d Alvare decries the Administration for treating all women as a uniform bloc, but she has no issue asserting that all women must be hurt by these alleged attacks on religious freedom.\n\nThis article plays on an underlying premise of mutual exclusivity \u2014 of \u201ceither-or\u201d \u2014 between a woman\u2019s faith and her right to access health care, especially reproductive health care. It\u2019s an uneasy trope that crops up in other conservative articles and resources.\n\nFor example, in a video produced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, we see the affecting imagery of three women speaking on conscience rights relating to health care. Another article suggests that the Affordable Care Act infantilizes independent young women. Another notes that since some \u201csingle moms working two jobs\u201d are willing to work for Hobby Lobby, the craft chain whose challenge to Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate is headed to the Supreme Court, things just can\u2019t be that bad.\n\nThese authors\u2019 and spokeswomen\u2019s opinions are theirs to hold. Their experiences are valid and theirs to speak to, and their beliefs are theirs to live out as far as the law allows. But the same goes for women on the other side.\n\nIn fact, this adversarial relationship between religious conscience and reproductive justice is a false one \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t hold up under religious-moral or feminist scrutiny.\n\nFrom a religious point of view, this either-or argument subtly suggests that \u201cgood\u201d women or \u201creal\u201d women must choose religious beliefs that require them to stand by the for-profit corporations that are fighting the Affordable Care Act. It is a difficult leap from church to commerce that requires a strange understanding of the First Amendment, in which corporations have consciences and business owners \u2014 who are legally separated from their corporations \u2014 are empowered to exercise religion in a way that includes imposing their beliefs and will onto their employees\u2019 consciences and needs.\n\nBut there are faithful men and women who recognize a more nuanced understanding of the First Amendment and the law. They believe that people, not corporations, have consciences and exercise religious beliefs, and that the law is meant to protect society\u2019s less powerful from the will of the more powerful, especially from compulsory participation in religion. For those religious people, allowing business owners to impose their consciences on their employees\u2019 actions raises many uncomfortable issues. As has been argued elsewhere, could a Christian Scientist business owner stop offering insurance altogether to their employees? Could Quakers stop paying all of their taxes because some of them fund wars or the prison industrial complex?\n\nMore importantly, there are men and women whose religious beliefs compel them to see the necessity of reproductive justice as grounded in their faith and, even, scriptural understandings. Many faith leaders have recognized that reproductive health care is part of a larger, contextual frame of \u201cjustice and dignity for all God\u2019s people.\u201d As Rabbi Dennis Ross recently explained, \u201c\u2026the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and other groups, endorsed the moral good in access to birth control some 80 years ago.\u201d Many people don\u2019t know that the the Catholic Church nearly lifted its ban on contraceptives in the 1960s. Even America\u2019s colonial puritans were more accepting of abortion than modern conservatives are of contraception.\n\nAnd more broadly, not all church groups are opposed to the health law \u2014 many have been vital partners in spreading the word about Obamacare enrollment \u2014 and activists of faith have fought for reproductive justice at the state level. That\u2019s because reproductive justice is not inherently in conflict with organized religion. In fact, it melds with the sacred and the moral when it allows men and women\u2019s lives to flourish more fully for themselves and their families.\n\nFrom the feminist perspective, conservatives pushing an adversarial relationship between women\u2019s religion and a belief in reproductive justice twist some of the basic ideals of those who work every day for women\u2019s rights. They attempt to speak for all women, even claiming that women\u2019s religiosity means that their religious liberty is being hurt more than men\u2019s. In doing so, they ignore the voices of the 99 percent of American women who have used birth control, the almost 60 percent of women who use it for reasons beyond preventing pregnancy, and the 82 percent of Catholics who say that birth control is \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Those personal experiences are just as valid as the experiences of the women advocating for their own, problematic version of religious liberty. They don\u2019t make women less committed to preserving religious freedom, but rather speak to the fact that the First Amendment protects everyone\u2019s conscience, not just a few.\n\nDissenting views from women deserve a space in the public square (here, Alvare might actually agree). But dissent doesn\u2019t necessarily negate a whole law, even when religion is involved.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, the purpose of the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t paternalism. Expanding access to health care allows equality and opportunity to thrive \u2014 the same purpose that drives feminists and reproductive justice advocates, and the same purpose behind the freedom of religion enshrined in the First Amendment. When conservatives argue that women must choose between religion and access to health care, they simplify the complexity and flatten the depth of many women\u2019s \u2014 and men\u2019s \u2014 religious beliefs and commitment to American religious pluralism.\n\nEmily Baxter is the Special Assistant for the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative at American Progress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Many religious people don't believe they need to choose between their faith and access to reproductive health care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Many religious people don't believe they need to choose between their faith and access to reproductive health care.", "title": "Despite The Fights Over Religious Liberty, Obamacare Doesn\u2019t Have To Be \u2018Girl Versus God\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/07/3034801/religious-liberty-obamacare-feminism/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FE_PR_130103_prayingl425x283.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FE_PR_130103_prayingl425x283-321x214.jpg", "title": "Despite The Fights Over Religious Liberty, Obamacare Doesn\u2019t Have To Be \u2018Girl Versus God\u2019", "description": "Many religious people don't believe they need to choose between their faith and access to reproductive health care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThinkProgress"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FE_PR_130103_prayingl425x283.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FE_PR_130103_prayingl425x283.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-07T09:30:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e3b\"", "article_summary": "This article plays on an underlying premise of mutual exclusivity \u2014 of \u201ceither-or\u201d \u2014 between a woman\u2019s faith and her right to access health care, especially reproductive health care.\nHealth Despite The Fights Over Religious Liberty, Obamacare Doesn\u2019t Have To Be \u2018Girl Versus God\u2019 CREDIT:It\u2019s a recurring theme among opponents of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control provision: women can either be for religious liberty or for reproductive health care, but they cannot support both.\nIn fact, this adversarial relationship between religious conscience and reproductive justice is a false one \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t hold up under religious-moral or feminist scrutiny.\nThat\u2019s because reproductive justice is not inherently in conflict with organized religion.\nFor example, in a video produced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, we see the affecting imagery of three women speaking on conscience rights relating to health care."}
