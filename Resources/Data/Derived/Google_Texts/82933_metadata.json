This violates both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law, as promises were repeatedly made during the healthcare debates by President Obama and others that taxpayer funding for abortion would not occur.\n\nThe GAO report proves that the Senate must act now to protect Americans from financing abortion with their tax dollars, as Obamacare\u2019s weak taxpayer protections are ignored.\n\nThe House of Representatives took action back in January to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, H.R. 7 \u2014 a bill which would apply the Hyde Amendment to all federal funding, thereby precluding any government funding for abortion through Obamacare. The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act was first introduced in the Senate in May 2013 \u2014 however Harry Reid\u2019s pro-abortion Senate has been sitting on this bill for 16 months without giving it so much as a hearing.\n\nFor those looking for areas of bi-partisan agreement, a prohibition on taxpayer funding for abortion is a good place to start. During the healthcare debates, a Quinnipiac University National Poll found that more than seven out of ten Americans agree that their taxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for abortions \u2014 including people who identify themselves as pro-choice and pro-life. The abortion funding through Obamacare identified through the GAO report proves that this administration is out of touch with the views of most citizens of this country.\n\nAt a recent news conference with members of Congress, Americans United for Life General Counsel Ovide Lamontagne observed: \u201cSadly, Nancy Pelosi had it right when she said that Congress would have to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it. But there was one exception, and that was the clear command in the law that while insurance plans that cover abortion would be permitted to receive taxpayer funds through the new exchanges (in a departure from existing federal policy), those funds could not be used to directly pay for abortion. Without that assurance, Obamacare would not have passed.\u201d\n\nThe GAO report shows that the Obama administration is not enforcing its own accounting gimmick, which requires \u201cseparate payments\u201d for abortion premiums and \u201cseparate payment\u201d for premiums for real health care, in plans offered through the exchanges that include abortion coverage. This convoluted accounting scheme is shrouded in a secrecy clause in order to further obfuscate the covert abortion premium mandate from the American people. The Democrats suggested this accounting scheme in order to skirt around the requirements of the Hyde Amendment, claiming it kept private abortion dollars from co-mingling with taxpayer subsidized healthcare dollars. The GAO report proves that even this scheme has been ignored in practice.\n\nIn fact, the GAO surveyed several Obamacare insurance issuers and found that not one of the insurers surveyed is collecting separate payments for the abortion premium \u2014 and most insurance issuers are not even itemizing the amount of the premium that is being used to pay for abortions.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mary Therese Drury", "description": "Harry Reid refuses to bring up a bill that would stop the practice.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The release of a report on abortion funding in Obamacare from the non-partisan government watchdog, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), validates what pro-life advocates have been saying since", "title": "GAO Report Proves the Senate Must Act To Stop Abortion Funding In Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/22/gao-report-proves-the-senate-must-act-to-stop-abortion-funding-in-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harry Reid refuses to bring up a bill that would stop the practice.", "title": "GAO Report Proves the Senate Must Act To Stop Abortion Funding In Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/22/gao-report-proves-the-senate-must-act-to-stop-abortion-funding-in-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-22 18:03:13", "sailthru.title": "GAO Report Proves the Senate Must Act To Stop Abortion Funding In Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "abortion,gao,harry reid,obamacare,senate", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "abortion,gao,harry-reid,obamacare,senate", "sailthru.description": "The release of a report on abortion funding in Obamacare from the non-partisan government watchdog, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), validates what pro-life advocates have been saying since", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-17T184131Z_1_LYNXMPEA5G0Z2_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-BENGHAZI-e1405537356249.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffa5\"", "article_summary": "The abortion funding through Obamacare identified through the GAO report proves that this administration is out of touch with the views of most citizens of this country.\nThe House of Representatives took action back in January to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, H.R.\nThe GAO report proves that the Senate must act now to protect Americans from financing abortion with their tax dollars, as Obamacare\u2019s weak taxpayer protections are ignored.\nThe GAO report proves that even this scheme has been ignored in practice.\nFor those looking for areas of bi-partisan agreement, a prohibition on taxpayer funding for abortion is a good place to start."}
