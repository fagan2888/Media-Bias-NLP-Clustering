Wichita Police are investigating an aggravated battery after a man claims he was beaten up over statements he made about Donald Trump.

According to Sgt. Brian Sigmund of the Wichita Police Department, the 24-year-old man was walking in the area of 47th St. S. and Broadway around 3 a.m. on Saturday when the altercation happened.

The police report reads the man said "Donald Trump cannot be bought" and then a group of 30 people attacked the man.

Police say there might be circumstances involved with this case that lead the accusations to be untrue. The investigation is ongoing.

Nearby surveillance footage at a gas station is being acquired by police to see what happened.
