This couldn\u2019t have been farther from the truth.\n\nJodi Schmidt, Natasha\u2019s first-grade teacher, had invited Burleton to the school last week. Natasha has been living with Burleton for the past two years to take advantage of the specialized care at Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin nearby. Schmidt handed Burleton a pink, gift-wrapped box when she arrived. Inside was a present, and a note saying Schmidt would donate a kidney to Natasha.\n\nBurleton immediately put the happy news on Facebook, writing, \u201cThis wonderful lady named Jodi Schmidt is a teacher at Natasha\u2019s school\u2026 and she gave the best ever present to Tasha. Jodi is a match for Tasha to get a new kidney \u2026 so very, very thankful to Jodi and her family.\u201d\n\nNatasha has been sick since birth with prune belly syndrome, a group of birth defects that can cause urinary tract infections and poor abdominal muscle development. Natasha now requires kidney dialysis \u2014 Burleton accompanies the girl to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee three times a week. Natasha has renal failure and has been on the list for a transplant kidney for years.\n\n\u201cI just lost it,\u201d Burleton told HNGN. \u201cYou could never tell this little girl has three tubes in her, she doesn\u2019t let it faze her. She is happy and sassy, and she just wants to lead a normal life, and do things like swimming.\u201d\n\nSchmidt felt she was the right person to help Natasha.\n\n\u201cI figured, I\u2019m O-negative blood and \u2026 I think we\u2019re all brought to a certain place and time for a reason.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "natasha, fuller, 8, prune, belly, syndrome, gifted, kidney, her, teacher", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Break out the tissues.", "title": "Teacher Donates Kidney To Her 8-Year-Old Student", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prune-belly-syndrome-kidney-donor-transplant-377645", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/11/kidney.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Break out the tissues.", "title": "Teacher Donates Kidney To Her 8-Year-Old Student", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prune-belly-syndrome-kidney-donor-transplant-377645", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/11/kidney.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/kidney.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-11T17:02:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-11T17:02:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Break out the tissues."}, "article_summary": "Chris Burleton, the grandmother of eight-year-old Natasha Fuller, thought she was being called into the child\u2019s classroom because Natasha had been misbehaving.\nJodi Schmidt, Natasha\u2019s first-grade teacher, had invited Burleton to the school last week.\nNatasha now requires kidney dialysis \u2014 Burleton accompanies the girl to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee three times a week.\nInside was a present, and a note saying Schmidt would donate a kidney to Natasha.\nNatasha has renal failure and has been on the list for a transplant kidney for years."}
