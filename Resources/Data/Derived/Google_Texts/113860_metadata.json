The university is a top research university, with more than 13,500 students and schools of medicine, law, social work and architecture, among others.\n\nIn that time, Bernstein has helped lead academic strategic planning for a $1 billion capital campaign, and create new programs, such as an undergraduate studies in social innovation and social entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled and honored to be in this process and to be one of the finalists, and I\u2019m very excited to be here,\u201d Bernstein said after he arrived in Cedar Rapids Thursday. He declined to comment further, saying it\u2019s best to \u201clet the process do it\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nMichael Bernstein\n\nAge: 60\n\n60 Education: Earned four degrees from Yale University in economics: Bachelor of arts, 1976; master of arts, 1978; master of philosophy, 1980; and doctorate, 1982.\n\nEarned four degrees from Yale University in economics: Bachelor of arts, 1976; master of arts, 1978; master of philosophy, 1980; and doctorate, 1982.

Family: Wife, Patti; children, Eleanor, 26, and Claire, 20.\n\nTulane professors with ties to Iowa said Bernstein has cultivated the intellectual culture of the university \u2014 and sought innovative ways to address challenges, an approach he\u2019d likely bring to Iowa if selected as the institution\u2019s next president.\n\nA golfer and avid reader of crime fiction, Bernstein is also active in the New Orleans community, serving on boards such as the Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans, and chairing the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n\u201cI think the University of Iowa would be lucky to have him,\u201d said Karissa Haugeberg, an assistant professor of history at Tulane who earned her doctorate at the University of Iowa.\n\nProfessors reached Thursday said Bernstein comes across as a warm and personable leader who frequently attends student events and faculty meetings, and is open to new ideas and programs.\n\nThat\u2019s a key trait for a university president, especially one who will oversee a medical school, said Prasad Katakam, an assistant professor at Tulane\u2019s School of Medicine and the secretary of the graduate medical faculty.\n\n\u201cYou have to be innovative,\u201d he said, given changes to heath care since the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, became law. \u201cThese things are going to be very significant issues in the next coming years, and medical schools have a lot at stake, and a lot to adapt to. The ones who adapt faster are the ones who are going to do well.\u201d\n\nKatakam, who completed part of his postdoctoral fellowship at Iowa\u2019s College of Medicine, was impressed after Bernstein discussed his fundraising plans and saw how he handled faculty concerns about promotion.\n\nWhen research funding from the National Institutes of Health became more difficult to secure \u2014 a requirement of earning tenure at the medical school \u2014 Breinstein\u2019s approach became a \u201clifeline\u201d for those on the verge of getting funding, Katakam said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s new guidelines that allow a little more time, in terms of tenure, to secure funding. At the same time, he hasn\u2019t lowered the standards,\u201d he said. \u201cHe navigated the system, and he got everyone on board.\u201d\n\nBernstein\u2019s also been a supporter of the arts, including creative writing.\n\nHe went so far as encouraging the creation of a master of fine arts degree at Tulane, although one has not yet been established, said Peter Cooley, a professor of English who graduated from UI\u2019s Writers\u2019 Workshop.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very warm and enthusiastic person,\u201d Cooley said.\n\nFinalist town halls\n\nMichael Bernstein is the second of four finalists for the UI presidency.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019ll participate in a late afternoon public forum Friday from 4:45 to 6:15 p.m. in the main lounge of the Iowa Memorial Union.\n\n\u2022 Live video streaming of the public forums and a recording upon its conclusion will available on the UI presidential search website.\n\n\u2022 After the campus visits, Iowa Board of Regents is scheduled to meet Sept. 3 to interview the candidates and select a new president.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1Eru27x", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Michael Bernstein of Tulane University, and a presidential finalist at the University of Iowa", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Michael Bernstein of Tulane University, and a presidential finalist at the University of Iowa", "title": "Tulane provost is named UI president finalist", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2015/08/29/michael-bernstein-named-finalist-university-iowa-president/71294920/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Bernstein of Tulane University, and a presidential finalist at the University of Iowa", "title": "Tulane provost is named UI president finalist", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44533dc496045cae9089caa48a44228d00916166/c=0-390-1268-1658&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "mackenziearyan"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Medicine", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Medicine", "title": "Tulane provost is named UI president finalist", "author": "Mackenzie Ryan", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/education", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2989d12e291601cf32b799735ec442f962044e1/c=0-178-1268-1869/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92f1361eeef3a208fa8b46b7cb1355661d9cb843/c=0-390-1268-1658/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ca1aec9522cd0ab74e41bc4180166d1db6defca/c=0-548-1268-1499/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d26f17fac0136875d6bdb2888e99424d267a9575/c=0-668-1268-1381&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-29T10:06:33.307000-05:00", "shorthed": "Tulane provost UI president finalist", "articleid": 71294920, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/391a6aef620af7f213b31ad302927d146efe308e/c=0-668-1268-1381/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21ac43a9acdfdcc3316d790bafa63ad0a35cfc1e/c=58-0-1210-2048/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DesMoines/B9318620925Z.1_20150828063707_000_GMCBO8LID.4-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Michael Bernstein, University of Iowa, Tulane University, New Orleans, Iowa City"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1894\"", "article_summary": "Recent administrative experience: Currently the senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at Tulane University.\nCurrently the senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at Tulane University.\nMichael Bernstein has served as a senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at Tulane since 2007.\nEarned four degrees from Yale University in economics: Bachelor of arts, 1976; master of arts, 1978; master of philosophy, 1980; and doctorate, 1982.\nTaught at Princeton University for five years before joining UC San Diego in 1987, where he served as a history professor and department chair."}
