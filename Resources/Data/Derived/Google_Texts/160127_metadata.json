If given the chance, he says he would ask the pope to pray for his family, persecuted Christians, and unborn children and their mothers.\n\nWhile Pope Francis is officially traveling to the United States to attend the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, a conference held every three years and created in 1994 by Pope John Paul II to \u201cstrengthen the sacred bonds of families across the globe,\u201d he will first stop in Washington before moving on to New York City and then Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday, he will visit the White House before riding in a parade, hosting a midday prayer with U.S. bishops at St. Matthew\u2019s Cathedral, and finally saying the canonization mass of Junipero Serra, an 18th-century Spanish Franciscan friar who served as a missionary in Mexico and California, at the Shrine.\n\nWhile in New York, Pope Francis has plans to address the United Nations General Assembly, hold an interfaith service at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and World Trade Center, and, again, ride in a motorcade parade.\n\nDuring his time in the States, Pope Francis will also spend considerable time ministering to the poor, imprisoned, and underprivileged.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, he is estimated to conduct seven meetings with \u201cordinary people\u201d throughout his stay. Previous pontiffs have, according to that same report, made two such visits at most.\n\n\u201cWhereas John Paul II was trained as an academic philosopher, and Cardinal Ratzinger and then Pope Benedict was trained as an academic theologian, Pope Francis, I think his primary identity would be as a pastor,\u201d says Ryan T. Anderson, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cI think Francis has a different papacy. I think he is not so much speaking to high-level global debates \u2026 he is trying to reach out in a field hospital way.\u201d\n\nExperts like Kathryn Jean Lopez\u2014a senior fellow with the National Review Institute and founding director of Catholic Voices USA\u2014believe that this focus on ministry has succeeded in striking a chord with a global audience, leaving onlookers speculating as to whether or not a \u201cmore popular pope,\u201d so to speak, could draw larger crowds in the nation\u2019s capital than previously seen during papal visits.\n\n\u201cPeople see Jesus Christ in this man because he\u2019s looking you in the eye, and he\u2019s embracing you. So much of the power in his communications is the gestures,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWhen he kneels down in a confessional on live TV, as he has done now on more than one occasion at St. Peter\u2019s, this is a man who starts a conversation with, \u2018I am a sinner.\u2019 That\u2019s how he identifies himself, and that is compelling to people, that is welcoming to people.\u201d\n\nCUA student Gonnerman says the pope\u2019s \u201cstrong emphasis on mercy\u201d as well as his insistence upon \u201cthe need to care for the poor and the environment\u201d is something he\u2019s personally delighted in. \u201cI have two dear friends who have come back to the church because of Pope Francis,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen asked what he would say to the Holy Father if given the chance, Gonnerman pauses, at last declaring quietly, \u201cThank you, I suppose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Next week, Pope Francis will make his first visit to the United States as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Next week, Pope Francis will make his first visit to the United States as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.", "title": "How Washington Plans to Welcome Pope Francis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Pope-Francis.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-21T18:14:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YhkCBT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Next week, Pope Francis will make his first visit to the United States as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.", "title": "How Washington Plans to Welcome Pope Francis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Pope-Francis.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "diplomacy", "published_time": "2015-09-18T03:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-21T18:14:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church, Washington, D.C., United States"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI have two dear friends who have come back to the church because of Pope Francis,\u201d he says.\nDuring his time in the States, Pope Francis will also spend considerable time ministering to the poor, imprisoned, and underprivileged.\nWhile in New York, Pope Francis has plans to address the United Nations General Assembly, hold an interfaith service at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and World Trade Center, and, again, ride in a motorcade parade.\n\u201cI think Francis has a different papacy.\nBoersma, who will head to Andrews Air Force Base with his wife and a group of young adult Catholics from across the Archdiocese of Washington on Tuesday to greet Pope Francis when he lands, says he hopes \u201cto get close enough to make eye contact\u201d with the pontiff."}
