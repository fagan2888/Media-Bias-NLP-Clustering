The primary is May 24, and early voting runs through May 20.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s get rid of the (Environmental Protection Agency),\u201d said former U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, after listing departments he\u2019d put on the chopping block. \u201cWould you all like to see that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of departments that need to be cut, but if you want to get at the real costs, you\u2019re going to go after the big drivers \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\u201d incumbent Doug Collins said.\n\n\u201cI think the (Department of Veteran Affairs) needs to be privatized because the private sector can render medical care better, and that means we need to get rid of Obamacare totally,\u201d Roger Fitzpatrick said.\n\nBernie Fontaine, a Vietnam veteran, talked about the long distances veterans have to go for health care. As to the VA: \u201cWe need to roll some heads at the top and kick some butt at the bottom,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the worst things this country ever did was implementing the income tax,\u201d Mike Scupin said. \u201c...We need to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service; we need to go to the (national retail sales tax).\u201d\n\nThe event got heated when the federal omnibus bill, which fully funded Planned Parenthood, was mentioned in a question by one of the audience members.\n\n\u201cIf you would have gotten Planned Parenthood out of the omnibus, then you would have done it, but you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Collins said.\n\nBefore he could explain his answer further, he was loudly booed by several audience members.\n\nThe audience reaction drew a sharp response from Fitzpatrick.\n\n\u201cShow some respect, please,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his allotted time to respond to the question, Fitzpatrick said he wouldn\u2019t have voted for the bill. \u201cAnything that would violate the moral conscience \u2026 you cannot vote for those sorts of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not have voted for the omnibus bill,\u201d Broun said. \u201cThe way I vote is (based on whether a bill is) biblically correct, constitutional, do we need it and can afford it.\u201d\n\nFontaine said Congress in general has a \u201csystemic problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get a whole lot of new people \u2026 and new leadership up there and change the system,\u201d he said.\n\nScupin ramped up criticism of Collins in his response.\n\nThe \u201cDoug Collins dog-and-pony show doesn\u2019t just happen with Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happens with nearly every vote he makes up there.\u201d\n\nOne thing the candidates were unanimous on was their support for Trump.\n\n\u201cOf course, I support him,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201c... What we have to do is look at not what you like but what the country needs.\u201d\n\nScupin gave his support but said Trump \u201crose to the top \u2026 because of the (GOP\u2019s) failure to do the right thing when they had the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump is \u201cthe people\u2019s choice,\u201d Broun said, adding he didn\u2019t want to see \u201cthe establishment in Washington try to steal (it) away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal: There\u2019s nobody in this room that\u2019s going to be happy with Hillary Clinton in the White House,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cWhoever (wins) \u2026 you\u2019ve got to work with, and if (Trump) does something I don\u2019t like, he needs to be called out on it,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/116834/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2016/05/09/0510FORUM_0001.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Get rid of the IRS, the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Education and even U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has waffled over his support for Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president.", "title": "9th District U.S. House candidates cite federal agencies, programs they\u2019d end in town hall"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "9th District U.S. House candidates cite federal agencies, programs they\u2019d end in town hall"}, "article_summary": "Removal of established programs and people was a common theme during a town hall meeting Monday night at the Brenau Downtown Center, featuring GOP candidates seeking the 9th District seat in the U.S. House.\n\u201cIt happens with nearly every vote he makes up there.\u201dOne thing the candidates were unanimous on was their support for Trump.\nThose without photo ID may obtain free voter ID card at Elections and Registrars Office or Department of Driver Services.\n\u201cIf you would have gotten Planned Parenthood out of the omnibus, then you would have done it, but you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Collins said.\nAs to the VA: \u201cWe need to roll some heads at the top and kick some butt at the bottom,\u201d he said."}
