Eggleston.\n\nThe 8th Circuit\u2019s decision \u201creaffirms that the U.S. Constitution protects women from the legislative attacks of politicians who would deny them their right to safely and legally end a pregnancy,\u201d Ms. Northup said.\n\nThe ruling, however, went far beyond upholding current Supreme Court precedent on abortion: It said there are \u201cgood reasons for the Court to reevaluate its jurisprudence\u201d on abortion, particularly its \u201cviability standard,\u201d which the panel of judges said \u201cwill prove even less workable in the future.\u201d\n\nThe three judges noted that the Supreme Court has tied viability to \u201cdevelopments in obstetrics, not to developments in the unborn.\u201d\n\nAs a result, they wrote, a 24-week-old fetus in the 1970s would have been deemed nonviable, but infants today \u2014 like Amillia Taylor, who was born at 21 weeks gestation \u2014 are surviving at much earlier ages.\n\nThe appellate court didn\u2019t accept Dr. Jerry Obritsch\u2019s argument that children conceived through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) live outside the womb for a few days, thus making viability at conception a reality. Neither the Supreme Court nor the medical community use such a definition of viability, wrote 8th Circuit Judges Bobby E. Shepherd, Lavenski R. Smith and William Duane Benton.\n\nHowever, \u201cas IVF and similar technologies improve, we can reasonably expect the amount of time an \u2018embryonic unborn child\u2019 may survive outside the womb will only increase,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe judges also noted that other \u201cunderlying\u201d facts of Roe v. Wade \u201cmay have changed.\u201d Both Norma McCorvey, the woman in Roe, and Sandra Cano, the woman in Doe v. Bolton, oppose the rulings made in their names. Also, Roe\u2019s assumptions that women would always make abortion decisions \u201cin close consultation\u201d with their doctors, or that women would not suffer ill effects post-abortion, have not held up over time, according to testimonies to the court.\n\n\u201cIn short, the continued application of the Supreme Court\u2019s viability standard discounts the legislative branch\u2019s recognized interest in protecting unborn children,\u201d the judges said.\n\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said Wednesday his office was reviewing the decision. After that, \u201cwe will make a determination of what further action, if any, is advisable,\u201d he said, according to the Grand Forks Herald.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who signed the 2013 law, was traveling and unavailable to comment on Wednesday, his spokesman said.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s first-in-the-nation \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law passed with bipartisan support and represented \u201cthe will of the people,\u201d pro-life advocate Janne Myrdal said last year.\n\nThe law \u2014 which has never gone into effect due to court rulings \u2014 bans abortions, except in cases of medical emergency, once a fetal heartbeat is detected. Doctors who violate the law face felony charges and license revocation.\n\n\u201cThough we are obviously disappointed by the ultimate outcome of the case, the Eighth Circuit gave us a thoughtful decision that outlines the many impervious, unwise and plainly unscientific aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence,\u201d said Penny Nance, president and chief executive of Concerned Women for America (CWA).\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the court\u2019s careful approach at this difficult issue,\u201d Ms. Nance said.\n\n\u201cYou know we have a problem in our country on this issue when courts are required to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cviability\u201d ignoring many medical professionals and clear scientific advances. The Eighth Circuit itself recognizes that \u2018the [Supreme] Court\u2019s viability standard has proven unsatisfactory\u2019,\u201d said Ms. Myrdal, state director for CWA of North Dakota.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation's first law to ban most abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is heard -- around six weeks of pregnancy -- lost in court again Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The nation\u2019s first law to ban most abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is heard \u2014 around six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 lost in court again Wednesday.", "title": "\u2018Fetal heartbeat\u2019 law struck down in North Dakota", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/22/fetal-heartbeat-law-struck-down-in-north-dakota/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/1719b8d3aed9f0207c0f6a7067004425.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/1719b8d3aed9f0207c0f6a7067004425.jpg", "description": "The nation's first law to ban most abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is heard -- around six weeks of pregnancy -- lost in court again Wednesday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Fetal heartbeat\u2019 law struck down in North Dakota"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Supreme Court, Court Of Appeals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7cf\"", "article_summary": "The Eighth Circuit itself recognizes that \u2018the [Supreme] Court\u2019s viability standard has proven unsatisfactory\u2019,\u201d said Ms. Myrdal, state director for CWA of North Dakota.\nCircuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court ruling striking down the 2013 law.\nBecause Supreme Court precedent \u201cdoes not permit us to reach a contrary result, we affirm,\u201d said a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s first-in-the-nation \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law passed with bipartisan support and represented \u201cthe will of the people,\u201d pro-life advocate Janne Myrdal said last year.\nThe nation\u2019s first law to ban most abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is heard \u2014 around six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 lost in court again Wednesday."}
