The head of a think tank popular with many Republican health policymakers has come out with a proposal for replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) commercial health insurance provisions.

Sally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute (PRI), has published The Way Out of Obamacare. Her team is promoting the book as "an actionable blueprint" for replacing PPACA with market-based programs.
