Democrats sensed an opportunity in the 2014 election, when Gov. Sam Brownback's popularity had seemingly flagged and Sen. Pat Roberts looking vulnerable in his bid for another six years in Washington, D.C. But Paul Davis, the former House minority leader from Lawrence, failed to overcome Brownback, and the party didn't run anyone against Roberts, instead pinning its hopes on independent Greg Orman, who also lost. In all, it was a demoralizing election for the Kansas Democrats.\n\nAs the summer of 2015 winds down, Kansas Democrats are wrestling with how to come back.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking to re-message how we speak about our party and our issues. At the end of election cycle, as you well know, we are Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Obamacare, Obama, anything bad they can figure out going on in Washington, and the Republicans brand us,\u201d Meeker told the Eagle this week. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are. Kansas Democrats are very different from Massachusetts Democrats or California Democrats.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but that doesn't necessarily mean they want to demonize Obamacare.\n\nThe state party struggles from an internal tug-of-war. On one hand, the party is viewed by some out-state Democrats as too devoted to the interests of traditional Democratic strongholds in Douglas, Wyandotte and Shawnee counties (along with portions of Sedgwick). On the other hand, the party is viewed by some progressives as too obsequious to Kansas Republicans.\n\nDonors haven't lavished money on the KDP's coffers, which, as of the most recent reporting cycle, had just $37,000 in the bank. The turmoil over the party's direction hasn't helped \u2014 and now has proven to be untenable for Meeker.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Lake Quivira Mayor Larry Meeker won't shepherd the Kansas Democratic Party to the right after all.\n The Pitch\u00a0has confirmed reports by the Wichita...", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://r2.pitch.com/files/base/scomm/kcp/image/2015/08/960w/imgres_1.jpg", "site_name": "Kansas City Pitch", "description": "Former Lake Quivira Mayor Larry Meeker won't shepherd the Kansas Democratic Party to the right after all.\n The Pitch\u00a0has confirmed reports by the Wichita...", "title": "Larry Meeker steps down as chairman of the Kansas Democratic Party"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "kc6h9aovh2ev_gwrAZgCxqsLmpdru1BedxO99dZpJVo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c67\"", "article_summary": "Meeker's comments irked progressives who already view the Kansas Democratic Party as too conciliatory to Kansas Republicans, particularly on social issues.\nFormer Lake Quivira Mayor Larry Meeker won't shepherd the Kansas Democratic Party to the right after all.\nKansas Democrats are very different from Massachusetts Democrats or California Democrats.\u201dMaybe, but that doesn't necessarily mean they want to demonize Obamacare.\nParty donors balked at comments Meeker made this week in The Pitch and the Eagle about possibly branding the party more conservatively.\nAs the summer of 2015 winds down, Kansas Democrats are wrestling with how to come back."}
