That can head off more serious and costly medical complications later, such as blindness, kidney failure and cardiovascular disease.\n\nQuest has not taken an official position on expanding Medicaid, but the researchers noted the benefits of the coverage expansion.\n\n\"We postulate that these Medicaid patients with newly identified diabetes will experience better management of their disease than if diagnoses had been made later,\" they wrote in the paper.\n\nThe data also could have important implications for other chronic medical conditions that benefit from better access to medical care, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nThe architects of the Affordable Care Act had hoped that expanded access to health insurance, such as Medicaid, would ultimately improve Americans' health.\n\nA growing body of evidence supports this conclusion, though some critics of the law have continued to question the link between insurance coverage and better health outcomes.\n\nDr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn., said it was time to end that debate. \"This latest study is a strong health argument against those folks who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" he said.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @NoamLevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Diabetes study shows benefits of expanded Medicaid under Obamacare", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Low-income patients with diabetes are getting better access to medical care in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act , suggests a new study that provides one of the first indications of the sweeping law's health effects.", "title": "Diabetes study shows benefits of expanded Medicaid under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obamacare-medicaid-diabetes-20150323-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-550f7b6e/turbine/la-na-obamacare-medicaid-diabetes-20150323", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Medicaid coverage, healthcare expansion, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, American Diabetes Assn.", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83123083", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-23", "Description": "Low-income patients with diabetes are getting better access to medical care in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act, suggests a new study that provides one of the first indications of the sweeping law's health effects.
