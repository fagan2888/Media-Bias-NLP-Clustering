Republican voters were much more likely to take a hard line on deportation, for example, with 74 percent in support of that idea, compared with 56 percent of independents and 32 percent of Democrats. At 85 percent, support is even stronger among Texans who identify themselves as Tea Party voters.\n\n\u201cThe harder-line conservatives have shifted this issue by the way they have talked about this issue,\u201d said Daron Shaw, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin and co-director of the poll. \u201cThe majority of Republican sentiment is moving in a more conservative direction in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe partisan lines are similar when it comes to tuition, with 54 percent of Democrats saying those undocumented immigrant students should get in-state tuition, while 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Tea Party voters say they should pay the higher out-of-state rates.\n\nOnly 34 percent of Texas voters agree that \u201cmost immigrants pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d while 56 percent disagree \u2014 40 percent of them strongly so.\n\nA large majority \u2014 73 percent \u2014 agree that \u201cwe should restrict and control people coming to live in the U.S. more than we do now.\u201d Half of the voters strongly agree with that statement.\n\nAt the same time, 60 percent agree with this statement: \u201cNewcomers from other countries enrich Texas with their hard work and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tells us a lot about the continuing power of immigration and border politics in Texas,\u201d said Jim Henson, co-director of the poll and head of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin.\n\n\u201cYou definitely get the sense that the Tea Party is the center of gravity when it comes to concern about immigration in the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are more conservative and intense than mainline Republicans as a group. The Tea Party has invested in more restrictive immigration policies. It\u2019s a big part of what defines their concerns right now.\u201d\n\nTexas voters\u2019 disdain for the Affordable Care Act remains strong, with only 31 percent saying they have a favorable view of it and 58 percent saying they have an unfavorable view. The strongest opinions are even more lopsided, with 50 percent saying they have a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d opinion of the federal health care law and only 16 percent saying they have a \u201cvery favorable\u201d opinion.\n\nThat said, only 26 percent would repeal the law and do nothing to replace it. Only 8 percent would leave the law as is, but 32 percent said their member of Congress should work to improve it and 28 percent want Congress to repeal it and replace it with something else.\n\n\u201cThis is the area where I think that the Obama administration has kind of won on this one,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cOnly 26 percent really say, 'Let\u2019s go back to what we had.'\u201d\n\nHenson said the numbers indicate a concern about the problem without suggesting a solution to it. Voters seem to agree, he said, that health care needs to be addressed in some way. And he pointed to one unusual result in the poll \u2014 a reminder that the sponsor of the reforms, and the reforms themselves, are very unpopular with one part of the electorate.\n\n\u201cThe Tea Party crosstab on \u2018Leave it as it is\u2019 was zero,\u201d he said. \u201cCall it a pollster\u2019s footnote, but that\u2019s pretty interesting.\u201d\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted May 30 to June 8 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. For this survey, we have shortened the time between polling and reporting the results to get a more timely measurement of sometimes rapidly changing public opinion. For questions of likely Republican primary voters, the margin of error is +/- 4.37 percentage points; for likely Democratic primary voters, +/- 4.75 percentage points. Numbers in the charts might not add up to 100 percent, because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of several stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.
