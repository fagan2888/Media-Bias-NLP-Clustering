Daughters of the American Revolution at the Chattanooga Unite event

The Chattanooga area chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution, along with members of the Col. Return Jonathan Meigs Society of the Children of the American Revolution, participated in the tribute parade for the Chattanooga Unite event on Wednesday.

The five Chattanooga chapters, Chickamauga Chapter, Chief John Ross Chapter, Judge David Campbell Chapter, Moccasin Bend Chapter, and the Nancy Ward Chapter, often participate in patriotic or military events as a group. They were excited to have CAR members present for this one as well, said officials.

Members were honored to walk and ride along with military, ROTC, and band groups from all over the area.

Members of the Chattanooga chapters also participated in other commemorative events surrounding the July 16 shootings, including removing and caring for the flags placed at the Lee Highway memorial. Those flags are being distributed to patriotic, veterans, and educational organizations all over the area.
