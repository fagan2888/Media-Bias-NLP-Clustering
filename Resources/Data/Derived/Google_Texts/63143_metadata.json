In addition to coverage examples for diabetes care and childbirth, the final 2017 version includes a coverage example for a simple fracture, according to CMS.\n\nHealth plans and issuers must use the new SBC for the open enrollment period that begins on or after April 1, 2017.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurers must provide people shopping for health plans with a brief summary of the coverage they offer and the individual\u2019s cost-sharing responsibilities. The uniform glossary of health and coverage terms is meant to assist consumers in evaluating and comparing different SBCs.\n\nIn addition to the new coverage example, the revised template offers more information about deductibles and requires plans to explain individual and overall out-of-pocket caps in the SBC.\n\nAside from these changes, the major upgrade to the new SBC is that terms used in electronic SBCs can be hyperlinked to the uniform glossary, Health Affairs Blog reports. Moreover, individual terms are hyperlinked to their definitions, and plans can link to the glossary by hovering over a term.\n\nAccording to CMS, the changes reflect input from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and consumer groups. The final SBC template is largely unchanged from a draft version released in February.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nHealth Affairs Blog: CMS Releases Final Summary Of Benefits And Coverage Template, Accompanying Materials\n\nCMS: Departments Finalize New Version of the Summary of Benefits and Coverage", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/03/05/0305ecf5d0b3306fe337028f842a5001.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "CMS releases final 2017 summary of benefits and coverage template", "pub_date": "apr 08, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-08T09:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, April 08, 2016, 09:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-27T09:00:00", "teaser": "<p>The new SBC includes a coverage example&nbsp;for a simple fracture and&nbsp;information on cost-sharing and&nbsp;hyperlinking capabilities.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-08", "sailthru.description": "The new SBC includes a coverage example\u00a0for a simple fracture and\u00a0information on cost-sharing and\u00a0hyperlinking capabilities.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The new SBC includes a coverage example\u00a0for a simple fracture and\u00a0information on cost-sharing and\u00a0hyperlinking capabilities.", "title": "CMS releases final 2017 summary of benefits and coverage template", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-releases-final-2017-summary-of-benefits-and-coverage-template/417080/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/CMS-logo.png", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ff/b4/ffb482b94a98aa25aaddeeae7e5aa05f.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingHealth Affairs Blog: CMS Releases Final Summary Of Benefits And Coverage Template, Accompanying MaterialsCMS: Departments Finalize New Version of the Summary of Benefits and Coverage\nDive Brief:CMS released an updated summary of benefits and coverage template and uniform glossary from HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury Wednesday.\nIn addition to coverage examples for diabetes care and childbirth, the final 2017 version includes a coverage example for a simple fracture, according to CMS.\nThe uniform glossary of health and coverage terms is meant to assist consumers in evaluating and comparing different SBCs.\nThe final SBC template is largely unchanged from a draft version released in February."}
