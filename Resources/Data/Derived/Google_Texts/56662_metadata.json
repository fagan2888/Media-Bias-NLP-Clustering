Tory Bruno has been named Gass\u2019 successor.\n\n\u201cI have been honored to serve as the chief executive officer of United Launch Alliance since its formation nearly eight years ago,\u201d Gass said in a statement. \u201cWith my intent to retire in the near term and the changing industry landscape over the next several years, the board of directors and I have agreed that the immediate appointment of my successor to begin the leadership transition is in the best interest of the company.\u201d\n\nULA is the largest provider of rocket launch services in the U.S. and recently has come under intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill.\n\nGass has spent the past several months navigating media questions and political inquiry about ULA\u2019s cost structure, defending its monopoly position by reiterating its track record for reliability.\n\nTroubles began in April when California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly called SpaceX, sued the Air Force and ULA claiming the government\u2019s \u201cblock buy\u201d contract awarded to ULA for $11 billion was unfair and not open to competition.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a U.S. federal judge refused to dismiss the case, ordering ULA to hand over details of the contract and requiring the parties to enter mediation.\n\nJust an hour before ULA made the announcement Tuesday, industry colleagues acknowledged several forces impacting the sector\u2019s future business model at a media briefing for ULA\u2019s launch of DigitalGlobe\u2019s highly anticipated WorldView-3 satellite, scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n\u201cULA, our subcontractor on this project, is in the cycle where a lot of its government business is in full swing, but they are adjusting their manufacturing capabilities,\u201d said Steve Skladanek, vice president of business development for Lockheed\u2019s Commercial Launch Services division.\n\nULA launches the U.S. military\u2019s most sensitive spacecraft, which involves long gaps of time between winning a contract and achieving the mission. The rocket provider\u2019s current rate of launches is expected to drop off based on its existing contracts.\n\nBruno comes from Lockheed, where he most recently served as vice president and general manager of strategic and missile defense systems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for Mike\u2019s leadership and contribution to ULA\u2019s customers and employees, as well as the space industry as a whole,\u201d said Craig Cooning, president of Boeing Network and Space Systems and a ULA board member, in a news release.\n\n\u201cTory understands the launch business as well as anyone and is well-qualified to ensure ULA keeps pace with changing customer needs and launch industry dynamics.\u201d\n\nAbout 1,700 of ULA\u2019s 3,600 employees are in Colorado.\n\nKristen Leigh Painter: 303-954-1638, kpainter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kristenpainter", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Gass steps down as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance", "title": "Michael Gass steps down as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-gass-steps-down-as-president-and-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/", "image": {"width": 563, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__wotr_16191124_9335p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__wotr_16191124_9335p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T13:58:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:54:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf36\"", "article_summary": "Centennial-based United Launch Alliance announced Tuesday that its founding president and chief executive will leave the company in December.\n\u201cTory understands the launch business as well as anyone and is well-qualified to ensure ULA keeps pace with changing customer needs and launch industry dynamics.\u201dAbout 1,700 of ULA\u2019s 3,600 employees are in Colorado.\n\u201cI have been honored to serve as the chief executive officer of United Launch Alliance since its formation nearly eight years ago,\u201d Gass said in a statement.\nBruno comes from Lockheed, where he most recently served as vice president and general manager of strategic and missile defense systems.\nMichael Gass has served as ULA\u2019s leader since the company formed in 2006 as a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co.Gass, 58, is retiring, a company spokeswoman said."}
