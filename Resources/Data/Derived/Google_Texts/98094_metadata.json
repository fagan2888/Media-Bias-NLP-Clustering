It was a very bad year if you couldn\u2019t stop \u201caccidentally\u201d saying racist stuff, if you had the misfortune of being stopped by the police or if you traveled to a country with Ebola.\n\nHere are those that lost out in 2014:\n\nRobin Thicke\n\nJOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images Singer Robin Thicke poses as he arrives to attend the MTV European Music Awards at the Ziggo Dome on Nov. 10, 2013, in Amsterdam.\n\nBack when Robin Thicke was a second-tier R&B artist with primarily black fans, he sure was a lot more likable. This new, crossover pop artist Robin Thicke, who the white mainstream \u201cdiscovered\u201d in 2013, is not as cool as the old Robin Thicke. This new, 2014-edition Robin Thicke cheated on Paula Patton, faced divorce and put out a gross, self-serving and poorly received album about their failed love. One of the music videos for the album, which he named for Patton, was criticized for its stalker-ish, domestic violence undertones. Flop, in 2014, thy name is Thicke.\n\nDonald Sterling\n\nROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling\n\nIt\u2019s not illegal to be a racist, but it does get pretty creepy when you\u2019re in the business of buying and selling black NBA players. Donald Sterling found himself on the outs with the NBA after recordings surfaced of the then-Los Angeles Clippers owner saying he didn\u2019t want his girlfriend to hang out with NBA legend Magic Johnson because Johnson is black. But do you know who\u2019s black? 76.3 percent of all NBA players. And those players were pretty much like, \u201cHe\u2019s got to go.\u201d And so he went, as the NBA stripped Sterling of his team, forcing a sale to another owner. But don\u2019t feel bad for a bigot; Sterling still has his money to keep him company. He is a billionaire, after all.\n\nLifetime\u2019s Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B\n\nCHRISTOS KALOHORIDIS/Lifetime Alexandra Shipp in Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B\n\nNo one ever has high hopes for a Lifetime movie\u2014it\u2019s the same network that cast Lindsay Lohan to play icon Elizabeth Taylor. But there was a flicker of hope that the network would try to do right by gone-too-soon singer Aaliyah. There were problems from the get-go, however: The first actress cast as Aaliyah was criticized for being too light to play the part and backed out of the film. Then it got out that Lifetime couldn\u2019t use any of Aaliyah\u2019s original music. Then came the end result, a boring script with terrible casting\u2014not one actor looked a thing like the celebrity she or he was playing. This sparked the hilarious Lifetime casting meme #LifetimeBeLike, the only good thing to come out of the film.\n\nAmericans Freaking Out Over Ebola\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images First responders wear full biohazard suits while responding to the report of a woman with Ebola-like symptoms at the Dallas Area Rapid Transit White Rock Station Oct. 18, 2014, in Dallas.\n\nThe coast of West Africa is still fighting the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Thousands of people have died, and holiday festivities were canceled in Sierra Leone. But like all things in the United States, the crisis didn\u2019t get much play in the press until Americans who\u2019d visited Ebola-stricken countries returned home. There were three cases of Ebola in the United States, with one death, spawning a full-blown panic of quarantines and freak-outs. Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Michel du Cille was disinvited by Syracuse University because he\u2019d visited Liberia three weeks before he was scheduled to speak.\n\nBill Cosby\n\nGerardo Mora/Getty Images Bill Cosby performs at the King Center for the Performing Arts on Nov. 21, 2014, in Melbourne, Fla.\n\nHe may have created several TV classics. He may be a comedic genius. He may have donated a small fortune to education, but the reputation of Bill Cosby went to the dogs in 2014 amid allegations of sexual assault, spanning decades, that resurfaced big time in October after comedian Hannibal Buress made a joke. Multiple women, including fashion icon Beverly Johnson, showed up telling similar stories of drugged drinks and a darker side of a man once called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad.\u201d But with no criminal charges pending and the statute of limitations up on many of the cases, Cosby is unlikely to face a day in court, though that probably won\u2019t matter in the court of public opinion.\n\nPolice Officers Who Shot or Killed Unarmed Black Men\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images Officers police an Oct. 12, 2014, protest in St. Louis over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer.\n\nThings that could get you shot or killed by police in 2014 if you were a black man\u2014stolen cigarillos, allegedly selling \u201cloosies,\u201d getting your license after an officer asked you to, playing with or holding toy guns, standing in a stairwell, taking your medication, cosplay. This year, like every year, was not a good year to do anything while black because \u201cblackness\u201d was viewed as being complicit in crimes, real and imagined, that were punishable by death. And though we\u2019re calling the police officers \u201closers\u201d\u2014as in those who failed at their jobs in the worst way imaginable\u2014it\u2019s the unarmed black men and their families who suffered losses that were unimaginable.\n\nThe Secret Service\n\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images The White House is seen behind a fence on Oct. 3, 2014, in Washington, D.C. A new director was appointed to head the Secret Service after a series of security breeches.\n\nThe Cast of VH1\u2019s Sorority Sisters\n\nVH1 Sorority Sisters\n\nHell hath no fury like a soror scorned. Black Greeks collectively lost it when they learned that a show claiming to demonstrate the real lives of black sorority members was going to air on the same network that has ruined hip-hop in three different cities. The show that aired was far from the scholarship, service and model-citizen views the orgs espouse. It was just more black women screaming, but now they had college degrees and Greek letters. #BlackTwitter already went for the show\u2019s sponsors, but what of the stars? TV One\u2019s Roland Martin tweeted, \u201cDear every woman on #SororitySisters, y\u2019all might wanna skip the national convention/boule. Most Wanted posters will feature all of y\u2019all!\u201d Considering the backlash, he\u2019s probably not far off from reality.\n\nRay and Janay Rice, Roger Goodell and the NFL\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images; Tom Berg/NFLPhotoLibrary Janay and Ray Rice; NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell\n\nThere were no winners in the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal that played out in 2014. No winner in Ray Rice, who found himself out of a job after videos surfaced of him knocking his then-fiancee, now-wife, Janay Rice unconscious in an elevator. No winner in Janay Rice, who found her pain mocked on social media and choices judged. Not for Roger Goodell, who initially suspended Ray Rice for only two games for the incident but then pulled a double jeopardy and tried to have Rice thrown out of football completely. It didn\u2019t work. Rice sued to have his eligibility reinstated and won. Rice has since said publicly that he made a \u201chorrible mistake.\u201d Goodell, on the other hand, is trying to save face with changes in how the league deals with domestic violence cases.\n\nObamacare\n\nKAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images This image taken March 31, 2014, in Washington, D.C., shows a page on the HealthCare.gov website indicating that it is too busy for the amount of traffic.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The new year can\u2019t come fast enough for people on this list.", "sailthru.tags": "biggest losers 2014, Donald Sterling, Ray Rice, Janay Rice, Roger Goodell, NFL, domestic violence, ebola, unarmed black men, Darren Wilson, Bill Cosby, Secret Service, Obamacare", "sailthru.author": "Danielle C.
