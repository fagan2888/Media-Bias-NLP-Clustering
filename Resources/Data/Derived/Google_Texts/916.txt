A simple trip to the store took an unexpected turn. Michael Cassidy had just walked out of the North Fort Myers Walmart.

"A guy stole a TV from Walmart, and we tried to stop him," said Cassidy.

Cassidy quickly spotted the suspect. He tells us he chased after the TV thief until the man jumped into his car and tried to speed off.

"He tried to run over me. I cut my finger," said Cassidy.

Cassidy says the thief wasn't alone.

"He had a driver and a baby in the backseat," said Cassidy.

The suspect took off down Pine Island Road.

"They called police, and they're looking for them now," said Cassidy.

It was a wild ride for Cassidy as he watched a man risk injuring so many others just to steal a TV worth only a few hundred dollars.

We reached out to the Lee County Sheriff's Office for more details. We are waiting to hear back.
