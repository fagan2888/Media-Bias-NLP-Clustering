This description remains true today.\n\nRussian scholar Karen Dawisha\u2019s new book, Putin\u2019s Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? covers the latest episode in Russia\u2019s long and painful history of government venality: Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nPutin is \u201cboth a product and a producer\u201d of Russia\u2019s pervasive corruption, according to Dawisha. The decay is on a scale few in the West truly understand. \u201cIn the West it might seem remarkable that anyone whose whole career is marked by allegations of corruption should rise to become a three-term president of any country,\u201d she writes about Putin, \u201cIn Russia it is less surprising.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy should be on the reading list of anyone who wishes to understand the true nature of Putin\u2019s regime, which, as Dawisha correctly states, is \u201ccommitted to a life of looting without parallel.\u201d The timing of this book is especially important, after Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March and the West subsequently enacted sanctions against those in his inner circle.\n\nDawisha describes how this inner circle formed. Her work is based on years of research into Russia\u2019s criminal circles and the KGB. Her sources include Russia\u2019s insiders, Russian and Western investigative journalists, government officials, and archival records.\n\nWhen Putin became Russia\u2019s prime minister in 1999 and then assumed his first presidential term in 2000, he was a little-known former KGB officer. Yet, as Dawisha argues, it was already possible to discern his true intentions during his first 100 days as president\u2014a period during which he began to crack down on Russia\u2019s free press and to curtail other civil liberties on the pretext of preserving \u201corder\u201d in the face of rising terrorism in the North Caucasus.\n\nDawisha begins her story of Putin in the years shortly before the breakup of the Soviet Union when Putin\u2014along with many other KGB members\u2014understood that the Soviet system was bound to collapse, and looked for ways to maintain political influence and create their own wealth at others\u2019 expense. The 1990s for Putin were \u201ca time when a group of former KGB, mafia, and political and economic elites joined forces, combining their money, connections, and positions to create the basis for Putin\u2019s spectacular success in building an authoritarian and kleptocratic regime.\u201d\n\nPutin and his circle, in Dawisha\u2019s account, used their public positions to attain wealth and influence in these years. Many of these individuals continued to maintain links with Russia\u2019s organized crime. Dawisha traces how Putin built a mafia-style system where \u201cprofound access to riches is provided in return for absolute loyalty,\u201d and where \u201cPutin alone decides who and what will be profitable.\u201d\n\nThe West itself is a critical element to the story of Putin\u2019s rise. It is in the West that Putin\u2019s cronies stash their money. They vacation there, and send their children to study in western schools. In this context, it is especially telling that Cambridge University Press (CUP), which had published several of Dawisha\u2019s previous books, declined to publish this one.\n\nThe quality of Dawisha\u2019s research was not the issue. CUP feared that the United Kingdom\u2019s plaintiff-friendly libel laws could be used to bankrupt the company should they publish Dawisha\u2019s book. \u201cIt is simply a question of risk tolerance in light of our limited resources,\u201d wrote John Haslam, executive publisher at CUP to Dawisha in March 2014.\n\nDawisha has repeatedly stressed that she\u2019s not angry with CUP, but rather with \u201cthe growing trend in the book world, where the rich and corrupt from many different countries use the U.K. courts for libel tourism as a way of suppressing investigative work into their worlds.\u201d Simon & Schuster, which published Putin\u2019s Kleptocracy, did not publish it in the U.K.\n\nDawisha dedicates her book to \u201cfree Russian journalism.\u201d Russian investigative journalists are among her prominent sources.\n\nVladimir Vysotsky, Russia\u2019s Bob Dylan of the Soviet period, poignantly commented in one of his songs on the Soviet system\u2019s destruction of spirit and life: \u201cHow much faith and trees have been toppled.\u201d Today, in Putin\u2019s Russia, many have lost faith too. Russia\u2019s educated and young elites increasingly look to leave the country, while many who remain continue to be fooled by the Kremlin.\n\nIn the West, however, where speech is still free, there are few excuses\u2014and even fewer today with the publication of Dawisha\u2019s book.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prominent 19th century Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin famously described the Russian government in one word: voruyut\u2014they steal.
