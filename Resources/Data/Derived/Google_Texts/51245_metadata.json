Bush, Hardball, Iraq, MSNBC, Ronald Reagan, News, Politics News\n\nEarlier this month, as the Beltway media was finally starting to realize that Bernie Sanders was mounting a serious campaign for president, MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews signaled his belated recognition with a Hail Mary of denial.\n\n\u201cDo people really see him [Sanders] as chief executive, the guy or a person in charge of the CIA, the U.S. military, the U.S. Marines? Do they actually see him in that role?\u201d Matthews asked. \u201cOr do they see him as an ideological avatar, of somebody that they believe will express their view, but not to actually have the job of chief executive and commander-in-chief. I don\u2019t think anybody`s thinking, commander-in-chief Bernie Sanders! It`s unimaginable!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unimaginable to Chris Matthews\u2014who, typically, once drooled over George W. Bush\u2019s \u201camazing display of leadership,\u201d the day Bush paraded around beneath the \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner wearing a flight suit, later going on to say:\n\nWe\u2019re proud of our president. Americans love having a guy as president, a guy who has a little swagger, who\u2019s physical, who\u2019s not a complicated guy like [former President Bill] Clinton or even like [former Democratic presidential candidates Michael] Dukakis or [Walter] Mondale, all those guys, [George] McGovern. They want a guy who\u2019s president. Women like a guy who\u2019s president. Check it out. The women like this war. I think we like having a hero as our president. It\u2019s simple.\n\nMatthews is hyper-typical of how thoroughly our political media misunderstands at least four different matters that all combine in this foolish display: First, the role of the presidency, and presidential leadership; second, the nature of Bernie Sanders, his background and his record; third, the limits of conventional force; and fourth, the unprecedented nature of new international threats facing America today.\n\nIn the Hardball segment, Washington Post reporter Bob Costa disrupted Matthews\u2019 fantasy with a whiff of basic facts addressing the first two misunderstandings, \u201cHe\u2019s been a veterans\u2019 advocate, committee chairman,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWhen you talk to his people, they say he`s met the threshold to be commander-in-chief. Treat him with respect. That`s their argument.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that same day, Politico ran a story, \u201cHow Bernie Sanders Fought for Our Veterans,\u201d and the week before the Boston Globe went even further, with a story by Annie Linskey reporting from the campaign trail, \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 surge is partly fueled by veterans.\u201d There\u2019s nothing new in this, either, as could be gleaned from a 2013 Army Times story, \u201cVietnam protester Sanders now battles for vets,\u201d which reported:\n\nSince his days in the House, the 71-year-old independent has won veterans\u2019 support by consistently focusing on the issues most important to them \u2014 from health problems caused by Agent Orange and Gulf War illness to disabled veterans\u2019 fears that their benefits will be cut.\n\nNow Sanders is simply reaping what he\u2019s long been sowing. \u201cEntire Reddit threads are dedicated to how veterans can best pitch Sanders to other veterans,\u201d Linskey wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cHe is revered,\u201d said Paul Loebe, a 31-year-old who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan during eight years of active duty and spends three hours a day updating a Facebook page promoting Sanders to veterans. \u201cHe\u2019s very consistent with where he stands. He\u2019s the first politician that I\u2019ve believed in my life.\u201d\n\nVeterans were intimately familiar with how he had fought for them. And they either didn\u2019t care about his ideological label, or else saw his socialism as a plus:\n\nFor Louis Celli, at the American Legion, Sanders\u2019s progressive views make some sense in the context of advocating for veterans\u2019 programs. \u201cWho better than a socialist to advocate for veterans\u2019 health care?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn short, the Beltway \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d was wrong from top to bottom, according to the reporting on the ground. And it\u2019s only natural to project that, sooner or later, veterans attitudes will be reflected in active troops as well. They look forward to their futures\u2014and it\u2019s only natural they should come to place more trust in a politician who does the same, rather than getting himself caught up in the momentary fog of war.\n\nIn short, all this speaks to the first two matters that our political media misunderstands in this matter\u2014first, the role of the presidency, and presidential leadership, and second, the nature of Bernie Sanders. The president is not \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d in the sense of some sort of super-macho military leader. That\u2019s exactly the opposite of what our system of civilian control of the military is all about. Civilian concerns are necessarily broader than military ones, and how the nation cares for its veterans is one of the most striking examples of how that broader responsibility concerns the well-being of all Americans\u2014including those who serve, or have served, in the military.\n\nThe fact that Sanders has devoted himself to veterans issues is actually not the least bit surprising, for those who know something about American history. First, as Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol demonstrated in \u201cProtecting Soldiers and Mothers: The Political Origins of Social Policy in United States,\u201d benefits for Civil War veterans and their families were the historical foundations for modern-day American social policy. Second, there was a deep bond between the anti-war left in the Vietnam War era and the great mass of veterans who served in that war, which makes Sanders\u2019 concern for veterans affairs reflective of a broader enduring concern.\n\nWhile the political media inverts the reality, recycling the myth that protesters spat on returning veterans, sociologist and Vietnam vet Jerry Lembcke thoroughly refuted and deconstructed that myth in \u201cThe Spitting Image: Myth, Memory, and the Legacy of Vietnam.\u201dThe reality was that the anti-war movement spread to the troops in Vietnam, and their eventual refusal to fight was a major factor in bringing the war to an end. This story is told by David Cortright, a participant in the GI antiwar movement, in his 1975 book, \u201cSoldiers in Revolt: GI Resistance During the Vietnam War,\u201d and is essentially (though not approvingly) confirmed by an account from a very different source, a 1971 article \u201cThe Collapse of the Armed Forces\u201d by Col. Robert D. Heinl, Jr., which appeared in the Armed Forces Journal in June 1971. \u201cBy every conceivable indicator, our army that now remains in Vietnam is in a state approaching collapse,\u201d that true believer wrote, \u201cwith individual units avoiding or having refused combat, murdering their officers and non commissioned officers, drug-ridden, and dispirited where not near mutinous.\u201d\n\nBut where Heinl saw a broken military, the anti-war movement that Sanders was part of saw another facet of itself. Thus, there is nothing the least bit surprising in Sanders\u2019 long-standing commitment to veterans.\n\nMoreover, this concern for veterans\u2019 welfare reflects a broader concern for the consequences of war which ought to be of the utmost concern for anyone holding the office of commander-in-chief. Strikingly, Washington conventional wisdom stands this sort of common sense on its head, assuming that short-sighted hothead blowhards, and know-nothing pose-strikers are the \u201cmost credible\u201d sorts to hold the office. This brings us to the second two areas of misunderstanding typified by Matthews\u2019 gut disbelief in Sanders\u2019 leadership capacity\u2014the limits of conventional force, and the nature of the international threats facing America today.\n\nThe first of these should be a no-brainer. America won its independence based on the limits of conventional force. Indeed, the British forces won almost every major engagement with Washington\u2019s forces. But that wasn\u2019t what determined the course of the war. Revolutionary wars of independence never depend on battlefield victories\u2014except, perhaps, at the very end. America\u2019s model has been widely replicated down through the years\u2014including by the Vietnamese we fought against half a century ago. Conventional force is but one element in military struggles, whatever the nature of those struggles may be. No less an authority than Sun Tzu, in his \u201cArt of War,\u201d says that the greatest victory is won without fighting\u2014and that victory is assured to whoever knows both his enemy and himself. Understanding is the key to victory\u2014and that includes the understanding of what wars should never be fought in the first place.\n\nBut the kind of knowledge Sun Tzu commends also entails a sensitivity to the broadest range of the international threats facing America today\u2014threats which may not necessarily take the forms of armies. Climate change is one such threat, and Sanders\u2014probably more than any other national politician\u2014has recognized it as such. In a 2013 Playboy interview, Sanders said:\n\nBig business is willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. I regard that as just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. And because of their power over the political process, you hear a deafening silence in the U.S. Congress and in other bodies around the world about the severity of the problem. Global warming is a far more serious problem than al Qaeda.\n\nIn his campaign announcement at the end of May, Sanders again highlighted climate change as a dire threat:\n\nThis country faces more serious problems today than at any time since the Great Depression and, if you include the planetary crisis of climate change, it may well be that the challenges we face now are direr than any time in our modern history\u2026. When we talk about our responsibilities as human beings and as parents, there is nothing more important than leaving this country and the entire planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and grandchildren. The debate is over\u2026. The scientists are telling us that if we do not boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energies, this planet could be five to ten degrees Fahrenheit warmer by the end of this century. This is catastrophic.\n\nThe view of climate change as a security threat is not new, but is getting increased attention, as noted recently in an article at Grist, \u201cClimate change is a security threat. Make it a foreign policy priority.\u201d The article first took note of a paper published this past March, by researchers at U.C. Santa Barbara and Columbia, linking climate change-generated extreme drought to the Syrian Civil War. But the main focus was a much broader report, commissioned by members of the G7, \u201cA New Climate for Peace: Taking Action on Climate and Fragility Risks\u201d.\n\nAs explained in a summary, the report identifies \u201cseven compound climate-fragility risks that pose serious threats to the stability of states and societies in the decades ahead,\u201d including \u201clocal resource competition,\u201d livelihood insecurity and migration,\u201d \u201cextreme weather events and disasters,\u201d \u201cvolatile food prices and provision,\u201d \u201ctransboundary water management,\u201d \u201csea-level rise and coastal degradation,\u201d and \u201cunintended effects of climate policies.\u201d It goes on to warn of the difficulty in dealing with these risks, saying, \u201cSingle-sector interventions alone will not deal with compound risks,\u201d and advising that \u201cIntegrating policies and programs in three key sectors \u2014 climate change adaptation, development and humanitarian aid, and peacebuilding \u2014 is necessary to help strengthen resilience to climate-fragility risks and realize significant co-benefits.\u201d\n\nWhat this tells us is that a whole new realm of integrating systemic thinking is needed in order to help prevent being overwhelmed by new security threats to the global order in the decades ahead. The stresses and strains we will face in the years ahead are simply without precedent in human history\u2014and the Republican Party is still mired in denial that the problem even exists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A \"who takes Bernie seriously\" rant by D.C.'s silliest wind-up toy gets Sanders, and American history, all wrong", "title": "Chris Matthews\u2019 dumb Bernie Sanders disdain: Dopey pundit drools over W\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d doesn\u2019t think vets\u2019 advocate can be commander in chief", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A \"who takes Bernie seriously\" rant by D.C.'s silliest wind-up toy gets Sanders, and American history, all wrong", "title": "Chris Matthews\u2019 dumb Bernie Sanders disdain: Dopey pundit drools over W\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d doesn\u2019t think vets\u2019 advocate can be commander in chief", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/20/chris_matthews_dumb_bernie_sanders_disdain_dopey_pundit_drools_over_ws_mission_accomplished_doesnt_think_vets_advocate_can_be_commander_in_chief/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/matthews_sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A \"who takes Bernie seriously\" rant by D.C.'s silliest wind-up toy gets Sanders, and American history, all wrong", "title": "Chris Matthews\u2019 dumb Bernie Sanders disdain: Dopey pundit drools over W\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d doesn\u2019t think vets\u2019 advocate can be commander in chief", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/matthews_sanders.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, Bernie Sanders, Chris Matthews, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Foreign policy, George W.
