Hodges case.\n\nOver 30 cases hang in the balance that will be facing the Supreme Court by the end of this month. The case on everyone\u2019s mind, however, is the Obergefell v. Hodges case in Ohio. The story of the couple involved in this case seems to have resonated with many groups and individuals around the nation. Together for 20 years, Jim Obergefell and John Arthur felt a sense of urgency to get married in spite of having chosen not to. In Ohio, same-sex marriage is currently illegal, and they don\u2019t recognize unions from outside states. Depending on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, states may be forced to recognize same-sex marriages from outside states.\n\nJohn Arthur and Jim Obergefell\n\nWhen Arthur and Obergefell married, they did so on a medical jet in Baltimore. It was a celebratory union in spite of Arthur\u2019s crippling condition: ALS. Their choice to marry coincided with the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \u201cWith John\u2019s death approaching, it just gave us more of an impetus and more of a desire to have our relationship validated and recognized,\u201d said Obergefell, though he admits they likely would have gotten married regardless since they\u2019d been together for 20.5 years. As the condition worsened, he became bedridden and mostly immobile. When they married, he could only speak and move his right hand and head. They felt amazing \u201chaving the government recognition of our relationship. Having the government say you exist, you count.\u201d\n\nTheir next mission was in Ohio, where they aimed to have his death certificate say \u201cmarried\u201d. The court ruled that it was okay, however the following year, the court appealed and won. If Obergefell wins the new appeal with the higher court, Ohio will be required to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.\n\nThousands Take Sides Showing their Support or Condemnation\n\nOver 7,500 pages have been submitted for the cases that are to be held this month. Obergefell v. Hodges alone has the highest number of filings seen since the 2012 Affordable Care Act case. The briefs were submitted by those who were for it, as well as those against it. Among the many groups to submit briefs, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops sent in a statement discouraging same-sex marriage and promoting traditional marriage.\n\nThe largest brief was from the President of the House of Deputies of the Episcopal Church. It was signed by many different groups, including the Union for Reform Judaism, the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association. Many religious groups in support of same-sex marriage said that not all views speak for all religions, adding that thousands of historic Christian leaders have views that challenge the old opinions of homosexuality. Others emphasize the number of Americans who feel their faith compels them to accept others, including LGBT citizens. Many republicans wrote that \u201cthe marriage bans challenged here target gay and lesbian couples, and their families, for injurious governmental treatment.\u201d\n\nResources\n\nFollow the conversation on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "supreme court, marriage, religion, Hodges, same sex, lgbt, gay, arthur, religious,", "wot-verification": "16fbad63ab63c74f7a00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=848230695", "og": {"site_name": "World Religion News", "description": "Supreme Court will make an important decision in the ongoing same-sex marriage debate with the Obergefell v.
