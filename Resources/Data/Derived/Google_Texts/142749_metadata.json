In fact, the illness of addiction is what lands many people in prison in the first place.\n\nBut four in five prisoners don\u2019t have health insurance when they leave.\n\n\u201cPrisons and jails are necessary for the protection of society,\u201d the study authors write. \u201cFor decades, though, the US health and criminal justice systems have operated in a vicious cycle that in essence punishes illness and poverty in ways that, in turn, generate further illness and poverty.\u201d\n\nVicious to virtuous\n\nWithin that bleak situation, however, lies opportunity because incarceration allows for diagnosis and delivery of care that, if continued in the community, would reduce the onslaught of health problems for individuals and ensuing costs for society, Rich says. The authors\u2019 recommendations are meant to turn that vicious cycle into a virtuous one.\n\nThe primary recommendation is to find alternatives to imprisonment when possible, given that the United States incarcerated more than 2.3 million of its 313 million residents in 2012. While the authors divided the rest of the recommendations between health care in prison and after release, in many cases the ideas are meant to improve integration of care between the two settings. Specifically they make the following recommendations.\n\nIn prison:\n\nImproved oversight and accountability of prison health care, including making accreditation of prison health care mandatory and enforceable\n\nInclusion of prisoners in accountable care organization health plans to increase provider incentives for providing good care\n\nMedical profession advocacy for legislation and programs that would benefit prisoner health, such as programs that improve care as prisoners transition to the community.\n\nAfter release:\n\nEmployment of a \u201crisk-needs-responsivity\u201d model to triage prisoners, based on their personal history, to the most appropriate care\n\nAssistance for released prisoners to help them enroll in Medicaid as it expands under the Affordable Care Act. In recent research, Rich has found that this activity may already be underway\n\nPolicies requiring electronic health records from within prison be available to community health providers\n\nIncentives for community providers to deliver mental health care to released prisoners\n\nImproved cultural competence among community physicians to understand the specific medical needs and risk factors of released prisoners. Transition Clinic medical homes provide a worthwhile example.\n\nThe full study and recommendations are published in the journal Health Affairs.\n\nSource: Brown University", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care for prisoners needs to be improved, both while they are incarcerated and after they return to society, according to a new report.", "og": {"site_name": "Futurity", "description": "Health care for prisoners needs to be improved, both while they are incarcerated and after they return to society, according to a new report.", "title": "Why health care for prisoners could lower costs - Futurity", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doctor_office_770.jpg", "height": 440}, "url": "http://www.futurity.org/study-prisoners-need-better-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care for prisoners needs to be improved, both while they are incarcerated and after they return to society, according to a new report.", "creator": "@FuturityNews", "image": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doctor_office_770.jpg", "title": "Why health care for prisoners could lower costs - Futurity", "site": "@FuturityNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "56028DC055B0AA27F7D0287D219F4C4D", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Futurity/143906865226", "section": "Health and Medicine", "tag": "public policy", "published_time": "2014-03-04T13:38:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In prison:Improved oversight and accountability of prison health care, including making accreditation of prison health care mandatory and enforceableInclusion of prisoners in accountable care organization health plans to increase provider incentives for providing good careMedical profession advocacy for legislation and programs that would benefit prisoner health, such as programs that improve care as prisoners transition to the community.\n(Credit: Haley C/FlickrWhy health care for prisoners could lower costsMore than 95 percent of prisoners will return to the community, often carrying significant health burdens and associated costs with them.\nIn a new study, researchers outline ways to improve health care for prisoners, both during and after incarceration.\nWhile the authors divided the rest of the recommendations between health care in prison and after release, in many cases the ideas are meant to improve integration of care between the two settings.\nBut four in five prisoners don't have health insurance when they leave and return to society."}
