Trump was asked, “where could you make deals with Democrats? On what issues do you think you can find middle ground?”

He responded, “We can make deals with a lot of people, and not necessarily deals, we’re going to have to force some through, because we’re not always going to get along with the Democrats. But, you know what, I watched Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill do a great job together. they were very different kinds of people, and yet they were able to make deals, and the country was really singing. It was doing well. And we need a little bit of that. And as you said, I mean, you said it, he’s [fellow candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz] a very strident person. Nobody likes him. I mean, take a look, he’s got republican senators. He doesn’t have one endorsement from one senator.”
