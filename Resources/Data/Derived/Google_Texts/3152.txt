"So I'm really getting to the point where I am ready for private insurers to be able to start enrolling people."

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Doug Hoffman, who volunteers to help people get enrolled in a health plan under the Affordable Care Act, says he would like to see a "work-around" of the troubled healthcare.gov website.

Hoffman, picking up on an idea from some major insurers as reported in the New York Times, said he would like to begin help processing applications with an assist from insurers -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama being the predominant one in the state. He said he has turned in 200 paper applications and have yet to get a response back.

"So I'm really getting to the point where I am ready for private insurers to be able to start enrolling people," Hoffman said. "As a navigator, what I'd like to do is meet with people, validate their accounts using the Kaiser Calculator ... and then once I was satisfied with their subsidies, I'd like to be able to go on to the Blue Cross website, or Humana, and enroll these people."

Hoffman spoke today as he visited St. Vincent Hospital's Access to Care clinic looking for uninsured people who may qualify for a subsidized health plan under ACA.

Corrected Nov. 14, 2:55 p.m., to reflect Hoffman is not a paid navigator but a volunteer navigator.
