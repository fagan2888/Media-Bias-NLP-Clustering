But that\u2019s not important right now. Around that time, I also wrote a piece for the magazine about the new utopianism of American liberalism. In short, I think you can judge every progressive \u201cism\u201d by its Utopia. What\u2019s vexing about contemporary liberalism is that it doesn\u2019t admit its Utopia forthrightly. The Marxists were honest about the dream of the classless society blooming from the withered-away state. The Social Gospel progressives openly promised to create a \u201cKingdom of Heaven\u201d on earth (Obama did once slip and say that we can create a \u201cKingdom here on earth,\u201d but he\u2019s usually let his followers fill-in-the-blank about why, exactly, we are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for). To their credit, the transhumanist types are honest about their utopianism; that glorious day when we can download our brains into X-boxes and Vulcan mind-meld with the toaster.\n\nBut liberals are annoying in that they have the itch to immanentize the eschaton but neither the courage nor the vocabulary to state it openly. Now, in fairness, the urge usually takes the form of Hallmark-card idealism rather than soul-crushing collectivism. The young activist who recycles Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s line \u201cThere are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why . . . I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?\u201d has no idea he\u2019s a walking, talking clich\u00e9, a non-conformist in theory while a predictable conformist in fact. But he also has no idea he\u2019s tapping into his inner utopian.\n\nQuoth the Serpent, Ever More\n\nAs the man who pulled a duck out of his briefcase during a bank-loan meeting said, I hope you\u2019ll forgive a digression. (Though, if you really hated digressions you probably wouldn\u2019t be reading this \u201cnews\u201dletter.) You know what else the aforementioned kid with the RFK quote is oblivious to? That RFK didn\u2019t coin the phrase (JFK didn\u2019t either, but he did use it first). The line actually comes from one of the worst people of the 20th century, George Bernard Shaw (admittedly he\u2019s on the B-list of worst people since he never killed anybody; he just celebrated people who did).\n\nThat much a lot of people know. But the funny part is the line comes from Shaw\u2019s play Back to Methuselah. Specifically, it\u2019s what the Serpent says to Eve in order to sell her on eating the apple and gaining a kind of immortality through sex (or something like that). Of course, Shaw\u2019s Serpent differs from the biblical serpent, because Shaw \u2014 a great rationalizer of evil \u2014 is naturally sympathetic to the serpent. Still, it\u2019s kind of hilarious that legions of Kennedy worshippers invoke this line as a pithy summation of the idealistic impulse, putting it nearly on par with Kennedy\u2019s nationalistic \u201cAsk Not\u201d riff, without realizing they\u2019re stealing lines from . . . the Devil.\n\n\u200bI don\u2019t think this means you can march into the local high school, kick open the door to the student government offices with a crucifix extended, shouting \u201cthe power of Christ compels you!\u201d while splashing holy water on every kid who uses that \u201cRFK\u201d quote on his Facebook page. But it is interesting.\n\nOkay, as the loan officer said when the customer pulled out a second duck, this time from his pants: Enough with these digressions already (by the way, you know Mel Brooks could do a yidishkeit musical adaptation of Breaking Bad called \u201cBack to Meth-Use-Bubela\u201d). Where was I? Oh right. Reno. No, wait; Utopia \u2014 which is a lot different from Reno. For starters, Utopia doesn\u2019t have nickel slots and the maids at the Motel Six actually clean the rooms and don\u2019t chew tetracycline gum.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals have a utopian impulse but it only comes out in hints and nods. If you look for it, you won\u2019t find it. But if you relax your eyes, like with one of those posters showing hidden spaceships, it will emerge in plain sight. I think the current model for liberal utopianism is the college campus. Particularly for affluent kids who go to elite schools, college is a wonderful time where you \u201cdiscover\u201d yourself. And there\u2019s a lot of truth to that. But a lot of kids don\u2019t want that experience to end. The problem is that college is a Potemkin existence. It is only possible because of a vast network of wealth-generating forces off campus and under-appreciated hard-working people on campus. As I put it in the magazine:\n\nThere\u2019s a certain kind of elite student who takes himself very, very seriously. Raised on a suite of educational TV shows and books that insist he is the most special person in the world \u2014 studies confirm that Generation Y is the most egocentric and self-regarding generation in our history \u2014 he is away from home for the first time, enjoying his first experience of freedom from his parents. Those same parents are paying for his education, which he considers his birthright. Shelter is provided for him. Janitors and maids clean up after him. Security guards protect him. Cooks shop for him and prepare his food. The health center provides him medical care and condoms aplenty. Administrators slave away at finding new ways for him to have fun in his free time. He drinks with abandon when he wants to, and the consequences of his bacchanalia are usually somewhere between mild and nonexistent. Sex is as abundant as it is varied. If he does not espouse any noticeably conservative or Christian attitudes, his every utterance in the classroom is celebrated as a \u201cvaluable perspective.\u201d All that is demanded of him is that he pursue his interests and, perhaps, \u201cfind himself\u201d along the way. His ethical training amounts to a prohibition on bruising the overripe self-esteem of another person, particularly a person in good standing with the Coalition of the Oppressed (blacks, Latinos, Muslims, women, gays, lesbians, transsexuals, et al.). Such offenses are dubbed hate crimes and are punished in a style perfected in Lenin\u2019s utopia: through the politicized psychiatry known as \u201csensitivity training.\u201d But even as this sensitivity is being cultivated, the student is stuffed to the gills with cant about the corruption of \u201cthe system,\u201d i.e., the real world just outside the gates of his educational Shangri-La. He is taught that it is brave to be \u201csubversive\u201d and cowardly to be \u201cconformist.\u201d Administrators encourage kitschy reenactments of 1960s radicalism by celebrating protest as part of a well-rounded education \u2014 so long as the students are protesting approved targets, those being the iniquities of \u201cthe system.\u201d There is much Orwellian muchness to it all, since these play-acting protests and purportedly rebellious denunciations of the status quo are in fact the height of conformity. But it is a comfortable conformity, and this student \u2014 who in all likelihood will go into a profession at the pinnacle of the commanding heights of our culture \u2014 looks at this Potemkin world and thinks it is the way things are supposed to be. He feels freer than he ever has or ever will again, but that freedom is illusory. He is, in fact, a dependent: All his fundamental needs are met and paid for by others. This is what the political theorists call positive liberty \u2014 when someone else gives you a whole pile of stuff so you can be \u201cfree\u201d to do whatever you want.\n\nThe elite college kids I have in mind are the most dependent people in the world, the beneficiaries of every kind of affluence, financial, social, even civilizational and yet they think they are independent free-agents.\n\nWage Slaves, No More!\n\nIf you think about it, the spin that Obamacare is awesome because it breaks the iron shackles of \u201cjob-lock\u201d is a good example of what I am getting at. Via Charlie Cooke I saw this tweet from the Huffington Post\u2019s congressional correspondent, Michael McAuliff:\n\nThere\u2019s an irony in the GOP complaining that ACA lets people quit jobs. I mean, what\u2019s wrong with freedom?\n\nThere\u2019s a great swirling maelstrom of philosophical fallacy stretching backwards from this tweet like the funnel cloud of a cyclone extending down and backward from a swirling maw of ignorance [\u201cPush away the keyboard and sit out the next few plays\u201d -- The Couch]. It assumes that negative liberty \u2014 which right-minded people call, simply \u201cliberty\u201d \u2014 is, in Charlie\u2019s words, \u201ca mirage.\u201d Government gives you freedom by giving you stuff. This is the logic that says a refusal to subsidize art is censorship; that the failure to provide housing is the same as denying it; that people have a right to have things provided for them they are unwilling to earn themselves. Or as FDR said \u201cnecessitous men are not free men.\u201d So when the government gives you stuff you need (or merely want) it is setting you free.\n\nWhat I like about McAuliff\u2019s tweet is the light and airy sense of the new to it. As if he stumbled onto an insight about conservative objections to positive-liberty arguments that hadn\u2019t occurred to conservatives before. Never mind that this is one of the oldest arguments in political philosophy. (Just for the record, I don\u2019t reject all of the things associated with positive-liberty interventions by the state, I just reject the notion that humans have a \u201cright\u201d to material goods. The state may have obligations moral or legal, but those don\u2019t amount to universal human rights. That\u2019s because rights come from God not from government. We\u2019re not born with material possessions, but we are born with inalienable rights. Confusion on this point has immiserated millions.)\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi says that Obamacare is entrepreneurial because it will let people quit their jobs to become poets, you can see the campus utopianism coming through. Quitting your job is like changing your major from business administration to French literature. \u201cYou just make the most of yourself, dear,\u201d Dean of Students Pelosi is saying, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d Who is Julia \u2014 of \u201cLife of Julia\u201d fame \u2014 other than a permanent student with the government operating as a sympathetic R.A. or academic adviser? When you read millennial Lefties like this guy, you can almost hear him trying to convince his Model U.N. buddies to stage a sit-in at the cafeteria. Everyone should have a job if they want one, but nobody should have to take a job they don\u2019t like. From design your major to design your life.\n\nOf course, Utopias don\u2019t exist \u2014 the word itself means \u201cNo Place.\u201d Which is why I love listening to the supposed champions of the \u201creality-based community\u201d talking as if, with just a tiny bit of tinkering and a few more tax hikes, everything will click into place. Harry Reid said this week that Obamacare will help achieve the goal of making everyone a \u201cfree agent.\u201d This from a voluntary thrall of labor unions \u2014 who consider free-agency in any form to be heresy \u2014 and the chief protector of Obamacare, which denies Americans the freedom to refuse to purchase a product they don\u2019t want.\n\nEutopias \u2014 good societies, not perfect ones \u2014 do exist. We live in one as a matter of fact. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement. There always is, and always has been. But when you\u2019ve got a good thing, there is almost by definition, no need to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d it into something else. The utopian can never fully accept this because the good is always the enemy of the perfect. And it\u2019s true that the perfect is better than the merely good in every respect, save one. It doesn\u2019t, and cannot, exist. And dreaming of things that have never been and asking \u201cWhy Not?\u201d won\u2019t change that.\n\nZo\u00eb Update\n\nSo, I am very happy to report Zo\u00eb is doing great. Not only does she seem to have kicked the parvo bug (knock on wood), but it appears that a lot of her weird behavioral issues stemmed from the fact that she was just sick from the moment we got her, poor girl. She\u2019s still a bit too fearful of big dogs and \u2014 I am a little embarrassed to say \u2014 too obsequious to our cats. If it weren\u2019t so humiliating it\u2019d be sweet. She thinks Gracie (the good cat, as opposed to my wife\u2019s cat) should be her playmate. Zo\u00eb kind of does this strange growl-howl when Gracie won\u2019t play with her and then rolls around on the floor while Gracie hisses. The good news is that Zo\u00eb is very clearly determined to ethnically cleanse the block of squirrels. Anyway thanks very much for your kind notes and support.

If you look for it, you won\u2019t find it. But if you relax your eyes, like with one of those posters showing hidden spaceships, it will emerge in plain sight. I think the current model for liberal utopianism is the college campus. Particularly for affluent kids who go to elite schools, college is a wonderful time where you \u201cdiscover\u201d yourself. And there\u2019s a lot of truth to that. But a lot of kids don\u2019t want that experience to end. The problem is that college is a Potemkin existence. It is only possible because of a vast network of wealth-generating forces off campus and under-appreciated hard-working people on campus. As I put it in the magazine:\n\n\nThere\u2019s a certain kind of elite student who takes himself very, very seriously. Raised on a suite of educational TV shows and books that insist he is the most special person in the world \u2014 studies confirm that Generation Y is the most egocentric and self-regarding generation in our history \u2014 he is away from home for the first time, enjoying his first experience of freedom from his parents. Those same parents are paying for his education, which he considers his birthright. Shelter is provided for him. Janitors and maids clean up after him. Security guards protect him. Cooks shop for him and prepare his food. The health center provides him medical care and condoms aplenty. Administrators slave away at finding new ways for him to have fun in his free time. He drinks with abandon when he wants to, and the consequences of his bacchanalia are usually somewhere between mild and nonexistent. Sex is as abundant as it is varied. If he does not espouse any noticeably conservative or Christian attitudes, his every utterance in the classroom is celebrated as a \u201cvaluable perspective.\u201d All that is demanded of him is that he pursue his interests and, perhaps, \u201cfind himself\u201d along the way. His ethical training amounts to a prohibition on bruising the overripe self-esteem of another person, particularly a person in good standing with the Coalition of the Oppressed (blacks, Latinos, Muslims, women, gays, lesbians, transsexuals, et al.). Such offenses are dubbed hate crimes and are punished in a style perfected in Lenin\u2019s utopia: through the politicized psychiatry known as \u201csensitivity training.\u201d\n\nBut even as this sensitivity is being cultivated, the student is stuffed to the gills with cant about the corruption of \u201cthe system,\u201d i.e., the real world just outside the gates of his educational Shangri-La. He is taught that it is brave to be \u201csubversive\u201d and cowardly to be \u201cconformist.\u201d Administrators encourage kitschy reenactments of 1960s radicalism by celebrating protest as part of a well-rounded education \u2014 so long as the students are protesting approved targets, those being the iniquities of \u201cthe system.\u201d There is much Orwellian muchness to it all, since these play-acting protests and purportedly rebellious denunciations of the status quo are in fact the height of conformity.\n\nBut it is a comfortable conformity, and this student \u2014 who in all likelihood will go into a profession at the pinnacle of the commanding heights of our culture \u2014 looks at this Potemkin world and thinks it is the way things are supposed to be. He feels freer than he ever has or ever will again, but that freedom is illusory. He is, in fact, a dependent: All his fundamental needs are met and paid for by others.

This is the logic that says a refusal to subsidize art is censorship; that the failure to provide housing is the same as denying it; that people have a right to have things provided for them they are unwilling to earn themselves. Or as FDR said \u201cnecessitous men are not free men.\u201d So when the government gives you stuff you need (or merely want) it is setting you free.\n\n#ad#What I like about McAuliff\u2019s tweet is the light and airy sense of the new to it. As if he stumbled onto an insight about conservative objections to positive-liberty arguments that hadn\u2019t occurred to conservatives before. Never mind that this is one of the oldest arguments in political philosophy. (Just for the record, I don\u2019t reject all of the things associated with positive-liberty interventions by the state, I just reject the notion that humans have a \u201cright\u201d to material goods. The state may have obligations moral or legal, but those don\u2019t amount to universal human rights. That\u2019s because rights come from God not from government. We\u2019re not born with material possessions, but we are born with inalienable rights. Confusion on this point has immiserated millions.)\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi says that Obamacare is entrepreneurial because it will let people quit their jobs to become poets, you can see the campus utopianism coming through. Quitting your job is like changing your major from business administration to French literature. \u201cYou just make the most of yourself, dear,\u201d Dean of Students Pelosi is saying, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d Who is Julia \u2014 of \u201cLife of Julia\u201d fame \u2014 other than a permanent student with the government operating as a sympathetic R.A. or academic adviser?

Harry Reid said this week that Obamacare will help achieve the goal of making everyone a \u201cfree agent.\u201d This from a voluntary thrall of labor unions \u2014 who consider free-agency in any form to be heresy \u2014 and the chief protector of Obamacare, which denies Americans the freedom to refuse to purchase a product they don\u2019t want.\n\nEutopias \u2014 good societies, not perfect ones \u2014 do exist. We live in one as a matter of fact. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement. There always is, and always has been. But when you\u2019ve got a good thing, there is almost by definition, no need to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d it into something else. The utopian can never fully accept this because the good is always the enemy of the perfect. And it\u2019s true that the perfect is better than the merely good in every respect, save one.
