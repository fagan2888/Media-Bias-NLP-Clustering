Nonetheless, HHS has set up a system to \"turn off\" benefits for anyone who is found to be ineligible.\n\nJulie Bataille, communications coordinator for the health care rollout, said most of the discrepancies appear to be due to outdated information in government files -- and the \"vast majority\" of cases are being resolved in favor of consumers. The government is making an all-out effort to reach those with discrepancies, which officials have termed \"inconsistencies.\"\n\n\"The fact that a consumer has an inconsistency on their application does not mean there is a problem on their enrollment,\" said Bataille. \"Most of the time what that means is that there is more up-to-date information that they need to provide to us.\"\n\nThe document provided to AP said that 2.1 million people enrolled through the new health insurance exchanges were \"affected by one or more inconsistency\" as of the end of April.\n\nThe exchanges offer subsidized private coverage to lower-income and middle-class people with no access to health care on the job. The sliding-scale subsidies are based on income and family size, and are also affected by where a person lives. Because they are structured as tax credits, the Internal Revenue Service can deduct any overpayments from a taxpayer's refund the following year.\n\nUnder the law, only citizens and legal immigrants are entitled to subsidized coverage.\n\nUpdated numbers provided by Bataille indicate that the total number of people affected remains about the same as a month ago. About 1.2 million have discrepancies related to income; 505,000 have issues with immigration data, and 461,000 have conflicts related to citizenship information.\n\nThe law contemplated there would be verification problems with the new program, and provided for a 90-day window to clear up discrepancies. During this time, a consumer's coverage is not affected.\n\nAbout 60 percent of all the people with discrepancies are still within that 90-day period, said Bataille. Consumers who get a request for additional information can upload documents electronically or mail them in. The HHS request is supposed to specifically describe any information that the government needs.\n\nThe HHS document provided to AP, dated May 8, describes a laborious effort to try to resolve the data problems, largely requiring hands-on work from a legion of workers employed by government contractor Serco, Inc.\n\n\"Current system access and functionality...limits the ability to resolve outstanding inconsistencies,\" said the document. \"A phased approach is proposed, initially leveraging manual processes.\"\n\nAtop the priority list are citizenship and immigration issues, then annual income.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee will hold hearings next week on the data issues affecting eligibility for health care benefits. The HHS inspector general is expected to deliver a report to Congress later this summer on how well the administration is doing at preventing inaccurate payments and fraud.", "article_metadata":
