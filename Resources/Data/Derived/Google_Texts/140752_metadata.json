The reports paint a portrait of an Administration casting aside security concerns\u2014potentially putting Americans\u2019 financial and health data at risk\u2014in its push to open insurance exchanges in all 50 states by October 1. These recent developments should provide further impetus for Congress to defund the entire law before the exchanges are able to undermine personal privacy.\n\nSecurity Delays, Timetables Slipping\n\nIn August, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) inspector general released a report highlighting many missed deadlines with respect to the security measures surrounding the Obamacare data hub.[1] The hub will provide access to government data from various government agencies\u2014tax filings and Social Security records, for example\u2014allowing exchanges to determine eligibility for subsidized insurance.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report found that \u201cseveral critical tasks remain to be completed in a short period of time\u201d in order to ensure the data hub\u2019s security.[2] Important elements of the security testing were delayed by two months. As a result, the official certification that the data hub is secure is not scheduled to occur until September 30, 2013\u2014one day before the exchanges are scheduled to open for business.[3]\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report noted the obvious problem that this tight timetable presents: \u201cIf there are additional delays\u2026the authorizing official may not have the full assessment of implemented security controls needed for the security authorization decision by\u201d the time open enrollment begins.[4] In other words, government officials could face a choice about whether to open the exchanges despite the potential risk to Americans\u2019 data security. Even if the security assessments are completed on time, there is no assurance they will work properly; the inspector general\u2019s report \u201cdid not review the functionality of the [data] hub.\u201d[5]\n\nWarnings Ignored\n\nSome government officials have warned of the privacy and security implications arising from shoddy data security\u2014even as the Obama Administration ignored those concerns. Michael Astrue, a former general counsel of HHS, offered objections while serving as the commissioner of Social Security through February 2013. He has called the Administration\u2019s exchange portal \u201can overly simplistic system without adequate privacy safeguards\u201d:\n\nThe system\u2019s lack of any substantial verification of the user would leave members of the public open to identity theft, lost periods of health insurance coverage, and exposure of address for victims of domestic abuse and others.[6]\n\nAstrue dubbed the version of the portal \u201cthe most widespread violation of the Privacy Act in our history,\u201d noting that both he and the head of the IRS \u201craised strong legal objections\u201d with the Office of Management and Budget\u2014objections that, Astrue argues, have been ignored in favor of what he calls \u201can absurdly broad interpretation of the Privacy Act\u2019s \u2018routine use\u2019 exemption.\u201d[7]\n\nNavigators Pose a Security Risk\n\nWhile the data hub creates concerns that Americans could be subjected to electronic identity fraud, Obamacare\u2019s \u201cnavigators\u201d could subject Americans to in-person scams.[8] HHS recently announced it was lowering by one-third\u2014from 30 hours to 20\u2014the minimum training time for navigators.[9] As a result, individuals can be certified as navigators with fewer than three full days\u2019 training\u2014and few security checks. While guidelines regarding navigators released in July permitted states to establish \u201cminimum eligibility criteria and background checks\u201d for navigators, it did not require them to do so.[10]\n\nBecause their job involves helping Americans figure out their insurance options, navigators will often have access to sensitive personal information\u2014bank accounts, Social Security numbers, insurance identification, and more. Yet navigators will not be required to undergo background checks, and the process for filing complaints about unscrupulous navigators remains unclear at best. Even California\u2019s insurance commissioner\u2014a Democrat and strong supporter of Obamacare\u2014raised concerns that navigators would put consumers at risk for scams: \u201cWe can have a real disaster on our hands.\u201d[11]\n\nNot One Dime\n\nFederal agencies have already encountered difficulties preserving the integrity of Americans\u2019 sensitive information. Earlier this year, a medical provider in California sued the IRS for improperly seizing 60 million records of 10 million Americans.[12] Yet under Obamacare, the IRS and other federal agencies will hold more new powers and have access to even more of Americans\u2019 personal health and financial information.\n\nIn its mad rush to implement its unworkable law, the Obama Administration has taken a slapdash and shoddy approach to Americans\u2019 personal security. Given these stakes, the choice for Congress could not be clearer: Congress should preserve Americans\u2019 privacy by refusing to spend another dime implementing Obamacare.\n\n\u2014Chris Jacobs is Senior Policy Analyst in the Center for Health Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nAbout the Author Chris Jacobs Senior Policy Analyst\n\nCenter for Health Policy Studies", "article_metadata": {"description": "In its mad rush to implement Obamacare, the Administration has taken a slapdash and shoddy approach to Americans\u2019 personal security.", "og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "description": "In its mad rush to implement Obamacare, the Administration has taken a slapdash and shoddy approach to Americans\u2019 personal security.", "title": "How Obamacare Threatens Privacy in America", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/09/obamacare-s-threat-to-americans-privacy-of-health-and-financial-data", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "keywords": "Obamacare, privacy, health data, financial data, Department of Health and Human Services", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2014Chris Jacobs is Senior Policy Analyst in the Center for Health Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\nAbout the Author Chris Jacobs Senior Policy AnalystCenter for Health Policy Studies\nGiven these stakes, the choice for Congress could not be clearer: Congress should preserve Americans\u2019 privacy by refusing to spend another dime implementing Obamacare.\n[4] In other words, government officials could face a choice about whether to open the exchanges despite the potential risk to Americans\u2019 data security.\nThe reports paint a portrait of an Administration casting aside security concerns\u2014potentially putting Americans\u2019 financial and health data at risk\u2014in its push to open insurance exchanges in all 50 states by October 1."}
