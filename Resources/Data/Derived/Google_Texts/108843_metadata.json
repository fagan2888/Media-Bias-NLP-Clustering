Since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s inception in April 2013, the San Francisco-based company has grown to more than 900 employees. That makes it the largest firm among dozens that have sprouted in the law\u2019s wake, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which issued a report on the trend this week.\n\nThe health law, which took full effect in 2014, represents the most dramatic change to the U.S. health system in 50 years. Entrepreneurs, including some from within President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, have founded companies that target employers, health insurers, hospitals, doctors and consumers looking to navigate new requirements and possibilities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity for new market entrants,\u201d Zenefits\u2019 Conrad said. \u201cThe ground is literally shifting under the feet of the incumbents.\u201d\n\nConrad, a cancer survivor, said that after reading the Affordable Care Act cover-to-cover and talking to insurance experts, he realized it offered an opportunity to ease the process of pricing, selling and managing health insurance for small businesses. Zenefits, which has 10,000 clients, can \u201cspit out pricing\u201d for every health insurance plan in a state \u201cin milliseconds,\u201d using only the ages and addresses of employees, he said.\n\nLaw\u2019s Opponents\n\nOpponents of the Affordable Care Act have continually warned of the law\u2019s potential effect on U.S. jobs, with Republican John Boehner of Ohio, the House Speaker, frequently calling it \u201cthe president\u2019s job-killing health-care law.\u201d The American Action Forum, a nonprofit advocacy group that opposes the law, has blamed it for reducing pay at businesses with 20 to 99 employees by about $22.6 billion annually.\n\nStill, the act became law just as the nation\u2019s employment figures began to improve. On March 6, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. added 295,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, the lowest level in about seven years. The economy has added at least 200,000 jobs for 12 straight months, the best run since a 19-month stretch that ended in March 1995.\n\n\u201cThe claim that the Affordable Care Act is a job-killer is just factually untrue,\u201d said Bob Kocher, a doctor and former Obama adviser who is now a partner at New York-based venture capital firm Venrock Associates.\n\n\u2018Enormous Opportunity\u2019\n\nThe law has \u201ccreated the most enormous opportunity to build health-care companies ever,\u201d Kocher said.\n\nHis firm has invested in eight such startups, including a Bethesda, Maryland-based company started last year by another former Obama administration official, Farzad Mostashari. His company, Aledade assists doctors looking to take advantage of a program in the health-care law that offers higher payments under Medicare, the insurance plan for the elderly and disabled, if they can reduce the cost of caring for those patients without harming their health.\n\nMostashari didn\u2019t return a phone message left at his office.\n\nBurwell\u2019s View\n\nThe U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, made an appearance today at Rock Health, a venture capital fund in San Francisco that backs health-care companies, to promote the health law\u2019s benefits for entrepreneurs. Since 2012, the Health and Human Services Department has hosted an annual event it calls \u201cHealth Datapalooza\u201d to encourage entrepreneurs to use its resources.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has \u201cprovided funding for us to make more investments in data and make that data available to the private sector to help find solutions to some of our biggest challenges through innovation,\u201d Burwell said in San Francisco, according to a transcript distributed by her department.\n\nIn the five years prior to the law \u201cyou don\u2019t get anywhere close\u201d to as many startups in the health-care industry, said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s Health Research Institute, which published the report.\n\n\u2018Stark Difference\u2019\n\n\u201cThere really is a stark difference,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought it was striking how many entrepreneurs said to us, \u2018This has sparked innovation and entrepreneurship.\u2019\u201d\n\nOmada Health, a San Francisco-based company that helps employers and insurers prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals \u201cis a direct result of the ACA,\u201d said CEO Sean Duffy.\n\nThe company\u2019s online service uses prevention techniques that were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under a little-known program funded by the health-care law, Duffy said.\n\nSome companies give only partial credit to the Affordable Care Act. They also were formed because of a related law passed a year earlier that provided federal money for hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices to buy electronic record systems, as well as advancements in mobile and wireless computing technology.\n\nJob Catalyst\n\nJiff, a Palo Alto, California-based company that\u2019s also funded by Venrock, helps large employers organize their health benefits and recommend specific services to workers that may improve their health and reduce the firms\u2019 costs.\n\nThe business \u201cwas conceptualized before the Affordable Care Act and wasn\u2019t completely dependent on it,\u201d Jiff\u2019s CEO, Derek Newell, said in a phone interview. However, the law\u2019s arrival encouraged employers to use Jiff by allowing them to reward workers for healthy behaviors, such as participating in tobacco-cessation programs or disease-management plans for costly conditions like diabetes.\n\n\u201cTo my mind, it has been an amazing catalyst for job creation and innovation in my segment of the economy,\u201d Newell said.\n\n(An earlier version of this story corrected erroneous references to the name of startup Zenefits.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "More than 90 new health-care companies employing as many as 6,200 people have been created in the U.S. since Obamacare became law, a level of entrepreneurial activity that participants say may be unprecedented for the industry.", "title": "Obamacare Is Spurring Startups and Creating Jobs", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/dozens-of-startups-in-obamacare-s-wake-reveal-law-as-job-creator", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iFl8Xhzxn2ME/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Yourpeople Inc,Parker Conrad,Law,Health", "news_keywords": "Yourpeople Inc,Parker Conrad,Law,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/dozens-of-startups-in-obamacare-s-wake-reveal-law-as-job-creator", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Is Spurring Startups and Creating Jobs", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-20T19:16:14.221Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "More than 90 new health-care companies employing as many as 6,200 people have been created in the U.S. since Obamacare became law, a level of entrepreneurial activity that participants say may be unprecedented for the industry.", "parsely-tags": "Yourpeople Inc,Parker Conrad,Law,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-03-20T19:16:14.221Z", "parsely-section": "game-plan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "More than 90 new health-care companies employing as many as 6,200 people have been created in the U.S. since Obamacare became law, a level of entrepreneurial activity that participants say may be unprecedented for the industry.", "title": "Obamacare Is Spurring Startups and Creating Jobs", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/dozens-of-startups-in-obamacare-s-wake-reveal-law-as-job-creator", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iFl8Xhzxn2ME/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "More than 90 new health-care companies employing as many as 6,200 people have been created in the U.S. since Obamacare became law, a level of entrepreneurial activity that participants say may be unprecedented for the industry."}, "parsely-post-id": "NLHAV16JIJUP01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iFl8Xhzxn2ME/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2654\"", "article_summary": "The health law, which took full effect in 2014, represents the most dramatic change to the U.S. health system in 50 years.\nThe business \u201cwas conceptualized before the Affordable Care Act and wasn\u2019t completely dependent on it,\u201d Jiff\u2019s CEO, Derek Newell, said in a phone interview.\nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s inception in April 2013, the San Francisco-based company has grown to more than 900 employees.\nSome companies give only partial credit to the Affordable Care Act.\n\u2018Enormous Opportunity\u2019The law has \u201ccreated the most enormous opportunity to build health-care companies ever,\u201d Kocher said."}
