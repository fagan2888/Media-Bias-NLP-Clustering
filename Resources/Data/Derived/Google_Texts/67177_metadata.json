(WDRB) -- There's a new wild card in the race for Kentucky governor. An independent candidate has jumped in and, in a tight race, he could very well shake things up.\n\nDrew Curtis believes there is enough dissatisfaction with politics as usual in Frankfort to put him in the governor's mansion.\n\nYou've probably never heard of Drew Curtis, but you may know of his offbeat and irreverent news website, FARK.com.\n\nHe's a digital entrepreneur from Versailles who now wants to be governor, making it official by filing his paperwork and the required petition with the state election office.\n\nCurtis believes he'll attract both dissatisfied Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cJack Conway has yet to say \u2018no\u2019 to any question beginning with the words 'Would you fund this?' And Matt Bevin can't remember what his policy positions are 20 minutes after he says them,\u201d Curtis told reporters at a news conference on the Capitol steps.\n\nCurtis says he switched from Democrat to Independent last year. He says he voted for Obama in 2008, but says he doesn\u2019t remember who got his vote in 2012.\n\n\u201cI think I might have flipped the button to Romney because I had a friend who worked for him who said he was great,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nOn the hot button issues, Curtis says he supports the Affordable Care Act, as long as long the state can afford it. He says he is anti-union, but not convinced right to work laws work. He says he would sign a bill legalizing marijuana, and does not side with county clerks protesting same sex marriage.\n\nCurtis says he's neither liberal nor conservative, calling himself a pragmatist.\n\n\u201cIf everyone who ever said government does not work for me comes out in November, I will win in a landslide. And that's a fact,\u201d he said.\n\nCurtis says he and his running mate, wife and business partner, Heather, will rely heavily on social media.\n\nHe says he's not sure from which opponent he'll take more votes, Republican Matt Bevin or Democrat Jack Conway.\n\n\u201cAll votes do not belong to the two parties by default. That's not how this system was envisioned. In fact, if you want the votes come get \u2018em,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nCurtis' first big challenge is to gain at least 10 percent support in the polls; enough to be on stage for the upcoming debates, especially the statewide debate on KET.\n\nYou can access Drew Curtis' campaign website here.\n\nCopyright 2015 WDRB News.
