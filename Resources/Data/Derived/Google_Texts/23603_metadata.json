Employees at Aetna who took a course in mindfulness saw a $2,000 drop per year in their health care costs and experienced increased productivity as well.\n\nRelated: The New Corporate Success Strategy: Face Time\n\nHedge fund managers on Wall Street are practicing mindfulness. Hospital administrators in busy medical centers are finding ways to embrace their inner calm. Even lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington are meditating (shockingly).\n\n\u201cCompanies are finding real benefits when they bring mindfulness to work,\u201d said David Gelles, author of a new book, Mindful Work: How Meditation Is Changing Business from the Inside Out. Stress reduction is chief among them. \u201cThe pace of our daily lives is so intense that any opportunity to break the habit of going non-stop and stressing ourselves out is not only pleasant, but necessary.\u201d\n\nGelles vividly describes a mindfulness session he witnessed at General Mills. First, a deputy general counsel led a group of employees in a breathing exercise to aid their concentration. Then she asked them to \u201cexpand that awareness\u201d to the rest of their body \u2013 their hands, their feet. They did some gentle yoga, had a group discussion, enjoyed a poetry reading and meditated again.\n\n\u201cAs a business reporter I had never seen anything like it,\u201d Gelles says in his book:\n\nAt the end of the session, the General Mills employees seemed decidedly more relaxed than they had been when they arrived. No doubt they still had plenty of complaints and lingering stress about their jobs [the company was in the midst of a round of layoffs]. Yet it was also clear that after the two-hour class, there was a genuine warmth in the room\u2026. At least one woman in the session had been informed she was being let go. She cried a bit. Then, several of her colleagues, including some strangers, approached to offer hugs and words of support. It was altogether a more humane atmosphere than the cutthroat buzz I\u2019d so often encountered at corporate headquarters.\n\nGelles has himself practiced mindfulness for 15 years \u2013 but he\u2019s quick to correct anyone who assumes this means a more relaxed approached to work, productivity and results.\n\nRelated: The One Trait All Leaders Should Have\n\n\u201cMindfulness does not ask us to not work fast or hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to intentionally create some space around our tasks and to lose some of the self-judging many of us are prone to on a regular basis. It\u2019s far better if we approach things as they happen even if they\u2019re happening at a very fast pace. We need to accept them for what they are and move forward.\u201d\n\nIn addition to reducing stress, Gelles shared three other benefits many corporate leaders, executives and workers are finding from mindfulness:\n\nIncreased focus and concentration. \u201cWe regain control of our attention. We come back to our breath over and over again even when our minds wander \u2013 and they\u2019re always wandering. Simple attentional training can yield big benefits in the long run.\u201d\n\nImproved creativity, calmness and compassion. \u201cMany leaders who embrace mindfulness cite these valuable qualities. They especially find an increase in their empathy toward a range of constituents. Bill Ford at Ford Motor Company discovered this, as has Mark Bertolini, the CEO of Aetna.\u201d Workers find their frustrations are not as unique as they think. That new understanding can become a liberating force.\n\nRelated: 20 Craziest Job Interview Questions\n\nFuller awareness of everyday tasks. \u201cYou notice your thoughts, your emotions \u2013 then you proceed,\u201d said Gelles. \u201cIt\u2019s about being aware of small moments. This can be even more effective than taking a big chunk of time to practice mindful meditation.\u201d\n\nGelles cites three reasons mindfulness as practiced today has gained traction. \u201cThe research is finally here \u2013 there\u2019s a huge amount of data showing the benefits of this practice. There\u2019s also been a broad shift in the culture. And we\u2019re all so connected to screens that any opportunity to interrupt that velocity is welcome.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The practice of mindful awareness has come out of the yoga studio and moved into the w", "title": "4 Proven Ways Mindfulness Can Help You at Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/21/4-Proven-Ways-Mindfulness-Can-Help-You-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/21/4-Proven-Ways-Mindfulness-Can-Help-You-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The practice of mindful awareness has come out of the yoga studio and moved into the w", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae41\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCompanies are finding real benefits when they bring mindfulness to work,\u201d said David Gelles, author of a new book, Mindful Work: How Meditation Is Changing Business from the Inside Out.\nThis can be even more effective than taking a big chunk of time to practice mindful meditation.\u201dGelles cites three reasons mindfulness as practiced today has gained traction.\nGelles has himself practiced mindfulness for 15 years \u2013 but he\u2019s quick to correct anyone who assumes this means a more relaxed approached to work, productivity and results.\nRelated: The New Corporate Success Strategy: Face TimeHedge fund managers on Wall Street are practicing mindfulness.\nRelated: The One Trait All Leaders Should Have\u201cMindfulness does not ask us to not work fast or hard,\u201d he said."}
