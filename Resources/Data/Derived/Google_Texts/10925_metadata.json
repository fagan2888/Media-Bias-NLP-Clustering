Using a specific example, Facebook\u2019s data scientists were able to show how one meme was distorted into 121,605 variants that appeared in 1.14 million status updates.\n\nHere\u2019s the original meme:\n\n\u201cNo one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, post this as your status for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nThat exact statement was used by 470,000 Facebook users as their status update in September 2009, according to the study. At some point, the wording began to change. Someone added the variant by saying \u201c(Name) thinks that,\u201d and that variant was copied 60,000 times. The third most popular variant inserted \u201cWe are only as strong as the weakest among us\u201d in the middle.\u201d At one point \u201cThe rest of the day\u201d translated into \u201cthe next 24 hours.\u201d\n\nConsidering the subject of the meme, many of the variants were political in nature, and some satirical, including \u201cNo one should be frozen in carbonite because they can\u2019t pay Jabba The Hut.\u201d The researchers found that the original variant, unsurprisingly, was propagated primarily by liberals, as were sci-fi variants. However, alcohol-related variants were conservative, as were ones mentioning taxes, Obamacare, and government.\n\nIn their conclusion, the scientists drew parallels between how information evolves in a social network and how genes evolve.\n\n[Images: Facebook]\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of data scientists researched how memes evolve on Facebook, specifically one from 2009 involving healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Social News Daily", "description": "A group of data scientists researched how memes evolve on Facebook, specifically one from 2009 involving healthcare.", "title": "Study Shows How Memes Evolve On Facebook", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 725, "identifier": "http://socialnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Facebook-Memes-Evolve.png", "height": 425}, "updated_time": "2014-03-23T07:58:48-04:00", "url": "http://socialnewsdaily.com/22497/study-shows-how-memes-evolve-on-facebook/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent study shows that memes on Facebook evolve much like a game of telephone, distorting their original intention for something else.
