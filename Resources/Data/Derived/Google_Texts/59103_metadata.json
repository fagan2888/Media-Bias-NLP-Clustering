But in a phone interview with Bob Sheehy, he noted that before he led UnitedHealthcare, he was once an entrepreneur.\n\nHe was one of the early employees of Peak Health Plan, a Colorado based company with a four-state HMO network of 104,000 enrollees, before UnitedHealth Group acquired it in 1986 for a cool $86 million. He served in several roles at UnitedHealthcare over the next 20 years. He became CEO in 2001 and was in that role through 2006. From 2007-2008, he was senior vice president for UnitedHealth Group. Prior to Bright Health he served as a director at Netsmart Technologies and as a healthcare adviser at private equity firm Genstar Capital.\n\nAsked about the contrasting worlds of leading a startup and a huge company, he said as a startup he said it\u2019s able to be much more nimble and quick to expedite solutions, and yet it\u2019s led by a team with deep health insurance experience and knowledge of how to use technology to simplify processes and connect people.\n\nIt currently has a staff of 25 and expects to double that by the end of the year, Sheehy said.\n\nThe company came together last summer. Sheehy said he met Bright Health\u2018s president Kyle Rolfing when UnitedHealth acquired Definity Health, which he founded. Dr. Tom Valdivia, the chief medical officer of Bright, also was chief health consumer officer of Definity Health. Valdivia was also a co-founder and president of Carol, a package-based direct to consumer care marketplace that also helped consumers calculate their out-of-pocket financial liability with Minnesota health plans. Optum acquired Carol in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking of health plan opportunities. We came to the realization that consumers will play an increasingly important role in healthcare plan coverage and consumers, in most parts of the country, don\u2019t have good choices.\u201d\n\nSheehy added that the health plan space offered a huge market opportunity in the realm of the consumer insurance marketplace.\n\nHe contrasted his team\u2019s experience with healthcare plans with the technology background of Oscar\u2019s. He said that although it is targeting the individuals who are driven by the Affordable Care Act to pick their own plans rather than employers, it\u2019s also working with large health systems who are interested in more integrated healthcare. It wants to use technology to connect these groups.\n\nSheehy added that his experience at UnitedHealthcare has taught him how to scale a company from a few million to tens of millions as well as what it takes to run a company in several markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I try to bring to whatever I do is a fundamental understanding of what happens in care settings. It is really about understanding what happens at that personal level.\u201d\n\nBessemer Ventures Partners led the Series A round for Bright Health. Stephen Kraus, a partner with the firm who oversees healthcare investments, said one goal is to eliminate the divide between payers and providers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inertia because of the fracture that exists between those areas,\u201d he said. Hospital system execs will take Bright Health\u2019s calls because they are its partners. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer payer versus provider \u2014 that\u2019s key to its model.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Consumers will play an increasingly important role in healthcare plan coverage and consumers, in most parts of the country, don't have good choices,\" Bright Health CEO and Co-founder Bob Sheehy said.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "\"Consumers will play an increasingly important role in healthcare plan coverage and consumers, in most parts of the country, don't have good choices,\" Bright Health CEO and Co-founder Bob Sheehy said.", "title": "There and back again: Ex UH CEO shares perspective of leading a healthcare startup", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/compass.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-07T20:39:19-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/04/there-and-back-again-bright-health-ceo-shares-insights-on-being-an-entrepreneur-and-heading-uh/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/compass.jpg", "description": "\"Consumers will play an increasingly important role in healthcare plan coverage and consumers, in most parts of the country, don't have good choices,\" Bright Health CEO and Co-founder Bob Sheehy said.", "card": "summary", "title": "There and back again: Ex UH CEO shares perspective of leading a healthcare startup - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Bob Sheehy, Bright Health, Minneapolis, payers, Startups, UnitedHealthcare, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "UnitedHealthcare", "published_time": "2016-04-07T19:51:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-07T20:39:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But in a phone interview with Bob Sheehy, he noted that before he led UnitedHealthcare, he was once an entrepreneur.\nPrior to Bright Health he served as a director at Netsmart Technologies and as a healthcare adviser at private equity firm Genstar Capital.\nIt is really about understanding what happens at that personal level.\u201dBessemer Ventures Partners led the Series A round for Bright Health.\n\u201cWe were thinking of health plan opportunities.\nDr. Tom Valdivia, the chief medical officer of Bright, also was chief health consumer officer of Definity Health."}
