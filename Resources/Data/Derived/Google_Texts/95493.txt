“I’m stepping up to the plate as your Republican candidate to represent you, the great people of Faulkner County, because we need a common sense, conservative voice in Little Rock to fight for lower taxes while spurring job creation, reduce wasteful government spending, and strengthen our state’s education system. I’m here to serve my neighbors as our representative and I am willing to stand-up for what we believe in. Together we can make Arkansas a beacon of opportunity and bring more of the American Dream to Faulkner County.”
