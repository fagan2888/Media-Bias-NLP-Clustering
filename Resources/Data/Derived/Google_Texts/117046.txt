The headline in the AP story says it all: “Crunch time at small businesses as health care demands loom.” “Loom” is the right word. As the story explains, starting next year, the dreaded ObamaCare employer mandate kicks in for businesses with between 50 and 99 employees. That means they will all have to offer their full-time workers — which means anyone clocking in more than 30 hours a week — government-approved health benefits, or face a steep fine.

President Obama delayed this mandate twice, citing the cost and disruptions it would cause.

The delays have come to an end, and as of Jan. 1, these companies will not only have to provide “affordable” insurance for these workers, they must also file complex new tax forms with the IRS detailing the cost of the insurance, the names and Social Security numbers of employees and their dependents, and how long they were covered by insurance.

The compliance costs alone can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, prompting one HR contractor to tell AP that “it’s probably going to be a big nightmare for a lot of businesses.”

The AP story goes on to detail other troubles businesses will face in meeting ObamaCare’s mandate, noting that “even companies that already offer insurance may be in for a surprise if their current plans don’t meet the law’s requirements.”

Keep in mind the fact that these medium-sized companies are typically the ones that create the most jobs in a growing economy, and the fact that the ObamaCare employer mandate has already shown to have an adverse effect on jobs and worker hours.

President Obama often talks about avoiding “self-inflicted” wounds to the economy, by which he means bad public policy. But his own ObamaCare law could prove to be a big one next year.
