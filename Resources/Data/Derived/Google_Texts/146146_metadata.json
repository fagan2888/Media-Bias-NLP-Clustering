Baylor signed its first agreement last fall with McLennan Community College in Waco.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful, proud, and we feel very blessed to be part of this partnership,\u201d Starr said during the TJC signing ceremony.\n\nThe program works as follows. Students enroll full-time at TJC in the Baylor Bound program and become Baylor transfer students when they complete certain criteria.\n\nStudents can declare their intent to transfer to Baylor by submitting a Baylor Bound application before enrolling at TJC or while enrolled as a full-time student, according to a news release about the program.\n\nBaylor\u2019s Office of Admission Services will determine who is admitted to the program, according to the news release.\n\nTJC Baylor Bound students can choose from 65 majors. Online resources provide information about the majors and course transfer equivalency between the two schools.\n\nMost Baylor Bound students will take classes for one year at TJC followed by three years at Baylor. But, two years at each institution is a possibility in some programs and situations, according to the news release.\n\nStudents must enroll in an approved associate\u2019s degree program, which will lead to an approved bachelor\u2019s degree program.\n\nStarr said the agreement makes sense educationally and in terms of efficiencies and controlling costs.\n\nTJC Baylor Bound students will be part of a cohort of students with special Baylor-related benefits.\n\nAdvisers from both schools will help the students select courses that satisfy the program requirements to enable a successful transition from TJC to Baylor, according to the news release.\n\nTJC Baylor Bound students also will receive information about scholarships and other resources available to transfer students.\n\nWith the strong Baylor alumni presence in East Texas, TJC officials are hoping to see scholarships develop specifically for Baylor Bound students.\n\n\u201cA quality education shouldn\u2019t be out of reach for a family simply because they don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d Metke said. \u201cBaylor Bound makes a first class education possible for these students.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "An agreement between Tyler Junior College and Baylor University will aim to make it easier for s...", "title": "Agreement to make transfers easier with TJC, Baylor - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/201447/agreement-to-make-transfers-easier-with-tjc-baylor", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6584\"", "article_summary": "Students enroll full-time at TJC in the Baylor Bound program and become Baylor transfer students when they complete certain criteria.\nWith the strong Baylor alumni presence in East Texas, TJC officials are hoping to see scholarships develop specifically for Baylor Bound students.\nMost Baylor Bound students will take classes for one year at TJC followed by three years at Baylor.\nTJC Baylor Bound students will be part of a cohort of students with special Baylor-related benefits.\nThe agreement, which will be effective in fall 2015, is the second Baylor Bound program the university has launched."}
