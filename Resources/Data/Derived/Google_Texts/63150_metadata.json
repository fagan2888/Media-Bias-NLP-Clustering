With one being the best, and 10 being the worst, sleeping outside was a \u201c50,\u201d she said. That was nothing compared to not knowing what was to come.\n\nPowerlessness and lack of knowledge as to what will happen next, where the next meal would come from, and where your body will find rest, are a big part of the experience Mission Waco offered as it led more than 30 people Friday through Sunday through a poverty simulation.\n\nSpanning 29 years, Jimmy and Janet Dorrell have led more than 15,000 people from across the world through their program designed to let someone experience life through other people\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next because you don\u2019t have the power to know, and you don\u2019t have the power to pay for it and you don\u2019t have the power to control it. You\u2019re powerless,\u201d Janet Dorrell said.\n\nDetails of the simulation are kept under wraps to help foster a feeling of helplessness from participants, that same sense of helplessness often felt by the poor. Information, Janet Dorrell said, gives people the power to change circumstances.\n\nThat information is rarely available for those struggling.\n\nParticipants had to choose between purchasing supplies, clothes, food, or sleeping inside. They spent part of Saturday afternoon trying to find a way to purchase another meal. The group also worked with area children, shared stories of God\u2019s love and prayed together.\n\nJanet Dorrell, left, has a laugh as Mission Waco\u2019s poverty simulation group forms a house, including a reclining chair, during one of the life learning exercises Saturday morning.

A count is required in odd-numbered years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which awards many of the grants the city and local agencies use to provide services to the homeless.\n\nJanuary\u2019s numbers peaked slightly, largely because the groups did a much better job of locating individuals on the street and from knowing where many stay. This year\u2019s number also included children.\n\nThere were 255 people living on the streets of Waco in January, 40 of which were chronic homeless. That compares to 246 in 2014, including 32 chronic homeless individuals, said Teri Holtkamp, homelessness administrator for the city of Waco. But those numbers are under-reported as the count only reflects a single day and is self-reported, she said.\n\nThose experiencing chronic homelessness cost the public $30,000 to $50,000 per person, per year, through repeated use of emergency rooms, hospitals, jails, psychiatric centers, detox and other crisis services, according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. The federal definition of chronic homelessness means a person who spent more than a year on the streets or has at least four episodes of homelessness during a three-year period.\n\nPoverty simulation participants soon realized they could only keep four items out of everything they brought for the weekend. The rest of their belongings would be stored away out of reach.\n\n\u201cIs my nose ring an item?\u201d one participant asked, before disappointment crept onto her face when she learned it was.\n\nWhat was a quiet room where the group listened to instructions turned quickly into loud whispers of frustration when they learned if they kept their shoes, it counted for two out of the four items.\n\n$40 for the weekend\n\nEach participant transformed into a single parent of three living below the poverty line. Each participant only had $40 to work with for the weekend. But several participants were given no items and no money, to represent the one out of every seven people who are homeless.\n\nBaylor University junior Keenan Gibson, 20, got lucky. One of the participants donated an item to him, because he was representing the homeless, and he got to keep his sleeping bag.\n\nParticipants struggled digging through belongings as they debated whether to keep a toothbrush and toothpaste \u2014 two items \u2014 or a sleeping bag, pillow, or deodorant.\n\nBaylor University sophomore Sarah Lairmore sacrificed an item to keep her hair tie.\n\nLairmore came to the program with hopes of better understanding people. Lairmore said she expected the hardest part of the experience would be knowing that on Sunday afternoon she\u2019d be able to return to her home, shower, and change into clean clothes while those in poverty never have that option.\n\nLack of permanent supportive housing options in Waco is one of the bigger hindrances to helping those living on the streets, Holtkamp said. Many poor individuals who have lived on the streets have had a brush with law enforcement, and a criminal record can prevent them from accessing housing complexes, she said.\n\nAffordable housing\n\nFederal tax credits for affordable housing built the Red Oak Apartments on Loop 340 and helped fund renovations for the old Waco High School building downtown, transforming it into affordable lofts. Tax credit monies also built Costa Esmeralda, a 112-unit apartment complex on Gurley Lane, and Barron\u2019s Branch, which is being built to replace the blighted Parkside Village apartments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a waiting list,\u201d Holtkamp said.\n\nHoltkamp, who has worked for the city for 11 years, tries to unite area agencies, sharing resources and information to help individuals.\n\nWhile the poor will always be among us, she said, that doesn\u2019t give anyone the excuse not to try and help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only as good as the neediest amongst us,\u201d she said.\n\nMission Waco\u2019s poverty simulation group selects from donated clothes to wear over the weekend, ditching the apparel they arrived in. Staff photo\u2014 Rod Aydelotte\n\nLate Friday night, the poverty simulation group headed to Mission Waco\u2019s resale shop, Clothesline, to purchase a shirt, pants and shoes to wear the rest of the weekend.\n\nJanet Dorrell said the clothes people wear give them an identity. Stripping participants of that comfort allows them to better understand what others face. Many entered the room sporting name-brand attire or clothing representing one type of Baylor University organization or another.\n\nRobert Collins, 13, of Temple, came out of the resale shop in shorts three times his size, wrapped tightly with the drawstring. Collins said he got off lucky because he\u2019s so small he had more options.\n\nOutside the resale shop complaints about shoes fitting too tight or having chosen clothes that would be too hot for the next day\u2019s adventures surfaced.\n\nThe group learned it would cost half of their three-day funding to sleep inside one night, with running water, air conditioning and on a soft bed.\n\nNot a single person chose to do that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really actually walking in the shoes of someone struggling and suffering on a daily basis,\u201d Janet Dorrell said. \u201cA middle class person won\u2019t get it because they don\u2019t have to chose between two important things. A lot of times people in middle class or above blame the poor, say \u2018They\u2019re stupid.\u2019 The whole goal of poverty simulation is to create this setting of compassion.\u201d\n\nMission Waco\u2019s poverty simulation group participants wake up from their Friday night sleepover. The group had the option of buying their way to sleep inside the training center or use their money else where. All elected to stay outside in the heat. Staff photo\u2014 Rod Aydelotte\n\nAmee Ihlenfeld, 20, chose buying a breakfast ticket for her and her three imaginary children over sleeping inside when it looked to be such a nice night.\n\n\u201cI think breakfast is the most important meal of the day,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to start my imaginary kids out right for the day.\u201d\n\nBaylor University senior Crockett Oaks, 21, said he could do without a sleeping bag, but food was important.\n\nOaks, who has lived in Oklahoma City, Houston, Amsterdam and Nigeria, said he has seen various types and levels of poverty in his life. What he doesn\u2019t understand is the \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\nWhy is there poverty in Waco? Why can\u2019t it be fixed? Why is this still happening?\n\nOaks said poverty can\u2019t be solved by throwing money at a situation because money only goes so far. He said he thinks supportive work placement would go a long way in helping those that are struggling.\n\nShannon McDermitt, program supervisor for Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homlessness with Heart of Texas Mental Health Mental Retardation, said working with the program has opened her eyes to problems she has never faced that many homeless struggle with regularly.\n\nMcDermitt is one of four employees of the PATH program, which provides intensive, personalized outreach to those living on the streets. McDermitt said the team works to help the homeless and those living in emergency shelters, unstably housed or doubled up in a home with another family, while mainly targeting individuals needing adult mental health services.\n\nMcDermitt said awareness of community programs exists, but access is difficult. Required paperwork to access resources \u2014 including a birth certificate, past pay stubs, identification \u2014 is a near impossibility for someone whose possessions fit entirely in a backpack. Once people are denied services because of the lack of paperwork, they are often discouraged from trying again, she said.\n\n\u201cThe door\u2019s just been shut in their face too many times,\u201d McDermitt said.\n\nHelp through process\n\nSo the PATH team walks people through the process. She said they will act as advocates and help locate necessary documents. Most of the time the first step is gaining their trust. The employees spend weeks working with one person.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go with them. We\u2019ll walk them through the process,\u201d McDermitt said. \u201cVisiting them at a camp site or library and just getting to know them and being there consistently and let them know we\u2019re not going to disappoint them.\u201d\n\nThose with mental health disorders face added barriers. Someone with schizophrenia may be guarded and paranoid because of symptoms.\n\n\u201cHaving them go to a crowded waiting room at a food stamp office, that can be very scary for the client,\u201d McDermitt said.\n\nMcDermitt said one of the bigger misconceptions she has seen regarding the homeless is that people are living on the streets as the result of substance abuse.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of stories of hard times . . . illness, medical bills piling up, they lost their job and it just kind of snowballs,\u201d McDermitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always just substance abuse or poor choices. It\u2019s circumstances that happen beyond our control and they didn\u2019t have enough support in place to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nWaco\u2019s poverty rate is about 30 percent. Every time children have to move homes they lose three to six months of education. The average poor individual moves three times a year, Holtkamp said.\n\nA Department of Education study released this week reports that homelessness among students rose for the sixth year in a row. Nationwide, more than 1.36 million students during the 2013-14 school year were identified as homeless, an 8.2 percent increase from the previous school year, and a 45-percent increase from the 2007-08 school year.\n\nThe National Alliance to End Homelessness attributes much of the increase to the number of students living doubled-up or in hotels. Of the 1.36 million homeless students, more than a third were in third grade or below.\n\nWith all her knowledge and years of experience working to find solutions to homelessness, Holtkamp said when she attended the poverty simulation it was a life-changing event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe beauty of it is at the end of the second or third day you get to go home. Other people don\u2019t. It will change your life. It really will.\u201d\n\nJericho Ybara, 15, came to the poverty simulation event with his Dallas youth group.\n\nA breakfast of chips was a disappointing way to start the day, he said. Ybara said when he purchased his meal ticket he really thought there would be waffles, adding he thought his money would go further.\n\nJanet Dorrell said what many people don\u2019t realize is the community is set up to allow the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.\n\nThe nearest grocery store from where the group was staying was 2.5 miles away. But there were several closer convenience stores, charging two or three times the rate for items compared to a grocery store like H-E-B.\n\n\u2018Change the world\u2019\n\nThe poor are often powerless to get better resources, she said. The community has to be an advocate for them, she said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not on the side of the poor, we\u2019re not on God\u2019s side. We\u2019re going to change the world,\u201d Dorrell said.\n\nFor most people who find themselves without a roof over their head, it was a series of unfortunate events that led up to that moment, said Jennifer Caballero, director of social services for the Salvation Army in Waco.\n\n\u201cOur clients take drastic measures sometimes to make sure no one knows they are in a shelter situation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen they get to a point where they are coming in to one of our emergency shelters, they\u2019ve kind of hit a low in their lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat I find most often is it is the isolation and the lack of relationships. They\u2019ve gotten to the point where they don\u2019t have those connections. They don\u2019t have the mom or the brother, or sister, or friend who could let them sleep on the couch. For lots of different reasons they lost those personal connections. That can be a pretty low point for someone.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nIf you go\n\nOther Poverty Simulation events this year are being held Oct. 9-11 and Nov. 20-22.\n\nThe events start at 8 p.m. Fridays and end at 3 p.m. Sundays.\n\nFor more information, go to missionwaco.org/poverty-simulation", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "WacoTrib.com", "description": "Baylor University junior Taylor Avie spent her first night ever sleeping outside this weekend as she worked to open her heart to the reality faced by the homeless in Waco every day.", "title": "Simulation teaches group to experience Waco homelessness first hand", "url": "http://www.wacotrib.com/news/nonprofits/simulation-teaches-group-to-experience-waco-homelessness-first-hand/article_f294e0c7-ce66-5eef-b08f-07362f67cd39.html", "image": {"width": 853, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/ca/2cac2c77-b2ae-504e-9079-6b11166aaa36/55fe09f39f8cd.image.jpg?resize=853%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wacotrib", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Baylor University junior Taylor Avie spent her first night ever sleeping outside this weekend as she worked to open her heart to the reality faced by the homeless in Waco every day.", "fb": {"admins": 100003972382224, "app_id": 109882439169884}, "google-site-verification": "50pYtHR6CCFTzZ71kPh9VblWnhVFzTMInJ8Z9e0QKbw", "keywords": "nonprofits", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wacotrib"}, "news_keywords": "nonprofits"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8c9\"", "article_summary": "Mission Waco\u2019s poverty simulation group selects from donated clothes to wear over the weekend, ditching the apparel they arrived in.\nPoverty simulation participants soon realized they could only keep four items out of everything they brought for the weekend.\nThat can be a pretty low point for someone.\u201d-----If you goOther Poverty Simulation events this year are being held Oct. 9-11 and Nov. 20-22.\nJanet Dorrell, left, has a laugh as Mission Waco\u2019s poverty simulation group forms a house, including a reclining chair, during one of the life learning exercises Saturday morning.\nStaff photo\u2014 Rod AydelotteLate Friday night, the poverty simulation group headed to Mission Waco\u2019s resale shop, Clothesline, to purchase a shirt, pants and shoes to wear the rest of the weekend."}
