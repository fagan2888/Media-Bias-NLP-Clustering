Jan. 29, 2016 -- Although terrorism and the economy have topped Americans’ list of concerns in recent polls, health care is still on voters’ minds.

WebMD looked at where presidential hopefuls from both parties stand on various health care issues, including the health care reform law (called the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare"), Medicare and Medicaid, the price of prescription drugs, and abortion. Candidates included are those who have finished in the top 5 of any of the early primaries and are still in the race.

Here’s what they said off and on the podium on these topics. If the candidate has not spoken about a topic or offered information on his or her web site, it will say “No information available.”
