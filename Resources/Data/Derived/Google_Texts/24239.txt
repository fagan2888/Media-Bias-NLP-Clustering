Sixty percent of the Uber rides that were taken on New Year's Eve had no extra surge pricing in effect, according to statistics released by the company.

Twitter users complained about the company charging more for holiday rides in many U.S. cities as revelers were looking for ways to avoid drunk driving incidents.

Uber said 60 percent of the trips that were taken in the U.S. on Dec. 31 were at "normal prices, with no surge increase."

The company added that "84 percent of trips taken in the U.S. came in at less than three times surge."

Uber said 150,000 people were in the middle of trips at midnight in their respective cities. The ride-hailing company said demand for its service increased by 250 percent between 12:01 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 1.
