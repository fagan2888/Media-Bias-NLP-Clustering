Kirch, MD, AAMC president and CEO, said in a press release.\n\nDarrell G. Kirch\n\nIn collaboration with IHS \u2014 a publicly traded company that provides comprehensive economic modeling and forecasting services \u2014 the AAMC published a report on the projected future supply and demand of physicians in the United States. The report pinpoints key trends that are likely to affect heath care services and physician demands, such as retirement, mortality patterns, specialty mix and demographics of new physicians, current numbers and work patterns in patient care hours. Individual specialties were categorized as primary care, medical specialties, surgical specialties and \u201cother\u201d specialties.\n\nPhysician demand has a projected growth of between 11% and 17%, while physician supply is projected at 9% growth. These trends will lead to a shortage of 46,100 to 90,400 physicians by 2025. Specifically, shortages are projected to be between 12,500 and 31,100 for PCPs and between 28,200 and 63,700 for nonprimary care physicians. These shortfalls are expected despite anticipated increases in advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and physician assistants (PAs). The projected physician shortage could be in the lower range and hinge on the growth supply of APRNs and PAs.\n\nResearchers said the Affordable Care Act, which expanded coverage to nearly 26 million previous uninsured people, is likely to be the cause of a projected 2% increase in physician demand. This projects a demand increase of 3.2% in surgical specialties, 2% in primary care, 1.7% in medical specialties and 1.5% in all \u201cother\u201d specialties.\n\n\u201cThe trends from these data are clear \u2014 the physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario,\u201d Kirch said in the release. \u201cBecause training a doctor takes between 5 and 10 years, we must act now, in 2015, if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe solution requires a multipronged approach: Continuing to innovate and be more efficient in the way care is delivered, as well as increased federal support for graduate medical education to train at least 3,000 more doctors a year to meet the heath care needs of our nation\u2019s growing and aging population.\u201d \u2013 by Casey Hower\n\nReference:\n\nIHS/Association of American Medical Colleges.
