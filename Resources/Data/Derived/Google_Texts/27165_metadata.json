Specifically, those critics said Clinton didn't smile enough and yelled too much.\n\nSo we put together a mashup of Clinton smiling and not yelling. She actually smiled and didn't smile, yelled and didn't yell \u2014 just as most presidential candidates have done \u2014 during her 16-minute speech.\n\nThis video includes clips from C-SPAN, images from Getty Images and music from Frenic / CC BY 3.0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics said Clinton didn't smile enough when she gave her victory speech after her \"Mega Tuesday\" wins.
