Just around in the past couple years Altoona, Conemaugh (Johnstown), DuBois, Clearfield, St. Marys, Brookville, Nason (Roaring Spring), Tyrone (pending) and Jameson (New Castle \u2014 pending) have all merged.\n\nIndiana, Clarion and Punxsutawney believe they can maintain local ownership by working together in a more integrated fashion to improve quality across the region, grow and enhance services by recruiting physicians and services, and become more efficient to better serve the communities represented.\n\nThe goal of PMCN is to provide the highest quality and service, in the closest location at the lowest cost.\n\nAs patients and families are asked to continue to pay more for their care, PMCN and IRMC strive to be there for you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last summer Indiana, Clarion and Punxsutawney hospitals signed an agreement to create a new entity called Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network.", "og": {"url": "https://www.indianagazette.com/news/indiana-news/seeds-of-wellness-hospitals-create-pennsylvania-mountain-care-network,22456946/", "image": "https://cityportals-indianagazette-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/news/images_preview/22456946.jpg", "description": "Last summer Indiana, Clarion and Punxsutawney hospitals signed an agreement to create a new entity called Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network.", "title": "Seeds of Wellness: Hospitals create Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network -  - July 28, 2015"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.indianagazette.com/news/indiana-news/seeds-of-wellness-hospitals-create-pennsylvania-mountain-care-network,22456946/", "image": {"width": 657, "identifier": "https://cityportals-indianagazette-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/news/images_preview/22456946.jpg", "height": 900}, "description": "Last summer Indiana, Clarion and Punxsutawney hospitals signed an agreement to create a new entity called Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network.", "card": "summary", "title": "Seeds of Wellness: Hospitals create Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network"}, "resource-type": "document", "p": {"domain_verify": "3ca97edaeb86fb7bb30ac456fded8ee3"}, "fb": {"app_id": 129670787203115}, "distribution": "global"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1234\"", "article_summary": "Last summer Indiana, Clarion and Punxsutawney hospitals signed an agreement to create a new entity called Pennsylvania Mountain Care Network.\nObamacare\u2019s impact has been dramatically felt across the region, state and nation, creating financial hardships on patients, families, hospitals and insurance companies.\nAs patients and families are asked to continue to pay more for their care, PMCN and IRMC strive to be there for you.\nThe goal of PMCN is to provide the highest quality and service, in the closest location at the lowest cost.\nLocal leaders whose families live and receive care in our community view decisions on these services much differently than leaders in another city or out-of-state headquarters for a for-profit."}
