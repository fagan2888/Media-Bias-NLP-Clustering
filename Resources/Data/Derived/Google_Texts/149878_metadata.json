Courts, politicians and corporations are all working together to chip away at deferred wages: reducing pensions or eliminating promised healthcare, or both. Said simply, they\u2019re looting retirements and pushing people toward poverty.\n\nThis is the course unfolding in federal bankruptcy court for the city of Detroit. It is what the Illinois Legislature passed last week in a giant pension reform bill that excluded the city of Chicago, whose red ink reckoning comes next year. It\u2019s what\u2019s before California cities that have filed for bankruptcy, or are seeking voter approval to cut into retirement benefits, such as Stockton, San Bernadino, Riverside and even wealthy San Jose.\n\nIn these and other government jurisdictions, the foremost question is not why legions of elected officials have failed to provide for the employees who did their jobs and made the cities function. Instead, the question seems to be how much they can plunder earned and pledged benefits, so they can avoid raising taxes or cutting services.\n\n\u201cNews leaking out this week from the Motor City tells how the enormous gap between pensions workers earned and the money set aside to pay for them will be closed,\u201d wrote David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. \u201cBy stealing from workers.\u201d\n\nThe plundering of private sector pensions by corporate executives is nothing new. Books and columns by Johnston and other Pulitzer Prize winners have detailed how most S&P 500 companies have diverted mountains of cash from employee pensions to make their quarterly earnings look bigger, boost stock prices and fatten their annual bonuses \u2014 all unconscionable and corrupt acts that were perfectly legal, says Johnston, thanks to a Congress that rewrote the legal fine print at the behest of corporate lobbyists.\n\nBut the newest development in America\u2019s unfolding retirement security crisis concerns public employees \u2013people who worked in schools, public safety departments, etc. and often are exempt from Social Security because they have other public retirement plans. For years, if not decades, top fiscal managers in a mix of cities, counties and states didn\u2019t put away what\u2019s now hundreds of billions of dollars for civil service workers. Now, the same class of public sector executives is taking steps to cut these retirement packages. The question is not whether the cuts are coming, but how will they unfold.\n\nTake Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Beyond the exceptionally nasty politics surrounding the largest municipal bankruptcy in America, what was pivotal last week was a ruling by the federal bankruptcy judge that classified the promised retirement benefits as \u201cunsecured\u201d debt. That\u2019s a subordinate class to \u201csecured\u201d debt holders, such as investors who bought bonds, and it means that the Court can order reduction in retiree benefits. The fact that Michigan\u2019s state Constitution forbids this kind of breach of contract did not apply, the bankruptcy judge said, because a federal proceeding trumps state law. Without getting lost in the legal details, the big question is how big a hit will Detroit\u2019s retirees take. A pension in the city averages $19,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThis decision sets a terrible precedent,\u201d said Karen Friedman, executive vice president and policy director for the Pension Rights Center. \u201cAllowing a city to cut its retirees\u2019 pensions is a signal to other cities across the country that they don\u2019t need to fund their pensions responsibly and that they can renege on these promises when they run into trouble\u2026 These are not big pensions.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s up next for Detroit is that the city\u2019s emergency financial manager \u2014 appointed by the state\u2019s Republican governor \u2014 will come back to court with a schedule of proposed benefit cuts and other renegotiated contracts. That\u2019s exactly the stage the California city of Stockton is at in its bankruptcy. It proposes to maintain its pensions but end retiree health benefits, raise the city\u2019s sales tax and pay some bondholders 50 cents per owed dollar. In another California city, San Bernardino, the process is further along, with the city already filing its plan to shortchange creditors and some of them \u2014 notably the California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS \u2014 objecting in court.\n\nOutside bankruptcy court, a slightly different dance is occurring. Last week, the state of Illinois passed a pension reform bill that cuts back pensions by reducing cost-of-living adjustments over three decades, compared to the previous inflation formula. Chicago, which has less than half of what\u2019s needed for its pensions and almost $900 million in unfunded retiree healthcare on top of that, hopes to present its plan early next year.\n\nIn almost all of these cases, the priority was cutting benefits \u2014 either in pensions, health plans or both \u2014 as opposed to making up the shortfall elsewhere. There also is a parallel push to shut down access to pensions, which is a deferred salary, by offering the newest employees only the option of opening a retirement savings account, as well as paying a larger share of their salary for healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe assault on retirees today is greater now than at any other time,\u201d said the Pension Rights Center\u2019s Friedman. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it in Detroit. We\u2019re seeing it in states that are trying to get rid of good pension plans. We\u2019re seeing it in major corporations that are transferring pensions to insurance companies. We\u2019re seeing it in Congress, where members are being heavily lobbied to introduce legislation that would allow multi-employer plans to cut retire pensions [a technicality that lowers the employer share]. And there are the ongoing efforts to cut back on Social Security.\u201d\n\nWhat is taking shape is a nationwide retirement security crisis. Experts like Johnston and Friedman are saying that for the first time in decades, tens of millions of elderly people will slide into poverty as they will be left with little more than Social Security to live on \u2014 which now averages $1,230 a month, and that\u2019s before paying taxes on it, or Medicare fees.\n\nThe reason this is happening in the private sector, as Ellen Schultz noted in her book Retirement Heist, is that executives want to boost stock prices and cash out. In the public sector, it\u2019s because government managers and legislators used retirement funds for all kinds of services instead of raising taxes. While powerful interests are working to steal other people\u2019s money, average Americans are increasingly finding themselves on shaky ground.\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen in a lot of these cases is that people end up selling their homes,\u201d Schultz told Forbes, when asked what happens to people whose pensions are cut. \u201cReally the only safety blanket that you have is Social Security, which also is under assault. The same retirement industry that dismantled pensions would love to dismantle that program and have a crack at the assets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Across America, local governments are taking steps that will make retirement for ex-public employees much harsher.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Across America, local governments are taking steps that will make retirement for ex-public employees much harsher.", "title": "America\u2019s Retirement Crisis Grows as Cities Raid Pension and Health Plans | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AP090812064526_crop.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2013/12/12/america%e2%80%99s-retirement-crisis-grows-as-cities-raid-pension-and-health-plans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Across America, local governments are taking steps that will make retirement for ex-public employees much harsher.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AP090812064526_crop.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s Retirement Crisis Grows as Cities Raid Pension and Health Plans | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2013-12-12T18:33:29-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20131212, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But the newest development in America\u2019s unfolding retirement security crisis concerns public employees \u2013people who worked in schools, public safety departments, etc.\nAnd there are the ongoing efforts to cut back on Social Security.\u201dWhat is taking shape is a nationwide retirement security crisis.\nand often are exempt from Social Security because they have other public retirement plans.\nAcross America, states, counties and cities are taking steps that will make retirement for ex-public employees much harsher.\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s before California cities that have filed for bankruptcy, or are seeking voter approval to cut into retirement benefits, such as Stockton, San Bernadino, Riverside and even wealthy San Jose."}
