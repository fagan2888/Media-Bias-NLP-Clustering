We Northerners have such a hard time figuring you out.\n\nWe know you\u2019re proud of your machismo and your independent spirit. We know you\u2019ve brought back, \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole other country\u201d as your official tourism slogan, and that some of your residents wish it were a separate country.\n\nIn healthcare, you had the highest uninsured rate in the country in 2011-12, and the gap has likely widened because you refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, mostly because you don\u2019t like President Obama. And just when someone comes along with an idea to increase access to care via technology \u2014 you know, private-sector innovation \u2014 you bring down the heavy hand of the, ahem, small government you seem to hold so dear.\n\nYes, while we were buried preparing for and covering HIMSS the last week and a half, the Texas Medical Board slapped tough new restrictions on the practice of telemedicine in the Lone Star State, then tried to spin it as \u201cexpanding telemedicine opportunities.\u201d The Texas Medical Association, representing the status quo, cheered.\n\nThe decision bans physicians from making diagnoses or prescribing drugs via telephone or the Internet for any patient they do not have a previously existing, in-person relationship with. Despite what the Texas Medical Board said, the telehealth industry is up in arms.\n\nThe Dallas Business Journal interviewed Dallas-based Teladoc, which said the move would \u201ctake away Texans\u2019 access to a safe, affordable and convenient health care option.\u201d Teladoc serves 2.4 million people in its home state.\n\nEven the right-leaning (OK, more libertarian) Heartland Institute took issue. \u201cWhile medical boards across the U.S. are loosening rules governing the practice of medicine over the Internet, and over the phone, The Texas Medical Board is, instead, shielding local physicians from outside competition,\u201d Heartland\u2019s Gene Koprowski wrote.\n\nThere\u2019s already talk of lawsuits challenging the new rule, which is set to take effect in June. No matter how much Texans may want to, you can\u2019t fight back against a judge. You know, that whole law-and-order thing.
