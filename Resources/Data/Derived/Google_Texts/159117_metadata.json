They\u2019re offering yoga and cooking classes, sponsoring farmers markets and writing prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nOne hospital in Connecticut opened a primary care clinic in a Stop & Shop supermarket, and another in Michigan opened a demonstration kitchen. In California and Virginia, hospitals have partnered with schools to teach children about nutrition and exercise.\n\nSuch programs attract new patients and build loyalty, but many nonprofit hospitals are also driven by a federal mandate to improve health outcomes in the communities they serve. In addition, some hospitals are working under new payment models as a result of the Affordable Care Act in which they are compensated and held accountable for results more than ever before. That has led to more integration with primary care clinics, as well as more projects and campaigns to help reduce chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nNearly 37 percent of Americans were obese between 2011 and 2014, according to a recent report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nEven in Orange County, where obesity levels are lower, Cecchini said patients don\u2019t always know what foods cause weight gain or raise their blood sugar.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to know a lot more about nutrition, but there are still a lot of misconceptions out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d\n\nGrocery stores are an ideal place to teach people that they can become healthier by making small dietary changes and eating in moderation, said Vanessa Rosales, community affairs manager for Ralphs & Food 4 Less.\n\n\u201cWhat better place to reach the public with that message?\u201d Rosales said.\n\nShe also said that the doctor and dietitian in the Shop With Your Doc program help ease confusion for shoppers as they try to make healthy choices.\n\n\u201cIt can be pretty intimidating to someone who may not know how to read those labels,\u201d Rosales said.\n\nThe shoppers didn\u2019t have to be St. Joseph\u2019s patients to get guidance from physicians as they filled up their shopping carts. Cecchini and a hospital nutritionist stood next to the pharmacy behind a table answering questions. One woman said she wanted to sweeten her tea and coffee and asked about the best substitute for sugar. A man said he was a vegetarian and took medication daily but that his cholesterol was still too high.\n\n\u201cSounds like you are doing everything right,\u201d Cecchini told him. \u201cJust don\u2019t give up the exercise.\u201d\n\nShoppers also received a free bag with measuring cups and a card with tips for navigating the grocery store: Choose foods with more fiber and less sugar. Use fish as a main ingredient instead of meat. Aim for a rainbow of colorful fruits and vegetables.\n\nAs Tamura and Cecchini pushed her cart through the store, she grabbed a few fruits, including apples and pears. Then they stopped in front of the bread aisle. She picked up a loaf of country potato bread and they looked at the label together. Tamura said she didn\u2019t realize that the bread had so much sodium. And that\u2019s before you add salted butter and garlic, he said.\n\nCecchini encouraged her to keep an eye on sodium levels in future shopping trips. But he also assured her that it\u2019s OK to make exceptions.\n\n\u201cYou have to satisfy the mind and heart as well as your stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nTamura has high blood pressure and high cholesterol and knows she needs to watch her diet. Shopping with the doctor was a reminder that one way to do that is by reading labels more carefully.\n\nFor that night, though, Tamura said she was sticking with her plans for spaghetti and garlic bread.\n\n\u201cSounds like you have a nice dinner planned,\u201d Cecchini said, laughing. \u201cWhen do we get to come over?\u201d\n\nAnna Gorman is a writer\n\nwith Kaiser Health News,\n\nan editorially independent program of the Henry J.
