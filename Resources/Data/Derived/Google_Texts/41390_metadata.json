At its July 29 meeting, the utility\u2019s board of trustees voted unanimously to abandon FELPS\u2019 policy with Blue Cross-Blue Shield in favor of a comparable one with Humana.\n\n\n\nGeneral Manager Kyle Dicke said that by accepting the Humana policy, which has a benefit year starting Oct. 1 and ending Sept. 30, 2016, FELPS would get a one-year break from the price increases associated with Obamacare. Signing an extension at the end of the contract term would stretch that grace period for another year, he said.\n\n\n\nConsultant Matt Amerman said that the Humana policy offers almost identical coverage to the current Blue Cross plan. However, FELPS\u2019 monthly contribution for employee-only coverage would drop to $375 per month, per employee. Workers who purchase additional coverage for their spouses would be charged $825 per month, which is down from the $967-per-month Blue Cross premium.\n\n\n\nAlso during the meeting, the board amended a resolution approved July 23, related to the refinance of its 2005 bonds. The change related to striking language that reflected FELPS\u2019 release of $1 million from a reserve fund, Dicke said. The utility had hoped to repurpose that money to fund capital projects. (See \u201cElectric utility gets green light from Floresville to refinance bond,\u201d July 29.)\n\n\n\nJeffrey Kuhn, bond counsel with the Norton Rose Fulbright law firm, said money cannot be moved because the insurers did not want to risk being sued by the bondholders for consenting to weakening the security of the bond.\n\n\n\nIn other business, the board:\n\n\n\n\u0095Approved a contract with Survalent for the purchase of software for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System, at a cost not to exceed $110,000. Additional hardware, which will be installed by FELPS workers, will be purchased at a later date.\n\n\n\n\u0095Learned during a closed session that Dicke has tendered his resignation, effective Sept. 11.
