(Video via World Economic Forum)\n\nAnd the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots says this worry isn't far off. Countries like the U.S., China and Russia are already working on building autonomous weapons. They warn keeping these robots out of the hands of non-state groups will be difficult. (Video via Computerworld)\n\nAlso at Davos, people are talking about domestic robots, the ones that can grade school papers and do your laundry, and most seem pretty thrilled with them. (Video via World Economic Forum)\n\nBut there's an undercurrent of worry: As robots get more advanced, they will begin doing jobs that humans do.\n\nBefore Davos started, the World Economic Forum released a paper that calculated as many as 5 million jobs could be lost to automation by robots or software. But it also says these advancements could create about 2 million new jobs in certain sectors.\n\nThese are issues that are still a few years away, but more and more leaders in the field are taking notice and urging some sort of action.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the World Economic Forum, there's a lot of talk about robots, artificial intelligence and how all of that could shape the future of war and work.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "At the World Economic Forum, there's a lot of talk about robots, artificial intelligence and how all of that could shape the future of war and work.", "title": "At Davos, World Leaders Get Real About Killer Robots", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/at-davos-world-leaders-get-real-about-killer-robots/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1453575767.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the World Economic Forum, there's a lot of talk about robots, artificial intelligence and how all of that could shape the future of war and work.", "title": "At Davos, World Leaders Get Real About Killer Robots", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/at-davos-world-leaders-get-real-about-killer-robots/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1453575767.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=czYjRlMDE66lzqk9qW8rmU4QxtroYPv4&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://56348", "iphone": "newsy://56348", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://56348", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "Robots,Killer Robots,Davos,World Economic Forum,War,Robots as Weapons,Autonomous weapons,Technology,Tech news,Artificial intelligence,Jobs,Robots and Work,Newsy", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1453575767.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "(Video via World Economic Forum)And the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots says this worry isn't far off.\nEthan WestonA large group of the world's leaders in business and politics have been meeting in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum where they've discussed the future of business, technology and the world at large.\n(Video via World Economic Forum)But there's an undercurrent of worry: As robots get more advanced, they will begin doing jobs that humans do.\nAt the World Economic Forum, there's a lot of talk about robots, artificial intelligence and how all of that could shape the future of war and work.\nBefore Davos started, the World Economic Forum released a paper that calculated as many as 5 million jobs could be lost to automation by robots or software."}
