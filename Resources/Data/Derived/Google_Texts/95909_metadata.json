The so-called \u201cresource curse\u201d is more than an academic quandary for development economists \u2014 it is a curse of geopolitical urgency to U.S. interests around the world.\n\nThe good news is that we can do far more than just talk about putting power with those who deserve it \u2014 the citizens of resource-rich countries. We can empower them through transparency. The bad news is that the U.S. is now following, not leading, in that area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis month is the fifth anniversary of our bipartisan law, known as the Cardin-Lugar amendment, or Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, that put the U.S. at the head of the global wave of transparency and government accountability. Regrettably, five years later, the law has yet to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank requires any U.S. or foreign company listed on U.S. stock exchanges to publicly disclose resource extraction payments made to governments on a project basis.\n\nIt is time for the SEC to act. While transparency is not sufficient to bring the governance changes our country seeks, it is necessary for citizens to hold their governments accountable.\n\nThere are 3.2 billion people living in developing countries, and 663 million of them live in absolute poverty. Yet according to Oxfam America, in the past five years, the oil produced in these countries was worth $1.55 trillion for their governments. To give a sense of the scale, this revenue is enough to close the funding gap for healthcare and education in the world\u2019s 42 poorest countries \u2014 five times over. This figure is almost 10 times the amount of U.S. foreign aid distributed over the same period. Transparency is critical to leveraging those aid dollars, as well as our diplomatic and security efforts.\n\nStopping the illicit flow of natural resource revenue is a national security and economic priority for the United States. It helps to create more stable economies and shrink the breeding ground for terrorism and conflict. It benefits American business by fostering more stable, less risky operating environments, and in turn provides more energy security for American citizens. It also helps U.S. investors by giving them valuable and detailed information about their holdings to evaluate and reduce their risks.\n\nPassage of the Cardin-Lugar amendment demonstrated America\u2019s determination to turn the tide in favor of transparent governance for all. Congressional action spurred the European Union, Canada and Norway to follow suit, creating a global standard that encompasses companies from Gazprom to Sinopec. But now the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the U.S. to take the lead on transparency again; it is time for the SEC to complete the final rule.\n\nCardin is Maryland\u2019s junior senator, serving since 2007.
