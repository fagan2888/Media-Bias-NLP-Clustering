But Democrats' losses during President Obama's time in office have been especially large. Among presidents elected to two terms in the past 50 years, no other saw as much erosion of his party in the House through his second midterm election, and only one, Bill Clinton, suffered as many setbacks in the Senate.\n\nThe Bush comparison matters enormously. Remember that Obama was elected in large part on his promise to restore basic competence to governing in the wake of Bush's missteps on issues from Iraq to Hurricane Katrina. (This was the president who made \"Heckuva job, Brownie\" a slogan for federal ineptitude.)\n\nEvery early move Obama made \u2014 from his campaign promise of \"change\" to the \"team of rivals\" idea for his Cabinet \u2014 was driven by the notion that this president, unlike the man he replaced, was all about turning the government into a pure meritocracy that would run things right.\n\nBut that idea began to unravel with a rapid-fire series of scandals: the revelation that the IRS was targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny, the Edward Snowden leaks about NSA surveillance and the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, to name three that happened in 2013.\n\nThat unraveling sped up over the past 12 months \u2014 fueled, interestingly enough, by foreign policy stumbles by the president and his team.\n\nObama's longtime pledge to \"reset\" relations with Russia was exposed as frighteningly naive when President Vladimir Putin moved into eastern Ukraine with impunity. Obama's response to Putin's aggression \u2014 sanctions \u2014 was derided as using a spray bottle to put out a five-alarm fire.\n\nThen there was Iraq, the \"dumb war\" that Obama was elected in no small measure to end. He seemed to do that once, removing the last combat troops from the country in 2011. But then came the rise of the Islamic State, the militant group that now controls much of Iraq and Syria, made particularly infamous by its heinous tactic of beheading captives.\n\nBy June, Obama had approved the deployment of almost 300 new U.S. troops to Iraq. In early September, after the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, Obama approved sending more troops to the region. In November, he authorized the deployment of 1,500 additional troops, bringing the total to roughly 3,000. The cost for this redeployment in Iraq? About $5.6 billion.\n\nAs if that weren't enough past-haunting-the-present for Obama, two memoirs released this year by former Cabinet officials cast him as something short of a decisive commander in chief.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton struck first, not only deriding Obama's \"don't do stupid s---\" foreign policy vision as less than visionary, but also blasting her onetime boss for not intervening earlier in the Syrian civil war and thereby potentially reducing the Islamic State threat. Yet even that critique was nothing compared with what former CIA chief and defense secretary Leon Panetta leveled at Obama in his memoir \"Worthy Fights.\" Panetta said the president had \"lost his way\" in matters ranging from the fight against the Islamic State to the budgetary process. He condemned Obama's \"frustrating reticence to engage his opponents and rally support for his cause\" and said the president too often \"relies on the logic of a law professor rather than the passion of a leader.\" (Former defense secretary Robert Gates's memoir was also tough \u2014 but it went after Vice President Biden more than Obama.)\n\nThen there was the matter of the midterm elections. Republicans badly wanted to nationalize the campaign around the unpopular Obama, even as Democrats, trying desperately to hold their Senate majority, were doing everything they could to make voters forget about the guy sitting in the White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama had the Worst Year in Washington ... again", "generator": "Piklist 0.9.9.7c", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Who had the Worst Year in Washington?", "title": "President Barack Obama had the Worst Year in Washington ... again", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/opinions/2014/12/12/president-barack-obama-had-the-worst-year-in-washington-again/", "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/opinions/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2014/12/worstyear-2014-facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "worst year, worst week, worst week chris cillizza, worst year 2014, worst year chris cillizza, worst year president obama, worst year in washington 2014, best year 2014, really bad year 2014, bad year 2014, bad year secret service, really bad year dan snyder, not-so-good year chris christie, good year elizabeth warren, best year mitch mcconnell, mitch mcconnell, senator mitch mcconnell, senate, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, chris christie, governor chris christie, new jersey governor chris christie, senator elizabeth warren, dan snyder, redskins owner dan snyder, president obama, president barack obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "worst year, worst week, worst week chris cillizza, worst year 2014, worst year chris cillizza, worst year president obama, worst year in washington 2014, best year 2014, really bad year 2014, bad year 2014, bad year secret service, really bad year dan snyder, not-so-good year chris christie, good year elizabeth warren, best year mitch mcconnell, mitch mcconnell, senator mitch mcconnell, senate, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, chris christie, governor chris christie, new jersey governor chris christie, senator elizabeth warren, dan snyder, redskins owner dan snyder, president obama, president barack obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd731b\"", "article_summary": "But Democrats' losses during President Obama's time in office have been especially large.\n(Former defense secretary Robert Gates's memoir was also tough \u2014 but it went after Vice President Biden more than Obama.)\nPanetta said the president had \"lost his way\" in matters ranging from the fight against the Islamic State to the budgetary process.\nThen there was Iraq, the \"dumb war\" that Obama was elected in no small measure to end.\nIn early September, after the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, Obama approved sending more troops to the region."}
