Schmirn, CC BY 2.0\n\nThe online world\u2019s constant flux of information often results in a mental \u201coverload\u201d that can come to the detriment of short-term memory retention, researchers from the Royal Institute of Technology (RIT) in Stockholm, Sweden suggest. Eventually, this loss of brain inactivity may impair the cerebral processes whereby short-term memories are transposed into long-term memories.\n\nPrevious research in neuroscience indicates that our short-term memory, also known as \u201cworking memory,\u201d can entertain up to four disparate stimuli simultaneously. Once this limit is exceeded, the efficiency and quality of mental work begins to decline.\n\n\u201cWorking memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication,\u201d study author Erik Frans\u00e9n told reporters. \u201cIt enables us to work online and store what we find online, but it\u2019s also a limited resource.\u201d\n\nHowever, even the most minimalist web designs and layouts tend to feature stimuli far in excess of our working memory\u2019s boundaries. Facebook, YouTube, and other social media sites cram advertisement and content into a single \u201cinformation field\u201d that must be interpreted and navigated by the user. As we dismantle the onslaught of information into discrete pieces of data, it becomes exceedingly difficult to assign hierarchy and significance.\n\n\u201cWhen you are on Facebook, you are making it harder to keep the things that are \u2018online\u2019 in your brain that you need,\u201d Frans\u00e9n explained. \u201cIn fact, when you try to process sensory information like speech or video, you are going to need partly the same system of working memory, so you are reducing your own working memory capacity.\n\n\u201cAnd when you try to store many things in your working memory, you get less good at processing information,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, overloading your working memory may result in a loss of crucial inactivity. Contrary to folkloric wisdom, our brains are designed to toggle between idleness and action, as relaxation facilitates cerebral \u201chousekeeping.\u201d For example, scientists believe that periods of rest are necessary to promote communications between short-term and long-term memory.\n\n\"When we max out our active states with technology equipment, just because we can, we remove from the brain part of the processing, and it can\u2019t work,\u201d Frans\u00e9n said.\n\nSometimes, an idle brain is our own workshop.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "short term memory, internet, social media, attention span, erik fransen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Internet and social media inhibit memory functions by overloading our short-term, \"working\" memory, a new study suggests.", "title": "Information Overload: How The Internet Inhibits Short-Term Memory", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/information-overload-how-internet-inhibits-short-term-memory-257580", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/memory.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Internet and social media inhibit memory functions by overloading our short-term, \"working\" memory, a new study suggests.", "title": "Information Overload: How The Internet Inhibits Short-Term Memory", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/information-overload-how-internet-inhibits-short-term-memory-257580", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/memory.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/memory.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-09-22T17:47:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T17:47:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Internet and social media inhibit memory functions by overloading our short-term, \"working\" memory, a new study suggests."}, "article_summary": "Previous research in neuroscience indicates that our short-term memory, also known as \u201cworking memory,\u201d can entertain up to four disparate stimuli simultaneously.\n\"When you try to store many things in your working memory, you get less good at processing information,\u201d the researchers explained.\n\u201cAnd when you try to store many things in your working memory, you get less good at processing information,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWorking memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication,\u201d study author Erik Frans\u00e9n told reporters.\nIn addition, overloading your working memory may result in a loss of crucial inactivity."}
