Each panelist brought a different perspective to the conversation, but an important point of agreement was clear: Nurses are key to meeting America\u2019s growing health care needs.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly diverse, experienced and committed set of leaders that have a lot of important things to do,\u201d said Mark McClellan, senior fellow and director of the Health Care Innovation and Value Initiative at the Brookings Institution, in his keynote speech. \u201cThey are the ones who are shaping our health care system, and to have all of them coming together here for this event tells you just how important the future of nursing is for the future of our health care system.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because nurses are critical to increasing access to health care, delivering care better, and reducing costs for both consumers and businesses that help pay for their employee health care, McClellan said. For example, nurses play a key role in helping to manage the transition of patients from hospitals to home, helping to prevent readmissions and getting better outcomes at less cost. Thousands of nurse practitioners nationwide staff a growing number of retail clinics, which give consumers increased access to primary care at a lower cost than most doctors\u2019 offices. And each day nurses are at the front lines using new technologies that are helping to provide consumers with more convenient, personalized and customized health care.\n\nThe idea of tapping nurses to meet America\u2019s health care demands is not new. In fact, it was four years ago this month that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its groundbreaking report on the future of nursing. The report called for the transformation of the nursing profession in order to meet our nation\u2019s need for patient-centered, high-quality, affordable health care, and it laid out a blueprint for how health care could be successfully transformed by leveraging the skill and power of nurses.\n\nWhile the IOM releases many reports each year, this one triggered a groundswell across the nation, and its impact continues to be felt. To ensure that the recommendations didn\u2019t just sit on a shelf, AARP, the nation\u2019s largest consumer organization, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation\u2019s largest health care philanthropy, together launched the Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action, a national campaign to transform health and health care through nursing.\n\nOver the past four years, I\u2019ve watched with pride as the campaign and its 51-state Action Coalitions have grown from the seed of an idea into a robust, flourishing nationwide network for change. I\u2019m proud of the many successes we\u2019ve achieved and the progress that\u2019s been made. But I also believe that right now this work is at a critical juncture, a point that was echoed by the panelists at our event on Sept. 17.\n\nWe need to move the national conversation about the value of nurses beyond health care experts and policymakers to include consumers and businesses. The very future of our health care system is at stake, and we need their voices to join ours in this effort. In particular, gaining the support of consumers and businesses is key as AARP and other organizations work to modernize state scope-of-practice laws that prevent nurses from doing everything they were trained to do, a key recommendation of the IOM report.\n\nElaine Ryan, vice president of State Advocacy and Strategy Integration (SASI) in AARP\u2019s Government Affairs group, has experienced firsthand, as a family caregiver to her parents for 15 years, the negative impact these outdated barriers have. It was Nurse Sue who cared for Elaine\u2019s mother each week. \u201cI saw up close that nurses are lifesavers,\u201d Ryan shared on the panel. However, Nurse Sue was not allowed to update her mother\u2019s prescriptions, forcing her wheelchair-using mom to make daylong trips to the doctor\u2019s office for an appointment that would last just a few minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to give nurses more authority to heal,\u201d Ryan said. By doing so, it can help to alleviate the burden our nation\u2019s 42 million family caregivers experience in caring for their loved ones. \u201cTo all of those family caregivers out there, raise your voices,\u201d she said. \u201cThese rules don\u2019t have to be the way they are.\u201d\n\nBusinesses should play a key role in this conversation, noted panelist Jack Rowe, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health and the former CEO of Aetna, as well as the president and CEO of Mount Sinai NY Health.\n\n\u201cThe companies in the United States that care a lot about health care are not just the health care companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is every company, because every company\u2019s largest or most rapidly growing expense is their health care costs for their beneficiaries.\u201d The impact that corporate leaders can have on health care organizations \u201ccan\u2019t be overestimated,\u201d he said.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2015 and the fifth anniversary of the IOM report, I am proud of all that\u2019s been accomplished and eager to continue to broaden the national dialogue about the value of nurses to include corporate leaders, family caregivers and, most importantly, consumers. Ultimately, we all will benefit when we give nurses more authority to heal.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Last month I moderated a fascinating panel discussion on health care that included business leaders, policymakers, insurers and health care experts.
