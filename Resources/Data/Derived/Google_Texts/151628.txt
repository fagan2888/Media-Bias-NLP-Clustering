Parents of children at a high school near Dallas are upset about the summarized definition of the Second Amendment included in the textbook The United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination.

According to the textbook the Second Amendment protects the right to "keep and bear arms in a state militia." The text of the book was written before the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms in the District of Columbia v. Heller case in 2008.

From Fox News:

Parents at a high school near Dallas say the authors of a book on U.S. history misfired when they defined the Second Amendment -- and now one of the book's co-authors says the book is being revised. The work book used at Guyer High School in the city of Denton, "The United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination," includes the "summary" definition of the Second Amendment to include the right to "keep and bear arms in a state militia." The edited definition is seen by gun-rights advocates as an affront to the Second Amendment, which states in full: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
