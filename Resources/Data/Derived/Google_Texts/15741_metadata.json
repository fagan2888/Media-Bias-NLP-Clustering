Worth areas. Penhall provides similar services in large portions of the United States and Canada, including the Southeastern United States and has 40 locations across 17 states and Canada, including offices in the Atlanta and Dallas/Ft. Worth areas.The controversy involves use of the letters \u201cSGG\u201d as a trademark for grinding and grooving services. In short, Penhall\u2019s complaint states that it acquired the \u201cSGG\u201d mark on December 7, 2012 as part of a larger transaction from Safety Grooving & Grinding, L.P.(\u201cSafety Grooving\u201d), another grinding and grooving service company, who had been using the mark at least since August 22, 1988. Safety Grooving\u2019s registration of the mark issued October 4, 2011.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the problem arose when defendant Stefan Frame, who was a Penhall employee from 1999-2009, formed Southeast on January 15, 2010 and soon after began using \u201cSGG\u201d on equipment, marketing materials and a company web site. The complaint also alleges Frame had contacted the then-current president of Safety Grooving during that same month, on January 8, 2010, to inquire about job opportunities. The complaint asserts that this demonstrates notice and willfulness in use of the mark.\n\nBetween its issuance in October 2011 and Penhall\u2019s acquisition of the mark fourteen months later, Safety Grooving sent two cease and desist letters to Southeast in a back and forth about the allegedly infringing use. The second reiterated Safety Grooving\u2019s demands after Southeast refused to cease the allegedly infringing actions in its reply to the first letter.\n\nSoutheast's Trucks Grinding a Race Track\n\nThe complaint also details several specific instances of alleged actual customer confusion between Penhall and Southeast as a result of the \u201cSGG\u201d mark being associated with the wrong company or from customers not realizing there were two distinct companies. Penhall alleges irreparable harm as a result.\n\nPenhall\u2019s complaint further asserts that Southeast\u2019s alleged use of the \u201cSGG\u201d mark is intentional, willful, and maliciously calculated to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of Southeast with Penhall as to the origin, sponsorship or approval of Southeast\u2019s goods or services by Penhall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese allegations form the basis of Penhall\u2019s aforementioned claims. Penhall seeks judgment enjoining Southeast from using the \u201cSSG\u201d mark, an order to destroy anything of Southeast\u2019s that bears the \u201cSSG\u201d mark, a report detailing compliance with the injunction, and lost profits, treble damages, costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe case is Penhall Company v. Southeast Grinding and Grooving, LLC et al, case no. 1:13-cv-03052-WSD in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, and is assigned to Judge William S.
