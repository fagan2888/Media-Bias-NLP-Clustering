It finished 10th in points. Busch set team season records with 11 top five finishes and 16 top 10s. He now drives the No. 41 Haas Automation Chevrolet SS for Stewart-Haas Racing and sits 24th in the Sprint Cup Chase with 422 points.\n\nI had the chance to talk with Busch for a story I\u2019m working on about general manager Joe Garone and asked Busch a few questions.\n\nQ: What did you like about working for a single car team like Furniture Row?\n\nA: The ease of communication among team members. A smaller team makes it easier to communicate.\n\nQ: What is your favorite memory from working with the Furniture Row team?\n\nA: It has to be sitting on the pole at Darlington. That race seemed to move us in the right direction of being a top-tier team.\n\nQ: Would you ever attempt to do the double again? (In May, Busch competed in the Indinapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 which is commonly referred to as the double. He finished sixth in the 500 but his car\u2019s engine engine blew on lap 271 in the Coke 600.)\n\nA: It came with a lot of hard work and it was a lot of fun. The amount of responsibility that comes with 1,100 miles in one day can overwhelm you. I\u2019ve had a month or so to digest it. Part of me wants to do it, but part of me says I\u2019ve accomplished what I want to accomplish.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Furniture Row Racing,Kurt Busch,NASCAR", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Last season the Furniture Row Racing team had its best year with Kurt Busch in the car, becoming the first single-car team to qualify for the Sprint Cup Chase and finished 10th in points.", "title": "Kurt Busch, former Furniture Row driver, talks about 2014 season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/07/08/catching-former-furniture-row-driver-kurt-busch/26452/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/07/kurt-busch-nascar.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Last season the Furniture Row Racing team had its best year with Kurt Busch in the car, becoming the first single-car team to qualify for the Sprint Cup Chase and finished 10th in points.", "creator": "@avaldez", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/07/08/catching-former-furniture-row-driver-kurt-busch/26452/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/07/kurt-busch-nascar.jpg", "title": "Kurt Busch, former Furniture Row driver, talks about 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup season", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Last season, Furniture Row Racing team had its best year with Kurt Busch in the car, becoming the first single-car team to qualify for the Sprint Cup Chase."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c0a\"", "article_summary": "Last season, Furniture Row Racing team had its best year with Kurt Busch in the car, becoming the first single-car team to qualify for the Sprint Cup Chase.\nBusch set team season records with 11 top five finishes and 16 top 10s.\nQ: What is your favorite memory from working with the Furniture Row team?\nQ: What did you like about working for a single car team like Furniture Row?\nI had the chance to talk with Busch for a story I\u2019m working on about general manager Joe Garone and asked Busch a few questions."}
