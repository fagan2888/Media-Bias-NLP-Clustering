As a small business owner in Skowhegan and chairman of the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Insurance, I am sensitive to the impact this provision, among others, will have on small employers destined to have this cost passed down to them by insurers. This provision will surely increase the cost of premiums in Maine, contrary to our own local efforts to reduce premiums over the same time.\n\nWe worked extremely hard in the 125th Legislature to rein in rising premiums in the state and reduce the cost of insurance by implementing pragmatic, market-based solutions. These and other provisions in the ACA will undermine these important efforts, and eventually drive up costs to small businesses. These are expenses small companies in our state cannot afford.\n\nBipartisan legislation has been introduced both in the U.S. House (H.R. 1624) and Senate (S. 1099) to address this problem, and I\u2019m pleased that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, have joined on as co-sponsors.\n\nThis is an issue that our entire delegation should work to address. But given how little gets done these days in Washington, I fear this legislation won\u2019t be considered in a timely fashion.\n\nAccording to a report published in February 2013 by the Small Business Administration, there are more than 143,000 small companies in Maine, representing 97 percent of all employers and providing jobs for more than 282,000 workers \u2014 almost 60 percent of our state\u2019s total workforce.\n\nWhat will happen to these businesses and their employees if they are unable to renew or purchase plans that don\u2019t meet certain standards or are simply too expensive? Many will not be allowed to keep their current coverage or will be faced with expenses that are too costly.\n\nWith 2016 just around the corner, health insurance brokers are firming up their product information and rates for next year. Little time remains to rectify this situation, which is why Congress needs to act soon on this important legislation.\n\nFortunately, Maine has exceptional leaders in Washington who have a long history of fighting for Maine\u2019s business sector. Hopefully, they won\u2019t let us down and will work hard in the coming weeks to push congressional leaders to bring up this issue for a vote. Maine businesses have no appetite for political discourse \u2014 especially when it comes to an issue that can have such a profound effect on their future.\n\nSen.
