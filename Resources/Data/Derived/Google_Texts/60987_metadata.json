And if you're not that person that's going to win the day, then you're falling behind.\"\n\n\"As a coach, you always want to see your kids invested in their own progress and the harder they work, the better they get,\" says Bay head coach Michael Grady. \"And sometimes it's good to see them seeing the intangible proof that hard work pays off.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Marianna, FL---Some of the best high school basketball players in the Panhandle traveled to Marianna High School for the first ever Panhandle Exposure Showcase from Next Up Recruits.", "language": "english", "author": "Greg Brzozowski", "og": {"description": "Marianna, FL---Some of the best high school basketball players in the Panhandle traveled to Marianna High School for the first ever Panhandle Exposure Showcase from Next Up Recruits.", "title": "Panhandle's Finest Hit the Hardwood in Marianna for Hoops Showcase", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Panhandles-Finest-Hit-the-Hardwood-in-Marianna-for-Hoops-Showcase-270637511.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/667/9D0/6679D0FC914D40E7918DB45538E22352", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/96E/23E/96E23E9AA150481D882CCFFBD9ABE929.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Marianna, FL---Some of the best high school basketball players in the Panhandle traveled to Marianna High School for the first ever Panhandle Exposure Showcase from Next Up Recruits.", "title": "Panhandle's Finest Hit the Hardwood in Marianna for Hoops Showcase", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Panhandles-Finest-Hit-the-Hardwood-in-Marianna-for-Hoops-Showcase-270637511.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7basketball.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Panhandle's Finest Hit the Hardwood in Marianna for Hoops Showcase", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Panhandles Finest Hit the Hardwood, in Marianna for Hoops Showcase"}, "article_summary": "More Video...Marianna, FL---Florida may be a football state, but the basketball here on the high school level features a deep talent pool.\nOne look at the gym at Marianna High School Saturday shows you that where the first ever Panhandle Exposure Showcase was hosted by Next Up Recruits, a certified NCAA scouting source based out of the area.\nNext Up's been serving Panhandle high school and Juco hoops for over three years now, providing an outlet and opportunity to our local hoop dreamers, while continuing to grow by leaps and bounds.\nLocal high school and Juco coaches were in the building to both volunteer and just watch the event, all whom back up that the summer work is serious.\n\"If you don't serve the sport in the summer, then you're actually going to fall behind because somebody's going to win the day."}
