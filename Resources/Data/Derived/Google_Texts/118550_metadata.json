The only real question is, how big?\n\nEverything from litter to unseen poisons are out there. As the waters creep back below rivers\u2019 banks, residents and officials are starting to assess the damage and clean up the debris. Here\u2019s at least part of what you could find:\n\nMosquitoes and snakes\n\nMore mosquitoes will hatch this week, and the air hasn\u2019t cooled down nearly enough to daunt them, said Ed Harne, Charleston County mosquito control lab technician. How thick the biting pests get will vary area to area, but in places of long-standing, water it could get bad. County mosquito crews already were noticing activity pick up in the woods last week. Harne asked residents to dump what standing water they can.\n\nCrews will be out in as much force as they can muster, but the soggy grounds they have to cover will be vast. On top of the standing-water problem, the spread of flooding over otherwise dry ground will cause dormant eggs to hatch. As of Thursday, the aerial crew alone already was spraying 58 sites.\n\nBerkeley County crews are stepping up treatment and will step up spraying as the adults hatch, said Jeff Cary, mosquito abatement manager. \u201cWith the extensive river basins and natural marshes all underwater, there\u2019s really going to be more water than we can ever hope to treat.\u201d Dorchester County did not return calls asking for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, snakes and other critters that crawled up from flooded ground were starting to move for seasonal cover anyway. They might not be in any hurry to return. Larger animals such as deer and coyotes were displaced too.\n\n\u201cI suspect we will see things concentrated on higher ground and continue to see displaced animals show up in novel areas,\u201d said Will Dillman, S.C. Department of Natural Resources herpetologist. \u201cAs the water recedes, reptiles and amphibians will try to find suitable habitat in place or perhaps try to navigate to a familiar area.\u201d\n\nPlants and soil\n\nYour grass could die. Ornamental plants won\u2019t stand up to a prolonged soaking. Trees that are not wetland-tolerant could wilt or die all together.\n\n\u201cTrees not used to extended periods of water, what can happen is the roots actually die. It may even be a year (later), but trees could die and fall over,\u201d said Dara Park, a Clemson University soil scientist.\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\n\u201cThe fertility of the soil could be lost for a short time,\u201d said Calvin Sawyer, Clemson University soil scientist. The load of washed-away fertilizer, fecal material from pet waste and other sources, as well as other nutrients in the soil will be good in the long run \u2014 floods are how soils distribute nutrients naturally \u2014 but not so good in the short term, destroying the richness in the soil that grew plants in the first place.\n\nWater\n\nSewage and other fecal waste already are showing up in Charleston Harbor. All 15 harbor area sites tested Wednesday by Charleston Waterkeeper were considered unsafe for swimming.\n\nSewage overflows from the flood are still being reported to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, and staff are aware of a number of them already, said spokeswoman Cassandra Harris. \u201cFlooding and power outages from this unique rainstorm have created issues for wastewater treatment systems across the state.\u201d\n\nCharleston Water Systems\u2019 Plum Island plant didn\u2019t spill over but some of the system\u2019s lines did, said Andy Fairey, chief operating officer. That happened to lines across the state in the overload of rain runoff and subsequent flooding.\n\nWith infrastructure collapsing on the Congaree and other rivers upstream, Santee Cooper and Charleston Water Systems are watching for pollutants at their raw water intakes on Lake Moultrie and in Bushy Park, respectively, but haven\u2019t seen any serious spikes so far, spokespeople said. Chemicals are in place to deal with problems that might show up.\n\nThe load of nutrients and other pollutants in the water could become an ugly, fish-killing problem. Hans Paerl, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill marine scientist, is part of a team doing an ongoing study of the impacts of a massive load of freshwater discharged into the eastern North Carolina sounds after Hurricane Floyd in 1999.\n\nThe most significant findings so far are that:\n\nThe discharge lowered salinity to where habitats \u201ccompletely changed,\u201d Paerl said, in some areas eliminating shrimp, crabs, larvae of finfish and other marine species. The depletion was serious enough that catch restrictions were put in place to correct it.\n\nFor a year after the flood, the load of nutrients triggered algal blooms. The nutrients and the layering of fresh and salt water depleted dissolved oxygen, killing marine species.\n\nIn the Lowcountry, salinity loss won\u2019t be so big or long an issue, Paerl said, because the seas more easily flush estuaries here. For the same reason, algae blooms are less likely and wouldn\u2019t be so prevalent. Blooms here, though, have a bigger chance of being killing \u201cred tides.\u201d The blooms in North Carolina largely weren\u2019t toxic.\n\nAmong other issues, ferries traveling the sounds after the discharge were damaged from hitting large debris in the water, he said.\n\nThe unknowns\n\nNutrients are just one of the pollutants the flood flushed into the rivers and estuaries. Just what others might be out there, and how toxic they will be, can\u2019t really be answered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what we\u2019re facing in South Carolina,\u201d said John Rodgers, Clemson University ecotoxicologist, who studied the waterborne pollution in the Gulf states after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nSewage is the initial concern, along with washed-away industrial waste. But there is a lab shelf full of others, including:\n\nHousehold soaps, solvents, pesticides.\n\nOrganic toxins such as black mold.\n\nOil leaked from flooded vehicles and other sources.\n\nMetals.\n\nBiotics: microbes, amoeba and other organisms that can cause disease.\n\nOn top of all that is the turbidity, or mud washed into the water, as well as erosion and loss of riverbank structure, deposits of mud and silt and the pollution issues surrounding debris disposal. Environmental damage from Katrina is still showing up, Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my intent to be part of the \u2018fear factor,\u2019 but if you come across something that doesn\u2019t look right, feel right or smell right, call emergency personnel,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the other pollutants, \u201cwe really don\u2019t know that much about the contaminant issue,\u201d Paerl said about the Floyd flood. The long-range damage might not be obvious, \u201cbut there could be a long-lasting effects.\u201d\n\nReach Bo Petersen at (843) 937-5744, @bopete on twitter or Bo Petersen Reporting on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lasting damage: water, soils, wildlife disturbed by deluge, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nWeather, \r\nWeather, Critters,environment,estuary,flood,Lowcountry,nutrients,pollution,soil and water", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Mosquito swarms, pollutants, trees toppling over for no apparent reason \u2014 the devastating flood last week will leave an environmental mess.
