HARRISBURG, Pa. - This weekend, people around the world are holding climate vigils and rallies to get the attention of world leaders ahead of Monday's Climate Summit in Paris, France. Leaders from 140 countries will be gathering to iron out a new global agreement on climate change.

On Sunday, people of all faiths came together at Grace United Methodist Church in Harrisburg to hold a climate vigil. Attendees are hoping this will show that people are united on the issue.

"This is an opportunity for the faith community and those whom are outside the faith community to make their positions known," United Methodist Pastor Yvette Davis said, "to proclaim that it is time for us to do something about climate change."

Widener University Professor John Dernbach was one of the speakers at the vigil. He is a delegate to the Paris summit, and will be traveling there for the meeting.

"The risks that we are facing right now are really rather substantial; no predictions there," Dernbach said, "but the risks are great, and they are non-trivial risks, and the climate is already warming."
