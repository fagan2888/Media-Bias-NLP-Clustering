The industry\u2019s trade association, PhRMA, has said repeatedly he is not a member.\n\nBut Shkreli\u2019s status for next week remains unclear: He was recently arrested for unrelated charges of securities fraud and stepped down as CEO of his company. While a federal judge gave him permission to travel to Washington, D.C., for the hearing, his lawyer has said Shkreli intends to invoke his right against self-incrimination to avoid participating in the hearing.\n\nA spokeswoman for Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzOvernight Cybersecurity: Watchdog report dings Clinton email security IRS head vows to finish term despite impeachment push Top Oversight Dem blames GOP cuts for poor cybersecurity MORE (R-Utah) said the committee expects him to cooperate with their subpoena.\n\nBoth Turing and Valeant pharmaceuticals have been heavily criticized for their practice of buying up decades-old drugs and then significantly raising the price, sometimes overnight.\n\nThe committee has said it will focus on the \u201ctimely review and approval\u201d of generic drugs \u2014 an issue that is likely to spark a partisan fight, with Oversight\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), taking a fierce stance on the issue.\n\nBesides Shkreli and the current leaders of Turing and Valeant, the committee will also hear from Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug development arm.\n\nAlso coming up is the end of ObamaCare\u2019s third enrollment season \u2014 the final sign-up season to be overseen by the Obama administration. The final deadline is Sunday, Jan. 31, and a top ObamaCare administration reiterated Thursday that he would not be extending the deadline like he did last year.\n\nThose who do not purchase coverage by Sunday will face fines of at least $695, nearly double the amount of last year's penalty.\n\nThe numbers for December and January have been strong, with more than 11.6 million people signed up nationally.\n\nBut the final stretch of sign-ups will be crucial to ease still-present concerns within the insurance industry that the marketplace isn\u2019t stabilizing quickly enough. One insurance giant, Anthem, already warned this week that it will likely raise premiums in 2017, citing poorer-than-expected figures.\n\nThe coming week will also bring the Iowa caucuses, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest, where the pharmaceutical industry has been taking a beating from both parties.\n\nRecent stories:\n\nRepublicans accuse Obama of failing to enforce abortion law: http://bit.ly/1QLHaIy\n\nJudge paves way for Shkreli to testify before Congress: http://bit.ly/1JMCQay\n\nWhite House kicks off efforts for \u2018cancer moonshot\u2019: http://bit.ly/23ylMLW\n\nCDC: Big Zika virus outbreak unlikely in US: http://bit.ly/1SOu66q\n\nTrump calls for Medicare to negotiate drug prices: http://bit.ly/20bDZjj", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Embattled pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli will get their first chance to defend themselves during a high-profile hearing by the House Oversight Committee next week.", "description": "Embattled pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli will get their first chance to defend themselves during a high-profile hearing by the House Oversight Committee next week.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Embattled pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli will get their first chance to defend themselves during a high-profile hearing by the House Oversight Committee next week.", "title": "Week ahead: Lawmakers go on offense over drug prices", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267545-week-ahead-lawmakers-go-on-offense-over-drug-prices", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:09:47-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267545-week-ahead-lawmakers-go-on-offense-over-drug-prices", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-01T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jesse Helfrich", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jason Chaffetz,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-01T06:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:09:47-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267545-week-ahead-lawmakers-go-on-offense-over-drug-prices", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Embattled pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli will get their first chance to defend themselves during a high-profile hearing by the House Oversight Committee next week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Week ahead: Lawmakers go on offense over drug prices"}, "dcterms.title": "Week ahead: Lawmakers go on offense over drug prices"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a84\"", "article_summary": "Embattled pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli will get their first chance to defend themselves during a high-profile hearing by the House Oversight Committee next week.\nBesides Shkreli and the current leaders of Turing and Valeant, the committee will also hear from Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug development arm.\nOne insurance giant, Anthem, already warned this week that it will likely raise premiums in 2017, citing poorer-than-expected figures.\nWeeks of public shaming of Big Pharma will come to a head on Thursday, where lawmakers are expected to focus on claims of profiteering by two pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Valeant and Turing.\nThe coming week will also bring the Iowa caucuses, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest, where the pharmaceutical industry has been taking a beating from both parties."}
