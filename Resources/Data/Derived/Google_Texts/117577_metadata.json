This immutable fact was reaffirmed this past week when an effort to encourage young people to sign up for Obamacare went horribly, terribly, plaidly wrong.\n\nIt all started with a tweet. Organizing for Action, the grass-roots operation built to advocate for President Obama\u2019s legislative agenda, tweeted a photo of a 20-something guy with hipster glasses, wearing a black-and-red-plaid onesie and cradling a mug. The text next to the image reads: \u201cWear pajamas. Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health insurance. #GetTalking.\u201d\n\nThus, Pajama Boy was born. And mocking Pajama Boy entered the world immediately afterward. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie kicked things off, tweeting a picture of himself working at a soup kitchen accompanied by this caption: \u201cGet out of your pajamas. Put on an apron. And Get Volunteering.\u201d A flood of other conservatives jumped on board, offering thoughts that ranged from the funny (a picture of Pajama Boy with the words \u201cI live with my parents\u201d plastered over it) to the surprisingly serious (one commentator mourned the American male, or \u201cinsufferable man-child,\u201d that Pajama Boy represents).\n\nPajama Boy was the latest swing and miss in efforts by Obama allies to persuade \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d who lack health insurance to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Who could forget the \u201cbrosurance\u201d ads featuring a college guy doing a keg stand with a \u201cgot insurance?\u201d headline? Or the one with a cardboard cutout of Ryan Gosling?\n\nPajama Boy, for getting people laughing at you rather than talking about health insurance, you had the worst week in Washington. Congrats, or something.\n\n@BarackObama\u2019s Twitter feed\n\nHave a candidate for the Worst Week in Washington?
