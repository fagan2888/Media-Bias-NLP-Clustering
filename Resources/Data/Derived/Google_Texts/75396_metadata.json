Paul LePage (YouTube/screen grab)\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage (R) was scolded during a radio interview on Wednesday regarding the issue of expanding Medicaid in his state, the Maine People\u2019s Alliance Beacon reported.\n\nLePage has vetoed five bills that would have done so, each of which would have allowed the state to take part in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state exchange program and be eligible for federal reimbursement.\n\nHe argued to Maine Calling host Jennifer Rooks that the state would not qualify for that reimbursement. LePage also expressed skepticism that doing so has cut off around 24,000 residents from health insurance they would get under the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe are providing everything that we can by law. We are following the law,\u201d he argued. \u201cExpanding Medicaid isn\u2019t gonna help those folks because they don\u2019t qualify anyways. That\u2019s the problem people don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nBut was quickly confronted by a caller identifying herself as Laura.\n\n\u201cLePage is wrong in saying that people aren\u2019t affected or they wouldn\u2019t get the insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cI would get the insurance if we accepted that money federally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you now?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I make too little money to be on Obamacare,\u201dshe replied. \u201cIt\u2019s expected that if you go to Obamacare that you\u2019re going to make a certain amount of money so you can afford the premiums.\u201d\n\nLaura explained that she did not qualify because she made less than $11,500 a year, prompting LePage to reply, \u201cThen you qualify for Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get Medicaid unless you\u2019re pregnant, disabled or over 55,\u201d she shot back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d LePage insisted.\n\nLaura said that she has been told so for cases including not only herself, but people she has helped in her job as a social worker.\n\nMaine Public Broadcasting, which carries the show, later reported that LePage\u2019s administration released a statement admitting that LePage misspoke regarding the state\u2019s eligibility for reimbursement, which would allow for 60,000 residents to receive health care under the law.\n\n[h/t Daily Kos]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lepage1-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Maine woman exposes Tea Party Gov.
