Without seeing the assessment scores, managers from both sexes were more likely to choose a male over a female, even though the candidates had equal scores on the math assignment.\n\nBusiness school professors Paola Sapienza from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Ernesto Reuben from Columbia Business School and Luigi Zingales of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, worked together on the study.\n\nAnother variation of the experiment allowed the interviewees to predict their performance on the task. Male candidates often overestimated their performance and female candidates typically downplayed theirs, but men were still chosen over women twice as often.\n\nEven after the hiring managers were given the assessment scores showing that the women were equally as skilled as the men, the managers continued to favor male candidates one-and-a half times more than female candidates.\n\nAlmost 20 percent of hiring managers decided to hire the candidate with the lower score on the assessment. Sixty-four percent of those candidates were men.\n\nThe study used an implicit association test (I.A.T.) to measure the gender bias of the hiring managers before beginning the experiment. Some I.A.T. results showed that the hiring managers were more likely to believe negative stereotypes against women.\n\n\u201cThe very people who are biased against women about math, they\u2019re also less likely to believe that men boast,\u201d Dr. Zingales said. \u201cSo they\u2019re picking up a negative stereotype of women, but not a negative stereotype of men.\u201d\n\nGet Free Updates!
