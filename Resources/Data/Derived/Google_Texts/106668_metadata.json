There is singing, diction, music, the beauty of the human voice, dancing, costumes and the orchestra.\n\nThe many elements reach deep into the soul.\n\n\"There's nothing like it, as far as I'm concerned,\" she said.\n\nHoch started the company after she moved to Loveland in 1994 and started giving music lessons while studying for her doctorate. She had great singers in her living room and realized there were enough to form an opera company.\n\n\"We have such a need here,\" she said. \"So many great singers come out of our universities and they have nowhere to sing. The bigger opera companies hire from the East Coast.\n\n\"There was a need to give young grads and artists an opportunity to work on their craft.\"\n\nThere also is a need, Hoch said, to offer the community opera performances at an affordable price.\n\n\"You could go to (another opera house) and spend $125-$300,\" she said, \"or you could come to Loveland and pay $32 for a gala.\"\n\nIn addition, the troupe practices community outreach: Its performers teach children about opera and try to spur interest in the art form through children's operettas such as \"Mikado for Kids.\"\n\nContact Jessica Benes at 970-669-5050 (ext. 530), jbenes@aespotlight.com or twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_26598007/loveland-opera-theatre-turns-10", "modificationDate": "2014-09-28T14:58:19-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0924/20140924__26AEOPE~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  A&E Spotlight", "description": "Micky Poage,  well-known for his renditions of popular music scores, will be making his debut with  the Loveland Opera Theatre on Oct. 4 when he performs  in a gala event celebrating the opera theater's 10th anniversary, \"From London and Broadway With Love,\" at the Rialto Theater Center in Loveland.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26598007:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-27T14:55:31-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_26598007/loveland-opera-theatre-turns-10", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0924/20140924__26AEOPE~3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Micky Poage,  well-known for his renditions of popular music scores, will be making his debut with  the Loveland Opera Theatre on Oct. 4 when he performs  in a gala event celebrating the opera theater's 10th anniversary, \"From London and Broadway With Love,\" at the Rialto Theater Center in Loveland.", "title": "Loveland Opera Theatre turns 10"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Micky Poage,  well-known for his renditions of popular music scores, will be making his debut with  the Loveland Opera Theatre on Oct. 4 when he performs  in a gala event celebrating the opera theater's 10th anniversary, \"From London and Broadway With Love,\" at the Rialto Theater Center in Loveland.", "title": "Loveland Opera Theatre turns 10", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_26598007/loveland-opera-theatre-turns-10", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0924/20140924__26AEOPE~3.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-27T14:55:31-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-09-27T14:55:31-0600", "sailthru.title": "Loveland Opera Theatre turns 10", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Jessica BenesA&E", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0924/20140924__26AEOPE~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-09-27T14:58:14-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont TimesCall Colorado news sports features movies health lifestyles gardening music arts dance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c45\"", "article_summary": "The gala also will include eight soloists from across the Front Range as well as chorus members from the Loveland Opera Theatre.\nMany of the troupe's singers have gone on to have major careers around the world, she said, crediting the Loveland Opera Theatre for being a good stepping-stone.\n: The celebration marks the 10th anniversary of the Loveland Opera Theatre and will feature music by concert pianist Micky Poage, \"Vail's Piano Man.\"\nJuliana Hoch, founder of the Loveland Opera Theatre, and her husband started working with Poage on music and formed a friendship that is going on 30 years.\nAdvertisementBut Poage will be making his debut with the Loveland Opera Theatre on Oct. 4 when he performs in a gala event celebrating the opera theater's 10th anniversary, \"From London and Broadway With Love,\" at the Rialto Theater Center in Loveland."}
