She makes sure everything in the office runs smoothly \u2013 scheduling patients, collecting payments, keeping the lights on. Recently she added another duty\u2013incorporating the trickle of patients with insurance plans purchased on the new Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nOpen enrollment doesn\u2019t end until March 31, but people who have already bought Obamacare plans are beginning to use them. \u201cWe had a spattering in January\u2014maybe once a week. But I think we\u2019re averaging two to three a day now,\u201d says Lawless.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like many new customers, but it\u2019s presented a major challenge: verifying that these patients have insurance. Each exchange patient has required the practice to spend an hour or more on the phone with the insurance company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on hold for an hour, an hour and 20, an hour and 45, been disconnected, have to call back again and repeat the process,\u201d she explains. Those sorts of hold times add up fast.\n\nIn the past, offices have been able to make sure patients are insured quickly, by using an online verification system. But for exchange patients, practices also have to call the insurer to make sure the patient has paid his premium. If he hasn\u2019t, the insurance company can refuse to pay the doctor for the visit, or come back later and recoup a payment it made.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a provision of the law that gives exchange patients who neglect to pay their premium a \u201cgrace period\u201d of up to 90 days. During the first 30 days, insurers have to pay any claims incurred by the patient. But for the next 60 days, nothing is guaranteed. If the patient visits the doctor, the insurer can \u201cpend\u201d the claim \u2013 that is, wait to pay the doctor until the patient pays his premium. At the end of the 90-day grace period, if the patient has not paid the premium, the insurer can cancel the coverage and refuse to pay the pended claims, or recoup the payments it\u2019s already made. And that puts the doctor\u2019s office at risk.\n\nSo Lawless is checking first with the insurer to make sure that everything is in order before proceeding with the visit. If the premium has not been paid, Lawless gives the patient the option of rescheduling the appointment or paying in cash and then applying to his insurer for the payment.\n\n\u201cMost small practices run lean and mean \u2013 you\u2019ve got one or two people to do this process plus do their other job duties that day as well, which is tend to the patients in front of them,\u201d says Lawless. To manage the new workload, she\u2019s had other staffers, including nurses, step in to answer the phone. And that means longer hours, more overtime, and higher overhead expenses. And then there\u2019s the plain old annoyance factor.\n\n\u201cYou call in and you hit option prompts and you get to listen to no less than an hour of Blue Cross Blue Shield intro music. I could sing you the tune, that\u2019s how often I\u2019ve had to listen to it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy staff said yesterday, it\u2019s a sad shame within their prompts you can\u2019t pick your music as well. If you\u2019re going to have to wait that long, at least let us listen to what we want to listen to!\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield in Texas is the only insurer offering exchange plans in Wichita Falls. Dr. Dan McCoy, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, says part of the problem was the health law\u2019s compressed timeline.\n\n\u201cClearly at the end of December there were a significant number of members that enrolled and it\u2019s taken some time to work through that volume in membership,\u201d explains McCoy. \u201cAnd we know this is a new day in the transformation of American health care. So it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to work through that.\u201d\n\nHealth Care Service Corp., which owns Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, has tried to address the situation by adding another 600 employees at its call center to handle the influx of calls and by extending business hours. McCoy has also been working directly with the Texas Medical Association to work out the kinks.\n\nAnders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs at the Medical Group Management Association in Washington, D.C., a trade group for practice administrators, says the real problem is that signing up for coverage on the exchange isn\u2019t as simple as the White House has made it sound.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that messaging out of the [Obama] administration right now that\u2019s aimed at the public, it tends to oversimplify the complexity of what it takes to get covered on the exchanges,\u201d says Gilberg. \u201cJust because you enrolled in coverage doesn\u2019t mean your coverage is effective.\u201d\n\nEven if patients pay their premium right away, it could be up to six weeks before their coverage actually starts. To have insurance start at the beginning of a month, the coverage generally must be purchased by the middle of the previous month. A plan purchased on Feb. 14 would be effective March 1. But a plan purchased on Feb. 16, for example, would not become effective until April 1. Go to the doctor before then, and your insurer doesn\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that given the subtle nuances and differences of what these exchange products are, that you\u2019re in a gray area right now where there\u2019s a little confusion on the patient side and the practice side. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a lot of right now,\u201d says Gilberg.\n\nFor a brand new program, that\u2019s to be expected, he adds. And it doesn\u2019t mean the exchange isn\u2019t working. The real test will be what happens in April, when open enrollment ends and everyone who has purchased a plan offered through the health law\u2019s online exchanges plan is clearly covered.\n\nIn the meantime, Lawless offers this advice to patients who have bought plans on the exchange: \u201cIf you pay your premium prior to [visiting the doctor], print that out and bring it with you because that will certainly save all a lot of grief.\u201d\n\nJenny Gold writes for Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
