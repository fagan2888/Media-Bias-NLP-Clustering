In late February, she\u2019ll move to Denison to be close to family.\n\nNielsen will work with Jon Bailey, who was chosen to take over the helm of the nonprofit, which provides food, clothing, financial assistance and affordable health care to locals.\n\nNielsen said she\u2019ll miss working directly with people the agency served the most.\n\n\u201cAs you rise to the top, you lose contact with your clients and your patients,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason you get into this kind of work. I\u2019m going to miss that.\u201d\n\nIn early December, Rockwall County Helping Hands board of directors named Bailey the organization\u2019s new executive director; his first day at the agency was Jan. 5. Bailey grew up in Rockwall, graduating from Rockwall High School in 1992 and from Texas A&M-Commerce in 1997. He serves as a Rockwall ISD school board member, is past president of the Rockwall Rotary Club and is a member of the Rockwall Chamber of Commerce board of directors.\n\nThough Nielsen is staying on board through mid-February to help Bailey transition into his new role, a retirement celebration that will also serve as a fundraiser for the nonprofit is set for Jan. 24. The black-tie event is called The Magic Of Margo and comes just weeks before her 70th birthday.\n\nMelody Hail, Helping Hands director of development, said the event \u201cis an opportunity for the community to come out and thank Margo for her service.\u201d\n\nAgency budget grows\n\nNielsen became the first executive director of Helping Hands in 1989, just four years after she moved to Rockwall with her husband.\n\nUnder her direction, the agency grew from a storefront to a four-building complex on more than 10 acres with an annual budget of $2.7 million. When Nielsen came to the agency, the nonprofit had a budget of $60,000 and there was no food pantry.\n\n\u201cI think the capacity has been the biggest change,\u201d she said.\n\nNielsen said most of the agency\u2019s clients were working-class families who were struggling to get by. Now it\u2019s people who never bounced back from the recession.\n\n\u201cA lot of people lost jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them never got jobs again. They\u2019ve adjusted. They\u2019ve downsized.\u201d\n\nThe organization relies on donations, but they do receive grants designated for the health care center. And about 40 percent of the organization\u2019s budget comes from the thrift store, Nielsen said. The thrift store saw more than $1 million in profits in 2014, she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exciting for my last year. It\u2019s kind of a record,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nThe organization now relies on 40 employees and 150 regular volunteers.\n\nThe health center, which has three nurse practitioners and six volunteer physicians, opened in 2000 when the area found itself without women\u2019s health care options. The county contracted with Helping Hands as a provider for women\u2019s health care. In 2004, it expanded to become a primary health care facility.\n\n\u201cOur practice is starting to grow,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cEven with the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019ve started seeing a lot of people who don\u2019t have health insurance and still can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nThe most recent estimates put Rockwall County\u2019s uninsured population at about 13 percent, or about 11,000 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey.\n\nWhile the clinic is not free, services are provided on a sliding scale for Rockwall County residents who meet income criteria. For those who don\u2019t qualify or have insurance, the clinic is still an option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to avoid having people go into the emergency room because that\u2019s the most expensive care you can get,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nThe clinic is open to the public 60 hours a week and sees 6,000 to 7,000 patients a year, she said.\n\n\u201cI never dreamed that I would be able to be a health care provider,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from almost zero capacity to an agency that can meet a whole lot of needs.\u201d\n\nInvolved in the community\n\nNielsen has also been very active outside of Helping Hands. She\u2019s been involved in the Rockwall Rotary Club, the Rockwall Agricultural Extension Service and the Rockwall MusicFest and has served on numerous nonprofit boards and commissions, including the Rockwall County Child Protective Services Board. She was appointed to the City Council in 2005, where she served for seven years.\n\nHeath Mayor Lorne Liechty said Nielsen has been an important part of the community for nearly as long as she\u2019s lived there.\n\n\u201cMargo has been not only critical to Helping Hands, but she has been one of the foundational people in Rockwall County,\u201d said Liechty, who also serves as chairman of Helping Hands\u2019 board of directors. \u201cThis large effort has been built thanks to Margo.\u201d\n\nNielsen said she\u2019s proud of the work she\u2019s been doing for 25 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to do this. I got thanked the other day at Wal-Mart by people who wanted me to know they had been helped,\u201d she said.\n\nNeighborsgo reporter Julissa Trevi\u00f1o can be reached at 214-977-8023.\n\nTHE MAGIC OF MARGO\n\nWhat: A cocktail reception and dinner will serve as a retirement party for longtime Helping Hands executive director Margo Nielsen and fundraiser for the organization.\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at the Hilton Dallas/Rockwall Lakefront\n\nCost: Individual tickets are $150\n\nMore info: Visit rockwallhelpinghands.\n\ncom/event/the-magic-of-margo", "article_metadata": {"description": "As executive director, Margo Nielsen has seen the organization grow from a 2,400-square-foot storefront on Kenway Street to two campuses occupying 28,000 square feet.
