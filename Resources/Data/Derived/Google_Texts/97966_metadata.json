Next Monday, June 30, is the only other scheduled decision day for the Court, at least for now.\n\nIn addition to King v. Burwell (the Obamacare case) and Obergefell v. Hodges (the same-sex marriage case), outstanding Court cases include pending decisions on lethal injections, voter redistricting and housing discrimination.\n\nToday, among the four opinions announced was Horne v. Department of Agriculture, in which Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority in an 8-1 decision. The Court reversed a lower court decision and found that a family of California raisin growers deserved just compensation after the state impounded parts of their crops in a price-support program.\n\n\u201cThe Fifth Amendment requires that the Government pay just compensation when it takes personal property, just as when it takes real property,\u201d said Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nRoberts also didn\u2019t send the case back to a lower court. \u201cThere is accordingly no need for a re\u00admand; the Hornes should simply be relieved of the obliga\u00adtion to pay the fine and associated civil penalty they were assessed when they resisted the Government\u2019s effort to take their raisins. This case, in litigation for more than a decade, has gone on long enough,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe privacy case was Los Angeles v. Patel and involved the ability of local police to access guest register lists at hotels. In the 5-4 decision, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that a Los Angeles law that required hotel operators to record and keep specific information about their guests on the premises for a 90-day period was unconstitutional.\n\nThe law allowed for the records to be \u201cmade available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection . . . at a time and in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operation of the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold facial challenges can be brought under the Fourth Amendment. We further hold that the provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code that requires hotel operators to make their registries available to the police on demand is facially unconstitutional because it penalizes them for declining to turn over their records without affording them any opportunity for pre-compliance review,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\nIn a third case, the Court ruled in Kimble v. Marvel that once a patent expires, the patent holder doesn\u2019t have to pay royalty fees to the original inventor when using it. In this case, the patent was for a web-slinging toy related to the Spider-Man franchise.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan said in the majority opinion that the Court needed to adhere to its 1964 decision in Brulotte v. Thys Co. about patent-royalty rights.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nSupreme Court Scorecard (Updated June 22): The big decisions due this month\n\nHamilton\u2019s supporters question Treasury Department\u2019s $10 decision\n\nHow much do you know about the American flag?\n\nConstitution Check: What power does the government have to control \u201cmobile billboards\u201d?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court didn\u2019t rule on its widely anticipated Obamacare or same-sex marriage cases on Monday, but it did issue decisions that could have important impacts on privacy and agricultural...", "title": "Supreme Court rules in raisins, hotel privacy cases", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-in-raisins-hotel-privacy-cases/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Raisins500a.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Raisins500a.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-22T15:42:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T18:05:18+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8baf\"", "article_summary": "The privacy case was Los Angeles v.
