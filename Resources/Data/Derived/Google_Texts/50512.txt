If you stepped outside Saturday, you couldn't miss the distinct smell of smoke and haze over south-central Kansas.

The smoke is from controlled burns in the Flint Hills area. Butler County disptachers tell KAKE News that there were numerous controlled burns across the county and in Greenwood County.

The National Weather Serice office in Wichita sent out a tweet on their Twitter feed, saying that the light winds and setting sun caused the smoke to be trapped in the lower atmosphere.

The yearly burning of ranch lands in Kansas is used to promote growth of fresh new grass, along with preventing invasive weed and tree species from overcoming graze areas for cattle.
