A Wichita man is charged with capital murder in the deaths of a local couple. Prosecutors formally charged Steven Edwards in Sedgwick County District Court this morning.

Edwards was arrested last month in the killings of Godofredo and Martha Moreno. The couple was found shot to death in their home in the 600 block of South Ida on October 16th.

An arrest warrant showed Edwards, 20, was caught driving the couple's SUV hours after the killings.

Edwards' bond is set at $1 million. His next court appearance is scheduled for December 10th.

The Public Defenders Office will represent Edwards.
