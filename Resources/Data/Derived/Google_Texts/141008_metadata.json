Hardliner and actual CNN contributor Erick Erickson, or maybe he's not there anymore because who the hell watches CNN these days:\n\nI am tired of funding Republicans who campaign against Obamacare then refuse to fight.

It's the fault of that damn meddling media for saying House Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare instead of calmly explaining that the Republicans merely wanted to reasonably exchange defunding or delaying the law in exchange for allowing the federal government to continue to function. Stop painting us as unreasonable!\n\n\"We never asked for a full repeal of Obamacare because we can't get that,\" he said. \"We have voted on a full repeal of Obamacare that the Senate has rejected every single time. But what we were asking for, our position from the beginning, was exchanging a one-year CR for a one-year delay of Obamacare. That was something we thought both sides were giving on something.\"\n\nJohn Boehner may have decided that he'd rather not plunge the United States into default quite just yet, but the true believers?
