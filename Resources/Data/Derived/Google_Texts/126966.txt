ISSUE | SODA TAX

Consumers' burden

Mayor Kenney's proposed sugary-beverage tax would be regressive and would pass the cost of public education on to the working poor.

Dr. Barbara Gold, vice chair of the Food Trust, wrote, "The proposal seeks to direct a fraction of the beverage industry's multibillion-dollar annual profits to pay for expanded pre-K programs and community schools . . ." ("Not a grocery levy," April 18). If that is true, why would consumers be the ones paying for pre-K and community schools? And, why isn't the city knocking on Comcast's or Aramark's door? Or reinstating payments in lieu of taxes so that the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University pay up?
