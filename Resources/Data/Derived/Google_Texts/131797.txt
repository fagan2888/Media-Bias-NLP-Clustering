There’s another grand jury decision on the horizon involving a high profile case involving the police, but it’s not in Ferguson, Missouri; it’s in New York City.

Next month, a Staten Island grand jury will decide whether to bring charges against the police officers that were involved in the attempted arrest of Eric Gardner, who died after being put in a chokehold; Gardner was suspected of selling illegal cigarettes.

With Ferguson being a hot spot for protesters following their grand jury’s decision to not indict Officer Darren Wilson, NYPD detectives are currently on the ground collecting intelligence and taking notes on how to prevent such rioting in the Big Apple:

“We have a number of our detectives out there, have had them out there for over a week to help out in terms of intelligence we have on some of the professional agitators who are involved in these types of activity,” Commissioner William Bratton said. The NYPD is also hoping to learn from Ferguson’s experience, he added.

On the night of the Ferguson grand jury decision, protests broke out in Times Square. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was splattered with fake blood by a protester.
