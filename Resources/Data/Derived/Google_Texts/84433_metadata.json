They say Obama violated his oath to protect the constitution, but more importantly, contradicted his own assessment that he couldn\u2019t act on his own.\n\nHow \u2018Bout a Raise: In a frank talk at the Business Roundtable, the president told the assembled corporate CEOs that stagnant wages have created \u201can undertow of pessimism\u201d that\u2019s dragging down the good news of the economic recovery.\n\nJust Kidding...: The president seemed relaxed during the Business Roundtable trading questions with the industry titans, even though there were reporters in the room. The famously press-suspicious president chalked it up to a form of short-timer\u2019s disease: \u201cYou get a little looser in your last two years in office,\u201d he said.\n\n...Or Not: The White House communications apparatus was on the defensive today after the Senate confirmed Colleen Bell, a soap opera producer, to be the next ambassador to Hungary, continuing the long tradition of rewarding big-dollar campaign fundraisers with diplomatic gigs. John McCain was not pleased, citing Hungary\u2019s proximity to Russia and other U.S. strategic interests, and lamenting that \u201cwe're going to send the producer of 'The Bold and the Beautiful' as our ambassador.\"\n\nReach the Kids: If Obama can\u2019t convince some congressional Republicans that global warming is real, he may as well go after the kids. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is going to start pushing climate education and literacy in the nation\u2019s classrooms, including distribution of science-based materials on the subject.\n\n\n\nToday in 2016:\n\nOn the Record: In the crowded Republican presidential field, known around Whispers as \u201cUndeclared,\u201d the speculation is hard to separate from the reality of who\u2019s actually going to run for president and who\u2019s merely flirting with the idea. Fortunately, Time Magazine sorts out who\u2019s said what about running for president and compiled it into a handy clip-and-save chart.\n\n\n\nWither Marco: Remember Sen. Marco Rubio? The Florida Republican used to be a hot commodity among the undeclared, but RealClearPolitics reports that he\u2019s got a lot to consider before throwing his hat into the 2016 ring, and the longer he waits the harder his decision will be.\n\n\n\nToday in Hillary:\n\nBy 2016, Maybe: The best estimates say Hillary Clinton will formally announce her candidacy sometime in January, but Politico believes it will come even later than that. They report top advisers say Clinton\u2019s entry into the 2016 field isn\u2019t a lock despite her commanding lead in most polls, and there\u2019s a lot of parsing to be done before she throws her hat into the ring.\n\n\n\nGood Seats Available: But if today\u2019s turnout for a policy speech at Georgetown University is any indication, Clinton might want to lower her profile \u2013 or her speaking fees \u2013 just a bit. As Clinton talked about women and leadership around the world, the Twittersphere buzzed about the dozens of empty seats in the auditorium, perhaps evidence that negative press about her six-figure honoraria and green room demands are having an effect on her popularity.\n\n\n\nToday in Everything Else:\n\nThat Was Then: House Speaker John Boehner insists his party has come up with a plan to avoid a government shutdown \u2013 something he and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have promised publicly \u2013 and register the GOP\u2019s displeasure with President Obama\u2019s actions on immigration reform. But Bloomberg Politics helpfully reminds us talk is cheap, and we\u2019ve been down this no-shutdown road before.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Obama Says Garner Case 'Speaks to Larger Issues'", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "POTUS gets sued (again), Hillary doesn't fill the house, and Tom Harkin wants an Obamacare do-over.", "title": "Last Call: Obama Reflects on Garner Case", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/12/03/last-call-obama-says-garner-case-speaks-to-larger-issues", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2c/cd/e68b1f39473aa41bc485446fca8d/141203-garnerprotest-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Last Call: Obama Says Garner Case 'Speaks to Larger Issues'", "description": "POTUS gets sued (again), Hillary doesn't fill the house, and Tom Harkin wants an Obamacare do-over.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
