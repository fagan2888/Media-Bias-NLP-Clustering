And some service providers who help clients get Medicaid coverage are reporting much longer processing times since the system went live in July and the state deals with a backlog of applications.\n\nKansas signed a contract with Accenture to build the Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES, in 2011. The system originally was slated to be complete by the end of 2013, , but considerable delays caused lawmakers to seek an audit in March.\n\nThe audit report published Thursday said the KEES timeline was unrealistic from the beginning. The system had to be adjusted because of state and federal changes to Medicaid, some due to the Affordable Care Act. But there also were problems with Accenture\u2019s \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d software.\n\n\u201cAlthough many modifications to the software were anticipated, far more extensive changes were required to meet the state\u2019s needs,\u201d wrote the Legislative Post Audit team, led by Matt Etzel. \u201cThese modifications required additional time to plan, design and implement and therefore increased the cost to build KEES.\u201d\n\nAuditors also determined that some of the functions Accenture promised had to be postponed, reduced or scrapped.\n\nHundreds of workarounds\n\nDocuments show that the state developed almost 400 workarounds during the KEES testing phases for employees to overcome problems or limitations within the system.\n\nAaron Dunkel, deputy secretary of KDHE, said that was a small number compared to other states that had done similar technical revamps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put us leaps and bounds ahead of other states,\u201d Dunkel said of KEES.\n\nThe documents show that more than 50 workarounds \u2014 some of them with 10 or more steps \u2014 have been added or changed since mid-June, when the program was about to go live. A state employee who requested anonymity said the system workarounds are causing delays in processing Medicaid applications.\n\nAccording to a former state agency information technology director, the documents indicate that KEES was not ready for rollout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very concerned if this were my system and this is what I was seeing, that we had put it into production too soon and without adequate testing,\u201d said Neil Woerman, who worked as a technology director for the Kansas Insurance Department.\n\nGlen Yancey, chief information officer for KDHE, has led the state\u2019s oversight of the KEES project since 2013. He said every project he\u2019s worked on required \u201cinstruction sets for people to use in order to efficiently use the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what those workarounds are \u2014 instructions on how to use the system correctly,\u201d Yancey said.\n\nThe auditors said the state\u2019s management of KEES appears to have improved since Yancey took over.\n\nSara Belfry, a spokeswoman for KDHE, said KEES is \u201cup and running\u201d and the agency has \u201cimplemented fixes to improve processing time.\u201d\n\nThe agency also is getting help for workers dealing with a backlog of more than 6,000 Medicaid applications, she said. Kansas Medicaid, or KanCare, currently serves more than 420,000 people.\n\n\u201cActions have been undertaken to address and eliminate the pending applications,\u201d Belfry said. \u201cWe have added and re-deployed additional staff to increase application processing capacity and continue to make system improvements to decrease application processing time.\u201d\n\nProviders report delays\n\nOrganizations that help Kansans apply for Medicaid say a process that used to take 10 days can now take more than a month, or even several months. That can have consequences for both patients and providers.\n\nAndy Rausch, a 41-year-old from Parsons, was in a coma while his children were struggling to get Medicaid coverage.\n\nRausch has had a heart condition for most of his adult life. Complications from a routine dental procedure in July turned into a life-threatening blood clot, a trip to a hospital in St. Louis and a long recovery.\n\n\u201cI was in the hospital for three months,\u201d Rausch said. \u201cAnd still nothing happened for the kids the entire three months.\u201d\n\nWhile Rausch was incapacitated, his ex-wife and some of her co-workers at the SKIL Resource Center in Parsons were trying to get coverage for his children, including one who needs medication for a chronic condition.\n\nIt ultimately took four months. Rausch\u2019s children had complicated applications because of shared custody and changes in their father\u2019s income due to his illness. But SKIL director Shari Coatney and her staff who serve Kansans with disabilities said that kind of timeline has become increasingly common since the state began processing Medicaid applications through KEES.\n\nBill Persinger, CEO of Valeo Behavioral Services in Topeka, said his workers also had reported problems with Medicaid since KEES went live.\n\nPersinger said that in addition to applications taking longer, some Valeo clients who were on Medicaid have been dropped from the program improperly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something our benefits counselor is helping people with.\u201d\n\nValeo continues to provide services in those situations, Persinger said, and tries to seek retroactive Medicaid reimbursement once the client is covered. It hasn\u2019t affected his organization\u2019s cash flow yet.\n\n\u201cI will say that Medicaid is a pretty sizable chunk of our fee-for-service third-party income. So if there were considerable delays with that, I think it could represent some income disruption,\u201d Persinger said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not concerned about that right now, because I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to be a short-run problem and folks will fix it.\u201d\n\nYancey said any new system has a \u201clearning curve to the workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly going to take an initial dip in productivity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you come out on the other end, you\u2019re actually more efficient.\u201d\n\nYancey said the ACA also made the rules for determining Medicaid eligibility more complex, requiring more data collection than in the past and causing some processing delays.\n\nSocial services applications to be added to system\n\nThe KEES system has not been fully implemented. Applications for other social services programs like food stamps and cash assistance through the Department for Children and Families are scheduled to be incorporated with the Medicaid processing portion in the spring.\n\nA backlog of more than 30,000 applications for food stamps grew in North Carolina last year after that state switched to a similar computer system, which also was developed by Accenture.\n\nMost of Accenture\u2019s $135 million contract to build KEES comes from federal funds, as does an additional $50 million for ongoing maintenance.\n\n\u201cAccenture has worked according to the contract and met delivery requirements, and remains strongly committed to the success of KEES,\u201d Accenture spokesman Joe Dickie said via email.\n\nThe auditors estimate that the KEES project will end up about $46 million over budget, but the federal government is expected to shoulder most of those costs as well.\n\nThe state has renegotiated some of the terms of the ongoing maintenance contract. When asked if Accenture would continue on the project, Belfry seemed to signal no change was imminent.\n\n\u201cAccenture has been a good partner to work with while implementing this complex and innovative IT system,\u201d she said. \u201cKDHE, DCF and Accenture are committed to the success of KEES.\u201d\n\nWoerman said that based on the workaround documents, the system appears to have some technical problems, but most of the workarounds are meant to address what he called \u201cbusiness rules.\u201d That is, the system may be working as designed from an information technology standpoint, but the design did not seamlessly integrate the complex Kansas Medicaid eligibility regulations.\n\n\u201cThese are very, very complex systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business rules are massive.\u201d\n\nWoerman worked on an insureks.org website that helped consumers estimate how much of a tax credit they might be eligible for on the Affordable Care Act federal Healthcare.gov marketplace. He said the problems with KEES put into context the issues that hopelessly bogged down the federal exchange when it first went live.\n\n\u201cThis is strikingly similar to what they were dealing with,\u201d Woerman said, \u201cand the big difference here is you have state employees who don\u2019t have the same recourse for raising the issues.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
