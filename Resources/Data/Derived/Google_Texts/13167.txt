— On Easter Sunday, parishioners at Saint Joseph’s Episcopal Church have a new understanding of resurrection and rebirth.

The historic Fayetteville church sustained water and smoke damage after fire spread through part of the building last month. Firefighters said it was a miracle they were able to save 85 percent of the church, which was built in 1896.

After the fire, which was ruled accidental, members of Saint Paul’s in the Pines Episcopal Church invited St. Joseph’s members to Easter service.

“I won’t ever forget this,” said Rev. Teddra Smith, St. Joseph’s pastor. “Even when we go back in, it's like the scriptures have really come alive and sometimes God uses the experiences in our life to make it come alive.”

Smith saw Sunday’s service as something that was meant to be.

“I know that God has his hand in doing something more than we can ever imagine that he's doing, but I think the first thing that he's doing is bringing us all together like he should be,” he said.

St. Joseph’s members like Donald LaHuffman were excited about the joint service.

“It's a period of enthusiasm in keeping with the Easter season of resurrection and new birth, so we will rise again and we will make our church better,” he said.
