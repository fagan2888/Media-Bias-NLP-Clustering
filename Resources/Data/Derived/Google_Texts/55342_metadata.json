It will be part of Village at the Peaks. ( Johnnie St. Vrain / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nJohnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.\n\nI looked at the Village at the Peaks website, and it wasn't clear if that building will be reused as part of the new development. Or are they going to blow it up on live TV or something befitting the whole Dillard's fiasco? \u2014 Demolition Spotter\n\nDemolition Spotter: As you might already know, the developer has repurposed and is recycling many of the materials from the old mall. One of repurposed parts of the mall is that building.\n\nThe one building that held up the process of the redevelopment is the one that will remain standing as part of the new Village at the Peaks.\n\nDillard's moved out of that building as the mall closed. Alan Ginsborg, principal director of developer NewMark Merrill Mountain States, said that in the new shopping center, it will house Gold's Gym and Sports Authority, among other tenants.\n\nAnd how is the work coming?\n\n\"So far, so well,\" Ginsborg said. \"But for weather days, construction is proceeding more or less as we anticipated. We are very much focused on having our opening at the beginning of the fall.\"\n\nSend questions to johnnie@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_26951735/johnnie-st-vrain-mall-is-gone-but-dillards", "modificationDate": "2014-11-17T10:41:05-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1116/20141116__17TCAJSV~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-11-16T21:50:57-0700", "description": "Johnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26951735:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-16T21:50:57-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_26951735/johnnie-st-vrain-mall-is-gone-but-dillards", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1116/20141116__17TCAJSV~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Johnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Mall is gone, but Dillard's building will live on"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Johnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Mall is gone, but Dillard's building will live on", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_26951735/johnnie-st-vrain-mall-is-gone-but-dillards", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1116/20141116__17TCAJSV~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-16T21:50:57-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Mall is gone, but Dillard's building will live on", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1116/20141116__17TCAJSV~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-11-16T21:52:24-0700"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd50\"", "article_summary": "The old Dillard's store is the lone remaining part of Twin Peaks Mall.\n( Johnnie St. Vrain / Longmont Times-Call )Johnnie: Now that almost all of the Twin Peaks Mall has been leveled, I notice that one of the Dillard's buildings is still standing and doesn't appear to be part of the demolition project.\n\u2014 Demolition SpotterDemolition Spotter: As you might already know, the developer has repurposed and is recycling many of the materials from the old mall.\nDillard's moved out of that building as the mall closed.\nOr are they going to blow it up on live TV or something befitting the whole Dillard's fiasco?"}
