He\u2019s in the lap of luxury, his own Boeing 747, and in Kenya his brother is living in a hut. You want to talk about income inequality? Barack Obama has family members living on less than a dollar a day, one of them in a six-by-nine-foot hut. \u2026 That\u2019s income inequality, wealth inequality\u201d (Free audio).\n\nAfter decades on the air, Limbaugh remains a powerful force in talk radio, so much so that his show is shifted to struggling stations to help turn their fortunes around. In a major shakeup, Clear Channel will be switching stations in three of its biggest markets over to conservative talk in January, with Limbaugh\u2019s program serving as the anchor.\n\nMichael Savage\n\nDr. Savage declared that \u201cin a sane country, [Facebook founder] Mark Zuckerberg would be under arrest\u201d for aiding and abetting illegal aliens. The Silicon Valley billionaire is one of many wealthy Americans pressuring Congress to pass an amnesty bill, Savage said, in order to keep wages down (Free audio).\n\nHowever, unlike many other conservative talk show hosts, Savage is not entirely opposed to raising the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cTimes have changed,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cTeenagers aren\u2019t the only ones working minimum wage jobs anymore. Today they don\u2019t work at all. They all either have bipolar disorder or gender identity issues and stay home sucking their thumbs.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, Savage added that the unions pushing for this wage increase are exploiting the workers they pretend to care so much about. Instead, \u201cthe unions just want to fatten their leaders\u2019 pensions and pockets\u201d (Free audio).\n\nAaron Klein\n\nDuring a time when major news organizations select their \u201cnewsmakers of the year,\u201d Klein invited listeners to vote for the \u201cWorst Person of 2013\u201d: the person who\u2019s done the most damage to the United States during the last 12 months.\n\nHe also explores the previously unheard of connection between \u201cglobal warming\u201d and Obamacare, then talks about explosive new revelations about what was going on at the Benghazi compound just before the attack. Finally, Klein reveals David Axelrod\u2019s shocking plans for Israel\u2019s Temple Mount (Free audio).\n\nLaura Ingraham\n\nThis week, Ingraham\u2019s guests include Congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner and Mo Brook talking about America\u2019s descent into \u201ca surveillance society\u201d and the security flaws built into the Obamacare website (Free audio).\n\nTexas Congressman Ted Poe also joined Laura to talk about the latest developments on the amnesty front. Poe says he is \u201cnot one of those people who supports a pathway to citizenship.\u201d\n\nMark Levin\n\nLevin came under fire from MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews this week. Matthews made the bizarre claim that Levin had compared Obamacare supporters to Nazi storm troopers \u2013 a blatant misrepresentation of Levin\u2019s description of the president\u2019s public appearances as \u201cpropaganda\u201d (Free audio).\n\n\u201cThe way you unleash prosperity is to embrace prosperity,\u201d Levin declared later this week, whereas \u201cObamacare is about redistributing wealth\u201d (Free audio).\n\nGlenn Beck\n\nBeck recommended two books to his listeners, both designed to inspire and elevate.\n\nHe recommended \u201ca book you can read in an hour that will change your life,\u201d the 1902 \u201cself-help\u201d classic \u201cAs a Man Thinketh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is power in words,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThere is power in ideas. Real power. The right words lift up. The wrong words destroy you. May I urge that if you have never read \u2018As a Man Thinketh,\u2019 please do\u201d (Free audio).\n\nBeck also read a poem by 19th century novelist Josiah Gilbert Holland entitled \u201cGive Us Men.\u201d It is featured in a recently released anthology called \u201cMansfield\u2019s Book of Manly Men: An Utterly Invigorating Guide to Being Your Most Masculine Self,\u201d by Stephen Mansfield.\n\n\u201cI think this is a game-changing book,\u201d Beck said. \u201c[A] really, really powerful book. \u2026 It is time to be a man, and stop waiting around for, you know, the icon man to drop out of the sky and show you how to be a better dad \u2026 show you how to be a man.
