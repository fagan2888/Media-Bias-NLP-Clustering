Representative Virginia Foxx will face a primary challenge in 2016. Pattie Curran announced this week that she will enter the race for the 5th District seat.

Curran is a Tea Party affiliate and will be making her first run for public office. She says she chose the Fifth District race because it’s the best place for her to make a difference.

"Because I feel like a lot of our problems are coming from a federal government that is overreaching and too intrusive in our daily lives," she says.

Curran says she has supported Foxx in the past but has been disappointed that she hasn’t done more to stand up against such federal policies as Obamacare.

Foxx has held the seat since 2004, when she won the GOP primary in a runoff and went on to win the general election. Since then no one has come close to unseating her. Last year, she was re-elected with about 60 percent of the vote over Democrat Josh Brannon.

Foxx could not be reached for comment.
