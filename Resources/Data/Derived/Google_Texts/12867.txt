Liberal billionaire George Soros invested $234 million in a leading U.S. energy company during the second quarter of 2014, as that company revamped its portfolio to align more closely with Obama administration energy policies.

Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that Soros bought 5.1 million shares of CONSOL Energy last quarter.

CONSOL is a leading coal and natural gas producer, but it sold off about half of its coal assets late last year.

The administration has made it a goal to “crucify” U.S. coal producers, and many companies are blaming onerous Environmental Protection Agency regulations for the industry’s decline.

As news of Soros’ equity stake broke on Thursday, the Department of Energy was announcing that it would ease restrictions on U.S. natural gas exports, a move that is widely expected to raise prices by increasing global demand for U.S. gas.

The Obama administration supports natural gas development, touting the need for such development in its overarching Climate Action Plan last year.
