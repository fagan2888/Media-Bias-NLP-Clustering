Norwood Davis, owner of N C Davis Insurance, prepares to launch his mobile Obamacare Enrollment Center in the upcoming days serving the citizens in the Jacksonville Florida Metro Area.

Mr. Davis, who is primarily a virtual insurance agent, got an epiphany after looking at the low Enrollment numbers in some underserved areas in the city of Jacksonville and after deciding that he would empower the people through educating them about insurance and the impact that having it has on our health, wealth, and our future generations.

In fact, Mr. Davis plans to speak at any church or civic organization in order to help the people learn more about insurance. He believes that his mobile unit is the only one of its kind in the South East and possibly on the East Coast. He believes that personalizing Obamacare /ACA Enrollment through his Community Outreach Program will prompt more people to Enroll. Davis contends, “People want someone to genuinely care for them and to guide them through the process …not to treat them like a number”. Mr. Davis, who attended Elizabeth State University and East Carolina University has been an Insurance Agent since 2001. Please visit his website at
