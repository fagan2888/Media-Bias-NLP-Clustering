Clark County residents who purchase individual health plans will likely have more insurers to choose from when open enrollment begins this fall.

Eight insurers have submitted applications to provide as many as 150 health plans in Clark County — both inside and outside of the state-based insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder. That includes five insurers currently offering plans in Clark County and three new insurers — Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon, Time Insurance Company and UnitedHealthcare of Washington, according to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner.

Community Health Plan of Washington, which currently offers three plans in Clark County, did not include Clark County in its coverage area for 2016.

Statewide, 17 insurers filed 246 individual plans and requested an average rate change of 5.4 percent — the lowest requested average rate change in eight years, according to the insurance commissioner’s office.

Thirteen of the 17 insurers filed 188 plans for sale inside the exchange, where eligible people can receive tax subsidies to help cover the cost of coverage. Currently, 10 insurers offer 90 plans in the exchange.

Eleven of the 17 insurers have filed all new plans, which means they’ve made substantial changes to provider networks, service areas, cost-sharing or benefits. As such, new plans are not included in the average requested rate change.

Three of the eight insurers that applied to provide plans in Clark County reported rate changes ranging from a 10 percent decrease to a 19 percent increase. The rest of the insurers filed new plans.

“I’m pleased to see the health insurers show an increased interest in the individual market and to see rates continue to come in relatively low,” Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a news release. “We will review each proposed rate and plan change very carefully. It’s on the health insurers to justify any rate change and they know our review will be thorough and complete.”

The insurance commissioner’s office will review the plans within 60 days. The exchange board is scheduled to certify all plans for sale in the exchange on Aug. 27. All other plans for sale outside of the exchange will be approved by Nov. 1, when open enrollment begins.
