So the number "13" apparently is bad luck for Obamacare, too.

Federal officials on Monday sought to lower expectations for upcoming enrollment in Obamacare, announcing that they now believe that only between 9 million and 9.9 million people will be enrolled in Affordable Care Act health insurance plans by the end of 2015.

That is well below the 13 million people that the Congressional Budget Office has projected for Obamacare enrollment by the end of 2015. Open enrollment for 2015 plans resumes Saturday.

The new projection, as much as 30 percent reduced from the CBO estimate, comes from the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the Obamacare health reform program.

HHS also said it now appears that it will take longer—perhaps quite a bit longer—than 2017 to reach a "steady state" of 25 million Obamacare enrollees that CBO had been projecting for 2017 enrollment.

The reduced projection is due to recent data showing "mixed evidence" about how quickly—and how dramatically—people will shift from employer-sponsored health insurance and non-Obamacare plans into insurance plans sold on government-run marketplaces such as HealthCare.gov, according to HHS.

HHS noted that the Congressional Budget Office had assumed there would be "significant shifts over three years" from people in employer insurance and in so-called "off-Marketplace" individual plans.
