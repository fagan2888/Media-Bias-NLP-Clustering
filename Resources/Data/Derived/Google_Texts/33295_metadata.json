The amount requested is approximately $7.2 million more than what is appropriated already.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDPI\u2019s budget indicates that the cost of administering the SBAC exam has increased from $26 to $33.64 per student. The costs will cover 62,500 students in grades three, four, and eight, including students attending private schools that have agreed to accept school choice vouchers and, consequently, are now required to submit to the state assessments.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re dealing with is actual numbers versus estimates,\u201d said Luci Willits, deputy director of SBAC, one of the two federally funded test consortia that are developing assessments aligned with the Common Core standards.\n\nWisconsin pays $1.9 million per year to belong to SBAC.\n\nWhen SBAC was launched, nearly 30 states were on board to use the interstate assessments, but that number has dropped to 21 as more Americans have learned about the Common Core standards, the aligned assessments, and the student data collection.\n\nWisconsin education officials believe one of the reasons the costs of the test are increasing is because more states are abandoning the consortium. Willits, however, said decreasing member states is not a factor.\n\n\u201cWhen the consortium started four years ago, there would be certain estimates about what it would cost between the consortium and vendors in terms of delivery and that\u2019s what I think Wisconsin is dealing with \u2014 now that they have actual numbers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Journal report indicates that the final cost for the tests could increase or decrease since the budget request is based on an \u201cintent agreement\u201d between DPI and Educational Testing Service (ETS), the test\u2019s vendor. Gov. Scott Walker (R) is reportedly reviewing the budget request.\n\nSimilar to states that have \u201crebranded\u201d the Common Core standards and tests, Wisconsin renamed the Smarter Balanced test \u201cThe Badger Exam.\u201d\n\nThe state legislature is currently considering a measure that allows school districts to assess their students with tests other than those aligned with the Common Core standards.\n\nBreitbart News reported last July that Walker was urging state lawmakers to pass a bill that would repeal the Common Core standards. According to the Journal, however, while the Governor \u201chas repeatedly expressed a distaste for the Common Core standards,\u201d he has pulled back from calling for a repeal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Testing WI students with the new assessments of Common Core standards is expected to cost at least $7.2 million over the original estimate.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Testing WI students with the new assessments of Common Core standards is expected to cost at least $7.2 million over the original estimate.", "title": "Common Core Tests to Cost Millions More than Expected in Wisconsin - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/standardized-testing-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/19/common-core-tests-to-cost-millions-more-than-expected-in-wisconsin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Testing WI students with the new assessments of Common Core standards is expected to cost at least $7.2 million over the original estimate.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/standardized-testing-AP.jpg", "title": "Common Core Tests to Cost Millions More than Expected in Wisconsin - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, Gov.
