The MAGI used to calculate Cover Oregon tax credits differs from the MAGI you\u2019ll find when you search for the term on the IRS.gov website or on TurboTax\u2019s site for that matter.\n\nIn fact, MAGI for calculating insurance premium tax credits even differs from the MAGI you calculate to determine the penalty you could face for not getting health insurance. That's right: Health reform has introduced two new MAGIs.\n\nOh Maggie I couldn\u2019t have tried anymore\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with AGI \u2013 adjusted gross income. That\u2019s the figure you find on the last line of the front page of Form 1040 and Form 1040A and on Line 4 of Form 1040EZ.\n\nMAGI requires that you to add back some income items that you\u2019d originally subtracted to get your AGI. But the add-backs differ depending on which tax break you\u2019re looking at.\n\nOh Maggie I wish I\u2019d never seen your face\n\nMAGI in the Affordable Care Act is not the MAGI used to figure out whether you make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA. It's also not the MAGI used on Form 8582 to calculate passive activity loss limits for landlords.\n\nTo calculate your MAGI for the premium tax credits, find the sum of:\n\nYour adjusted gross income from Form 1040 + any tax-exempt interest you earned (Line 8b on Form 1040) + any foreign earned income and housing expenses (Form 2555) + any untaxed Social Security benefits plus (Line 20a \u2013 Line 20b on Form 1040) + the modified adjusted gross income reported by any dependents you claim in your household that are required to file a tax return. This could be your live-in adult child or a working relative whom you claim as a dependent for tax purposes. Even an unrelated person living with you for whom you provided at least half their support and who grossed less than $3,800 last year can be a dependent.\n\nTo get your MAGI for calculating your \u201cshared responsibility\u201d penalty for not getting health insurance:\n\nDo the same calculation above EXCEPT - don\u2019t add in any untaxed Social Security income\n\nWhich means I instructed wise readers incorrectly in my post this week about the penalty.\n\nYou made a first-class fool out of me\n\nBut I\u2019m blind as a fool can be\n\nWhy is this any of this important?\n\nIf you have significant foreign earnings or income from tax-free municipal bonds, knowing this calculation could be the difference in determining your credits. It could help you from over-estimating credits and having to pay them back when you file your 2014 tax return.\n\nThat\u2019s the importance of health reform\u2019s MAGIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou stole my heart but I love you anyway\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,cover oregon,health reform,magi,tax credits,taxes", "title": "What is modified adjusted gross income -- MAGI -- for health insurance tax credits?", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"What is modified adjusted gross income -- MAGI -- for health insurance tax credits?\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/finance/index.ssf/2013/11/how_to_find_magi_-_modified_ad.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/finance/photo/-rod-stewartjpg-5a2fbd4541ee3dbd.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11681632\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-21T13:22:04Z\", \"author\": \"Brent Hunsberger | For The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@business\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"affordable care act\",\"cover oregon\",\"health reform\",\"magi\",\"tax credits\",\"taxes\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/finance/photo/13810285-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@onlymoney", "site": "@oregonlive", "card": "summary", "description": "The tax code now has (at least) three kinds of MAGI.
