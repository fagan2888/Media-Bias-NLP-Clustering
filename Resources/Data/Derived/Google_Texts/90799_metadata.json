The whistleblower said there were 25,000 more files on a database.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, the stolen data is worth millions on the black market because it allows rogue brokers to target people in investment scams.\n\nBarclays thanked the Mail on Sunday for bringing the data leak to its attention.\n\n\"Protecting our customers' data is a top priority and we take this issue extremely seriously,\" Barclays said in its statement.\n\n\"We would like to reassure all of our customers that we have taken every practical measure to ensure that personal and financial details remain as safe and secure as possible.\"\n\nBarclays has been trying to rebuild its reputation after becoming the first bank fined for its part in a global scam to manipulate Libor benchmark interest rates in 2012. The Libor scandal led to the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah Young.
