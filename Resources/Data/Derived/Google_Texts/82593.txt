DENVER — A Denver Sheriff’s deputy died Saturday, two days after he was severely injured in a motorcycle crash near Littleton.

Deputy Anthony Petranilli, 53, was riding his motorcycle on Santa Fe Drive, just south of C-470 Thursday afternoon when he collided with another vehicle, the sheriff’s department confirmed.

He was not on duty at the time of the crash.

Deputy “Petro” Petranilli was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and underwent surgery, officials said.

Petranilli died at 9:28 p.m. Saturday night after a decision was made to take him off life support, a news release said.

“Petro was a good officer and a loving father,” the Denver Sheriff’s Department said in a news release. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this time.”

The cause of the crash is still being investigated.

The Colorado State Patrol is looking into whether the traffic lights changed due to an approaching ambulance, according to Trooper Nate Reid.

Petranilli served the department for 19 years and worked at the County Jail on Smith Road.

Petranilli is survived by a 17-year-old son. Funeral arrangements are pending.
