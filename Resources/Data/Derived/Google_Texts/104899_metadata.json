They can disrupt targets non-lethally, making them increasingly tantalizing to the defense industry.\n\nA powerful fiber-optic laser system in development by Lockheed Martin is showing a lot of promise. In its first field test it disabled a small truck from well over a mile away, the company announced this week. Called ATHENA \u2014 short for Advanced Test High Energy Asset \u2014 the system is being built to protect military forces and infrastructure.\n\nRelated: This Is the Laser That Can Take Out ISIS\n\nATHENA burned through the small truck\u2019s engine with pinpoint precision. The truck wasn\u2019t driving normally but was propped up on a platform with its engine running for the test, Lockheed said. Nonetheless, it\u2019s apparently the highest power documented by a laser weapon of its kind.\n\n\u201cFiber-optic lasers are revolutionizing directed energy systems,\u201d Lockheed\u2019s chief technology officer, Keoki Jackson, said in a statement. \u201cThis test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks.\u201d\n\nATHENA uses a technique called \u201cspectral beam combining\u201d in which multiple laser modules together form a single high-quality beam. The technology is based on Lockheed\u2019s earlier $32 million ADAM (Area Defense Anti-Munitions) system, built to shoot down enemy rockets in mid-air. Other companies, including Boeing, have also been working on laser systems.\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\nThe cost effectiveness of using lasers is part of their appeal, aside from their accuracy and precision. While firing a surface-to-air missile costs roughly $400,000 a pop, say Navy accountants, consider this: The Navy\u2019s experimental laser LaWS (Laser Weapons System), which has been tested with success aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf and is authorized for use in self defense, costs a mere 59 cents a shot to deploy.\n\nAs for ATHENA laser\u2019s strength, an everyday pointer laser is about one milliwatt. ATHENA\u2019s 30-kilowatt laser is about 30 million times that.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With their great range and accuracy, laser weapons don\u2019t just destroy things.", "title": "This Lethal Laser Could Cripple ISIS and Other Enemies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/08/Lethal-Laser-Could-Cripple-ISIS-and-Other-Enemies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07292014_laser_pointer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/08/Lethal-Laser-Could-Cripple-ISIS-and-Other-Enemies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07292014_laser_pointer.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With their great range and accuracy, laser weapons don\u2019t just destroy things.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0913\"", "article_summary": "A powerful fiber-optic laser system in development by Lockheed Martin is showing a lot of promise.\nWith their great range and accuracy, laser weapons don\u2019t just destroy things.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s apparently the highest power documented by a laser weapon of its kind.\nRelated: This Is the Laser That Can Take Out ISISATHENA burned through the small truck\u2019s engine with pinpoint precision.\n\u201cThis test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks.\u201dATHENA uses a technique called \u201cspectral beam combining\u201d in which multiple laser modules together form a single high-quality beam."}
