It\u2019s easy to predict what they will say or what they said even without watching; they\u2019ll call for border fences, an end to affordable healthcare, and blast the man beneath the toupee for his racist and misogynistic statements. But if they want to really set themselves apart from the conservative mass (and perhaps win themselves the nomination), they only need to do one simple thing: call for climate action.\n\nThe Science Is Clear\n\nThe argument that climate science is wrong or too alarmist is so 2012 (although, it was even outdated then). The evidence that climate change is happening now is overwhelming. Cartographers have redrawn maps to reflect the melting arctic and disappearing coastlines of Alaska and Louisiana. Weather patterns are noticeably different. The U.S. Department of Defense is amping up its presence in previously ice-blocked areas.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s just plain ridiculous that Ben Carson, the only Republican within striking distance of frontrunner Trump, questioned climate science at an event in San Francisco last week. \u201cI know there are a lot of people who say \u2018overwhelming science,\u2019 but then when you ask them to show the overwhelming science, they can never show it,\u201d Carson told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThere is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are man-caused and not naturally caused.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown immediately called Carson\u2019s bluff. He called the presidential candidate a \u201cscience denier\u201d and sent Carson a computer flash drive containing the entire United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. His letter accompanying the flash drive didn\u2019t hide his disgust with Carson\u2019s ignorance:\n\n\u201cThis is just one of the thousands of reports authored by the world\u2019s top scientists on the subject, including a study published just last month by Columbia University, University of Idaho and NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientists that found climate has intensified California\u2019s drought. These aren\u2019t just words. The consequences are real.\u201d\n\nRepublican candidates can continue pretending climate science isn\u2019t real. They can also pretend the sky is red and the ocean is yellow. But the people may want a president who\u2019s a little more grounded in reality.\n\nThe People Want It\n\nPeople want a president who will do something about climate change. According to a poll conducted earlier this year by The New York Times, Stanford University, and the nonpartisan environmental research group Resources for the Future, an overwhelming majority of the American public, including half of Republicans, support action to curb climate change.\n\nIn March 2015, the Yale and George Mason found that a solid majority of Americans \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Specifically, seven in ten Americans (70%) \u201csupport setting strict carbon dioxide emission limits on existing coal-fired plants to reduce global warming and improve public health, even though the cost of electricity would likely increase.\u201d Most Americans also support policies to increase renewable energy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just liberal tree huggers who are calling for climate action. Conservative Christians also believe the government should do more to protect the environment. In a new report published by the Public Religion Research Institute, more than seven in ten (73%) Catholics believe the U.S. government should do more to address climate change. And the Center for American Progress found that a majority of Protestants believe \u201cresponding to climate threats will help \u2018avoid more serious economic problems in the future.'\u201d\n\nReligion Mandates It\n\nThe growing concern among people of faith is a product of the growing environmental movement in religious communities.\n\nPope Francis\u2019s call for climate action, as seen in his recently released environmental encyclical, has set fire to an environmental ethos that has been brewing in congregations and religious organizations for decades. Christian religious leaders have repeatedly advocated for action on climate change, divestment from fossil fuels, access to clean drinking water and air, and the protection of species. When a small, Presbyterian church in West Virginia, one of America\u2019s biggest coal states, went solar, the pastor made the case for the religious responsibility to honor the environment.\n\n\u201cThe earth and its wondrous web of life is clearly not of our making,\u201d said Randy Tremba, pastor of Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift and we know it. Or should. It\u2019s our job to sing its praises, photograph its wonders, and treat it with the utmost gratitude and respect. It is sacred. Every step we take is on holy ground.\u201d\n\nThe growing Christian environmental movement is not something Republican politicians should ignore. After the 2014 mid-term elections, Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition released a poll showing that conservative Christians represented a third of the electorate and over half of total Republican voters. \u201cThis is not only the largest single constituency in the electorate,\u201d Reed said, \u201cbut it is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, the union vote, and the gay vote combined.\u201d\n\nIf politicians like Jeb Bush continue to ignore their pope and their electorate by not taking climate action, Republican voters may begin to wonder just who they actually represent.\n\nIt\u2019s Time for a Change\n\nA leadership vote within Australia\u2019s ruling Liberal Party recently led to the controversial Prime Minister Tony Abbott being replaced by his rival Malcom Turnbull. Abbott, famous for his opposition to climate action, differs significantly from Turnbull when it comes to the environment. In 2009, Turnbull described Abbott\u2019s climate policies as \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, the same thing is happening. The country\u2019s prime minister, Stephen Harper floated the idea of a \u201cconservative alliance among \u2018like-minded countries\u2019 to work against global climate-change efforts proposed by the Obama administration.'\u201d And now Harper has to atone for his anti-environmental policies in a tough election. People across Canada are crashing campaign events of all the major political party leaders to demand answers on the climate.\n\nThe time to scoff away climate change as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201calarmist\u201d is over. It\u2019s happening and Americans \u2014 even Christian conservatives \u2014 want their leaders to take action. Republican presidential candidates can continue to blow off the issue as they have done in the past. But if they actually want to steal some of Trump\u2019s glory (and headlines), it\u2019s time for a change.\n\nKeep up to date with all the eco-spirituality news here on EdenKeeper.
