For the most part, it uses clips of Crist\u2019s own contradictory comments before concluding, \"That\u2019s flippin\u2019 nuts\" and \"Charlie Crist, typical flippin\u2019 politician.\"\n\nCrist, a former Florida governor and once a Republican, is now a Democrat. He's taking on incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Polls have been close with a slight edge for Scott.\n\nCrist as flip-flopper isn\u2019t a new political attack, and it\u2019s up to voters to decide whether his many changes of position are sincere or cynical. Many -- but not all -- seem to track with his change of party from Republican to Democrat.\n\nAs for the ad\u2019s substance, it\u2019s on solid ground for saying that Crist has changed positions on two issues and gets partial credit for the other two.\n\nWe\u2019ll compare the ad\u2019s claims with what PolitiFact Florida has found about Crist changing positions over the years.\n\nOn party affiliation\n\nThe ad shows video of Crist saying that he is a Republican, an independent and a Democrat. Crist\u2019s changes of party are well documented. In March 2010, Crist said he intended to run for the U.S. Senate and ruled out running as an independent. That rated a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter after he declared he was running as an independent on April 29, 2010. Crist still lost the election to Republican Marco Rubio of Miami. (The Democrat was U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek of Miami.)\n\nAfter the Senate loss, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012 and delivered a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention . Months later, he formally became a Democrat, revealing the switch at a Christmas party at the White House.\n\nOn the health care law\n\nVideo shows Crist saying the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, needs to be repealed, then calling it \"great.\"\n\nCrist is now a strong supporter of the health care law. But he hasn\u2019t always been that way.\n\nIn the 2010 Senate race, Rubio charged that Crist had taken six different positions on health care. Back then, we rated Rubio\u2019s statement Half True , because we counted only three different positions, not six.\n\nAt one point, Crist said he opposed the law and wanted to repeal it, then he said he would have voted for the law, and then he said he wanted to modify the law.\n\nIn a March 2014 interview with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley, Crist said the law was \"great\" and that Democratic candidates should be more vocal in supporting the law. \"They ought to strengthen up,\" he said. \"The president's a smart guy and he's doing the right thing, and God bless him for it.\"\n\nOn the Flip-O-Meter, we rated Crist\u2019s position a Full Flop.\n\nOn the economic stimulus\n\nBack in 2009 when he was still Florida governor, Crist supported the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The law pumped $787 billion into a sputtering economy after the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nCrist was one of 19 governors who wrote Obama on Feb. 3, 2009, in support of the stimulus. \"As stewards of the economies of our respective states and regions, we urge the Congress to reach prompt resolution of all outstanding differences and you to sign the bill when it reaches your desk,\" the letter said.\n\nCrist then edged away from that support when he was competing to win the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. \"You know, unfortunately, the president thinks that everything we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money and that's just wrong,\" he said.\n\nCrist also tried to disavow his earlier support for the stimulus, saying \"I didn\u2019t endorse it.\" Because the evidence clearly contradicted that, PolitiFact Florida rated his statement Pants on Fire .\n\nThroughout all of that, though, he spoke positively about the stimulus preventing teacher layoffs. \"We would have had to let go of over 20,000 schoolteachers in Florida if we hadn't had that support,\" he said in 2010. Today, he also talks of saving the jobs of 20,000 school teachers thanks to his acceptance of the stimulus. So he seems to like it again. We rated his change a Half Flip .\n\nOn abortion\n\nCrist\u2019s positions on abortion have always been consistently contradictory, according to an extensive review of his public comments by PolitiFact Florida. His website now says he \"supports a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions.\"\n\nOver the years, Crist has called himself \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice\" at different points, and he now says he is both. He often -- but not always -- talked about being personally \"pro-life\" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors.\n\nHis stances on particular abortion laws have been more telling. He has backed restrictions such as a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. But he has also rejected a waiting period for adults and has said he doesn\u2019t want to overturn Roe vs. Wade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new ad with an old complaint against Charlie Crist calls it &quot;flippin&rsquo; unbelievable&quot; -- then recounts how Crist has flip-flopped on, well, many things.
