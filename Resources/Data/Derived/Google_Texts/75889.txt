The Trump Apocalypse Watch is a subjective daily estimate, using a scale of one to four horsemen, of how likely it is that Donald Trump will be elected president, thus triggering an apocalypse in which we all die.

That's a lot of action. The nation's attention is squarely fixated on Trump right now, for sure. But I have to say I agree with my colleague Josh Voorhees: When you consider the current state of the economy, the relative popularity of the Democratic incumbent, the current head-to-head polling, and Trump's reputation with the general public, it's still Hillary Clinton's race to lose. I hope!
