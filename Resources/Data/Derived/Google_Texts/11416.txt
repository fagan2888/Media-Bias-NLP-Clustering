A fire at a Fort Worth apartment complex displaced residents and injured one person Sunday afternoon, officials said.

Firefighters were called to the Sandshell at Fossil Creek complex in the 5700 block of Sandshell Drive, near Fossil Creek Boulevard and Interstate 35W, at 4:38 p.m.

The two-alarm fire was under control after about 30 minutes, fire department spokesman Kyle Falkner said.

One person was burned but was treated at the scene. The injury is not considered to be life-threatening, he said.

Sixteen units in the complex had significant fire and water damage and two more in an adjacent building had minor damage. Only one of the 18 affected units was unoccupied, Falkner said.

The Red Cross is on scene to assist those displaced by the fire.

Firefighters also rescued a puppy and two cats from the apartments. They are in good health and were returned to their owners.
