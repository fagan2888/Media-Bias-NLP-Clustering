Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, Murder, National security, president, Soviet Union, Warren Commission, Politics News\n\nEvery year, without fail, the president dies all over again. For a few days every autumn, the entire media is overwhelmed by those haunting photos from Dallas. Those cruelly happy and innocent pictures of a young president smiling and waving at bystanders, the first lady clutching a bouquet of roses. With their soft, prelapsarian colors, they seem to hail from another universe\u2014one that has been stolen from us.\n\nPerhaps it is that feeling of loss that explains the lingering sense of grief over John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination year after year, when the anniversaries of other, equally shocking events\u2014from Pearl Harbor to 9/11\u2014are generally quieter affairs. But there is also something unfinished about Kennedy\u2019s death, a lingering suspicion that no one has ever been able to banish.\n\nFor the public has never embraced the official verdict, handed down by the Warren Commission in September 1964. After less than a year of hearings and deliberations, the team\u2014led by Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2014concluded that President Kennedy had been shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old ex-Marine portrayed by the Commission as a shiftless loner with communist sympathies. But they could not explain why.\n\nThe most obvious question about the murder was also the one that could not be answered. Not only had Oswald been murdered in police custody two days after the assassination, but the Commission had been unable to find a single person who remembered Oswald criticizing Kennedy. On the contrary, Oswald had frequently expressed his admiration for the president. The Commission interviewed at least six witnesses who remembered Oswald praising Kennedy.\n\nFaced with a substantial hole in their case, the Commission tried to plug it by filling the report with airy speculation about Oswald\u2019s tormented psyche. Oswald, they insisted, was someone who had been driven by \u201cresentment of all authority,\u201d \u201cantagonism toward the United States\u201d and an \u201curge to try to find a place in history.\u201d Perhaps he had shot the president, the Report blandly suggested, because of his \u201cinability to enter into meaningful relationships with people.\u201d\n\nBut this conclusion was not reached in a vacuum. From the moment it was established, the Warren Commission was under tremendous pressure to calm a hysterical public and quash the widespread rumors of a conspiracy that exploded across the country in the days following the public killing of the president\u2019s accused assassin. As Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach put it in a memo written hours after Oswald\u2019s death, \u201cWe need something to head off public speculation or Congressional hearings of the wrong sort.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cspeculation\u201d never went away. In 1966, the first national poll taken on the subject found that 46 percent of Americans believed that JFK had been struck down by a plot. Last year, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 62 percent of the public rejected the idea that a single man had killed the president.\n\nThe Post reported this development with a palpable sense of bafflement, for the mainstream media has always treated skeptics of the official account with impatience, even scorn. For them, the Kennedy case was cracked and closed long ago. Last year, Jill Abramson blithely informed readers of The New York Times that \u201cthe historical consensus seems to have settled on Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone assassin,\u201d dismissing the wealth of information about the assassination that can be found online as \u201cunfiltered and at times unhinged musings.\u201d\n\nAs far as the vast majority of the American press is concerned, critics of the Warren Commission are in a class with the paranoids who doubt that the moon landing occurred, that President Obama was born in the United States, or that al Qaeda was responsible for the 2001 terrorist attacks. They insist, as Adam Gopnik did in a meandering New Yorker essay last year, \u201cthat the evidence that the American security services gathered, within the first hours and weeks and months, to persuade the world of the sole guilt of Lee Harvey Oswald remains formidable,\u201d and that anyone who differs with this assessment is an \u201cobsessive\u201d or a \u201cbuff\u201d with no life. Some defenders of the Warren verdict sound as passionate as any conspiracy theorists: Chris Matthews, an admirer of Kennedy, once told his audience that assassination skeptics cling to conspiracy theories \u201cbecause they cannot bear the suffering that truth brings to the heart and to the mind.\u201d\n\nIt can be shocking, after reading such dismissive remarks, to learn that some of the most powerful people in the United States expressed skepticism about the official account of JFK\u2019s death. John Kerry might have startled some people when he admitted last year that he entertained \u201cserious doubts\u201d about the Warren verdict, but he was far from the first member of the political establishment to say so.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, who commissioned the Warren Report, was never satisfied by its conclusions. \u201cI can\u2019t honestly say that I\u2019ve ever been completely relieved of the fact that there might have been international connections,\u201d he told Walter Cronkite in 1969, adding that Oswald was \u201ca mysterious fellow\u201d whose motivations remained uncertain. \u201cI never believed that Oswald acted alone, although I can accept that he pulled the trigger,\u201d he told another journalist in 1971. Senator Richard Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, disagreed with the final report, particularly the controversial claim that JFK and Texas Governor John Connally had been struck by the same bullet\u2014a conclusion that Connally himself doubted.\n\nWhile the Kennedy family has been guarded in its public statements on the subject, they privately expressed doubts that Oswald had acted alone. A week after the assassination, Robert and Jacqueline Kennedy sent a back-channel message to Soviet leaders, telling them that they believed that \u201cthe president was felled by domestic opponents.\u201d In 2013, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. revealed that his father had dismissed the Warren Report as \u201ca shoddy piece of craftsmanship.\u201d\n\nOther Washington bigwigs have given voice to similar suspicions. In his memoirs, former House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill recalled that JFK aides Kenneth O\u2019Donnell and Dave Powers\u2014both of whom had been riding in JFK\u2019s motorcade at the moment of the assassination\u2014once told him that they had heard two shots coming from the grassy knoll, across the street from where Oswald is alleged to have fired all of the shots. CIA Director John McCone told RFK that he believed two gunmen had been present in Dealey Plaza. In 1992, both Al Gore and Bill Clinton expressed guarded doubts that Oswald had acted alone.\n\nIn short, even as the media strained to portray the Warren Commission\u2019s verdict as unassailable, some of the most powerful figures in Washington, past and present, publicly and privately admitted that they found it hard to swallow. None of these people were flakes, none were easily fooled, and none could be considered \u201cobsessives\u201d or \u201cbuffs.\u201d Why did they feel, instinctively, that something was wrong in the Kennedy case?", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the 50th anniversary, so many questions remain.
