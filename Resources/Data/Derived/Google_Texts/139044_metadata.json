Steven Spielberg told the Associated Press that \u201cthere will be a time when the superhero movie goes the way of the Western.\u201d Uproxx translated that into a headline blaring that Spielberg \u201cThinks Superhero Movies Are About To Crash, Hard.\u201d Similarly, actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson had expressed extreme fatigue with the genre.\n\nAudiences may be getting weary of it, too. \u201cThe Fantastic Four\u201d was a disaster, ignored at the box office and trashed by critics. Marvel\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man\u201d drew only middling returns. And Disney apparently considered \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d a failure, despite its taking in $1.4 billion to rank as the second highest grossing picture of the year. The sequel got less than glowing reviews and made $200 million less than the first Avengers film.\n\nWith all of this negativity, the resurgence of the genre that began with, depending on who you ask, Sam Raimi\u2019s 2002 \u201cSpiderman\u201d or Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2006 \u201cBatman Begins\u201d is at least looking tired if not completely exhausted. But fans of the genre shouldn\u2019t start grieving just yet and detractors can hold off on the celebrations.\n\nRelated: The Future of Advertising: Everything, Everywhere, All the Time\n\nBefore we explain why, though, let\u2019s first acknowledge that Spielberg does have a point: Film has historically gone in cycles. The \u201840s had film noir, which sprang from post-war shellshock and a fear of liberated women. In the \u201850s, one of every four movies made was a Western. The \u201880s were known for both slasher films and big budget, high-concept action spectacles, which could be seen as the byproduct of the Reagan approach to the Cold War. The \u201890s had the Tarantino-inspired hipster-gangster films.\n\nOur particular moment will almost certainly be remembered as the age of the comic book hero, fueled by 9/11, the subsequent political atmosphere that it produced, and the ensuing financial crisis. We no longer believe our problems are fixable by mere mortals, and our institutions have failed too thoroughly to be our saviors (those responsible for the financial crisis, remain largely unpunished). We\u2019re all waiting for Superman.\n\nBut as a younger generation of moviegoers comes of age, with no real personal memory of 9/11, they can view this focus on the terrorist attack and its aftermath as somewhat overblown, in the same way Gen X-ers mocked Vietnam fixations. It is already clear that their outlook is less glum than that of their predecessors. The appetite for gritty reboots has been replaced by a desire to have a good time.\n\nRelated: The One Important Number Netflix Isn\u2019t Giving Out\n\nThere are a few factors, however, that will keep the superhero genre front and center for the foreseeable future, and will preserve it as a part of the entertainment world\u2019s DNA forever.\n\nFirst is the slate of films and television shows announced by Disney as it continues its fascinating effort at building out the Marvel universe, for better or worse, over the next few years. Remember that Disney paid $4 billion to buy Marvel in 2009, and it\u2019s going to keep looking for ways to maximize the return on that investment, including a new partnership with Sony to bring Spiderman into the fold. Cleverly, Marvel has also developed its properties for television, with \u201cMarvel\u2019s Agents of Shield\u201d and the quartet of Netflix shows that have begun rolling out, starting with the excellent (and definitely not for kids) \u201cMarvel\u2019s Daredevil.\u201d By having these shows exist in the same universe as, and be affected by the events of the larger movies, they function as a kind of commercial. To keep up, you need to watch them all. This is a trick that comic books, with their tie-ins and crossover issues, have been pulling for years.\n\nFor its part, DC Comics, has so far had real difficulty bringing its non-Batman characters to life on the big screen. Both attempts to reboot Superman were glum and disappointing, any attempt to bring Wonder Woman to life has died in production hell, and let\u2019s not even talk about \u201cGreen Lantern.\u201d The venerable old man of comics is making its best effort to keep up with the upcoming film \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d and an ongoing expansion of its television properties, including the CW\u2019s \u201cArrow.\u201d But the model works too well, and the interest in these characters is still strong enough, for anyone involved to simply drop these efforts altogether.\n\nHollywood has finally learned that comic readers are a fanatically loyal and voracious audience. Comic book sales in 2014 totaled $934 million, with $100 million of that in digital sales \u2014 not bad for a print industry in this day and age. And in many cases, these are characters and storylines that have been going on for nearly a century.\n\nRelated: The Long, Slow Death of Cable Just Reached a Tipping Point\n\nConsider the increasing prominence, and attendance, of most of the country\u2019s larger Comic Cons. As little as five years ago, you were unlikely to hear much entertainment reporting on the Cons. Now it\u2019s a mainstay of entertainment coverage and Hollywood knows an effective marketing tool when it sees one. Comic book fans, due to their rabid geeky loyalty, have been a giant boon for Hollywood, ensuring the success of movies when the industry overall is struggling to fill seats and suffering from diminishing returns. The general public may tire of the comic book movies, but as long as the loyal (and ever-increasing) army of the faithful keeps attending, Hollywood has an incentive to keep giving them what they want.\n\nAlso, even if the broader audience appetite for superheroes does fade and these genre movies go out of vogue, they won\u2019t go away completely. We still make snarky gangster movies and big budget action films. We even still make some film noir and Westerns (see Tarantino, Quentin). For some reason, we even make a few musicals. So even if the production of superhero movies does eventually slow, we\u2019ll still see our favorite characters brought to the big screen as other trends emerge.\n\nBut as the general movie-going audience gets smaller, the industry will be happy to keep hold of a particularly large and loyal slice of the pie. It may be the only real hope Hollywood (or at least the portion of Hollywood that still cares if people go to movie theaters to see films) has of maintaining profitability domestically. Of course all of this ignores China. As long as superhero films continue to rake it in overseas, Hollywood will keep making them, whether Americans are tired of them or not.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Following a summer of somewhat tepid box office success for superhero movies, Hollywoo", "title": "Sorry, Steven Spielberg, Superhero Movies Aren\u2019t Going Away Anytime Soon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/07/Sorry-Steven-Spielberg-Superhero-Movies-Aren-t-Going-Away-Anytime-Soon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Comic_Book_Movies_The_Avengers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/07/Sorry-Steven-Spielberg-Superhero-Movies-Aren-t-Going-Away-Anytime-Soon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Comic_Book_Movies_The_Avengers.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Following a summer of somewhat tepid box office success for superhero movies, Hollywoo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9002\"", "article_summary": "Also, even if the broader audience appetite for superheroes does fade and these genre movies go out of vogue, they won\u2019t go away completely.\nAs long as superhero films continue to rake it in overseas, Hollywood will keep making them, whether Americans are tired of them or not.\nFollowing a summer of somewhat tepid box office success for superhero movies, Hollywood luminaries have begun coming out of the woodwork to declare that the end of the comic book blockbuster is nigh.\nSo even if the production of superhero movies does eventually slow, we\u2019ll still see our favorite characters brought to the big screen as other trends emerge.\nComic book sales in 2014 totaled $934 million, with $100 million of that in digital sales \u2014 not bad for a print industry in this day and age."}
