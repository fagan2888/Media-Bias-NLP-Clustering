PISCATAWAY â€” About 50 people attending the Rutgers football game at High Point Solutions Stadium in Piscataway this afternoon were overcome by the heat and were taken to nearby air-conditioned areas and a few of them to area hospitals, a university spokesman said.

No one was seriously ill, the spokesman, Greg Trevor, said.

"In a small number cases, the high heat and humidity aggravated existing medical conditions," he said.

The temperature at the game this afternoon hovered around 90 degrees, although conditions put the heat index at 101, according to data from the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist.

A crowd of just more than 48,000 attended the game, at which Rutgers defeated Howard 38-25.
