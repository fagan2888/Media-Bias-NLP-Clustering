In spite of a gradual transition from summer to fall, forecasters report that winter is, in fact, coming with a pronounced drop in temperature and high amount of snow.

“After record-shattering temperatures and high snow totals last winter in the Northeast, a similar theme will continue into the 2014-2015 season,” said forecasters Accuweather, noting that the polar vortex, a sequel no one asked for, “will slip down into the [Northeast] region from time to time,” although it will not be as “persistent.”

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a more tempered projection for this winter, however. Even though temperatures will be below average in the south-central and southeastern states, it said, overall weather will not be as extreme as the winter of 2013-2014. It even forecast that the west coast will experience one of its warmest winters on record. Drought conditions are expected to improve in December and January.

The Weather Channel says that while last winter primarily hit the upper Midwest, this winter’s chill will largely impact the East Coast and Gulf Coast.
