Set aside, if you will, the health insurance hiccups of health reform.\n\nLook past all of that because there is very good news to report in health care today: The impermeable black box of surgeon performance has finally been breached. If you've noted an unusual number of dudes in scrubs at your local pub in the past week, here's why.\n\nThe nonprofit news organization ProPublica just released its breakthrough Surgeon Scorecard to share with consumers for the first time the information most surgeons already know: who the best and worst surgeons are in their profession.\n\nA rare peek at surgical stats\n\nAs outrageous as it sounds, many hospitals don't collect this data, those that do often use it only internally, and -- except for Medicare -- the federal government doesn't routinely take a comprehensive look at the batting averages of our surgical corps either.\n\n\"Guided by experts, ProPublica calculated death and complication rates for surgeons performing one of eight elective procedures in Medicare, carefully adjusting for differences in patient health, age and hospital quality,\" the news group explains. \"Use this database to know more about a surgeon before your operation.\"\n\nUsing data supplied by Medicare, Surgeon Scorecard posts the complication rate for 17,000 surgeons performing common procedures across the country. Medicare has been on an Obamacare-prompted tear to cut hospital readmission rates nationwide, in part by shaving Medicare reimbursements for hospitals that exceed national averages. Medicare readmissions cost taxpayers in the neighborhood of $17 billion annually.\n\n'Scorecard' reflects millions of surgeries\n\nProPublica analyzed 2.3 million common, low-risk procedures, including hip and knee replacements, spinal fusions, gallbladder removals and prostate surgeries done between 2009 and 2013 on patients in Medicare. The researchers focused exclusively on elective procedures that would typically involve healthier patients with better odds of recovery.\n\nThey then ran the results by two dozen physicians, who looked closely for the most common surgical complications, such as infections, blood clots, misaligned orthopedic devices and uncontrolled bleeding. Patients who died in the hospital or who were readmitted within 30 days were counted against the surgeon.\n\nSo how did the surgeons measure up? Overall, complication rates ranged from 2 to 4 percent, depending on the procedure. While that may seem reasonably low, surgical experts say they should have been significantly lower. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n11 percent of the surgeons studied accounted for 25 percent of the complications.\n\nHundreds of surgeons across the country had complication rates double or triple the national average.\n\nSome of the outliers hail from the nation's most prestigious medical centers, while statistically at least, some of the best surgeons practice in small-town clinics.\n\nSeen as a win for transparency\n\nConsumer groups generally hailed the Surgeon Scorecard as a long-overdue breakthrough in medical transparency. While some physicians expressed concerns that the scorecard would shame surgeons rather than improve them, Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon and professor at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, welcomed the news.\n\n\"If you leave it up to the altruism of hospitals, you end up with what we have now -- just a few that use meaningful data to improve quality,\" he told ProPublica. \"Broader transparency, if done fairly and accurately, can drive this improvement with greater force.\"\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @omnisaurus\n\nGet more news, money-saving tips and expert advice by signing up for a free Bankrate newsletter.\n\nVeteran contributing editor Jay MacDonald is co-author of \"Future Millionaires' Guidebook.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "health insurance, medicare, health reform", "description": "A new Surgeon Scorecard helps consumers pick a surgeon based on their past performance.", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Using data supplied by Medicare, Surgeon Scorecard posts the complication rate for 17,000 surgeons performing common procedures across the country.\nSeen as a win for transparencyConsumer groups generally hailed the Surgeon Scorecard as a long-overdue breakthrough in medical transparency.\nDoes your surgeon make the cut?\nOverall, complication rates ranged from 2 to 4 percent, depending on the procedure.\nThe nonprofit news organization ProPublica just released its breakthrough Surgeon Scorecard to share with consumers for the first time the information most surgeons already know: who the best and worst surgeons are in their profession."}
