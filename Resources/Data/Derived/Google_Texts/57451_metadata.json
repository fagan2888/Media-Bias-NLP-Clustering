This is a significant finding and is significant for pathologists and clinical lab managers because the Walmart health benefit plan includes an expanded provider network, at a premium that is about half of the subsidized rate for a comparable health plan at Healthcare.gov.\n\nA Washington Examiner analysis comparing Walmart\u2019s employee health insurance program with Obamacare\u2014more formerly referred to as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or simply the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014found that \u201cWalmart\u2019s plan is more affordable and provides significantly better access to high-quality medical care than Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that Walmart\u2019s participation in a national healthcare network means employees typically choose from a list of participating providers and high-profile hospitals that dwarfs the number of options on Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIndependent Health Insurance Examiners Find Walmart\u2019s Health Plans Superior\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner\u2019s report, Walmart offers its employees the choice of two plans that are managed by Blue Cross Blue Shield:\n\n1. A Health Reimbursement Account; and\n\n2. An \u201cHRA High,\u201d which features similar coverage, but with higher out-of-pocket expenses and lower deductibles.\n\nWalmart also offers its employees a Health Savings Account plan that includes high deductibles but allows tax-free dollars to be used to pay for coverage.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s article cited several examples of Walmart\u2019s health plan price superiority:\n\n\u2022 For a family of four with an annual income of $53,000 per year, Walmart\u2019s monthly premium is $160 compared to a subsidized rate of $317 or an unsubsidized rate of $962 on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u2022 A 30-year-old smoker with a $30,000 income pays $70 per month under the Walmart plan versus a $352 subsidized premium or $428 unsubsidized premium under Obamacare.\n\n\u2022 Two 60-year-old nonsmokers with a $25,000 income pay a $134 monthly premium under the Walmart plan compared to a $94 subsidized premium or a $1365 unsubsidized premium on HealthCare.gov (the only comparison showing mixed results).\n\nThe report did not detail any differences in the deductible amounts between the various plans. Independent insurance agents affiliated with the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) and health policy experts compared the plans at the Washington Examiner\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better program than people, I think, might assume without looking, just because Walmart has gotten such a bad reputation by some of the labor groups and other groups for its general activities,\u201d stated Gail Wilensky, PhD, in the Washington Examiner article. Wilensky was head of the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA) under President George H.W. Bush. The HCFA was the predecessor to today\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nEight \u2018Centers of Excellence\u2019 Included in Walmart Plan: Not Offered in Obamacare\n\nBeyond the price differences, the Washington Examiner also pointed out that the Walmart plan offers a broader network of hospitals, including eight \u201cCenters of Excellence\u201d such as Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic , which are not part of most Obamacare exchange plans. This is a notable finding, because pathologists working in academic centers are often excluded from the narrow networks of the health exchange plans offered by many private payers. That is not the case under the Walmart health benefit program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the number, but who they are,\u201d health policy advocate Betsy McCaughey, PhD,, a former New York Lieutenant Governor, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cYou\u2019ll find under the Obamacare exchanges that the academic hospitals have declined to participate, along with the specialists who practice at those hospitals. The same is true of cancer hospitals.\u201d\n\nPart-time Employees Not Offered Coverage by Walmart\n\nYet the news is not all good. A large portion of Walmart\u2019s employees\u2013its part-time workers\u2014do not qualify for health coverage. In fact, the Washington Examiner\u2019s positive analysis of Walmart\u2019s health plan was followed in October, 2014, by news that the retailer was cutting health benefits for its 30,000 workers who work fewer than 30 hours a week and raising full-time worker premiums by 19%.\n\n\u201cIf a retail empire built on low prices can\u2019t find a way around Obamacare\u2019s added costs, we\u2019re all doomed,\u201d stated an Investors Business Daily editorial.\n\nThat decision by Walmart coincided with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s January 1, 2015, deadline requiring large employers to provide subsidized healthcare for every employee who works 30-hours a week or more.\n\nNeed for Tough Decisions Due to Affordable Care Act Mandates\n\n\u201cWe had to make some tough decisions,\u201d Walmart Senior Vice President for Global Benefits Sally Welborn was quoted in Newsmax.\n\nThe part-time workers that make up about 2% of Walmart\u2019s 1.3 million-person workforce are eligible to enroll in state and national healthcare insurance exchanges and may be eligible for government subsidies that reduce their premiums. How well that turns out for those workers is up for debate.\n\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s insurance appears to be pretty cheap, and while it has a high deductible, that deductible is comparable to, or better than, many of Obamacare\u2019s \u2018bronze\u2019 plans,\u2019\u201d wrote Bloomberg View\u2019s Megan McArdle. \u201cThe out-of-pocket maximum is higher, but the Walmart plan seems to have included a variant of a health savings account, which workers won\u2019t get on the exchanges, and most workers won\u2019t approach the out-of-pocket maximum. If the part-time workers are earning very little, they\u2019ll get a nice big subsidy. But how many people are supporting themselves entirely on part-time work at Walmart? If they have other family income, this may turn out to be a substantially worse deal.\u201d\n\nSeveral Big Companies Dropped Health Insurance Coverage for Part-time Staff\n\nAs Forbes pointed out, Walmart is not the only high-profile retailer to cut health benefits for part-time workers. Home Depot, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, Forever 21 and other large retailers also ended health insurance coverage for part-time staff as Obamacare went into effect.\n\nCarrie Gleason, Director of the Fair Workweek Initiative , a grassroots effort to achieve an equitable workweek for today\u2019s workforce, criticized the retailers for forcing taxpayers to subsidize an employee benefit that they \u201ccan more afford to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real issue at play here is that employers consistently don\u2019t offer part-time employees health insurance,\u201d Gleason told Forbes.\n\nClinical Lab Executives May See Next Congress Tackle Healthcare Costs\n\nNotwithstanding the ongoing controversy about the good and bad aspects of the Affordable Care Act, the Washington Times report provides evidence that the private marketplace can deliver health insurance options that offer patients access to a larger provider network at significant savings compared to comparable plans offered through HealthCare.gov. Medical laboratory executives and pathologists should keep this in mind as they watch the next round of Obamacare mandates push even more people insured by their employers into the health plans offered through the health insurance exchanges.\n\nIn addition, news reports about the substantial increase in premiums for 2016 for health exchange insurance plans in many states can be seen as a sign that, in its sixth year as law, Obamacare has failed to achieve its stated goal of an overall reduction in healthcare costs across the American healthcare system. That may turn out to be a problem that must be tackled by the next Congress and president.\n\n\u2014Andrea Downing Peck\n\nRelated Information:\n\nWalmart Health Plan Is Cheaper, Offers More Coverage than Obamacare\n\n\n\nTarget Joins Home Depot, Walmart, Others in Cutting Healthcare for Part-timers, Citing Obamacare\n\n\n\nWalmart\u2019s Latest Move May Boost Obamacare\n\n\n\nWalmart Ends Health Coverage for Part-timers, Cites Obamacare\n\n\n\nWalmart Stymied by Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "medical laboratory, clinical laboratory, pathology, laboratory pathology, laboratory news, washington examiner, obamacare, patient protection and affordable care act, affordable care act, walmart, gail wilensky, blue cross blue shield, national association of health underwriters, nahu, betsy mccaughey, cleveland clinic, mayo clinic, home depot, target, trader joe\u2019s, forever 21, bloomberg view, megan mcardle, sally welborn, forbes, carrie gleason, fair workweek initiative, newsmax, centers for medicare and medicaid services, ,affordable care act,betsy mccaughey,bloomberg view,blue cross blue shield,carrie gleason,centers for medicare and medicaid services,cleveland clinic,clinical laboratory,fair workweek initiative,forbes,forever 21,gail wilensky,home depot,laboratory news,laboratory pathology,mayo clinic,megan mcardle,nahu,national association of health underwriters,newsmax,obamacare,pathology,patient protection and affordable care act,sally welborn,target,trader joe\u2019s,walmart,washington examiner,coding, billing, and collections,compliance, legal, and malpractice,laboratory management and operations,laboratory operations,laboratory testing,managed care contracts & payer reimbursement,management & operations", "description": "Walmart shoppers expect to find low prices on the retailer\u2019s shelves, but the discounter\u2019s full-time employees may be surprised to learn their company healthcare plan is also a low-cost leader.
