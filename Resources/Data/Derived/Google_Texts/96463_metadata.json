Lobbying and law firms, political fundraisers and association chiefs are competing for a-listers by booking the roof deck with the best view of the city\u2019s historic skyline.\n\nBut not every rooftop is party-ready. Some have no parapets or railings\u2014a no-no when cocktails flow. Others are still covered in pea gravel and pigeon droppings.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t kept two hotels whose roofs aren\u2019t pedestrian-friendly from competing\u2014with each other\u2013by putting beehives, not people, up top.\n\nThe Sofitel on Lafayette Park near the White House has three hives on its roof, which this season, its second, produced nearly 500 pounds of honey. The hotel gives its guests silver-topped jars of Le Miel whose provenance, the label claims, is \u201cthe flowers of the White House gardens and surrounding parks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that our bees are going to the White House and collecting pollen and having fun that way,\u201d Sofitel sales director Alexandra Byrne said in her French accent. \u201cWe think they go as far as the Tidal Basin\u201d\u2014home of the capital\u2019s famed cherry trees.\n\n\u201cOh, so they\u2019re just guessing. Well that\u2019s cute,\u201d says Diana Bulger, spokeswoman for the Fairmont hotel, with a rival apiary on its roof. \u201cWe assume that our bees range three miles away, and we are within three miles of the White House, so our bees could be over there too,\u201d says Ms. Bulger. \u201cAnd our bees go to Rock Creek\u201d\u2014the sweeping park that was a favorite haunt of former president Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s.\n\nThe White House, by the way, has its own beehives.\n\nThe Fairmont is one of the first hotels in the nation to get into honey production, beginning in 2009, Ms. Bulger says. The hotel uses its own honey in its cuisine, and in the Bee-tini, a cocktail of honey, vodka, tequila and lemon served in its bar. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d Ms. Bulger says.\n\nThe Sofitel uses its honey in its kitchen, too\u2014its signature drink is the Bee Mine, a blend of honey, gin and lemon. \u201cAnd we will sell our honey in the restaurant starting this fall,\u201d Ms. Byrne says.\n\n\u201cOur honey is delicious. And it\u2019s sustainable\u2014not only because we create our own honey, we help with the pollination of the city, and we are very proud of that.\u201d\n\nThe Fairmont runs a beekeeping program for D.C. public schoolchildren, Ms. Bulger says. And it\u2019s establishing another rooftop hive strictly for pollinator bees: there\u2019s a pop-up version of that hive, without stinging insects, in the hotel lobby.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about that,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s no pollinator pop-up in the Sofitel\u2019s lobby. However, says Ms. Byrne, the Sofitel also keeps bees in Paris.\n\nON PAGE ONE:\n\nWashington Power Brokers Battle for the Rooftops\n\nVideo: Washington Power Brokers Race to the Rooftops", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Not every D.C. rooftop is party-ready.
