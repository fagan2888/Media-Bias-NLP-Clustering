Danny Trevathan will begin practice this week. Problem is he is not eligible to return until the San Diego game in Week 15. As a result, the Broncos enter this week compromised at linebacker with Brandon Marshall undergoing the concussion protocol.

That leaves rookie Lamin Barrow, backup Steven Johnson and possibly safety T.J. Ward as potential replacements at Kansas City if Marshall is not cleared.

“We have options,” coach John Fox said Monday.

Barrow has participated in four games this season, but played a season-high 21 snaps in Sunday’s win over the Dolphins. He was used in nickel coverage for nine snaps. He was designated to call defensive signals after Marshall’s second-half injury, but had technical problems with the helmet.

“I know I have plenty to work on,” said Barrow, a former star at Louisiana State. “I am critical of my work. I know have to get better and continue to adjust to the speed of the game.”

The Broncos’ defense also faces issues at cornerback. Kayvon Webster dislocated his left shoulder and Aqib Talib played just 17 snaps because of a hamstring injury. Omar Bolden replaced them, and impressed Fox with his preparation.

“You always like to see when a guy is ready when called upon,” said Fox said.

Webster and Talib are listed as day-to-day. Talib said he would discuss his injury on Wednesday. Tight end Julius Thomas sat out the Dolphins game with a left ankle injury. He remains hopeful that he will return against the Chiefs, but nothing is certain.

“I have had better days and I have had worse,” Thomas said Monday. “You hope to wake up and feel better. It has improved, though.”
