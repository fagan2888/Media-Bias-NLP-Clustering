Activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a stake in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. on Thursday, saying shares are undervalued and that he plans to talk with management.

Icahn said in a filing that he intends to have discussions with Freeport-McMoRan’s FCX, +4.86% board and management about the company’s capital expenditures, executive compensation practices, capital structure and curtailment of its “high-cost production operations.” Icahn may seek board representation.

A group including Icahn holds an 8.46% stake.

The criticisms come after Freeport-McMoRan outlined plans Thursday morning to cut its capital-spending plans for 2016 by 29% and reduce head count at U.S. mining operations as copper prices near six-year lows--which sent shares up 29% in the regular session. After Icahn disclosed his stake, shares climbed a further 20%. Before Thursday trading began, the stock had dropped 66% for the year.

The reductions, which could include eliminating around 1,560 jobs, come after the Phoenix-based miner cut its oil-and-gas spending plans earlier this month and said it would review its mining operations.
