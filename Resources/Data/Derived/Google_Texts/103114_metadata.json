An average of 15.73 percent of the state\u2019s population received SNAP benefits.\n\nSo, several years after the national recession, is an Ohio where 15 percent of residents are on food stamps the new status quo?\n\n\u201cYes, I do believe this is the new norm,\u201d Ohio Association of Food Banks executive director Lisa Hamler-Fugitt said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nOhio\u2019s recent decline in SNAP enrollment follows the reinstatement of work requirements for recipients in most counties at the end of 2013. The state had waived work requirements for able-bodied, working-age childless adults before President Obama\u2019s 2009 \u201cstimulus\u201d bill.\n\n\u201cThe decline in SNAP/Food Stamp enrollment in Ohio has been largely due to the state reimposing the time limit on unemployed/underemployed adults without dependents between 18 and 50 years of age who reside in 71 counties that were not granted the waiver,\u201d Hamler-Fugitt explained.\n\nCongress ending \u201ca modest increase to SNAP benefits\u201d from Obama\u2019s stimulus and Ohio ending its statewide work requirements waiver have resulted in leaving nearly 134,000 adults subject to \u201charsh\u201d SNAP restrictions, she said.\n\nWithout a work requirements waiver, able-bodied, working-age childless adults can only receive three months of SNAP benefits in any three-year period unless they work, volunteer or attend job training for at least 20 hours per week.\n\nHamler-Fugitt said the one in six Ohioans served by the Ohio Association of Food Banks who would qualify for SNAP under a statewide waiver \u201chave lost over 235 million\u201d federally funded meals \u201cworth over $331 million\u201d in the past 14 months.\n\nDoes the Ohio Association of Food Banks see any alternatives to the federal SNAP program?\n\n\u201cCharity will not and cannot fill the gap,\u201d Hamler-Fugitt said. \u201cHunger is increasing, children are losing ground academically, seniors are going hungry and workers are less productive. Hungry people are not healthy people.\u201d\n\nShe noted one in four Ohioans are now on Medicaid, \u201cwhich has a higher income eligibility than food stamps.\u201d\n\nOhio had fewer SNAP recipients in December than in the average month during fiscal 2014, and the 2014 average was lower than the average for 2013. The recent decline, however, followed several years of sharp spikes in the number of SNAP beneficiaries.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014, the average number of SNAP recipients in Ohio increased by 850,516, while Ohio\u2019s population increased by just 109,153.\n\nDuring fiscal 2004, an average of 925,584 Ohioans received SNAP benefits each month, 8.09 percent of the state\u2019s population. The number of recipients increased gradually from 2005-08 before increasing dramatically in 2009, 2010 and 2011.\n\nOhio\u2019s average monthly SNAP enrollment increased by 157,740 in 2009, 275,694 in 2010 and 196,403 in 2011. Monthly SNAP enrollment declined by 45,727 in 2014 only after additional increases in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe national recession officially ended in June 2009, but the average number of Ohioans receiving SNAP benefits first topped 15 percent of the state\u2019s population in 2011 and remained above 15 percent through 2014.\n\nSNAP payments to Ohioans cost federal taxpayers just less than $3 billion each fiscal year from 2011-13, and cost nearly $2.7 billion in 2014. The state share of SNAP administrative costs totaled $97 million in 2013.\n\nJosh Archambault, a senior fellow at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said Ohio lawmakers should \u201ccontinue to reorient their programs toward work first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a window of opportunity for state legislators to re-examine welfare programs in general,\u201d Archambault told Ohio Watchdog in a phone interview.\n\nArchambault recommended Ohio end its policy of broad-based categorical eligibility, end its partial waiver of work requirements and impose asset limits for SNAP enrollees.\n\nHe said the state should also consider putting recipients\u2019 photos on SNAP cards, which the state could not require but could offer as a default choice to help prevent fraud.\n\nArchambault suggested legislators should be \u201cthinking through the application process for SNAP, making sure that when individuals are coming in through that process that you are finding strength-based, work-oriented goals for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will end up on a lot of your other social service programs, so you have to be mindful of how that application process happens,\u201d Archambault said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohioans' reliance on food stamps decreased last year, yet it remains higher than at any time before the 2007-09 recession.", "title": "Ohio's reliance on food stamps remains near record high - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/snap-logo.gif", "url": "http://watchdog.org/208321/ohio-food-stamps/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Stimulus", "published_time": "2015-03-26T10:59:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohioans' reliance on food stamps decreased last year, yet it remains higher than at any time before the 2007-09 recession.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/snap-logo.gif"}, "title": "Ohio's reliance on food stamps remains near record high - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "SNAP, supplemental nutrition assistance program, lisa hamler-fugitt, josh archambault, ohio association of food banks, foundation for government accountability, ohio department of job and family services"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cf5\"", "article_summary": "Ohio\u2019s recent decline in SNAP enrollment follows the reinstatement of work requirements for recipients in most counties at the end of 2013.\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogOhioans\u2019 reliance on food stamps decreased last year, yet it remains higher than at any time before the 2007-09 recession.\nThe state had waived work requirements for able-bodied, working-age childless adults before President Obama\u2019s 2009 \u201cstimulus\u201d bill.\nDuring fiscal 2004, an average of 925,584 Ohioans received SNAP benefits each month, 8.09 percent of the state\u2019s population.\nAn average of 15.73 percent of the state\u2019s population received SNAP benefits."}
