[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit [official website] on Tuesday dismissed [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit that challenged the fairness of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) [text, PDF] for allowing members of Congress and their staffs to receive subsidies for their health insurance. US Senator Ron Johnson [official website] and one of his aides filed the suit and argued that the rule created an administrative burden on the senator and his staff, resulted in unequal protection, and caused him "reputational and electoral injury." The court affirmed the ruling of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin [official website] and dismissed the case for lack of standing, agreeing that the plaintiffs received a benefit, not an injury, from the ACA. Senator Johnson announced [press release] his intention to consider his options in moving forward with the case.
