Before the new clinic opened, Mclaughlin worked in Rock Springs while living in Riverton.\n\nSkaf said he began to hear news of departing physicians in April 2012, with four primary care physicians leaving in one year. As a result, careful planning enabled Skaf and his team to open new clinics in Riverton, Casper and Rock Springs.\n\nA shortage also is taking place at other health care provider networks in the state. Changes in the Affordable Care Act means providers are getting paid less for certain services while patients are paying more. For this reason, many physicians in the country are choosing to work for larger practices.\n\nPatients with Medicare were reported to receive more benefits under the ACA reform. Several health care providers, including the Riverton Memorial Hospital, reported that a majority of their patients are on Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nHealth network\n\nCedars Health has six clinics in the state. If patients in Rawlins, Cheyenne or Sheridan need care, they can receive it in any of the clinics, with or without an appointment.\n\nCedars Health's urgent care services are offered on a walk-in basis and help treat issues that don't require emergency room attention. Patients with respiratory infections, minor burns, bites, cuts, sprains, sinus infections or coughs and colds can stop in for medical help.\n\nPrimary care is offered through a family nurse practitioner, and the services include well woman exams, well child care, physicals, immunizations, men's health care, check-ups and behavioral health care.\n\nThe business accepts all types of insurance and has a low flat rate for uninsured patients that also can be offered with a payment plan. Worker's compensation also is accepted.\n\nThe clinic offers occupational medicine, and testing comes with OccMed services such as drug and alcohol testing, spirometry, audiometry, vision screening, lab testing, hair follicle testing and wellness programs.\n\nThe new office opened Oct. 28 and has exam rooms equipped to offer in-office procedures and pediatric to geriatric services. The clinic maintains health records electronically and continues to expand its clinic and office space.\n\nAn open house is scheduled for January.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your copy of The Ranger online, every day!
