The GOP hopefuls on the main stage were businessman Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. The debate was sponsored by Fox Business News.\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nKasich said he is in the race \u201cto give voice\u201d to voiceless Americans who he said have been ignored by the Obama administration.\n\nChristie said Obama, in his State of the State speech this week, talked about \u201ca fantasy land,\u201d because the people are in pain and facing a dangerous world.\n\n\u201cWe need someone to fight for his country again. I fought all my life,\u201d Christie said.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\u201cSo many Americans are discouraged and angry,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. . . . I ask you to join me with truth and integrity and honesty . . . to inspire and revive America.\u201d\n\nBush said, \u201cI ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.\u201d\n\nRubio said \u201cour rights don\u2019t come from government,\u201d but \u201cthis country is changing, it feels different.\u201d\n\nHe said Obama has turned his back on the nation\u2019s allies and Clinton would make it worse.\n\n\u201cI want to speak to all our fighting men and women . . . who have a sense of betrayal\u201d by Obama, Cruz said. \u201cI want to speak for all of those maddened by political correctness. . . . This will end.\u201d\n\nTrump said he stood with 75 tough construction workers, crying, watching the U.S. sailors on their knees with Iranians holding guns to their heads.\n\n\u201cWe will make America great again, we will win at everything we do,\u201d Trump said.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nRubio defended his change from supporting more open borders.\n\n\u201cThis issue has to be, first and foremost, about keeping America safe,\u201d Rubio said. He said he supports strict screening.\n\n\u201cThe situation has changed\u201d with ISIS, he said. \u201cThey are recruiting people to enter this country. . . . This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS from entering the United States.\u201d\n\nCruz said terrorism didn\u2019t begin \u201c24 months ago,\u201d criticizing Rubio for what he saw as a reversal.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nRubio said Cruz used to support doubling the number of green cards and providing a path for immigrants without proper documentation.\n\nRubio accused Cruz of flipping on issues to help his popularity in Iowa, the key caucus state.\n\n\u201cHe had no fewer than 11 attacks there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAt least half of the things Marco said are outright false.\u201d\n\nCruz and Rubio accused each other of flip-flopping on issues ranging from immigration to farming to the military in the Senate.\n\nBush called the Rubio-Cruz debate a fight among \u201cback benchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem today is there is no confidence in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Bush said.\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nKasich said he created a task force over a year ago to improve police-community relations after deadly confrontations.\n\n\u201cThey sat down as a group to make sure we heal some of our problems,\u201d Kasich said. The result has been better policies on use of deadly force and better training, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about getting people to listen to one another\u2019s problems,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, the country needs healing. . . . You gotta bring people together, you\u2019ve got to have hope.\u201d\n\nChristie said Obama\u2019s Justice Department \u201cgives the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not the police.\u201d\n\nChristie, a former federal prosecutor, said he would order his attorney general to enforce the law against everyone fairly \u201cand them [police] know how proud we are of them.\u201d\n\n11:05 p.m.\n\nTrump was asked what he would do with his companies as president.\n\nTrump noted he \u201cbuilt a very great company. But if I became president, I wouldn\u2019t give peanuts for it.\u201d\n\nHe said his children would take over and he wouldn\u2019t have a role.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever be involved because I wouldn\u2019t be interested in anything but our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nCruz said his business flat tax of 16 percent would allow the elimination of the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and Obamacare costs.\n\nCruz said he would \u201cabolish the IRS\u201d by simplifying the tax return to the size of a post card.\n\n\u201cIt produces economic growth, it raises wages,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cYou may rename the IRS, but you are not going to eliminate it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSomeone is going to have to collect that tax.\u201d\n\nChristie interrupted \u201cthis debate on the floor of the Senate.\u201d\n\nCruz tried to interject.\n\n\u201cNo, Ted, you had your chance and you blew it,\u201d Christie said.\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nThe candidates were asked how to fix crumbling infrastructure without adding to an already massive national debt.\n\nChristie called for \u201crepatriation\u201d of overseas money of American companies that is kept overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. Christie said income from those billions of dollars could be earmarked for infrastructure repairs.\n\n\u201cWe need to reform this tax system,\u201d Christie said, and use the revenue for fixing roads and fighting terrorism.\n\nCarson said he would work to stop that flow of cash overseas by reforming the tax code \u201cand stop spending so much money.\u201d\n\nCarson said he learned about thriftiness from his mother\u2019s scrimping and saving.\n\n\u201cIf my mother was the secretary of the treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation,\u201d Carson said.\n\nTrump said companies \u201cby the thousands\u201d are thinking of moving out of the U.S. to save money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest problems we have,\u201d Trump said.\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere is a middle ground,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cObama is not protecting American workers . . . and we were getting hammered.\u201d\n\nCruz said Bush is right that a big tariff would only prompt China to charge its own high tariff.\n\nBush said if China faced a 45-percent tariff it would undermine the U.S. economy because China would stop trade.\n\n\u201cWe need a steady hand,\u201d Bush said, directing his comment to Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t need a weak hand,\u201d Trump said.\n\nKasich agreed with some of Trump\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m liking him tonight,\u201d Trump interjected.\n\nKasich ignored the comment, but said, \u201cWhen countries violate trade treaties, we need to stand up without making them into an enemy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s demand open trade, but fair trade,\u201d Kaisch said.\n\nRubio said a tariff won\u2019t work, because the cost will passed on to American consumers.\n\nHe called for \u201creversing course\u201d from Obama with tax reform to benefit companies and encourage growth.\n\nRubio called Obamacare health care \u201ca certified job killer.\u201d\n\nTrump said Rubio\u2019s route \u201cwould take too long.\u201d\n\nTrump also said his tariff wouldn\u2019t be passed on to American consumers because the threat of it would put China in line.\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nTrump targeted China as undermining America\u2019s interests and economy because of a \u201cvery unfair trade deficit.\u201d\n\nTrump said the U.S. \u201chas great economic power over China\u201d if America uses it.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t start treating us fairly . . . I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe denied a media report, however, in which he was quoted as calling for a 45-percent tariff.\n\nHe criticized China for devaluing its currency and creating an unequal playing field with the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a free trader, I believe it, but we have to be smart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI love the Chinese people . . . but I am totally open to a tariff.\u201d\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nCarson called for convening experts from around the world to develop new protocol for passports and screening.\n\nBush asked if we should ban immigrants from India and other allies.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Bush answered his own question. Instead, he called for an Arab alliance. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it with big talk about banning all Muslims,\u201d Bush said, aiming at Trump.\n\nRubio said ISIS is a sadistic group and its followers must be stopped from entering the U.S.\n\nCruz said President Obama \u201cacts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nCruz said he would suspend all refugees from nations in which ISIS controls \u201csignificant territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to ISIS, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nChristie said the only way to ban radical Islamists is to provide the resources needed to vet immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to keep everybody out, we just need to keep the bad people out who want to harm us,\u201d Christie said.\n\nKasich said he supports \u201cpausing\u201d immigration of Syrian refugees because he said the screening isn\u2019t yet efficient.\n\nBut he said the U.S. needs Arab allies, as President George H.W. Bush did in the first Gulf War, and stopping all Muslim immigration \u201cis not right.\u201d\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe are running for president of the United States . . . you can\u2019t make rash statements,\u201d Bush said to Trump.\n\n\u201cI want security for this country,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, radical Islam. It is not just a problem here.\u201d\n\nHe cited \u201cthe two horrible people\u201d in last fall\u2019s attack in San Bernadino, California. \u201cMany people knew what was going on. . . . Where were they? We need vigilance.\u201d\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nTrump was pressed on his position to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and asked if he changed his mind.\n\n\u201cNo. We have to stop with political correctness,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI have many Muslim friends.\u201d\n\nHe said he wants a temporary ban on the travel and many of his \u201cMuslim friends \u2014 some said we need to get to the bottom of it. . . . We can\u2019t be the stupid country any more.\u201d\n\nBush said that thought will block any alliance with the Arab world to take out ISIS and restore democracy in Syria. Bush called for \u201ctightening up\u201d screening and keeping out dangerous immigrants.\n\n\u201cBut all Muslims? Seriously? What does that say to the world?\u201d Bush said to Trump.\n\nThe candidates were asked if the air strikes against ISIS have been effective, and if ground troops are needed.\n\n\u201cI think we need to doa lot more than we are doing,\u201d Carson said. He said he wouldn\u2019t tie the hands of military leaders and set them loose to take on the Islamic State group, then take the oil from the region.\n\nHe said such attacks shouldn\u2019t be stopped out of fear of hurting civilians.\n\n\u201cJust get people out of there if they don\u2019t want to be bombed,\u201d Carson said.\n\nChristie blamed Obama and Clinton for the violence in Syria through their inaction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have peace in Syria unless there is a no-fly zone,\u201d Christie said. There would be no refugee problem, he said, adding \u201cSyrians would stay in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe said Syrian President Asaad must be replaced, despite his support by Russia.\n\n\u201cWe will fight ISIS and defeat them,\u201d Christie said.\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so critical for us to be energy independent and we are getting there with fracking,\u201d said Kasich, a strong supporter of hydraulic fracturing for oil trapped in shale deposits.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do on-the-job training,\u201d Kasich said, making an argument for an executive like himself who also has Congressional experience. He said the complexity of fighting ISIS demands nothing less.\n\nBush said he would grow and restore the military to end provocative actions by Iran, China and others.\n\n\u201cThe planes are older than the pilots, we are gutting our military,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe have to rebuild our military that makes it clear we are back in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountries are moving away from us because we are weak,\u201d Bush said.\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nCruz defended his criticism of Trump as a having \u201cNew York values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most people know exactly what New York values are,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cEveryone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal . . . focus around money and the media.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan, I\u2019m just saying,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cSome conservatives do come out of Manhattan,\u201d Trump said, citing William F. Buckley.\n\n\u201cWhen the World Trade Centers came down, I saw something that no other place could handle so beautifully,\u201d Trump said. He talked of the \u201csmell of death\u201d that hung for months, as New Yorkers worked to clean up and recover.\n\n\u201cThat was a very insulting statement that Ted made,\u201d Trump said.\n\n10 p.m.\n\nChristie was challenged on his mixed record on gun control.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Founders made it No. 2 by accident . . . I think they made it second because it\u2019s that important,\u201d Christie said.\n\nHe called Obama \u201ca petulant child\u201d for using an executive order to order more gun control because he couldn\u2019t work with the Congress on new laws.\n\nChristie then addressed Obama: \u201cThe American people have rejected your agenda . . . and we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House this fall!\u201d\n\nRubio defended gun rights in the face of terrorism.\n\nRubio said the \u201clast line standing between them and us may be a gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis president at every chance has tried to undermine the Second Amendment,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat will never happen when I am president of the United States.\u201d\n\nCruz said Clinton believes the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t provide a right for individuals to own guns, which will lead to confiscation of guns.\n\n\u201cI have a proven record fighting for the Second Amendment,\u201d Cruz said, noting he is supported by the National Rifle Association.\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nCarson didn\u2019t respond to the FOX Business News moderator\u2019s question on whether Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct because she didn\u2019t take more action against President Bill Clinton when he faced a sexual scandal in the White House. Carson instead talked generally about declining values that don\u2019t mesh with the Christian-Judeo ethic.\n\n\u201cIs this America anymore? Do we still have values?\u201d Carson asked.\n\nHe lamented race wars, religious wars, \u201cevery war you can image. You know our strength is in our diversity.\u201d\n\nHe said the divisiveness \u201cdidn\u2019t come from our Christian-Judeo roots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is such a thing as right and wrong, and let\u2019s not let the secular humanists drive that out,\u201d Carson said.\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nKasich said the economy is in trouble and retraining older workers is part of the problem. He said recent college graduates also can\u2019t land jobs.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about their economic future,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cMy father used to say, \u2018We don\u2019t hate the rich, we just want to be the rich.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said training and support is needed to provide opportunity for all Americans.\n\nRubio addressed a question on his sharp criticism of Christie as being Obama-like in his policies.\n\n\u201cThis president is more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than the military. Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.\u201d\n\nRubio said Christie has adopted many liberal positions on guns, social services and other issues.\n\n\u201cI never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThis is the difference between being a governor and a senator. When you are a senator you can talk and talk and talk. When you are a governor, you are accountable for everything you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a compelling conservative agenda that doesn\u2019t disparage people,\u201d Bush said.\n\nHe called for unity, saying all the GOP candidates are better than Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cIf we damage ourselves,\u201d Carson said, \u201cthis country is over as we know it.\u201d\n\n9:35 p.m.\n\nTrump said his only concern about Cruz\u2019s citizenship is that if he wins and chooses Cruz as vice president, Democrats will bring a lawsuit that will disrupt government.\n\n\u201cYou should go out, get a declarative judgment and let the courts decide,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThere is a big question mark on your head,\u201d Trump said to Cruz. \u201cYou have to have certainty. . . . You can\u2019t have a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz said, noting that Trump\u2019s expert on the topic formerly worked for Democrats.\n\nCruz said he\u2019d consider Trump as a vice presidential running mate.\n\n\u201cI think I will go back to building buildings if it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I think it will work out.\u201d\n\nRubio switched the topic from \u201cthis episode of Court TV\u201d and targeted Obama, promising to end all of Obama\u2019s executive orders.\n\nTrump was asked what he thought of some in the Republican establishment warning voters to avoid the voice of anger, meaning Trump.\n\n\u201cI will gladly accept the mantle of anger,\u201d Trump said. He said so much is wrong with the country \u2014 \u201cour country is a mess\u201d \u2014 that everyone should be angry.\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nCruz was questioned on whether he is a \u201cnatural born American,\u201d which is a requirement to be president. Cruz was born in Canadian to an American mother.\n\nCruz dismissed it as not \u201cone of the important topics of the evening.\u201d\n\nCruz said Trump had months ago dismissed the concern.\n\n\u201cSince September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed, but the polls have,\u201d Cruz said, noting that he is now higher in the polls, threatening to surpass Trump.\n\nCruz said even Trump could be a problem under his logic, because Trump\u2019s mother was a Scot who became an American citizen.\n\n\u201cI suggest we focus on who would be the best commander in chief,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nTrump shot back that he\u2019s rising in the polls, and Cruz is dropping.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t misrepresent how you are doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u201d But he said a Harvard professor and lawyers feel there is a serious concern.\n\nCruz tried to brush off a recent New York Times article that reported his campaign failed to adequately report a $1 million loan. He called it \u201ca truly stunning hit piece.\u201d\n\nCruz said his campaign staff was inexperienced and not highly paid professionals like Hillary Clinton\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYes, I made a paperwork error, but if that\u2019s the best hit The New York Times has got, they better go back to the well,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nTrump said his hard-line stance against immigration is not unfounded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fear of terror, it\u2019s reality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the migration . . . where are the women? Very few women, very few children \u2014 strong, powerful men,\u201d he said of the waves of Syrian refugees he would keep from the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders, we can\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military,\u201d Bush said. \u201cOur enemies no longer fear us . . . terrorism is on the run . . . and we pull back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a peaceful world people will know the United States is there to take care of our own interests and protect our allies,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.\u201d\n\nBush said Clinton would be going \u201cbetween the court house and the White House\u201d because her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state is being investigated by the FBI.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief,\u201d Rubio said.
