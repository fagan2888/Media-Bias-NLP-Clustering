During a press conference in New York Monday, Amy Schumer joined her second cousin, New York Senator Charles Schumer, to promote tighter gun control laws. The comedian was shaken up by last month’s movie theater shooting during a screening of her film Trainwreck.

“I’m not sure why this man [the gunman] chose my movie to end those two beautiful lives and injure nine others, but it was very personal for me,” she said, with sadness in her voice. “Enough is enough. These shootings have got to stop. I don’t know how else to say it.”

The two Schumers proposed a three-pronged plan to increase background checks nationwide. Their plan would also make it harder for violent criminals and the mentally ill to have access to guns.

“Sensible legislation can happen,” Chuck Schumer said. “The Second Amendment says you have the right to bear arms, but it is not absolute….Having people like Amy speaking out reaches people who I could never reach.”
