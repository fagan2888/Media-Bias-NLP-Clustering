Scott died of strangulation.\n\n\"What we intend to do is enlighten you a little bit about his background. You have sort of a taste of it where he discusses growing up hard,\u201d Defense Attorney Walter Smith said.\n\nDefense attorneys attempted to argue that Jeffries was tricked into the situation.\n\nJurors heard testimony from six people during Friday\u2019s penalty phase.\n\n\"The boy that I knew was a very loving, beautiful baby boy. I think he was poisoned from his mother. He never knew love,\u201d Jeffries' aunt, Verna Christopherson, said.\n\nBut Jeffries mother Mary Goldsmith says otherwise.\n\nOthers including Bay County Sheriff's deputy Chad King, Morris Spense from the Inn Paradise and stepfather Darrel Goldsmith took the stand.\n\nFinally, Sherri Mercer, Jeffries' aunt spoke.\n\nShe's accused of motivating the robbery at Scott\u2019s home.\n\nShe's serving jail time for grand theft of Scott\u2019s credit cards.\n\nJeffries decided not speak on his own behalf.\n\nThe attorney's addressed the jury one last time before they began deliberations.\n\nThe juror\u2019s recommendation is not final. It\u2019s up to the judge.\n\nJudge Brantley Clark has scheduled a Spencer hearing for August 29th, when he'll sentence Jeffries for armed robbery and armed burglary. He will decide if Jeffries will get life in prison or the death penalty.\n\nGriffin has already cut a deal with the state, pleading guilty to second-degree-murder in exchange for her testimony and a 20-year sentence.\n\nChallender is scheduled to go on trial in September", "article_metadata": {"description": "A local jury is recommending the death penalty for 29-year-old Kevin Jeffries.
