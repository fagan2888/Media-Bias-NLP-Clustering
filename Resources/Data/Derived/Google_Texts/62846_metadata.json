But its not ok with all parents, or children.\n\nWASHINGTON, November 4, 2015 \u2013 After months of hearing about isolated incidents of transgender students being told to share bathrooms with whichever gender they \u201cidentified\u201d with, the federal government took the definitive step of declaring that the State of Illinois violated Title IX discrimination laws by preventing a 13 year old boy from gaining \u201cunrestricted\u201d access to the girls locker room on the grounds that he considers himself a girl.\n\nThe rights of young girls, or their parents, who don\u2019t want to be \u201cexposed\u201d to a developing young man\u2019s genitalia, were not addressed.\n\nTuesday, like most first Tuesday\u2019s in November have recently been, was otherwise a good day for the conservative crowd.\n\nIn search of our true identity\n\nOhio said no to legalizing drugs, Houston said no to a poorly written and unnecessary anti-discrimination law, Kentuckians elected a conservative superstar, Matt Bevin, as their governor and San Francisco ousted their embattled Sheriff because of his ardent support for radical \u201csanctuary city\u201d laws.\n\nThese stories, all hugely important, will likely be overlooked by the dishonest main stream media.\n\nThis move represents a startling departure from reason and as David French articulately pointed out for National Review while writing about a similar incident in Missouri,\n\n\u201cThe controversy exploded after a girl at the school reported encountering an \u2018 intact male \u2018 in the locker room. Exposing a penis to girls in a public high school is generally considered an act of sexual harassment, not part of the sexual revolution.\u201d\n\nA sexual revolution is exactly how the left is trying to paint this issue.\n\nWhile this may sound exciting and progressive to millennials and people who desperately want to be part of a positive movement, in reality, there are few things more regressive than forcing parents to cede control of their children\u2019s lives and safety due to nothing more than the desire to create the illusion of supreme tolerance in order to pat yourself on the back for doing something good.\n\nGive me that new-time religion: Leftism\n\nThe unintended consequences of these laws are difficult to even think about, let alone write about in detail.\n\nLet\u2019s just leave it at this and be as blunt as possible without being crude. Laws like this expose children, at very young and developmentally important ages, to the naked body parts of the opposite sex on a daily basis. The rest is up to your imagination, but also don\u2019t forget we aren\u2019t just talking about locker rooms with children, laws like the one rejected Tuesday in Houston want to allow transgender citizens of any age to be allowed to use whatever bathroom they identify with.\n\nThere is absolutely a way for conservatives to win this argument.\n\nFirst of all, this issue is not about Democrats and Republicans. Or at least it shouldn\u2019t be. While I have mentioned this as a partisan issue several times, that is only the case because of the epidemic of intolerance that has been rapidly spreading throughout the Democratic party that has demanded everyone who disagrees with these kinds of rulings be publicly outed and humliated as a bigot.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame. Mostly because we are dealing with children here and these kids should be able to use the bathroom at school without having to suffer from the unintended consequences of political correctness that their parents failed to stop the government from exposing them to.\n\nThis conversation is about government overreach, protecting children, and standing up for the rights of parents to determine what their children are exposed to.\n\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect of this situation is that there is a clear solution that doesn\u2019t oppress anyone but doesn\u2019t put anyone at risk either.\n\nThe previously mentioned controversy in Missouri involved the same sort of situation where a young man who identified as a girl wanted to use the same locker room as the girls at the school.\n\nThe school initially came up with the appropriate response and allowed the young man to change in his own private bathroom which would not expose any of the girls to inappropriate graphic encounters that made the parents uncomfortable but equally as importantly would prevent the boy from being ridiculed if he had been callously banished back to the boys locker room.\n\nSounds sensible right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough for our friends on the left.\n\nThis solution was deemed to be too alienating for the young man who didn\u2019t want to be singled out.\n\nThis speaks to the crux of the issue. It is impossible to appease everyone all the time, which is why compromise is so vital whether we are talking about capitol hill, state legislatures, or a locker room in middle America.\n\nThis response from the left boils down to nothing more than a complete inability to accept less than 100% of what they want.\n\nIt\u2019s why Obamacare was a one-sided piece of legislation, it\u2019s why Democrats have refused to work with Republicans on every issue, it\u2019s why the president rules by executive fiat rather than through Congress, and it\u2019s ultimately why Congress has such an abysmal approval rating.\n\nIf you can look yourself in the mirror and claim that you have absolutely no problem with your 13-year-old child being exposed to his or her naked classmates of the opposite sex simply because that other child believes in their mind that they are a different gender, then that is a position you are entitled to.\n\nThat is in no way the position of the vast majority of parents and in no way is it the government\u2019s job or right to tell individual schools across the country that they can\u2019t decide for themselves what their children are exposed to.\n\nThere are solutions to this problem that most level headed people can agree with, but with the all-or-nothing mentality being so prevalent on the left, this battle promises to only get more fierce.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If boys wanted to peek inside the girls locker room, it used to require a peep hole.
