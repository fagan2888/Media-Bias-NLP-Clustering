(The total cost for the project was more than $750,000.)\n\nIt was quick work: excavation started in summer 1929, work on the foundation began in April 1930, with completion four months later.\n\nSome Fighting Irish fans may be dismayed to learn that Notre Dame Stadium was modeled, on a smaller scale, after the University of Michigan Stadium, constructed in 1927.\n\nTragically, famed Irish coach Knute Rockne led the Irish for only one season in the new stadium. He died the following March at age 43 in an airplane crash in Kansas.\n\nThe exhibit includes some rarely seen artifacts: a green wooden original box seat (in 1930 each box seat cost up to $2,000 to reserve), early game tickets, early helmets, original steel lockers that were removed during the 1997 renovation/expansion, and photos of Cartier Field, the 30,000-seat facility where Notre Dame home football games were played from 1900 to 1928.\n\nThe exhibit pays tribute to some of the great Irish coaches: Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, Devine and Holtz, as well as such gridiron legends as the Four Horsemen and George Gipp.\n\nThere\u2019s a wonderful 1924 letter, signed by Rockne himself, warning students who didn\u2019t buy tickets or who \u201cwere foolish enough to sell their Nebraska tickets\u201d to not attempt to crash the gate for that big game under penalty of \u201csevere disciplinary action.\u201d\n\nFans who thinks the shiny golden helmets or gold shoes the Fighting Irish players don these days are too flashy must take a close look at the 1935 uniform on display that was worn by William \u201cBill\u201d Shakespeare \u2014 nicknamed \u201cThe Bard of South Bend\u201d and \u201cThe Merchant of Menace\u201d \u2014 who played for Notre Dame from 1933 to 1935. It\u2019s vivid yellow with red and navy blue details.\n\nThere also are details about the current $400 million Campus Crossroads construction project that is adding three academic/student life buildings to the exterior of Notre Dame Stadium and room above for luxury seating.\n\nIt\u2019s an exhibit worthy of a visit for those wanting to look back \u2014 or forward.\n\nmfosmoe@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6329\n\n@mfosmoe", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "'House That Rockne Built' traces stadium from 1929", "title": "History Museum exhibit depicts Notre Dame Stadium history", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/history/history-museum-exhibit-depicts-notre-dame-stadium-history/article_2b9d4766-f153-5b02-b5c4-bc973f10f894.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f1/7f12c520-fa10-59be-8570-79ede461e9c4/5606303c48aa1.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sbtribune", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f1/7f12c520-fa10-59be-8570-79ede461e9c4/5606303c48aa1.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "description": "'House That Rockne Built' traces stadium from 1929", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "History Museum exhibit depicts Notre Dame Stadium history"}, "description": "'House That Rockne Built' traces stadium from 1929", "Published Date": "2015-09-26T05:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "keywords": "#loc,notre dame stadium,local history,notre dame football,the history museum,knute rockne,history,football,local,featured", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/131645746945348"}, "news_keywords": "#loc,notre dame stadium,local history,notre dame football,the history museum,knute rockne,history,football,local,featured"}, "article_summary": "Visitors can travel back in time to the stadium\u2019s early days in the current exhibit, \u201cThe House That Rockne Built: Notre Dame Stadium,\u201d which opened in August at The History Museum.\nSome Fighting Irish fans may be dismayed to learn that Notre Dame Stadium was modeled, on a smaller scale, after the University of Michigan Stadium, constructed in 1927.\nThere also are details about the current $400 million Campus Crossroads construction project that is adding three academic/student life buildings to the exterior of Notre Dame Stadium and room above for luxury seating.\nSOUTH BEND \u2014 As giant construction cranes are changing forever the exterior appearance of Notre Dame Stadium, now is the right time to look back on the history and lore of that famous football shrine.\nTragically, famed Irish coach Knute Rockne led the Irish for only one season in the new stadium."}
