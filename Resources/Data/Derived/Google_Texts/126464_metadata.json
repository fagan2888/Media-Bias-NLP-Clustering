That was followed by the Savannah media market, with 48,549; Augusta, 33,718; Macon, 24,095; Columbus, 20,961; and Albany, 17,339.\n\n(Note: Media market numbers sometimes go across state lines.)\n\nCindy Zeldin of Georgians for a Healthy Future said the enrollment numbers \u201cshow that the health insurance options available to Georgia consumers are meeting an important need.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving meaningful coverage choices, access to financial help, and enrollment assisters available who could help consumers make sense of their options all led to robust enrollment,\u2019\u2019 Zeldin added.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s enrollment total trailed that of Florida, Texas and North Carolina among states using the federally run exchange.\n\nThe highest rates of growth from last year\u2019s open enrollment were in Oregon (31 percent), Utah (25 percent), Iowa (22 percent), South Dakota (22 percent) and Nevada (20 percent).\n\nThe news of the enrollment increases, though, follows recent criticism of the exchanges by national health insurers.\n\nAetna said Monday that it has been struggling with customers who sign up for coverage outside the ACA\u2019s annual enrollment window and then use a lot of medical care, the Associated Press reported. This dumps claims on the insurer without providing enough premium revenue to counter those costs, the AP article noted.\n\nThe law established that window to prevent people from waiting until they become sick to buy insurance. But insurers say it has become too easy for customers to sign up outside of this window, AP reported.\n\nConsumers are allowed to buy coverage outside that time frame if they lose a job, get divorced or have a child, among other reasons. Insurers want the federal government to take a closer look at whether people actually qualify for these special enrollment periods when they apply for coverage, the article said.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently outlined several changes it said it was making to help shore up exchange enrollment windows.\n\nAnthem, parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, also is paying close attention to how the government deals with special enrollment periods as it judges how sustainable the exchange business will be in the future, CEO Joseph Swedish said recently.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has already said it will decide this year whether to participate in the exchanges next year.\n\nAnd Kaiser Health News reported that in recent days, major insurers including Anthem, stung by financial losses, told brokers they will stop paying them sales commissions to sign up most customers who qualify for new coverage outside the normal enrollment period, according to the companies and broker documents.\n\nThat has occurred in Georgia as well, documents obtained by GHN indicate.\n\nSome health insurers have told Georgia agents that they will not pay commissions on new individual health insurance policies, on or off the exchange, from a period that starts soon and lasts for the end of the year, the documents say.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "More than 580,000 Georgians signed up for coverage in the insurance exchange during the third open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, federal health officials said Thursday.", "title": "Affordable Care Act enrollment tops 587K in Ga., but insurers nervous over signup rules", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2016-02-05/affordable-care-act-enrollment-tops-587k-ga-insurers-nervous-over-signup-rules", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/AP_45293628028.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently outlined several changes it said it was making to help shore up exchange enrollment windows.\nThe news of the enrollment increases, though, follows recent criticism of the exchanges by national health insurers.\nGeorgia\u2019s enrollment total trailed that of Florida, Texas and North Carolina among states using the federally run exchange.\nConsumers are allowed to buy coverage outside that time frame if they lose a job, get divorced or have a child, among other reasons.\nATLANTA | More than 580,000 Georgians signed up for coverage in the insurance exchange during the third open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, federal health officials said Thursday."}
