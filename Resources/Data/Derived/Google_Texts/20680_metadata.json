Opponents of the tax increase have put up a slick website, betterbrooklineoverride.com, complete with an elaborate online calculator that allows residents to figure out \u201chow much more you will pay over the next six years.\u201d\n\nTo appeal to the left-leaning Brookline electorate, opponents of the tax increase have also framed their campaign carefully. They insist that they aren\u2019t opposed to any tax increase; they just want a smaller increase, in the $5 million to $6 million range rather than the $7 to $8 million range. And they stress that the tax increase could force out Brookline\u2019s middle-class residents and seniors, damaging the town\u2019s economic diversity and hurting vulnerable elderly people.\n\nA campaign opposing a $7.67 million tax increase in favor of a $6 million one instead may strike Grover Norquist types as weak beer. On the other hand, one has to start somewhere. In the language of the tax increase opponents can be found the sound of contemporary American coastal liberalism colliding with reality, and who knows where that may lead?\n\nThrift, after all, is a New England virtue, one that opponents of the tax increase wish were stressed more in their town government. \u201cMoney is not the answer to everything,\u201d a former selectman, Richard Benka, said in arguing against the tax increase at a forum hosted earlier this month by the Brookline League of Women Voters.\n\n\u201cThey are asking to fund wants, not needs,\u201d said another opponent of the tax increase who spoke at the forum, Carol Levin.\n\nThe campaign against the tax increase says on its website that it is concerned about \u201cthe philosophy of bigger and more expensive is better.\u201d It says, \u201cCurrent levels of school spending are unsustainable: even before the proposed override, spending has outpaced growth in enrollment and town revenues and far outpaced many residents\u2019 income growth.\u201d\n\nSome historical and geographical context will be helpful to outsiders. Proposition 2 \u00bd , a statewide Massachusetts ballot initiative passed in 1980, limits property tax revenues in Massachusetts and their rate of increase. Cities and towns can override Proposition 2 \u00bd; those that do so tend to have higher property taxes but also higher property values and better schools. The May 5 vote in Brookline is a Proposition 2 \u00bd override that would go along with the town\u2019s previous overrides.\n\nChoices on these issues by local voters has significant effects. The border between Brookline and neighboring Boston isn\u2019t like the light versus dark in those NASA photos of South and North Korea, but it is nevertheless a significant dividing line, so much so that the same house might be worth $100,000 or $200,000 more on the Brookline side than on the Boston side. Residents of properties that straddle the line have launched elaborate campaigns to send their children to Brookline schools rather than Boston schools, and Brookline has responded with similarly elaborate campaigns to keep them out. The status quo, so far as I can tell, has to do not only with the location, relative to the Brookline-Boston border, of the bedroom in which the prospective student sleeps, but also, within the bedroom, the location of the prospective student\u2019s bed, and his or her sleeping body, relative to the border. This all has to do, too, not only with taxes but also with race and with Boston\u2019s legacy of court-ordered busing and school desegregation versus Brookline\u2019s neighborhood schools.\n\nMeanwhile, Brookline has changed; its most famous residents are no longer Larry Bird and Michael Dukakis; they are now Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, and John Henry.\n\nMore famous than any of them is John F. Kennedy, the Democratic politician whose birthplace on Beals Street in Brookline is a National Historic Site. It was Kennedy, campaigning in Pennsylvania in the closing days of the 1960 presidential race, who said, \u201cThe property tax in most urban communities has reached the point of diminishing returns\u2026I come from a city where the property tax is about $103 or $104 per thousand dollars, and the assessments reasonably high, and at that point I say it becomes confiscatory.\u201d\n\nIf Brookline\u2019s brewing tax rebellion has a national impact, let\u2019s just say it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A rebellion is brewing in liberal Brookline, Massachusetts over raising property taxes.", "title": "When Liberalism Finally Collides With Reality", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/04/27/when-liberalism-collides-with-reality", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14301596147112.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14301596147112.jpg", "description": "A rebellion is brewing in liberal Brookline, Massachusetts over raising property taxes.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "When Liberalism Finally Collides With Reality"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Economics", "published_time": "2015-04-27T20:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92be\"", "article_summary": "In the language of the tax increase opponents can be found the sound of contemporary American coastal liberalism colliding with reality, and who knows where that may lead?\nA campaign opposing a $7.67 million tax increase in favor of a $6 million one instead may strike Grover Norquist types as weak beer.\nDriving or walking through the streets here, one sees more than a few \u201cNO on #1\u201d lawn signs urging votes against the tax increase.\n\u201cThey are asking to fund wants, not needs,\u201d said another opponent of the tax increase who spoke at the forum, Carol Levin.\nProposition 2 \u00bd , a statewide Massachusetts ballot initiative passed in 1980, limits property tax revenues in Massachusetts and their rate of increase."}
