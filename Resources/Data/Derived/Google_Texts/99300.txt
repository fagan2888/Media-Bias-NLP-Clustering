Skaneateles, N.Y. â€” The federal medical device tax had nothing to do with Welch Allyn Inc.'s decision to be acquired by Chicago-based Hill-Rom, the senior executive at Hill-Rom said Wednesday.

"The medical device tax has been in effect for three years and nobody in the industry is in favor of it, but I don't think it had any impact on the decision," said John Greisch, president and CEO of Hill-Rom.

Greisch and Welch Allyn President and CEO Stephen Meyer said the $2.05 billion acquisition by Hill-Rom was driven by a need for both companies to compete more effectively on a global scale.

U.S. Rep. John Katko, R-Camillus, said earlier Wednesday that the 2.3 percent excise tax on medical equipment made it impossible for Skaneateles-based Welch Allyn to compete and forced it to seek a buyer.

His comments came in a speech on the House floor in which he called for repeal of the tax, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have also vowed to repeal.

Erin O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Katco, said his comments were based on prior discussions with executives at Welch Allyn and other medical equipment makers.
