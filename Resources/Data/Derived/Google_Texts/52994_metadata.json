Essentially, it helps to \u201csmooth out losses\u201d for insurance companies operating in the Obamacare individual market.\n\nRelated: UnitedHealth Makes Good on Threat to Pull Out of Obamacare\n\nBut a tax imposed on all insurers in the country to fund the TRP and simultaneously bolster the U.S. Treasury has proven to be grossly inadequate. And an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services decided in 2014 to shift most of the funds to the reinsurance program without consulting Congress.\n\nThe diversion of billions in funds is the latest in a series of controversies around the Affordable Care Act\u2019s operations and funding. Earlier this month, United Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurance company, said it was pulling out of most of the ACA exchanges where it currently operates by 2017 because of serious losses. And a multitude of financial and management problems forced nearly half of the original 23 non-profit insurance coops out of business by late last year.\n\nEarlier this month, Republicans on a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee grilled HHS official Andy Slavitt concerning his agency\u2019s decision to divert funds away from the Treasury, which some denounced as an insurance industry \u201cbailout\u201d that comes at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA), argued that decision was unlawful because the Affordable Care Act specifically states that the Treasury would receive funding, according to the Morning Consult.\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s Bait and Switch Has Left Consumers Scrambling in 2016\n\n\u201cThe administration cannot rewrite its own law to make it more convenient for special interests,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis is a dangerous precedent and is an affront to the separation of powers. . . Moreover, this program funnels money to insurers \u2014 now with money intended for the Treasury \u2014 in an attempt to prop up Obamacare.\u201d\n\nA new legal opinion prepared by former GOP White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray for the conservative, free-market Galen Institute, concludes that Slavitt\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is diverting $3.5 billion to insurance companies it was \u201clegally obliged to remit to the Treasury.\u201d\n\nThe letter \u2013 reported this week by Forbes \u2013 said, \u201cBy the time the books close on TRP for the 2014 and 2015 benefit years at the end of 2016,\u201d insurers eligible for reinsurance \u201cwill likely have received 98 percent of expected payments\u201d \u2013 or $15.6 billion out of an expected $16 billion.\n\nBy contrast, the Treasury will likely have received only 12 percent of expected payments, or just $495 million out of an anticipated $4 billion, according to the letter.\n\nTRP is one of three special programs created under the Affordable Care Act to protect the financial interests of the health insurers that ventured into a new and untested market.\n\nRelated: Uninsured Rate Hits New Low, but Obamacare\u2019s Still a Hot Potato\n\nThe so-called \u201crisk corridor\u201d program was designed to limit losses or gains beyond an allowable range. Insurers that made more than the allowable gains were obliged to return part of it to the program, while companies that badly underestimated their coverage costs could dip into the fund to avert losses.\n\nBut Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and other congressional Republicans criticized the risk corridors as another industry bailout and forced sharp cuts in the program\u2019s funding over the past two years. Last October, the administration had no choice but to provide 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that insurers were seeking to offset losses.\n\nThe controversy over the TRP is different because it relates to efforts to hold down premiums and it involves revenues raised by taxing the entire health care industry, not just those insurers taking part in Obamacare.\n\nSlavitt, the acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, defended his agency\u2019s decision to divert Treasury funds to the TRP during his appearance before the House subcommittee this month.\n\nRelated: More Bad News for the Remaining Obamacare Co-ops\n\nSlavitt, who was not at CMS when the decision was made, told lawmakers that it is common for federal agencies to update regulations as officials learn more, according to Morning Consult. While insisting that the agency did indeed have the legal authority, he conceded that the statute was unclear as to what officials should do if the reinsurance pool wasn\u2019t as large as expected.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said on Tuesday that the controversy highlights the \u201cporousness\u201d of the Obamacare reinsurance provision. \u201cIf the administration gets away with this, the process will become hollow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number was written into law, so it shouldn\u2019t have been confusing at all, and the policy action wasn\u2019t taken,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIn other words, the money never got to the Treasury.\u201d\n\nHe said that Gray\u2019s analysis was essentially right, but that he doubted the controversy would be resolved this year, before the election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some lawmakers are still seething over an administration decision nearly two years ago", "title": "Obamacare Insurers Received More than $15 Billion in Taxpayer \u2018Bailouts\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/25/Obamacare-Insurers-Received-More-15-Billion-Taxpayer-Bailouts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/25/Obamacare-Insurers-Received-More-15-Billion-Taxpayer-Bailouts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some lawmakers are still seething over an administration decision nearly two years ago", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said on Tuesday that the controversy highlights the \u201cporousness\u201d of the Obamacare reinsurance provision.\nEarlier this month, United Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurance company, said it was pulling out of most of the ACA exchanges where it currently operates by 2017 because of serious losses.\nAnd an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services decided in 2014 to shift most of the funds to the reinsurance program without consulting Congress.\nLast October, the administration had no choice but to provide 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that insurers were seeking to offset losses.\nEssentially, it helps to \u201csmooth out losses\u201d for insurance companies operating in the Obamacare individual market."}
