Make every word in that introduction count\u2014and yes, font matters. If you don\u2019t want your cover letter to end up forlorn and neglected, keep reading.\n\n1. The first rule? Don\u2019t be boring.\n\nHiring managers and recruiters read\u2014and eliminate\u2014hundreds of cover letters a day, until the words all blur together:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m self-motivated and determined with a passion for...\u201d\n\n\u201cI can manage a team up close or at a distance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking for a position that utilizes my skills\u201d\n\nEvery time you use a generic phrase or sentence to describe yourself and your capabilities, you sound nondescript and forgettable. At best, you appear pleasantly bland. At worst, you present no good or compelling reason for a company to hire you over anybody else, which leads me to my second point.\n\nRelated: 12 Creative Resumes That Worked\n\n2. Be specific and share relevant details. This mandate starts right at the top. If you can\u2019t figure out the name of the person who will be reading your resume from the LinkedIn job posting, or the company\u2019s Twitter account or website, simply address your letter to \u201cDear Hiring Manager.\u201d This move will also let you bypass the formality of \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d or the quaint, catch-me-if-I-faint \u201cDear Sir or Madam,\u201d which sounds like a relic from Downtown Abbey\u2014and not in a good way.\n\nDo use the cover letter to reveal important details and skills about you\u2014and any salient work experiences. But don\u2019t overuse the pronoun \u201cI.\u201d If your letter focuses more on you than on what you can do for the company, you\u2019re sending a dubious message.\n\n3. Don\u2019t dawdle. Get to the point\u2014and fast. Use bullets or numbers to show why your experience and accomplishments fit with the employer\u2019s stated strategic plan. Most publicly traded companies reference the company\u2019s goals in annual reports, which are published on their investor site.\n\n4. Structure your cover letter as a series of problems and challenges that you\u2018ve successfully met. Identify issues that you\u2019ve helped to solve or fix. Avoid a linear, chronological summary. And don\u2019t exaggerate or lie\u2014you\u2019ll be caught, eventually.\n\nRelated: Lie on a Resume and You May Lose More Than a Job\n\n5. Resist the temptation to use the same cover letter for every application. I can see why using one cover letter as a template seems like a good idea while job-hunting, but hear me out--this is too easy to mess up. What if you forget to swap out the job title or the company name? You come off looking careless and sloppy. And what happens if you address your cover letter to the wrong person because you forgot to update the contact information? Awkward!\n\nThese mistakes completely derail that \u201cdetail-oriented\u201d image you were trying so hard to convey to your future employer in the first place. In fact, every typo and mistake you make on your universal cover letter will be repeated on future job applications until you catch the mistake. Your typo will be multiplied every time you hit send. Always proofread correspondence. Don\u2019t assume what you wrote last week or last month is still valid or correct.\n\nRelated: The Amazing Resume Everyone\u2019s Talking About\n\n6. Don\u2019t just repeat what\u2019s already on your resume. Your cover letter connects the dots and bullet-points of your resume in an inspiring narrative or highlights reel. Plus, your cover letter needs to stand as a complete document on its own, especially if the hiring manager hasn\u2019t had a chance to read your resume yet.\n\n7. Follow instructions. If the application asks you for a salary range, then include it. If not, don\u2019t volunteer this information until you\u2019re asked. Same goes for start dates and dates of availability for interviews. A cover letter has one purpose, and one purpose only\u2014to get your foot in the door.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A cover letter doesn\u2019t just serve as an introduction to your resume, in many cases it\u2019", "title": "Looking for a Job? 7 Deadly Cover Letter Mistakes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Looking-Job-7-Deadly-Cover-Letter-Mistakes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05142011_job_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Looking-Job-7-Deadly-Cover-Letter-Mistakes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05142011_job_article.jpg", "creator": "@SuelainMoy", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A cover letter doesn\u2019t just serve as an introduction to your resume, in many cases it\u2019", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And what happens if you address your cover letter to the wrong person because you forgot to update the contact information?\nA cover letter has one purpose, and one purpose only\u2014to get your foot in the door.\nDo use the cover letter to reveal important details and skills about you\u2014and any salient work experiences.\nIf you don\u2019t want your cover letter to end up forlorn and neglected, keep reading.\nResist the temptation to use the same cover letter for every application."}
