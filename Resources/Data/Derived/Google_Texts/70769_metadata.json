Nikki Haley led South Carolina to \u201copt out\u201d of Medicaid expansion funded through Obamacare, it was merely a political move. Some health care advocates hoped that after a few years, the state would buy-in to expansion because of billions of dollars offered by the federal government.\n\nTwo years down the line, there has been little movement in state government to expand the state health care program, despite a vexing \u201ccoverage\u201d gap between Obamacare and the state\u2019s program that left tens of thousands without the real possibility of health insurance.\n\nAccording to several observers and experts on state health care, able-bodied residents making between 70 percent and 100 percent of household poverty wages are not covered by either the state or the federal health care programs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently released information that more than 80,000 South Carolinians suffering from mental health and addiction issues would \u201cbenefit\u201d from expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe federal government has offered states 100 percent of the funds it would take states to cover Medicaid expansion until 2017, when the buy-in would begin to shrink 5 percent every year. Past estimates of those in South Carolina caught in this coverage gap, overall, has ranged from ranged between 200,000 to more than 700,000.\n\nThe new conventional wisdom\n\nConventional wisdom now has it that nothing will be done until after the November elections when everyone in the Senate is safe for a couple of years.\n\nHolley Ulbrich, an economist at the Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson University, argues that \u201cnothing happens in this state happens until the January right after the Senate is reelected.\u201d She pointed to 1990 when the legislature passed legislation creating special local option sales taxes as the \u201cmost upstanding example.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean state Sen. Joel Lourie (D-Columbia) is going to take it sitting down this year.\n\nAn insurance broker and consultant not running for reelection, Lourie has vowed to argue for expansion when proposed budget bills hit the floor of the Senate in coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not overly optimistic, as something this big has got to start with the governor,\u201d said Lourie. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not just a fiscal issue, but a moral one, too. A lot is said from the podium in the Senate about faith. But there is nothing in my faith, or in the Judeo-Christian value system, about leaving these people behind.\u201d\n\nOften, he said, potential customers, especially working single mothers, walk into his office intent on buying health insurance, only to find they are in that coverage gap.\n\n\u201cThe working poor are getting screwed, there is no other way to say that \u2026 maybe they\u2019re \u2018getting the short end of the stick\u2019 would be more diplomatic,\u201d Lourie fumed.\n\nLourie\u2019s isn\u2019t the only voice in the Senate passionate about the issue. State Sen. Kevin Bryant (R-Anderson), a pharmacist and chairman of the General Committee, has been a consistent foe of expansion and Obamacare.\n\nThis week, Bryant confirmed his opposition, saying the state must \u201cbreak the cycle of dependency\u201d on the taxpayers\u2019 wallets.\n\nState Sen. Tom Davis (R-Beaufort), also a foe, introduced a bill this week that could enhance residents\u2019 ability to \u201cshop\u201d for better health care coverage.\n\nThe bill would, in part, require insurance companies to \u201cshare\u201d as much as 40 percent of cost-savings with patients who comparison-shopped.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to give consumers a chance to take control of their health care costs by making the prices transparent for health care services, rewarding consumers who shop for savings, and introducing market forces to lower costs and increase options,\u201d said Davis, a frequent champion of the free market over government action.\n\nThe S.C. Hospital Association thinks it\u2019s time that the legislature did something to address the coverage gap, according to its executive vice president Allan Stalvey.\n\nStalvey said a majority of the 31 states that expanded Medicaid with federal buy-ins have reported generally positive fiscal impacts.\n\nUlbrich, who also holds a degree in theology, said, \u201cThis is the rare instance where what is fiscally-prudent coincides with the morally-justified path of action.\u201d\n\nStalvey said that programs in Southern states like Arkansas and Kentucky have shown that state-funded, privately-managed hybrid expansion of Medicaid could also work in South Carolina.\n\nIn fact, the hospital association commissioned a study that found exactly that, said Stalvey, who added, \u201cBut why take our word for it?\u201d\n\nAs such, the association is backing an effort in the House to set aside a chunk of state money and study it before the next legislative session. \u201cWho can argue against a study?\u201d asked Stalvey.\n\nBryant said he would have to \u201cstudy very closely\u201d any call to take taxpayer money for such a study.\n\n\u201cWell, then,,\u201d replied Stalvey, \u201chire a conservative firm like Arkansas did; a very conservative firm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Nikki Haley led South Carolina to \u201copt out\u201d of Medicaid expansion funded through Obamacare, it was merely a political move.\nBy Bill Davis, senior editor | Looks like \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d was wrong, or at least delayed, when it came to health care in South Carolina.\nAccording to several observers and experts on state health care, able-bodied residents making between 70 percent and 100 percent of household poverty wages are not covered by either the state or the federal health care programs.\nThe federal government has offered states 100 percent of the funds it would take states to cover Medicaid expansion until 2017, when the buy-in would begin to shrink 5 percent every year.\nSome health care advocates hoped that after a few years, the state would buy-in to expansion because of billions of dollars offered by the federal government."}
