CMS proposed similar changes in reimbursement for a number of established molecular diagnostic tests, according to Maag.\n\n[Also: Top revenue cycle stories of 2015]\n\nThough with the \"the best intentions\" CMS erred in its method to determine price based on erroneous comparisons, Maag said.\n\nAn estimated 40 percent of heart transplant patients are covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nThe blood test determines whether a recipient is rejecting the new organ.\n\nThe only alternative is an invasive biopsy that takes out snippets of a patient's heart, said Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute surgeon Dr. Jon Kobashigawa.\n\n\"Without this test we will be compelled to rely on the heart biopsy,\" Kobashigawa said. \"This proposal leads to taxpayers paying more money for heart transplant care, while leaving patients with a more invasive and stressful biopsy procedure as their only alternative.\"\n\nThe AlloMap test is currently used by 110 of 130 transplant centers in the United States, according to CareDx.\n\nThe new clinical laboratory fee goes into effect Jan. 1, 2016. CMS is taking open comment until November 24, prior to issuing final guidance.\n\n\"We're led to believe CMS is open-minded,\" said CareDx attorney Lanny Davis. \"In the next 30 days we're optimistic they will hear us, they will invite us to provide additional information.\"\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/caredx-says-cut-reimbursement-rate-blood-test-could-put-it-out-business", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/closed-sign-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "CareDx in California is pushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to keep the current reimbursement price for its heart transplant blood test AlloMap, or the company may have to close, according to CEO Peter Maag.", "title": "CareDx says cut to reimbursement for blood test could put it out of business"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/closed-sign-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "CareDx in California is pushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to keep the current reimbursement price for its heart transplant blood test AlloMap, or the company may have to close, according to CEO Peter Maag.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CareDx says cut to reimbursement for blood test could put it out of business"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "CareDx in California is pushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to keep the current reimbursement price for its heart transplant blood test AlloMap, or the company may have to close, according to CEO Peter Maag.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The AlloMap test is currently used by 110 of 130 transplant centers in the United States, according to CareDx.\nAn estimated 40 percent of heart transplant patients are covered by Medicare, he said.\nCMS proposed similar changes in reimbursement for a number of established molecular diagnostic tests, according to Maag.\nCareDx in California is pushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to keep the current reimbursement price for its heart transplant blood test AlloMap, or the company may have to close, according to CEO Peter Maag.\n\"Without this test we will be compelled to rely on the heart biopsy,\" Kobashigawa said."}
