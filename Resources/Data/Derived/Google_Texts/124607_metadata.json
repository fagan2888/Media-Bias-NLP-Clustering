Schimmel, Umatilla, had her second face-off with Tulsa Shock's point guard Angel Goodrich, Cherokee, who scored 6 points and had 1 assist.\n\nWhen asked what the biggest factor is in how well her team plays at home, Schimmel told ICTMN, We feel the energy from our fans. We get that on the road, but at the same time, we are in our home; this is our atmosphere, and we know the court pretty well.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Shoni Schimmel's Dream Jersey Is No. 1 Seller in WNBA\n\nAfter the final home game, ICTMN caught up with Schimmel and asked her a few questions about her accomplishments as a rookie and how she\u2019s preparing for the playoffs.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, will you add or change anything to your routine?\n\nNot at all, I\u2019m just going out there and having fun playing basketball.\n\nAny playoff predictions?\n\nNo. Honestly we are in a good place right now from the past two games. And we got back on track from where we were (referring to the 6 straight losses on the road).\n\nWill your family get to attend any playoff games?\n\nI think it depends on where the playoffs are, but hopefully they\u2019ll get there.\n\nAs you look back over your rookie year, which of your many accomplishments are you most proud of?\n\nI would say the MVP and playing in the All-star game was huge. My whole rookie year has been a great learning experience and it's been a lot of fun.\n\nThe Dream\u2019s first playoff game is Friday, August 22 against the Chicago Sky.
