LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Last year, the state paid out $30 million for medical patients to ride in ambulances.



It's an example of the huge costs of providing healthcare for people on Medicaid and Medicare.



Healthcare providers working to reduce those costs are looking to a new program that aims to bridge a gap in care.



At the UAMS emergency room in Little Rock, doctors treat some of the sickest patients in the state.



"When they get discharged from the hospital, they get a long list of things they have to do," said Danny Bercher, director of UAMS Emergency Medical Sciences.



Many end up back in the emergency room, running up big bills for ambulance rides and taking up limited space, even when their condition is not an emergency.



"They really just can't get their head around what they need to do," Bercher said.



Part of the Affordable Care Act penalizes hospitals who re-admit patients within 30 days.



One of the ways providers are working to avoid fines and improve care is through a new concept called community paramedics.



"Those visits are a lot different than when a paramedic comes to someone's home in an emergency mode," Bercher said.



Community paramedics are trained to offer a wide array of services from cardiac monitoring to connecting patients with social services.



"We're working with the health department and the EMS community to write the rules and regulations," said John Swanson, MEMS Executive Director.



MEMS hopes to launch its own program over the next few months.



30 students have graduated through the course at UAMS since it first started two years ago. Professor Bercher said it combines healthcare with getting to know the patient on a deeper level.



"The specialty is understanding community health and community health approaches for patients and family members," he said.
