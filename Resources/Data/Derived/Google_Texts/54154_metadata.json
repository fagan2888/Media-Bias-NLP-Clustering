They saw sheets of metal and pieces of wood standing together in what looked to be a hut, certainly too small to house an individual, yet it housed a family of six.\n\nOr more.\n\nThey saw children playing in this world of trash, their feet bare or maybe wearing one sandal with a broken strap, their faces dirty with the soot that coats the mountain of garbage known as Smokey Mountain that rises more than 100 feet in the worst slum in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.\n\nAnd those children, dressed in tattered clothes and perhaps playing with what was left of a toy or a doll, smiled through those dirty faces.\n\n\u201cIt was the best eye-opening experience I ever had,\u201d Mikaela Souza said.\n\nIn November, Mikaela and her husband, Rays right fielder Steve Souza Jr., traveled to the Philippines with a small group as part of a faith mission organized by Unlimited Potential Inc. (UPI), a Christian organization dedicated to using baseball and baseball players to spread the word of God.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe Souzas visited orphanages, schools and a mission that was a refugee for girls rescued from sex trafficking.\n\nThey held baseball clinics and shared their faith.\n\nWhenever Souza saw a group of children playing basketball, he joined in, dunking the ball to shrieks of laughter. At 6-foot-4, he was the biggest person around.\n\nThey walked through some of the poorest villages and yelled, \u201cFeeding! Feeding!\u201d And those living there \u2014 the young and the old \u2014 left their tiny huts and eagerly accepted the food, which Souza described as an oatmeal-like mixture of rice, vegetables, protein and nutrients.\n\n\u201cWe were there for 10 days, and they did more for me than I will ever be able to do for them,\u201d Souza said.\n\nThe Souzas traveled to the Philippines with Brewers pitcher Chase Anderson and his wife and Brian Hommel, who organizes the missions for UPI.\n\nHommel has been going to Manila since 1996. Five years ago, he included Smokey Mountain as part of the trip.\n\n\u201cEveryone is impacted by it to some degree,\u201d Hommel said.\n\nSmokey Mountain is a garbage dump. Trucks pull up daily filled with refuse. Over the years, it has grown so high you can see the prosperous parts of Manila from the top. It gets its name from the fires caused by the methane gas that escapes from the garbage.\n\nMany of those who live on Smokey Mountain or in the slums at its base left their villages for the promise of a better life in Manila. But having not found employment and with families to feed, they are pushed toward the slum, where they pick through the garbage for recyclables that can earn them a few dollars or burn the wood to make charcoal to sell.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe trip to Smokey Mountain is long and includes a van ride to a train, then a tricycle ride to the slum. Normally, Hommel\u2019s trips there did not include a hike to the summit. But for some reason, the Souzas and Andersons asked to make the climb.\n\n\u201cI totally believed there was divine intervention that we were sent up there,\u201d Souza said.\n\nThey encountered children of all ages playing in the garbage, even some, Souza said, who appeared to be eating dirt.\n\n\u201cEverybody on the mountain is covered in ash. They are black,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just was crazy. You just don\u2019t see those types of things in your lifetime.\u201d\n\nNear the top of the mountain, the group saw a tiny hut that was home to a family of eight. The father, Souza said, was in jail after sexually assaulting one of his daughters. The mother held her baby, a 1-year-old boy who looked to be about six months, Mikaela Souza said.\n\nOn the baby\u2019s head was a growth. Was it a tumor? The result of a cut that had become infected? An insect bite?\n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Souza asked Hommel.\n\nWith the family in tow, the group brought the baby and his mother to a pastor, who was able to get the baby to a hospital. That was a blessing for the family, Hommel said, because those who live in Manila\u2019s slums are often not admitted to a hospital because they can\u2019t pay for the treatment.\n\nThe baby stayed a week. The growth was removed. The Souzas and Andersons paid the hospital bill.\n\n\u201cThat was the ultimate blessing,\u201d Souza said.\n\nSouza has been on missions before. He traveled to Thailand in 2012. He and Mikaela have worked with the homeless here in the United States.\n\n\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t ready for this,\u201d Souza said. \u201cWe left there with so much humility, and honored to interact with these families. We left with a mindset that we don\u2019t need to have all this stuff. It\u2019s nice to have great things, and we\u2019ve been blessed in our lives to this point. But what do we need on a daily basis and let\u2019s try to live within our means and by that way, whatever we\u2019ve been given in excesses by the Lord we can spread around us.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nMikaela said whenever she hears friends and family say they are starving as they are about to sit down and eat, she looks over at her husband.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not starving. The people in Manila are starving,\u201d Mikaela said. \u201cWe\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nThe Souzas would like to return to Manila, to Smokey Mountain, because as Hommel predicted, they were affected by it.\n\nAmericans are obsessed with possessions, Souza said. The more we have, the more comfortable life is, or so goes the belief. In the poorest villages in the Philippines and in the slums around and on top of Smokey Mountain, possessions are what other people threw out. That\u2019s why the smiles of the children stood out.\n\n\u201cUp there, it\u2019s tough to find joy,\u201d Souza said, \u201cbut they find joy in themselves.\u201d\n\nSo what if Souza struggled through an injury interrupted season in 2015. So what if his start to camp this year is delayed by an intercostal strain.\n\nYou want to see real problems? Look at a family huddled inside a tiny hut constructed of garbage that sits on a pile of trash. See a mother who can\u2019t feed her children because her husband, who used to find what he could to sell from the garbage, is in jail for assaulting one of the girls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling. Your bad days are nothing like theirs,\u201d Mikaela said. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nBut see how that family enjoyed the company of strangers. How the kids smiled through their dirty faces while someone took their picture. How excited the children were during the ride to the hospital with their mother and baby brother. How thankful the mother was to see her baby receive proper medical care.\n\n\u201cIn that area of the world, it\u2019s so easy to be neglected,\u201d Souza said. \u201cJust to show people you care and you\u2019re loved and no matter what the situation is, we\u2019re here for you. It puts a smile on their face.\u201d\n\nrmooney@tampatrib.com\n\nTwitter: @rmooneyTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 28 Feb 2016 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Rays right fielder Steve Souza Jr. and wife Mikaela  traveled to the Philippines with a small group as part of a faith mission organized by Unlimited Potential Inc.
