Dan\u2019s thoughts can be found in bylined articles in most major publications for financial planners and a slew of financial planning related publications have featured him as one of America\u2019s top advisors and was recently named one of \"15 transformational advisers\" by InvestmentNews. A past national President of the Financial Planning Association (FPA), his service to the profession includes three years on the CFP Board of Practice Standards crafting the standards to which all US CFP\u2019s must adhere and serving as Chairman of the CFP Board\u2019s Discipline and Ethics commission, the body that judges complaints against CFP licensees. A frequent presenter at such events in the U.S., Dan has spoken to planner groups on five continents and in recent years has led delegations of U.S. planners to Russia and China on behalf of the FPA.\n\nBloomberg\n\nQ. Dear Mr. Moisand, Thank you for your column, \"Be careful of the 'wash sale' rules when taking losses.\" I have a disallowed loss for 2015 tax. What if I sell this position during 2016, but in less than 30 days after, I buy back the same position? Thanks for your help. \u2014 Jean C\n\nA. Jean each transaction is treated separately. If you sell the position for a loss in 2016 and buy it back less than 30 days later, that transaction has no affect on 2015 taxes, The loss will be disallowed on your 2016 return and the buy back will necessitate a basis adjustment.\n\nIn the Q&A column you referenced, I used an example of a person that sold for a $2,000 loss on $10,000 but bought the holding back within 30 days for $7,000. The $2,000 loss was disallowed but added to the purchase price for new total basis of $9,000.\n\nSay that sometime in 2016, the holding is sold for $5,000. That is another $2,000 loss from the recent $7,000 buy but the basis was $9,000 so you would have a $4,000 loss taken in 2016.\n\nNow if you again buy it back within 30 days of the sale, you have another wash sale. The loss will not be usable yet, but it is added to the purchase price to establish the basis. If you did that buy back for $3,000, your basis would be $7,000.\n\nThis chain of transactions started with two transactions both resulting in $2,000 losses. If we sold this position more than 30 days after buying it, the chain stops.\n\nLet's pretend the holding rises to $7,000 and you make a chain-ending sale for $7,000. Since the basis is $7,000, there is neither a loss nor a gain. That probably looks odd since you started with a $10,000 buy and ended with a $7,000 sale. Add up all the buys and sells and you'll see how the chain reflects the economic impact of the transactions.\n\nIn our example, you spent $10,000, $7,000 and $3,000 on the buys for a total of $20,000. You sold and received $8,000, $5,000 and $7,000 also for a total of $20,000.\n\nThat is not to say the wash-sale rules are no big deal. The accounting chore alone can be a bit of a pain. Moreover, in the case where a loss would be of more value in one year than another, the timing of transactions and thus when the realization of the loss occurs can be critical.\n\nDan Moisand's comments are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for personalized advice.
