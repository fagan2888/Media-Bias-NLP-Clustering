By other accounts, it was the conservatives who had rolled Ryan, denying him the full endorsement he had requested (the Freedom Caucus requires 80 percent agreement to endorse someone) and undercutting his ability to enforce the demands he made earlier this week around conditions of his service.\n\nRelated: The Knives Come Out for Paul Ryan on the GOP\u2019s Right Wing\n\nThe back story is that the Freedom Caucus -- after forcing Boehner\u2019s resignation and rejecting his likeliest successor, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy -- forced House Republicans to scramble for a candidate who could get the support of the majority of the Republican caucus.\n\nRyan, after multiple statements indicating he preferred to stay on as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, eventually succumbed to intense pressure to run, but only under certain conditions. He demanded the endorsement of three main caucuses within the House GOP, including the Freedom Caucus. He also required that his duties allow him considerable time with his young family. And he required that the process by which a single member can introduce a privileged motion to \u201cvacate the chair\u201d \u2013 essentially booting the speaker from his job \u2013 be changed so that he wouldn\u2019t have to live under constant threat of losing his job.\n\nThe demands didn\u2019t sit well with many on the far right of the political spectrum, including the outside pressure groups that have been pressing conservative members of the House to stand together and demand major changes to how the institution is organized and run, most of which would devolve greater power to individual members and committees.\n\nThe ultra-conservative group Tea Party Patriots immediately plastered a \u201cStop Paul Ryan\u201d banner across its website with the message: \u201cSo Paul Ryan wants to be Speaker as long as he can never be removed. He wants all future Speakers to never fear retribution from Members of Congress for doing a bad job. This is just another reason why Paul Ryan does not need to be the next Speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nRelated: Meet the Freedom Caucus, the Group Inflaming Washington\n\nWhen it came out that in a Wednesday evening meeting with the Freedom Caucus Ryan secured the support of more than two-thirds of the group, other conservatives were outraged.\n\nThe conservative website Breitbart.com declared in a headline, \u201cPaul Ryan Sold the House Freedom Caucus a Bill of Goods.\u201d\n\nThe story, by Matthew Boyle, alleged that Ryan had made \u201csecret\u201d promises to the Freedom Caucus members, swaying enough of them to gain the support of a majority while failing to achieve the group\u2019s 80 percent threshold for an endorsement.\n\nBoyle pointed out that Ryan had said he would only proceed if he received an endorsement from the three major House caucuses. If Ryan were to move forward with a majority but no endorsement, he would be \u201cbreaking a promise\u201d to them.\n\nRelated: This Week Could Blow the Lid Off Congress\n\n\u201cWill they believe him on everything else he told them in that room?\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf they do vote for him, and he doesn\u2019t deliver all these things, the Freedom Caucus becomes politically irrelevant. If they don\u2019t believe him after the first move he\u2019d make is breaking a promise \u2013 to Americans and to his GOP colleagues about a condition that would need to be filled for him to run for Speaker \u2013 it\u2019s entirely possible the Freedom Caucus members who previously would have supported Ryan turn on him in the coming days.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying, though,\u201d Boyle added, \u201cthat Ryan is a brilliant strategist who cooked this whole master plan up from the beginning.\u201d\n\nNot all conservative activists were as downcast, though. Larry Ward, president of the Constitutional Rights PAC and organizer of a coalition of a groups banded together under the \u201cFire Paul Rayan\u201d campaign, said that the result of Ryan\u2019s meeting with the Freedom Caucus might be seen as a win for conservatives.\n\n\u201cRyan vowed to only run if he got their endorsement,\u201d Ward said by email. \u201cHe did not. Now if he runs, his demands are off the table and his promises to the Freedom Caucus are on the table. The Caucus may have outfoxed the \u2018smart\u2019 one for now, but lots is likely to change before the vote next week.\u201d\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan\u2019s Nod from the Freedom Caucus Clears His Run for Speaker\n\nConservative pundit Erick Erickson was similarly optimistic. \u201cThis is the best of both worlds. Paul Ryan can move to the Speaker\u2019s chair and the House Freedom Caucus held its ground against a coordinated campaign to box them into an untenable position with an endorsement,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI hope the House conservatives pay attention to this,\u201d Erickson continued. \u201cThey stayed united, they did not give Ryan an endorsement, but two-thirds of their members were willing to go along with Paul Ryan as Speaker while rejecting Ryan\u2019s preconditions.\u201d\n\nThe lack of an outright endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, at least in theory, gives Ryan an out if he decides he really doesn\u2019t want what appears to be a completely thankless job. However, the indications at the moment are that he will push forward with his run for speaker and that he will have the votes to take the chair when Boehner vacates it next week.\n\nHow he will run the House \u2013 or try to run it, at least \u2013 remains unclear.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The news that Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan had persuaded a large majority of the House of Representatives\u2019 most conservative element to support his bid for Speaker of the House left the conservative movement outside the country \u2013 which had been rabidly against a Ryan speakership hours before \u2013 rather confused.", "title": "Did Paul Ryan Outsmart the Freedom Caucus?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Did-Paul-Ryan-Outsmart-Freedom-Caucus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08132012_Paul_Ryan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Did-Paul-Ryan-Outsmart-Freedom-Caucus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08132012_Paul_Ryan_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The news that Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan had persuaded a large majority of the House of Representatives\u2019 most conservative element to support his bid for Speaker of the House left the conservative movement outside the country \u2013 which had been rabidly against a Ryan speakership hours before \u2013 rather confused.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc92b\"", "article_summary": "The ultra-conservative group Tea Party Patriots immediately plastered a \u201cStop Paul Ryan\u201d banner across its website with the message: \u201cSo Paul Ryan wants to be Speaker as long as he can never be removed.\nThis is just another reason why Paul Ryan does not need to be the next Speaker of the House.\u201dRelated: Meet the Freedom Caucus, the Group Inflaming WashingtonWhen it came out that in a Wednesday evening meeting with the Freedom Caucus Ryan secured the support of more than two-thirds of the group, other conservatives were outraged.\n\u201cIf they do vote for him, and he doesn\u2019t deliver all these things, the Freedom Caucus becomes politically irrelevant.\nNow if he runs, his demands are off the table and his promises to the Freedom Caucus are on the table.\nPaul Ryan can move to the Speaker\u2019s chair and the House Freedom Caucus held its ground against a coordinated campaign to box them into an untenable position with an endorsement,\u201d he wrote."}
