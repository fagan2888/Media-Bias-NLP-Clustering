The way he describes it, his work is a reason why repairing your torn rotator cuff no longer requires opening up your shoulder.\n\n\u201cIt really has created a paradigm shift in shoulder surgery,\u201d Burkhart says, and cut infection rates to less than .01% from 2%. \u201cThat alone is saving a huge amount of misery and cost to the health-care system.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t dispute the reported payments, which he says are royalties on the more than 25 patents he\u2019s received for developing the implants, instruments and techniques used in the shoulder arthroscopy surgeries.\n\nThe royalties are paid by a company called Arthrex, which confirms it has the rights to Burkhart\u2019s inventions and used them in hundreds of its products.\n\nNeither \u201cDr. Burkhart, nor any surgeon Arthrex pays, receives any payment or royalty for their use, or their associated facility\u2019s use, of Arthrex products,\u201d the company tells us in a statement. Arthrex pays him royalties when other doctors use products made from his inventions, but not when he uses Arthrex products on his patients.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services posted the payments this week in a database that was created as part of the Affordable Care Act, which is designed to shed light on the financial relationships between companies and doctors.\n\nThose relationships have been murky, and studies have shown the undue influence that industry perks as minor as a free lunch can have on patient care decisions.\n\nBurkhart says he received an undergraduate degree in medical engineering, and upon entering medical practice in 1981, thought the minimally-invasive approach to reconstructing knees could be applied to shoulder surgeries.\n\nHe says he spent 25 years developing the new approach, even employing an aircraft machinist to make the initial instruments. Today, doctors can repair rotator cuffs through three or four punctures in the shoulder.\n\nBurkhart asks that those going to the website avoid jumping to conclusions. \u201cMy focus has been on making\u201d shoulder surgery better for patients, he says.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The $7.4 million that Texas surgeon Stephen Burkhart received from a medical device maker earlier this year seems like the kind of eye-popping sum that a new doctor-payment website was created to reveal.
