Now the hospital, along with community partners, work to protect both patients and hospital staff.\n\nIdentifying triggers of patient violence can help hospital leaders find potential intervention targets, according to a study published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nResearchers found that some catalysts for patient violence against healthcare workers included the use of needles and restraints, patient discomfort, cognitive impairment, physical transfers and patients who demand to leave. Hospitals can train staff to recognize patient violence indicators and educate them as to how to best mitigate the situation, the study found.\n\nViolent patients and vulnerable hospital staff are a dangerous combination, one the federal Patients' Bill of Rights needs to address, Anne Skomorowsky, Ph.D., a psychiatrist at Columbia University and a Public Voices fellow with the OpEd Project, wrote in an opinion piece in today's Boston Globe.\n\n\"The human rights perspective acknowledges that healthcare workers have the same inherent rights to safety as do patients,\" Skomorowsky wrote. \"The healthcare worker is encouraged to report, document, and demand response from the institution and the government to prevent violent and threatening behavior.\"\n\nCommunication could be the key to defusing angry, potentially violent patients.
