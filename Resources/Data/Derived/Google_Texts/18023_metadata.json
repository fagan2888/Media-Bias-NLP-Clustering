Rowling, Japan, Voldemort, Entertainment News, News, Politics News\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost\n\nLong-time foes China and Japan have accused each other of being many things over the years, but this may be the first time they have compared each other to an evil wizard from a children\u2019s book.\n\nAmbassadors for the Asian neighbors in the UK invoked Lord Voldemort, the arch villain of J.K. Rowling\u2019s best-selling Harry Potter series, in the latest spat between the two countries, which was sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s recent visit to a controversial war shrine.\n\nWriting in the British newspaper, The Telegraph, last week, Beijing\u2019s envoy to London, Liu Xiaoming, said: \u201cIf militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation\u2019s soul.\u201d\n\nAs Harry Potter fans will remember, Voldemort created seven horcruxes to hold fragments of his soul in order to achieve immortality. To kill him, all seven horcruxes must be destroyed.\n\nJapan\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Keiichi Hayashi, responded in kind in the same newspaper and compared Beijing to the grotesque-looking wizard.\n\n\u201cEast Asia is now at a crossroads. There are two paths open to China,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOne is to seek dialogue, and abide by the rule of law. The other is to play the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions, although Japan will not escalate the situation from its side.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest spat between the Asian neighbors has descended into name-calling of the wizard variety", "title": "Voldemort dragged into China-Japan dispute over war shrine", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The latest spat between the Asian neighbors has descended into name-calling of the wizard variety", "title": "Voldemort dragged into China-Japan dispute over war shrine", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/08/voldemort_dragged_into_china_japan_dispute_over_war_shrine/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/12/voldemort.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest spat between the Asian neighbors has descended into name-calling of the wizard variety", "title": "Voldemort dragged into China-Japan dispute over war shrine", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/12/voldemort.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allison Jackson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, China, GlobalPost, J.K.
