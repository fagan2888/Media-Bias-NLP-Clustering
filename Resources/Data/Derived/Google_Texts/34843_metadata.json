Some are just like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see how many celebrities we can get together.\u2019 Some are actually legitimate like the Grammys, and the AMAs is a very legitimate show with musicality to it.\u201d\n\nThree hours after Perry opens the show at 8 p.m. EST, Miley Cyrus will close things down. In between, most of the year\u2019s top performers are scheduled to take the stage, including Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Pitbull hosts and will perform with Ke$ha, and Jennifer Lopez will offer a tribute to Celia Cruz.\n\nAs 2013 nears an end, the question is how can these acts distinguish themselves in an especially memorable year that\u2019s included some brinksmanship, a few totally odd moments and plenty of skin?\n\nWhen last we saw Perry, she was floating above the stage at the MTV European Music Awards, a human maypole of sorts. Cyrus was at the Amsterdam show, too, smoking a joint and sharing the stage with a little person \u2014 proving just how easily she could top her over-the-top twerk-a-thon on the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nMacklemore and Lewis are the fan-voted AMA\u2019s top nominees this year with six, while Swift and Timberlake have five apiece. All three acts are up for top honor artist of the year, along with Rihanna and Bruno Mars.\n\nSwift and Justin Bieber, who is not nominated this year, have alternated victories in the category the last four years, cashing in on their rabid, social media-driven fan bases.\n\nOnly the adventurous would vote against Swift this year. Timberlake has the year\u2019s top-selling album and Macklemore and Lewis tickled everyone\u2019s fancy with \u201cThrift Shop.\u201d But the category winner has been either young or country since the award\u2019s inception in 2004. Swift is both.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What\u2019s next?
