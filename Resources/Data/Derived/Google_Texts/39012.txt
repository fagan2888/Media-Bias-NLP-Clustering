Rural communities are losing more and more of their hospitals. Fifty-seven rural hospitals have closed over the last five years across the country, and nearly 300 more are on the brink of shutting down.

The town of Douglas, on the Arizona-Mexico border, recently lost its hospital and the ripple effect is evident: jobs were lost, emergency services were overwhelmed and people worried about their safety.
