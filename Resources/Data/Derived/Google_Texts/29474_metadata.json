She has a nanny and I asked her how she thought the nanny, who had a little girl of the same age, was faring. Five days a week, the nanny came to my friend\u2019s apartment shortly after breakfast and stayed until just before dinner, leaving her own child somewhere with someone\u2014who knew where? certainly my friend didn\u2019t\u2013 so that she could earn a living. My friend, a thoughtful woman most of the time, said she hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\nToo many Americans fit into my friend\u2019s position in their relationships with the poor, the working poor and those that barely make it into the middle class. They\u2019re not unfeeling people, they\u2019re just not thinking about those Americans or situations that don\u2019t affect them. They\u2019ve been encouraged in this dissociation by a society \u2013 and media\u2014that celebrates successful entrepreneurs, internet gurus, Wall Street billionaires, sports figures and faux reality. Those who succeed tend to credit themselves a success narrative about their success. Or they may also just be whistling past the graveyard, thankful for their own financial security, and fearful that any acknowledgement of poverty will splash back on them.\n\nYet as we head into 2014, the continued growth of income inequality among Americans is, as Robert Shiller, the Yale professor who shared this year\u2019s Nobel prize for economics, warned: \u201cThe most important problem that we are facing now today.\u201d\n\nIncome inequality. Not glitches in the Affordable Care Act, not our love affair with 250 million guns, not sequestration and the dysfunctional disconnect between political parties in Washington, but income inequality.\n\nCertainly, the wide reach of the economic downturn- has created more sympathy for the poor than in more affluent times. Back in 2001, for example, a National Public Radio poll found that half of those surveyed thought that the poor were poor because they hadn\u2019t worked hard enough to pull themselves out of poverty. Today, there is a bit more understanding since a greater percentage of the population has lost a job and can\u2019t find another no matter how hard it has tried. More than 60 percent of Americans believe that the economic system favors the wealthy, still less than half attribute the yawning gap between the rich and the poor to a problem of economic structure.\n\nBut it is a problem. In 2010, the number of people living in poverty in the US was at an all -time high\u2014with numbers not seen since the late 1950s. The U.S. has been on fallow ground since the housing bubble burst, but the poor have been on neglected soil for nearly 50 decades.\n\nHere is Barbara Ehrenreich on the poverty of millions in her provocative, controversial 2001 book, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, her investigation into post 1996 welfare reform and its societal impact:\n\nThe \u201cworking poor\u201d\u2026 are in fact the major philanthropists of our society. They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high. To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone.\n\nIn contrast to these anonymous donors and nameless benefactors, the top one percent of Americans \u2014 those with incomes of more than $350,000 \u2014 now receive the largest share of national income since the year before the Great Depression plunged the country into an economic tailspin that left one-third of the population jobless.\n\nCertainly, deep recessions worsen long-term unemployment and income inequality, but they are also the result of structural problems. The programs of the New Deal brought relief, recovery and reform and softened the situation for the unemployed, but it wasn\u2019t until the U.S. entry into World War II with its drafting of millions into the military, the hiring of women and minorities and factories producing war materials that the economy fully recovered. Today, the collateral consequences of income inequality \u2013and growing poverty \u2013in a global economy stretches into the U.S. future in the form of inequality of opportunity for millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity gap in America,\u201d President Obama said in his December economic speech, \u201c is now as much about class as it is about race. And that gap is growing. So if we\u2019re going to take on growing inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people, we\u2019ve got to move beyond the false notion that this is an issue exclusively of minority concern.\u201d\n\nIncome and opportunity inequality are very real obstacles for a democratic society.\n\nToo much social stratification undermines democracy. One has only to look at emerging nations \u2013like China and India \u2013to see that the mammoth chasm between rich and poor divides rather than unites a people. This is most evident in the U.S. in the relationship between income and political influence: Wealth doesn\u2019t always make a winner, but wealth ensures that the concerns of the wealthy are heard.\n\nAmericans esteem freedom but the options for freedom of the poor are severely limited by lack of basics\u2014decent housing, adequate healthcare, safe neighborhoods, good education, financial security.\n\nYears ago, Dolly Shiff, the executive editor of The New York Post, assigned an Italian-American reporter to do an article on how earlier immigrants, like Italians, had managed to succeed without having to be schooled in Italian. At the time, some in New York City\u2019s Latino community were demanding that their Spanish-speaking children have some classes, such as math, in Spanish.\n\nShiff, steeped in our Horatio Alger culture, was sure that the numerous individuals who escaped lives of poverty and disadvantage to become wealthy got there through hard work, talent and tenacity.\n\nAnd the resulting article acknowledged that, yes, many Italian immigrants succeeded in the U.S., but many more had not, including the reporter\u2019s brilliant uncle, who never learned enough English to prosper.\n\nAnd while it is true that ultimately each American is responsible for his or her circumstances, without our collective concern and awareness of the nation\u2019s growing poverty gap, nothing will change. We will we can see our own security in the security of other Americans, we will continue to have an increasing number of poor Americans\u2014Americans who are poor through no fault of their own.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/income-inequality-many-americans-poor-fault/2013/12/26", "site_name": "Your Site NAME Goes HERE", "image": "http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/income-300x168.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Income inequality: So many Americans poor through no fault of their own"}, "twitter": {"description": "A journalist friend complained that she couldn\u2019t get any writing done because her two-year old son was distracting.\u00a0 She has a nanny and I asked her how she thought the nanny, who had a little girl of the same age, [\u2026]", "creator": "@baltpostexam", "image": "http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/income.jpg", "title": "Income inequality: So many Americans poor through no fault of their own - Baltimore Post-Examiner", "site": "@baltpostexam", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "YOUR USER ID"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda005\"", "article_summary": "Too many Americans fit into my friend\u2019s position in their relationships with the poor, the working poor and those that barely make it into the middle class.\nCertainly, deep recessions worsen long-term unemployment and income inequality, but they are also the result of structural problems.\nToday, the collateral consequences of income inequality \u2013and growing poverty \u2013in a global economy stretches into the U.S. future in the form of inequality of opportunity for millions of Americans.\nTo be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone.\nNot glitches in the Affordable Care Act, not our love affair with 250 million guns, not sequestration and the dysfunctional disconnect between political parties in Washington, but income inequality."}
