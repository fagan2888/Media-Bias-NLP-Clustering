The phrase “population health” might be cliché to many working in health care today, but for The MetroHealth System, it’s a way of doing business. So much so, in fact, that the health system is hiring for the newly created position of senior vice president of population health.



The idea is to find someone who can help accelerate MetroHealth’s transformation from a health system that only cares for people when they’re sick into one that keeps people healthy. This individual, who will report directly to MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros, will develop and lead programs that will help the system find the root causes of patients’ health risks and “upstream our intervention to make the biggest impact,” according to an email from Boutros.



This, of course, isn’t MetroHealth’s first foray in the population health arena.



As Medicaid eligibility expanded under the Affordable Care Act — and before that, through an experimental waiver in Cuyahoga County — the health system has retooled itself to manage the health care of these challenging populations. Some of those efforts include the usual targeted outreach to high-risk patients. Other efforts include offering patients transportation and even legal assistance.



The health system has also taken over the local care coordination efforts for CareSource, a nonprofit Medicaid managed care plan, and launched a Medicare accountable care organization.
