I was really hoping my fellow Republicans would snap out of their infatuation with Donald Trump.\n\nUnfortunately, he\u2019s still dominating in most of the polls. I honestly don\u2019t understand how people cannot see through this man. To me, he always comes across as abusive, petty, vain and shallow.\n\nThere is one thing he excels at \u2014 he knows how to tell people what they want to hear. For me, he has always been the GOP version of Barack Obama, the GOP \u201cmagic man.\u201d\n\nOn top of the abusiveness and petty and vain behavior, there are even plenty of reasons to question Trump\u2019s credentials as a conservative. He was a registered Democrat for almost the entire decade from 2001-2009, and as recently as four years ago he wasn\u2019t a registered Republican.\n\nHe had the Clintons as wedding guests to his most recent wedding, in 2005.\n\nDespite now saying the right things about the 2nd Amendment, he previously supported the \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban and longer waiting periods on gun purchases. In 2011 he announced he had evolved on the issue of abortion and was now pro-life. He had previously been pro-choice. He has advocated for a Canadian-style, single-payer plan \u2013 which is far more extreme than Obamacare.\n\nFor Republicans or Democrats, our choices for 2016 are not great at this point. It\u2019s like being the last one to go pick out a DVD at a motel at the coast on a stormy winter night.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem with the candidates, for either party. God bless them for being willing to serve and put up with everything they have to put up with. This is a problem with the people who elect them. The quality of the field of candidates reflects the quality of those who would elect them.\n\nBack on Feb. 13, the day Gov. John Kitzhaber was expected to announce his resignation, I went down to the Oregon Capitol at lunchtime. As I got ready to head upstairs, I noticed a large enclave of reporters gathered outside the governor\u2019s office and snapped a picture of them.\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to, but I also happened to take a picture of these profoundly appropriate words on the wall below: \u201cIn the souls of its citizens will be found the likeness of the state \u2014 which if they be unjust and tyrannical then will it reflect their vices \u2014 but if they be lovers of righteousness, confident in their liberties, so will it be clean in justice, bold in freedom.\u201d These same words apply to our nation.\n\nBack in 2012, I wrote a column on why money matters in politics. I noted, \u201cOur form of government is \u2018high maintenance\u2019; it requires a great deal of citizen involvement to work well.\u201d This mess is on us. Through our collective disengagement from the political discourse, we cede political power to those with money to buy TV commercials.\n\nIt\u2019s a vicious cycle. Voters don\u2019t pay attention; lobbyists and special interests gain power \u2014 power given to them by uninterested citizens. Then citizens get frustrated with the inevitable results and want a quick fix, a \u201cmagic man.\u201d\n\nI get it, politics are unpleasant and downright ugly at times. They can be very divisive. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell Republicans from Democrats. For example, despite claims that he was standing up to Wall Street, President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign \u201craised more money from the financial community than any other politician in American history,\u201d which was repaid when \u201cWall Street amassed more profits in the first two years of the Obama presidency than all eight of George W. Bush\u2019s combined.\u201d\n\nI largely avoided politics for most of my life, but that doesn\u2019t really work and it especially doesn\u2019t work if we want to hang onto this magnificent \u201cgovernment of the people by the people for the people\u201d we\u2019ve been so blessed to inherit. That so many of our predecessors fought for and when necessary gave their \u201clast full measure\u201d for.\n\nWith all of its flaws, it is still the best thing out there. As Winston Churchill said, \u201c... democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\u201d It\u2019s why so many Iraqis after the fall of Saddam Hussein risked real danger to vote and were so proud of their purple fingers.\n\nDemocracy will be much harder to win back if it\u2019s lost. Please let\u2019s all get more involved, if even a little bit more. Please reject quick fixes \u2014 it\u2019s taken us a while to get into this mess caused by our inattention. Please, let\u2019s be patient and persistent in restoring it.\n\nDan Lucas of Salem is an independent researcher and policy advocate, and the chief editor for the blog Oregon Catalyst.
