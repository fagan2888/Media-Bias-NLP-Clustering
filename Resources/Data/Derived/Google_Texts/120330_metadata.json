You want to get to the nearest facility as soon as possible.\n\nThere is more time, however, to plan for a non-emergency procedure, and if you do the research, you might be surprised to learn that the hospital may charge anywhere from $26,171 to nearly $90,000 for knee replacement surgery, depending on where in Kentucky you choose to have it done.\n\nIn May 2013, for the first time ever, the federal government released a list of the charges that hospitals across the country bill for the 100 most common procedures. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the information to \u201cshow the significant variation across the country and within communities in what hospitals charge for common inpatient services.\u201d Releasing the information, CMS said, would help \u201cmake our healthcare system more affordable and accountable.\u201d\n\nThe data included hospital-specific charges by the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare for fiscal year 2011. (Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients, and these charges are the amount on the hospital bills.)\n\nHuge range of charges for same procedures\n\nEach hospital has its own charge structure, according to Steve Miller, vice president for finance at the Kentucky Hospital Association. Every patient suffering from heart failure, for example, must be charged the same amount within that hospital.\n\nOn average, Kentucky hospitals collect about 50 cents on every dollar charged, he said.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies negotiate with medical facilities and end up paying a percentage of the billed amount.\n\n\u201cDepending on the contracts (hospitals) have with different insurers and different groups, some may pay 85 to 90 percent of that charge; others may be paying 35 percent of that charge. That\u2019s all negotiated with the hospital,\u201d Miller said.\n\nIn most every category, the CMS data showed a wide range of charges for procedures performed in Kentucky hospitals.\n\nThe cost of surviving heart failure with no major complications, for example, ranged from $5,816 at Saint Joseph Mount Sterling to $36,308 at Paul B. Hall Regional Medical Center in Paintsville. Rounding out the top five highest billers for heart failure procedures were: University of Louisville ($21,241); Three Rivers Medical Center ($19,582); Parkway Regional Medical ($19,413); and Frankfort Regional Medical Center ($19,143).\n\nBills for renal failure with complications at Kentucky hospitals ranged from $8,666 to $45,493. Bourbon County Hospital had the lowest average charge; the highest was again Paul B. Hall Regional Medical Center.\n\nThe bills for treating hypertension without major complications ranged from $5,956 at Clinton County Hospital in Albany to $25,427 at UofL, where more charity care is provided than all other Louisville hospitals combined, according to Ruth Brinkley, CEO of KentuckyOne Health.\n\nNeed a pacemaker? Kentucky hospitals charged anywhere from $21,815 to $80,856 for that procedure.\n\nWhy so varied? Why so high?\n\nMedicare patients make up 50 to 55 percent of a Kentucky hospital\u2019s volume, and Medicaid patients represent 15 to 18 percent of volume, according to KHA.\n\nMedicare pays 93 to 95 percent of the cost of delivering care to a patient, Miller said.\n\n\u201cNot 93 percent of the charge, but 93 to 95 percent of the actual cost of caring for that patient,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid pays about 85 percent of the cost of care.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, you\u2019ve got some 70 percent of your patient load \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t include bad debts and charity \u2013 that on average are paying less than 90 percent of the cost of delivering that care,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSomewhere along the line, as bad as it may sound, somebody\u2019s got to be paying more than their (actual) cost to make up for the cost that is not being covered with the other patients. Consequently, somewhere through the hospital\u2019s charge structure, they have to make sure they have the charges in place to cover that and maintain a positive bottom line.\u201d\n\nThis informal healthcare cost-shifting arrangement is sometimes referred to as the \u201csick tax.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate that point, the heart procedure for which Paul B. Hall Regional Medical Center billed $36,000 brought in an average Medicare payment of $3,898 in 2011. Medicare payments for renal failure procedures, for which hospital charges ranged from $8,666 to $45,493, produced an average reimbursement of $6,174.\n\nThe addition of more than 300,000 Kentuckians to Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act will compound the problem, at least in the short term, Miller said.\n\n\u201cThat puts about 30 percent of the state\u2019s population on Medicaid, which will pay an average of 85 percent of the costs of caring for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our projection, we saw that the increased payment coming from those individuals who will now have insurance does not offset the payment reductions that we\u2019ve incurred to help finance that expansion of insurance.\u201d\n\nCombine that with reimbursement issues, reductions in payments on the federal level and insurance companies that know they have been paying \u201cmore than just their cost and are tired of doing that,\u201d according to Miller, and you have \u201ca challenging opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt makes for a perfect storm when you\u2019ve got those who have been paying more-than-cost don\u2019t want to anymore, and you\u2019ve got more people coming on board that will be covered by policies that pay less-than-cost,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? Good question, said Mike Rust, KHA president.\n\nHospitals continue to look for ways to be more efficient, provide better outcomes for patients, improve quality-of-life care and develop population-health-management strategies, he said.\n\nIn the long term, more access to healthcare will improve overall health, thereby driving down costs, but it will take a while to get there, Miller said.\n\nAssessing the real costs to consumers\n\nAs expected, the release of hospital charges by CMS got a lot of attention. TIME magazine printed the longest story in its history, \u201cBitter Pill: Why Medical Bills are Killing Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now spend 20 percent of our GDP \u2013 an estimated $2.8 trillion for 2013 \u2013 on healthcare. It\u2019s time to cut through the policy debate and follow the money,\u201d TIME wrote. (Read the story here: http://ti.me/11WkvkP)\n\nThe data certainly piqued the public\u2019s interest, but for 99 percent of consumers, the information was \u201cimmaterial,\u201d said Mike Lorch, regional vice president for provider services at Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kentucky, which serves 1.2 million of Kentucky\u2019s 4.38 million residents.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is kind of interesting,\u201d Lorch said. \u201cThe public did get interested when the data came out, but it didn\u2019t really have anything to do with them. Ninety-nine percent of people aren\u2019t paying those billed charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the hospitals charges are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt matters what your actual cost is, based on what your health plan has negotiated with each of the hospitals.\u201d\n\nThere are multiple ways to determine the actual cost of care, but not everyone has access to the information.\n\nAnthem has developed several tools, including an online application that shows the \u201cestimated real cost of care.\u201d Before having surgery or a procedure, Anthem members can find out and compare the facility cost and professional costs (doctors fees, etc.) at various hospitals or outpatient facilities, Lorch said. Because individual care can vary, the rates are plus or minus 10 percent.\n\nAt the beginning of 2013, Anthem instituted an \u201cinteractive process\u201d to help its members find the best prices for medical procedures. For example, when a member\u2019s doctor orders an MRI, during the insurance company\u2019s pre-certification process, \u201cwe will look at the choice of provider to see if there are more cost-efficient providers in the area with the same quality, of course,\u201d Lorch explained. \u201cIf there is, we will attempt to contact you and give you that information.\u201d\n\nLouisville-based Humana, one of the country\u2019s largest health insurance companies, also provides cost comparison tools to its 10.2 million members. One of the most robust is MyChoice Tools on the MyHumana member portal, where members can compare physicians, hospitals and outpatient facilities.\n\n\u201cIf an individual is searching for a physician, he/she may look at the estimated costs of an office visit, related pharmacy and drugs and lab tests,\u201d said Rich Johnson, Humana\u2019s director of provider analytics and transparency. For outpatient procedures and hospitalization, members may review a range of costs for the procedure and a rating of facilities based on cost and quality.\u201d\n\nThe range of costs is all-inclusive, meaning if a patient is receiving surgery the procedure assessment includes payments to the anesthesiologist, radiologist and surgeon as well as recovery costs, Johnson said.\n\nOther companies also are getting into the act. Lexington-based IF Technologies developed a subscription-based medical cost-comparison software tool for preferred-provider networks and employers. Health eReports allows patients to log into an online database that provides historical data on the prices charged by area physicians for medical procedures, as well as patient satisfaction ratings in categories such as professionalism, cleanliness and other parameters.\n\nWebsites such as the Healthcare Blue Book and Medicare.gov also offer ways to compare providers and facilities, and KHA provides data about procedures performed in Kentucky facilities, including the number of discharges, the median charges, length of stay and median age of the patient. (Access KHA\u2019s online database at info.kyha.com/Pricing/MSDRG/main.htm.)\n\nGetting consumers to use cost-comparison tools\n\nWhile the information is available in many formats \u2013 some hospitals now publish their master charge list on their websites, Miller said \u2013 the real trick is getting consumers to actually use it.\n\nAlthough Anthem has provided tools to its members for several years, \u201cwe get very little usage of it,\u201d Lorch said.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think that it is in people\u2019s natural DNA to shop for medical services, and you\u2019ve got to keep the availability of that information at the top of everyone\u2019s mind for the one time maybe in your lifetime you\u2019re going to need to shop for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pretty hard to get that done.\u201d\n\nPatients who are required to pay a significant amount of the costs of the procedure, however, are more likely to shop around.\n\n\u201cPatients with high deductibles are going to have a bigger stake in the actual cost of care. They\u2019re more interested in comparing costs,\u201d Lorch said.\n\nOver time, Anthem expects its cost-comparison tools to become more popular, especially as the landscape of healthcare continues to change.\n\nKHA also predicts more involvement on the patient level.\n\n\u201cJohn Q. Public is being encouraged and in some cases forced to get more informed,\u201d Miller said.\n\nLorie Hailey is associate editor of The Lane Report.
