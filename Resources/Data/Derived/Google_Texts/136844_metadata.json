Insured's have the duty to defend all claims (with defense costs advanced), but can tender claims defense to BHSI if they prefer. A roster of highly sought ERISA litigation defense attorneys will be available to policyholders facing claims, but their use is not obligatory.\n\nThe policy also provides full \u201csettlor\u201d coverage (with no sublimit) for litigation stemming from certain business decisions made about employee benefit plans, and extends Affordable Care Act \"gap\" coverage for no additional premium. Additional highlights include a broad definition of \"plan,\" and expansive fines and penalties coverage.\n\nUp to $100 million in capacity is available, grounded in BHSI's financial strength.\n\nThe new fiduciary liability policy is part of Executive First\u2122, BHSI's suite of executive liability insurance products designed to provide clear, current and customizable coverage for commercial and financial firms, including those firms with the most complex risk-transfer needs.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (www.bhspecialty.com) provides commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional lines insurance and programs for customers across the U.S. It underwrites on the paper of Berkshire Hathaway's National Indemnity group of companies, which hold financial strength ratings of A++ from AM Best and AA+ from Standard & Poor's. Based in Boston, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance has regional underwriting offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.
