Fallis was indicted last month on a charge of second-degree murder and arrested in Bloomington, Ind., where he was living with his three children.\n\nFallis, who did not fight his extradition, arrived in Colorado last week. He is next due in court on Thursday.\n\nFallis is accused of killing his wife, Ashley, 28, at their Evans home after a fight that began over smoking a cigarette on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAshley Fallis\u2019 death initially was ruled a suicide, but the case was reopened this year after it was alleged that an officer assigned to the case possibly tampered with evidence. Police in April said the new information \u201cincludes alleged eyewitness accounts and other information which requires additional investigation.\u201d\n\nWhile the officer was cleared of tampering with evidence, the subsequent investigation resulted in probable cause to arrest Fallis.\n\nThe Fallises\u2019 children are at the center of a custody dispute between Ashley\u2019s parents and Fallis\u2019 family.\n\n\u201cMy clients, Ashley\u2019s parents, are very happy that there is now a prosecution for murder pending against Tom Fallis,\u201d attorney Dan Recht told The Denver Post last month. \u201cIt has been a series of nightmares for them over the last three years.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tom Fallis, accused in wife\u2019s 2012 Evans death, posts $500,000 bond", "title": "Tom Fallis, accused in wife\u2019s 2012 Evans death, posts $500,000 bond", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/09/tom-fallis-accused-in-wifes-2012-evans-death-posts-500000-bond/", "image": {"width": 550, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141118__tom-fallis-mugp1-1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141118__tom-fallis-mugp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-09T14:12:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:48:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00d3\"", "article_summary": "Tom Fallis, 34, posted $500,000 bond on Monday, according to court records.\n\u201cMy clients, Ashley\u2019s parents, are very happy that there is now a prosecution for murder pending against Tom Fallis,\u201d attorney Dan Recht told The Denver Post last month.\nThe Fallises\u2019 children are at the center of a custody dispute between Ashley\u2019s parents and Fallis\u2019 family.\nA former Weld County deputy accused of shooting his wife to death in 2012 and extradited from Indiana back to Colorado to face charges has posted bond.\nFallis is accused of killing his wife, Ashley, 28, at their Evans home after a fight that began over smoking a cigarette on New Year\u2019s Eve."}
