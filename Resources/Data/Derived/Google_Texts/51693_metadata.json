Bush, iran contra, October surprise, Ronald Reagan, News, Politics News\n\nIt\u2019s been said that if President Obama were to walk on water, the headline news would be \u201cPresident Can\u2019t Swim.\u201d That can explain why what would normally be a cause for celebration \u2014 the return of America\u2019s only prisoner of war in Iraq or Afghanistan \u2014 quickly became a controversy, with talk of it being a crime. Reactions to the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, in exchange for five Taliban members being held at Guantanamo, have been so severe that even the hometown joy at his release has been dampened.\n\nGOP criticism \u2014 picked up by the media \u2014 initially focused on two lines of attack on Obama, the first claiming that \u201cnegotiating with terrorists\u201d sets a bad precedent, and the second claiming that Obama broke the law by failing to consult with Congress 30 days in advance of releasing the Taliban detainees. There were calls for \u201cinvestigations,\u201d the GOP\u2019s favorite word in Obama\u2019s second term. But the consultation requirement in a bill passed by Congress was countered by a presidential signing statement \u2014 and acting on such signing statements was never a problem for the GOP when Bush was president.\n\nAs for \u201csetting a bad precedent\u201d by \u201cnegotiating with terrorists,\u201d the GOP\u2019s very serious concern comes three decades too late: Their hallowed icon, Ronald Reagan, firmly established that precedent in a still-murky tangle of secret dealings with Iran, only some of which came to light in the Iran-contra scandal. While Obama was actually involved in prisoner-of-war negotiations \u2014 a quite different matter, as several commentators have tried to explain \u2014 Reagan clearly was not. Thus, if we really want to put the current faux controversy over Bergdahl\u2019s release into context, a review of Reagan\u2019s record should prove most illuminating. The particulars involved in that record were far more shocking than the ambiguities surrounding Bergdahl\u2019s conduct, which have opened up a third line of attack on Obama\u2019s success in bringing him home.\n\nNot only did Reagan deal with terrorists as president, as revealed in the Iran-Contra scandal, the preponderance of evidence now supports the charge that his campaign negotiated with Iranian hostage-takers while he was running for president in 1980, to delay the release of hostages before the election, which could have helped Carter win reelection \u2014 what was known as \u201cThe October Surprise.\u201d Given that Reagan wasn\u2019t president then, but was negotiating to thwart a president\u2019s attempt to get hostages released, this is not simply questionable behavior, it is arguably an act of treason. Democrats\u2019 reluctance to vigorously investigate Reagan\u2019s misdeeds \u2014 the exact opposite of GOP attitudes toward Clinton and Obama \u2014 has left much of the true story still shrouded in mystery, but what we do know is damning enough in itself, and still cries out for a truly thorough investigation.\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s no doubt that Reagan himself set the precedent of dealing with terrorists \u2014 and encouraging more hostage-taking. He and his administration convinced themselves they were dealing with \u201cmoderates\u201d in Iran. But they also famously sent Donald Rumsfeld to Iraq to hang out with Saddam Hussein, and collaborated with Osama bin Laden in building up the most extreme mujahideen elements fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan \u2014 the very forces that eventually gave birth to the Taliban. When his own hand-picked \u201cTower Commission\u201d confirmed the basic facts of the Iran-contra scandal, Reagan went on national TV and said, \u201cA few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that\u2019s true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.\u201d\n\nIn short, Reagan had utterly terrible judgment when it came to the politics of the region, and the fact that he deluded himself about what he was doing and who he was doing it with was part and parcel of his terrible judgment; it only makes matters worse \u2014 it does not excuse them.\n\nIf we ignore the October Surprise for the moment, the Iran-Contra Affair began as a response to the Lebanon Hostage Crisis, which Wikipedia describes as \u201cthe systematic kidnapping in Lebanon of 96 foreign hostages of 21 national origins \u2014 mostly American and western European \u2014 between 1982 and 1992.\u201d The hostage crisis, in turn, was an outgrowth of the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), and more specifically the role the U.S. and other Western nations played in trying to intervene in 1983. (Only one hostage was taken before then.) This, in turn, was met by two notorious bombing attacks \u2014 one on a U.S. Marine barracks, the other on the U.S. embassy. Both involved far more loss of life than Benghazi \u2014 but were considered tragedies, not scandals, and have been entirely forgotten by today\u2019s GOP. As Wikipedia explains:\n\nThe original reason for the hostage-taking seems to have been \u201cas insurance against retaliation by the U.S., Syria, or any other force\u201d against Hezbollah, which is thought responsible for the killing of 241 Americans and 58 Frenchmen in the Marine barracks and embassy bombings [in which another 17 Americans were killed] in Beirut. Other reasons for the kidnappings or the prolonged holding of hostages are thought to be \u201cprimarily based on Iranian foreign policy calculations and interests\u201d particularly the extraction of \u201cpolitical, military and financial concessions from the Western world,\u201d the hostage takers being strong allies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nThis passage shows that the reasons for hostage-taking were such that no amount of deal-making would put an end to them. (Sgt. Bergdahl, in contrast, was not taken hostage for any such strategic purposes.) If some hostages were released, others would inevitably be captured to take their place, because the need for hostages remained unchanged. And this is exactly what happened.\n\nIn all, there were eight arms shipments to Iran from Aug. 12, 1985 through Oct. 28, 1986. The first two came from Israel, with the promise that the U.S. would replenish them, but thereafter the U.S. sent them directly \u2014 and began skimming the profits to send to the Nicaraguan contras, who were themselves something of a terrorist organization, responsible for a pattern \u201cincluding rape, torture, kidnappings, mutilation and other abuses\u201d against the civilian population. In all, 2,512 TOW anti-tank missiles were sent to Iran, along with 18 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and more than 240 Hawk spare parts. These were all vital weapons in Iran\u2019s ongoing war with Iraq.\n\nThe results on the hostage-freeing side were a good deal more uneven, to say the least. On Sept. 15, 1985, after the second delivery, the Rev. Benjamin Weir was released by the Islamic Jihad Organization. But then four more shipments took place before another hostage was released. What\u2019s more, on April 17, 1986, the body of one American hostage was discovered near Beirut, along with two other employees of the American University of Beirut, who were British. Then, in late July 1986, Hezbollah released another hostage, Father Lawrence Martin Jenco, former head of Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. After that, however, in September and October 1986, three more Americans \u2014 Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, and Edward Tracy \u2014 were abducted in Lebanon. One final hostage, David Jacobsen, was released on Nov. 2, 1986, the day before the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa exposed the ongoing arms-for-hostages deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republicans who want to investigate the Bergdahl deal need to be reminded of Iran-Contra and October Surprise", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Republicans who want to investigate the Bergdahl deal need to be reminded of Iran-Contra and October Surprise", "title": "Ronald Reagan \u201ctreason\u201d amnesia: GOP hypocrites forget their hero negotiated with terrorists.
