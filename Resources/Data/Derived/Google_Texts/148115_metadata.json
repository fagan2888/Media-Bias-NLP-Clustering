And the money we make from the crafters, we don't charge adminission at all, but the money we make from the crafters goes to funding the 4th of July celebration here in DeFuniak Springs and north Walton,\" said Sara Comander of the DBPA.\n\nComander says this event is a great way to support the local DeFuniak Springs economy and businesses.\n\nThe event will take place the Saturday Novemeber, 29th at 9 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you are looking to do a little shopping after the Thanksgiving holiday, the DeFuniak Springs Hometown Christmas Show is one place to check out.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/DeFuniak-Business-and-Professional-Association-Hosts-25th-Annual-Hometown-Christmas-Show-283639591.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/393*315/untitled47.png", "type": "article", "description": "If you are looking to do a little shopping after the Thanksgiving holiday, the DeFuniak Springs Hometown Christmas Show is one place to check out.", "title": "DBPA Hosts 25th Annual Hometown Christmas Show"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you are looking to do a little shopping after the Thanksgiving holiday, the DeFuniak Springs Hometown Christmas Show is one place to check out.", "title": "DBPA Hosts 25th Annual Hometown Christmas Show", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/DeFuniak-Business-and-Professional-Association-Hosts-25th-Annual-Hometown-Christmas-Show-283639591.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/393*315/untitled47.png", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "DBPA Hosts 25th Annual Hometown Christmas Show", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "DBPA Hosts 25th Annual Hometown"}, "article_summary": "If you are looking to do a little shopping after the Thanksgiving holiday, the DeFuniak Springs Hometown Christmas Show is one place to check out.\nComander says this event is a great way to support the local DeFuniak Springs economy and businesses.\nThe event is hosted by the DeFuniak Business and Professional Association, and this will be the 25th year for the event.\n\"It is a really great event, like I said it has been going on for 25 years, and it is one of the longest running in the panhandle, and we are really proud of that.\nThe event will take place the Saturday Novemeber, 29th at 9 a.m."}
