The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the Legislature violated the law by not giving yearly increases during the Great Recession, and a trial court judge last year ordered immediate payments \u2014 more than $330 million a year. The Legislature is appealing.\n\nThe result is a series of proposals to boost funding from Gov. Doug Ducey, Republican legislative leaders, Democratic legislative leaders and Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas.\n\nThe plans advanced by Ducey and GOP lawmakers have the best chance of being adopted in some form, but the other plans muddy the waters by offering simpler proposals that get money into the classroom sooner. The governor and Republican leaders have been separately meeting with lawmakers to pitch their plans and garner support.\n\nA special legislative session is expected to be called to enact a plan as soon as a deal is struck.\n\nSchools will receive $3.9 billion in the current budget year from the state general fund, including $3.4 billion in basic school aid. Adding other state funds, local property taxes and federal money brings the total to just over $10 billion, according to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. That equals about $9,000 for each of the state\u2019s 1.1 million K-12 public school students, nearly $400 per pupil less than was allocated in 2007. Adjusted for inflation, per student funding has dropped 18 percent from fiscal year 2007 though the 2016 budget year.\n\nA look at the proposals now in play:\n\nDUCEY\u2019S LAND TRUST PLAN\n\nThe Republican governor has proposed tapping the principal in the state\u2019s permanent land trust endowment. Right now, the $5.1 billion trust fund provides about $70 million a year in K-12 school funding. His plan:\n\n\u2014 Adds more than $2.2 billion into schools over the next 10 years.\n\n\u2014 Boosts payouts from 2.5 percent of annual trust valuation per year to 10 percent of the trust\u2019s total value for five years, dropping to 5 percent for the next five years.\n\n\u2014 Puts between $320 million and $375 million a year in new funding into schools for five years.\n\n\u2014 Requires Legislative and voter approval of a constitutional amendment, and possible changes to federal law.\n\nREPUBLICAN LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP PLAN\n\nHouse Speaker David Gowan and Senate President Andy Biggs are proposing four key ways to increase spending. Their plan:\n\n\u2014 Increases school funding by $5 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u2014 Boosts payout from the land trust by $170 million to $200 million a year, substantially less than governor\u2019s plan.\n\n\u2014 Continues $74 million in inflation funding provided this year and boosts it annually for inflation.\n\n\u2014 Adds $100 million in additional general funding, also inflation-adjusted.\n\n\u2014 Uses some tobacco tax money from the state early childhood education fund, First Things First.\n\n\u2014 Requires voter approval for the trust land and First Things First changes.\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEAGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP PLAN\n\nDemocrats propose boosting school funding using part of the state\u2019s current $325 million surplus and capping a tax credit. Their plan:\n\n\u2014 Increases funding by $3.8 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u2014 Continues $74 million in extra inflation funding in current budget.\n\n\u2014 Adds $262 million in the current year and larger amounts in coming years using general fund surplus.\n\n\u2014 Freezes corporate private school donations to $50 million year, stopping an annual 20 percent increase.\n\n\u2014 Allows additional money from a trust land proposal after new funding is in place.\n\nSUPERINTENDENT DOUGLAS\u2019 PLAN\n\nDouglas\u2019 plan uses excess cash and land trust money. Her plan:\n\n\u2014 Boosts school funding by $4 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u2014 Uses $400 million from general fund surplus and rainy day fund this year and next.\n\n\u2014 Uses a combination of general fund money and trust land cash in subsequent years, if approved by voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona's K-12 school funding crisis has gone from a top-tier political issue to an outright crisis in the past five months.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "Arizona's K-12 school funding crisis has gone from a top-tier political issue to an outright crisis in the past five months.", "title": "Competing proposals on school funding muddy waters - KTAR.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/State-Capital.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-04T16:09:42+00:00", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/678860/competing-proposals-on-school-funding-muddy-waters-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "Arizona's K-12 school funding crisis has gone from a top-tier political issue to an outright crisis in the past five months.", "creator": "@ktar923", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/State-Capital.jpg", "title": "Competing proposals on school funding muddy waters - KTAR.com", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-10-04T16:05:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-04T16:09:42+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde314\"", "article_summary": "A look at the proposals now in play:DUCEY\u2019S LAND TRUST PLANThe Republican governor has proposed tapping the principal in the state\u2019s permanent land trust endowment.\nPHOENIX \u2014 Arizona\u2019s K-12 school funding crisis has gone from a top-tier political issue to an outright crisis in the past five months, as parents, teachers and school officials who long complained about lagging school funding were bolstered by reports showing the state is at the bottom of national rankings for school spending and teacher pay.\nRight now, the $5.1 billion trust fund provides about $70 million a year in K-12 school funding.\nDEMOCRATIC LEAGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP PLANDemocrats propose boosting school funding using part of the state\u2019s current $325 million surplus and capping a tax credit.\n\u2014 Uses a combination of general fund money and trust land cash in subsequent years, if approved by voters."}
