Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, has revealed on the campaign trail that his family no longer is covered by health insurance.\n\nNaturally, he blames the Affordable Care Act: \"I\u2019ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who\u2019s lost their healthcare because of Obamacare? That would be me,\" he told an audience in Manchester, N.H., according to Politico. \"I don\u2019t have healthcare right now.\"\n\nIf you pay attention, however, you'll discover that Cruz\u2019s quandary is entirely his own fault. His, and his Republican colleagues in the Senate.\n\nYou know who one of those millions of Americans is who's lost their healthcare because of Obamacare? That would be me. \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz, who failed to sign up for 2016 health insurance\n\n[UPDATE: It turns out that Cruz actually is insured and always was, as his campaign disclosed late Friday. This makes his remark about his losing his coverage because of the Affordable Care Act look even more like pure political spin. Read on, and see more below.]\n\nEssentially, Cruz\u2019s coverage lapsed because his 2015 carrier, BlueCross BlueShield of Texas, ended its individual PPO plans for 2016, including the family plan that covered the Cruz family. The carrier decided to move entirely to HMO plans for the individual market. And Cruz didn\u2019t manage to sign up for a new 2016 plan by Dec. 31. That happened even though the insurer announced its decision to close PPO plans way back on July 23. Five months is normally enough for an educated adult to arrange health insurance.\n\nCruz still has until Jan. 31 to sign up for coverage beginning March 1, and he said he\u2019d be doing that. \"We\u2019re in the process of finding another policy,\" he said. \"I hope by the end of the month we\u2019ll have a policy for our family.\"\n\nIn other words, Cruz\u2019s problem has nothing to do with Obamacare and everything to do with his own sloth \u2014 unless the explanation is more sinister, as insurance expert Richard Mayhew of balloon-juice.com speculates: \"The Cruz family is currently uninsured to guarantee their father a cheap laugh line.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more certain is that Cruz\u2019s characterization of his issue is layered with dishonesty. He claims that the new plans he has examined carry premium increases of 50% \u2014 \"That\u2019s happening all over the country,\" he said. \"That\u2019s happening in New Hampshire.\"\n\nWell, no. Cruz wasn\u2019t especially forthcoming with details about his old plan or the new ones he\u2019s examining, but average rate increases in the individual market in Texas aren\u2019t anywhere near 50%. No single carrier is getting a rate increase that high; the largest is 34%, for a very tiny carrier. At some companies, including BlueCross BlueShield, some rates actually decreased.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the biggest plans had increases in the single digits. At Anthem, the largest individual insurer, some rates decreased.\n\nIt\u2019s proper to examine why Cruz is looking for insurance on the individual exchange in the first place. Until last year, the Cruz family got its coverage from his wife\u2019s employer, Goldman Sachs. But after she took an unpaid leave of absence from her job to help him run for president, they had to find coverage from his employer \u2014 the federal government.\n\nNormally, Cruz would be eligible for the standard government health insurance plan enjoyed by all government employees. But thanks to a deliberate monkey wrench forged by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) during the drafting of the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress and their staffs are required to get their insurance through the exchanges \u2014 a biting-your-nose-off-to-spite-your-face stunt that increased the complexity of health coverage for them all, since the ACA wasn't designed to substitute for employer insurance.\n\nCruz is still eligible for the government\u2019s employer subsidy of up to 75% of his health insurance premium. He has said he wouldn\u2019t accept the employer share, which makes his complaint about his cost of insurance just a teeny bit more dishonest because he\u2019s the one driving up his own premium.\n\nCruz\u2019s lament is sadly typical of congressional critics of Obamacare, including former Speaker John Boehner, who made the claim in 2013 that his insurance rates had \"spiked\" because of Obamacare. It was just as bogus as Cruz\u2019s complaint, as we demonstrated here. Former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) claimed in 2014 that Obamacare had cost him his cancer doctor. Typically, his office refused to provide any details, including why the 65-year-old Coburn was using an ACA plan instead of Medicare.\n\nThat\u2019s the state of Obamacare criticism on the GOP side of the aisle. They insist they want to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare. Because they can\u2019t offer any legitimate reasons to do so, they\u2019re stuck with making them up.\n\n[More on the Cruz campaign's backtracking: A campaign spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the Cruz family had been automatically enrolled by BlueCross BlueShield in one of its HMOs, or health maintenance organizations, as of Jan. 1, when their former PPO plan expired. The insurance carrier did this for all 2015 PPO enrollees who took no action before Dec. 31. Cruz presumably should have known this, if he was paying attention, as the insurance carrier informed all affected customers of the change.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ted Cruz flubs his family's health insurance and (naturally) blames Obamacare", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "U.S.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0 Ted Cruz \u00a0(R-Texas), a candidate for the GOP \u00a0presidential nomination, has revealed\u00a0on the campaign trail \u00a0that his family no longer is covered by health insurance.", "title": "Ted Cruz flubs his family's health insurance and (naturally) blames Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-ted-cruz-blames-naturally-obamacare-20160121-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56a188a6/turbine/la-fi-mh-ted-cruz-blames-naturally-obamacare-20160121", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "cruz, obamacare, health insurance", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/85653688", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-01-22", "Description": "U.S.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Ted Cruz\u00a0(R-Texas), a candidate for the GOP\u00a0presidential nomination, has revealed\u00a0on the campaign trail\u00a0that his family no longer is covered by health insurance.\u00a0   Naturally, he blames the Affordable Care Act: \"I\u2019ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who\u2019s lost...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "cruz, obamacare, health insurance"}, "article_summary": "Normally, Cruz would be eligible for the standard government health insurance plan enjoyed by all government employees.\nThe insurance carrier did this for all 2015 PPO enrollees who took no action before Dec. 31.\nCruz is still eligible for the government\u2019s employer subsidy of up to 75% of his health insurance premium.\nFive months is normally enough for an educated adult to arrange health insurance.\nCruz presumably should have known this, if he was paying attention, as the insurance carrier informed all affected customers of the change."}
