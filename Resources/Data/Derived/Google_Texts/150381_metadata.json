The authority countered that it has every right to charge a fee to properties directly protected by the levee, which it maintains are those that fall within the 1972 Hurricane Agnes floodplain.\n\nIn his ruling issued Wednesday afternoon, Luzerne County Judge Richard M. Hughes III cited the Municipalities Authorities Act, which says, in part, that \u201cEvery authority may exercise (the power to) fix, alter, charge and collect rates and other charges in the area served by its facilities at reasonable and uniform rates ... \u201d\n\nThe question of what constitutes the \u201carea served by its facilities\u201d is one of the pivotal points of the case, he wrote.\n\nKingston Mayor James Haggerty argued that the authority\u2019s facilities channel runoff and divert water in a way that benefits all residents of the county, not only those in the floodplain. Therefore, everyone in the county gets a direct benefit from the system and should pay an equal fee, he claimed.\n\nThe judge found that the definition of \u201carea served\u201d is ambiguous, but that Kingston failed to meet its burden of proving that the authority abused its power, as required by law.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of possible definitions of the \u2018area served\u2019 by the authority\u2019s facilities; urging that one of these definitions is \u2018obvious\u2019 does not make it so,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cIn the absence of specific language in the ordinance creating the authority, it is impossible to interpret \u2018area served\u2019 broadly (as have plaintiffs) or narrowly (as has the defendant). The burden is on the plaintiffs to show that defendant has been arbitrary or capricious or has committed manifest abuse of discretion in its defining the \u2018area served by its facilities\u2019 as the Agnes floodplain. This court finds that plaintiffs have not met that burden.\u201d\n\nThe ruling means the levee fee will remain in force.\n\nIt comes as the authority on Tuesday filed more than 800 liens against property owners who have failed to pay the fee on time this year, according to court records.\n\nRecords at the prothonotary\u2019s office show Northeast Revenue Service on Tuesday filed 835 liens against delinquent property owners. Authority Executive Director Christopher J. Belleman said the bills were mailed Oct. 1 and the fees were due within 60 days. By the first of December, the authority imposed a 10 percent penalty and filed the liens Tuesday, he said.\n\nBelleman said about 1,000 of the 14,000 impacted properties change hands in a given year, and that many newcomers are simply unaware they must pay the fee.\n\n\u201cMost of the people in the area are aware it\u2019s being used for the maintenance and operation of the 16-mile flood protection system, and I think most people are on board with the fee,\u201d Belleman said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing less and less liens having to be filed every year.\u201d\n\nThe fee, which was enacted in 2009, ranges from $46.85 for residential properties worth less than $100,000 to $676.44 for commercial properties worth at least $750,000.\n\nSome notable entities on the lien list this year include Kingston and the Wilkes-Barre Area School District. Court records show liens were filed against Kingston for $340 each on a couple of properties on Main Street.\n\nKingston did not intentionally disregard the fee, Haggerty said before the ruling came out Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA fee\u2019s been implemented,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cIt\u2019s legal until a court says otherwise.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know for certain what had happened, but said the properties might be the result of the municipality\u2019s seizing several blighted properties in that area and tearing them down.\n\nThose fees were likely imposed in error and will be corrected, Belleman said. Federal and state governmental agencies, including local subdivisions, are exempt from the fee, he said.\n\nSchool districts, however, are not, he said.\n\nCourt records show Wilkes-Barre Area owes $836 each on three properties it owns, including Meyers High School and Coughlin High School.\n\nThe liens will be removed when the fees are paid, Belleman said.\n\n570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin", "article_metadata": {"author": "James Halpin, Staff Writer", "title": "Disputed county levee fee receives judge\u2019s approval", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "James Halpin, Staff Writer", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1811364"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Disputed county levee fee receives judge\u2019s approval"}, "article_summary": "The Luzerne County Flood Protection Authority\u2019s controversial levee fee can legally target only some county residents and will remain intact, a county judge ruled Wednesday.\nThis court finds that plaintiffs have not met that burden.\u201dThe ruling means the levee fee will remain in force.\nTherefore, everyone in the county gets a direct benefit from the system and should pay an equal fee, he claimed.\nCourt records show liens were filed against Kingston for $340 each on a couple of properties on Main Street.\n\u201cThere are a number of possible definitions of the \u2018area served\u2019 by the authority\u2019s facilities; urging that one of these definitions is \u2018obvious\u2019 does not make it so,\u201d Hughes wrote."}
