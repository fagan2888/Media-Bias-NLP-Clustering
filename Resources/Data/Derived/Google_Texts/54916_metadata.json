The strategy worked, and CSU junior quarterback Garrett Grayson did his part in a 34-17 Rams victory in CSU\u2019s home opener.\n\nGrayson threw for 227 yards passing in the first half, and finished 21-of-30 for 297 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nColorado State (1-2) at least gained some momentum into next weekend\u2019s game at No. 1 Alabama.\n\nCal Poly (1-2) entered the game ranked No. 14 nationally at the FCS (formerly I-AA) level. The Mustangs pulled to within 27-17 in the third quarter and set up for a field goal to tighten the score. But CSU senior defensive end Shaquil Barrett blocked a 32-yard attempt by Bobby Zalud with 8:11 to go.\n\nColorado State put the game out of reach when Grayson hit tight end Kivon Cartwright for a 5-yard touchdown with 4:03 to go.\n\nFor the first time this season CSU emphasized its tight ends in the passing game. Senior Crockett Gillmore caught his first passes of the season in the first half Saturday \u2014 four of them, in fact. He finished with seven receptions for 83 yards.\n\nColorado State never punted in the first half, scoring on its first five drives before running out the clock with its sixth possession.\n\nIt didn\u2019t always come easy for the home team, however. The Rams had their lead cut to 13-10 after a 34-yard touchdown run by Cal Poly senior Akaninyene Umoh on the first play of the second quarter.\n\nBut CSU regained some separation and took a 27-10 lead into halftime when Kapri Bibbs scored on a 1-yard run and Grayson connected with freshman wideout Rashard Higgins for a 36-yard score \u2014 the first TD of Higgins\u2019 college career.\n\nColorado State, obviously feeling looser than in the losses to Colorado and Tulsa, even pulled out a gadget play to set up the Bibbs touchdown. Ty Sambrailo, a 6-foot-6, 305-pound junior who normally is the starting left tackle, lined up as a tight end and rumbled 11 yards to the 1-yard line after taking a backward pass (lateral) from Grayson.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU goes pass-happy in win over Cal Poly", "title": "CSU goes pass-happy in win over Cal Poly", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/14/csu-goes-pass-happy-in-win-over-cal-poly/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914_044216_colorado-state-football.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914_044216_colorado-state-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T16:39:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T17:16:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdca9\"", "article_summary": "But CSU senior defensive end Shaquil Barrett blocked a 32-yard attempt by Bobby Zalud with 8:11 to go.\nGrayson threw for 227 yards passing in the first half, and finished 21-of-30 for 297 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe Rams had their lead cut to 13-10 after a 34-yard touchdown run by Cal Poly senior Akaninyene Umoh on the first play of the second quarter.\nFor the first time this season CSU emphasized its tight ends in the passing game.\nThe strategy worked, and CSU junior quarterback Garrett Grayson did his part in a 34-17 Rams victory in CSU\u2019s home opener."}
