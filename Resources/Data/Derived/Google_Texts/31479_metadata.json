Mauricio Carreon-Maltos, 28, was last seen Friday\n\nafternoon when he told his family he was going hiking.\n\nHis family called the sheriff's department around 10:20 Friday night when they did not hear from him. His vehicle was found in the Sabino Canyon parking lot.\n\nAuthorities called the Southern Arizona Rescue Association to assist in the search around 1 a.m., said Shelley Littin, SARA spokeswoman. Littin said there are teams deployed to search the far-ranging trails right now in case Carreon-Maltos wandered far away from Sabino Canyon.\n\nPlans are also in the works for a new wave of volunteers to continue as soon as the sun rises Sunday morning, she said.\n\nCarreon-Maltos is described a Hispanic man, 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighing 160 pounds.
