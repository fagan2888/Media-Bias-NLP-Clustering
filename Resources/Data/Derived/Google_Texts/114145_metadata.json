Isaac Lawrence/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nLunchtime strolls, camping gear and folding origami umbrellas in one of Hong Kong\u2019s busiest thoroughfares will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nAs Hong Kong police prepare to clear the main occupied protest encampment in Admiralty on Thursday morning, thousands turned out to witness the final hours of the site, which pro-democracy protesters have occupied since Sept. 28.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a larger than usual crowd of office workers spent their lunch break at the Admiralty site, eating, taking photographs and talking politics.\n\n\u201cThey have built up a good micro-community here,\u201d said Jeff Cheung, 27, who works in nearby Central district. \u201cThis is a place where people who support the democracy cause but who don\u2019t necessarily align themselves with any political party can come together,\u201d he added, eating a homemade salad with two friends in the so-called study area of the encampment, where volunteers built rows of desks for students to use.\n\nLeaders of the two main student protest groups\u2014The Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism\u2014 urged protesters to turn out Wednesday night for a last hurrah and to stay overnight if they could.\n\nA painting by the artist Water inspired by Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy Umbrella Movement. Courtesy of Water\n\nJoshua Wong, the 18-year-old leader of Scholarism, said he wouldn\u2019t be at the front line during Thursday\u2019s clearance operation because he needs to avoid being arrested again before his Jan. 14 court appearance. Mr. Wong was arrested in November during the clearance of the Mong Kok site.\n\nA third, small protest site in Causeway Bay remains occupied.\n\nSome demonstrators are working to preserve the art created during the protests. Meaghan McGurgan, a theater critic who also works with a group called Umbrella Movement Art Preservation, removed some pieces from Admiralty on Wednesday night to return to the artists on their wishes. Her collective was also responsible for preserving some of the art from Mong Kok.\n\nOne of the pieces Ms. McGurgan is helping to preserve is a large banner called \u201cUmbrella Girl\u201d that hung between the two footbridges leading to the central government offices. The artist, who goes by the name Water, removed the 35-kilogram banner Tuesday night.\n\nAnother group, Umbrella Research, is also working to preserve digitally or physically some of the art in Admiralty, including the Lennon Wall, a staircase that is covered with neon Post-it notes of messages from supporters of the movement.\n\nProtesters were noticeably emotional in the days leading up to the police clearance. A nightly guitar performance by artist and musician Sham Wailun, who goes by the name Bananaooyoo, drew larger crowds than usual, as people sat on the steps of Admiralty Centre sandwiched between McDonald\u2019s and KFC, the central entrance point to the protest site.\n\nCyrena Leung, 20, an engineering student, was one of many who cried while listening to songs by Cantopop legends such as Eason Chan, Beyond and Leslie Cheung on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crying because\u2026we have fought for so long but the government chooses to use injunctions as an excuse to clear us out. I\u2019m very disgusted,\u201d said Ms. Leung, who has slept in a tent in Admiralty for more than 50 nights.\n\nShe said she won\u2019t be able to come to Admiralty on Thursday morning because she has exams.\n\n\u2013 Isabella Steger.
