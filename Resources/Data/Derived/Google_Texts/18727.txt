Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall might not want to talk about Geno Smith and the broken jaw he suffered when he was punched by then-teammate IK Enemkpali over a $600 plane ticket. But Bart Scott, the former Jets linebacker and current The NFL Today studio analyst, has no such obligations. Which is why he spoke frankly on the Jets' locker room dynamic and the quarterback's role within it.

“I can understand how that situation can escalate, especially because there's an ATM in the players' lounge,” Scott said Tuesday, via the New York Post's Brian Costello. “Come on, bro, you're walking by an ATM every day. It's just bam, bam, get the money.”

Like most current and former players, Scott was surprised that Smith found himself in a predicament that ended with him getting punched in the face.

"I've never heard anyone get into it with the quarterback,” Scott said. “In my opinion, if you put [former Jets quarterback] Mark Sanchez into that same situation and he couldn't make it to the charity event or whatever happened, what a quarterback is supposed to do is to give you your $600 and donate $1,000 to your charity. That's what a leader does. Maybe Geno is too young in the process to understand that and he has to mature more. ...

“Sanchez, even though he was goofy and he didn't play well at times, he was a likable guy. The only person I could have seen getting in an altercation with Sanchez was maybe Santonio [Holmes].”

Meanwhile, Smith returned to practice this week, though he'll miss the start of the regular season. That means veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the Jets' starting quarterback with rookie Bryce Petty and just-signed Matt Flynn behind him on the depth chart.
