The Russian people, he said, should view the punishing international sanctions currently imposed on the country as an opportunity to strengthen domestic production in sectors that were neglected in the past.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Putin also continued to insist \u2013 despite what multiple international groups say is overwhelming evidence to the contrary \u2013 that there are no Russian troops in Ukraine. In fact, he called war between Russia and Ukraine an impossibility.\n\nRelated: Putin Gets Ready to Showcase His New Military Weapons\n\n\u201cThere are no Russian troops in Ukraine,\u201d he said flatly, when asked by a caller.\n\nWar between Russia and Ukraine \u201cis impossible,\u201d he said, calling the nations \u201cbrotherly.\u201d He continued, \u201cI make no difference between Ukrainians and Russians in general. I think this is basically the same nation, ethnically.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment might be less than comforting to the Ukrainian people, considering that it was the protection of ethnic Russians in the Crimean Peninsula that Putin used to justify Russia\u2019s invasion of that part of Ukraine last year.\n\nOfficials from NATO allied countries and multiple international non-governmental organizations have challenged Russia\u2019s claim that it has no involvement in the ongoing conflict between armed rebels in Eastern Ukraine. Military equipment and personnel have been seen crossing the border, and multiple Russian soldiers have posted to their social media accounts from inside Ukrainian territory.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Arsenal\n\nPutin and other officials have claimed that any Russian soldiers inside Ukraine are there as volunteers, on \u201choliday.\u201d Many of the callers to the program, called \u201cDirect Line with Vladimir Putin\u201d expressed concerns about the Russian economy.\n\nPutin acknowledged that the country\u2019s economy is in trouble but, noting that the ruble has strengthened slightly against international benchmark currencies recently, held out hope for the future. \u201cWe were confronted with certain foreign economic restrictions and this affected our growth and our development in one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201cBut generally we see that the ruble is strengthening and stock markets are growing. We have managed to prevent an inflationary spiral.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Says Putin\u2019s Men Are Training Rebels in Ukraine\n\nHe also said that Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of the Crimean peninsula last year, and in reaction to its continued support of armed rebels in Ukraine, actually have nothing to do with the situation in Ukraine. The real reason for the sanctions, he said, is a U.S.-led effort to \u201ccontain\u201d Russia. He further criticized the U.S. for, as he put it, not wanting alliances with other nations, but preferring to turn them into \u201cvassals.\u201d\n\nThe president also answered some rather offbeat questions. One woman asked him if he hopes one day to be the head of the United Nations, to which he replied that he did not. Another caller asked if Putin would like to have a clone of himself, so that there would be more public officials the people could trust. He declined that as well.\n\nHe was asked to intervene in a dispute about a dog, and about how much sleep he gets at night.\n\nIn all, Putin answered about 90 questions in the space of nearly four hours.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In his semi-annual marathon call-in show with the Russian people, President Vladimir Putin continued to insist that no Russian troops are in Ukraine.
