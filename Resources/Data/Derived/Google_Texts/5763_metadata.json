All kinds of money gets funneled to all sorts of agencies in this massive bill. The usual careless disregard for taxpayer loot follows this money as night follows day. No one in the federal government is ever going to care all that much about taking care of tax money until that money is treated as a valuable, finite resource whose rightful owners have a legitimate claim to it.\n\nOne of ObamaCare\u2019s billion-dollar slush funds seems to be coming up a little light, as Americans for Tax Reform reports:\n\nThe IRS is unable to account for $67 million spent from a slush fund established for Obamacare implementation, according to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report released today. The \u201cHealth Insurance Reform Implementation Fund\u201d (HIRIF) was tucked into Obamacare in order to give the IRS money to enforce the tax provisions of the healthcare law. The fund, totaling some $1 billion of taxpayer money, was used to roll out enforcement mechanisms for the approximately 50 tax provisions of Obamacare. According to the report: \u201cSpecifically, the IRS did not account for or attempt to quantify approximately $67 million [from the slush fund] of indirect ACA costs incurred for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2012.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not as if anyone in the IRS, or any other agency, has to worry about suffering for incompetence. Lois Lerner of the Tax Exempt Organizations Division was officially classified as incompetent by internal review, to protect her from charges of abusing her authority, and she\u2019s riding off into the sunset with a $113,000 pension after years of earning over $170,000, having enjoyed several months of paid vacation to cap off her career.\n\nImagine a company where no one can ever be fired, everybody is guaranteed posh retirement benefits, the company has an unlimited line of credit, it can never go out of business, and it can raise the price of its \u201cproduct\u201d to a small subset of its \u201ccustomers\u201d with relative ease. What do you suppose the customer-service and accounting departments would be like?\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! ATR quotes the Treasury Inspector General\u2019s report dinging the IRS for pulling seemingly unrelated travel reimbursements for 38 employees out of the slush fund, which was large enough to hire over 1200 new agents, if the money had been spent for that purpose. Apparently it was not, so the agency requested budget money for 859 new ObamaCare enforcers, but the request was denied.\n\nThe money from this immense slush fund has all been spent, but the IRS promises that if someone gives them another billion dollars, they\u2019ll keep better track of it. Too bad the missing $67 million couldn\u2019t have been spent on getting the insurance exchanges ready. Reuters reports several of the exchanges won\u2019t be able to perform key functions \u2013 including the calculation of the new middle-class welfare subsidy much of America is about to become hooked on \u2013 when the system goes live on October 1. You\u2019ll have to buy your insurance blind if you want to purchase it online \u2013 and remember, if you don\u2019t, those thousands of new IRS agents are standing by to asses a penalty\u2026 er, excuse me, a tax\u2026 no, wait, a penalty\u2026 for non-compliance.\n\nIf buying insurance without knowing its effective price turns you off, you can fill out a paper application and bounce it through a couple of bureaucracies, and you\u2019ll get a response from off-line \u201cexperts\u201d sometime in early November. Among the affected regions are Colorado, Oregon\u2026 and the District of Columbia, comically touted as a showpiece of ObamaCare exchange performance until now. Coloradoans will reportedly be able to get their subsidy calculations done over the phone. Hopefully they\u2019ve got some perky hold music picked out, and they\u2019ve hired lots of new government employees to help everyone \u201cnavigate\u201d the system.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Too bad they didn't spend that money on the train-wreck exchanges.", "title": "IRS loses $67 million out of billion-dollar ObamaCare slush fund | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/money_burn-480x325.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/26/irs-loses-67-million-out-of-billion-dollar-obamacare-slush-fund/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Too bad they didn't spend that money on the train-wreck exchanges.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/money_burn-480x325.jpg", "creator": "@@Doc_0", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Too bad they didn't spend that money on the train-wreck exchanges."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9802\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cHealth Insurance Reform Implementation Fund\u201d (HIRIF) was tucked into Obamacare in order to give the IRS money to enforce the tax provisions of the healthcare law.\nThe money from this immense slush fund has all been spent, but the IRS promises that if someone gives them another billion dollars, they\u2019ll keep better track of it.\nOne of ObamaCare\u2019s billion-dollar slush funds seems to be coming up a little light, as Americans for Tax Reform reports:The IRS is unable to account for $67 million spent from a slush fund established for Obamacare implementation, according to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report released today.\nThe fund, totaling some $1 billion of taxpayer money, was used to roll out enforcement mechanisms for the approximately 50 tax provisions of Obamacare.\nToo bad the missing $67 million couldn\u2019t have been spent on getting the insurance exchanges ready."}
