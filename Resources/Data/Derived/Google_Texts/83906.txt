Nearly a dozen people were evacuated from a Greene County group home Saturday afternoon when fire erupted in the laundry room.

Hookerton Fire Chief Shaun Jackson says the Edwards Group Home on 408 E Main St. caught fire around 4 p.m. The fire station's headquarters are right next door to the home, which made for a quick response by firemen.

They were also assisted by Snow Hill and Maury fire departments.

Jackson says the fire was caused by a dryer in the laundry room. After 5 minutes, the fire was under control.

The 10 people inside when the fire began did not suffer any injuries.

We're told there is fire damage in the laundry room and smoke damage throughout the facility.

Jackson says no one will be returning to the group home until it is repaired.
