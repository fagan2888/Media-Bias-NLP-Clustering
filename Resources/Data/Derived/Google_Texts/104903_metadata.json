(AP) \u2014 Grabbing a front row spot for the chance to watch a historic finish at the Masters is easy: Be at the gate when the doors open, walk briskly to No. 18 and plop down a chair.\n\nThen wander off.\n\nGrab some breakfast, go shopping or walk around Augusta National enjoying the day. When golfers start on the back nine, return to find that chair still in the same spot.\n\nYes, the Masters takes saving a seat to an entirely different level.\n\n\u201cYou know if you put your chair down, nobody\u2019s going to move it,\u201d Anne Costigan of Baltimore said. \u201cIt\u2019s safe where it is. Nobody does that. It\u2019s so unique.\u201d\n\nJust look next time the TV cameras span the magnificent par-4 18th.\n\nNo grandstands ring this green, just row upon row of people sitting, or cheering, from the chairs they brought with them to Augusta National or bought in the shop. Ropes mark off just how close fans can sit next to the green or elsewhere on the course. Signs note where the sitting areas begin with aisles marked off with spray paint.\n\nGallery guards ensure people line those chairs up in perfect rows.\n\nScoping out where to put the chair the day before is key because gates opened Sunday at 7 a.m. even though the first group didn\u2019t tee off until 10 a.m. Then it\u2019s time to hustle through the gate with the Costigans arriving by 7:45 a.m. Saturday to place their new chairs by the 17th tee with a perfect view of the pin on 16. And remember, no running.\n\n\u201cChicken walk,\u201d Kevin Costigan said of their pace to the far corner of the course.\n\nThe biggest decision is where to set up the chair on a course where there isn\u2019t a bad spot, so the choice is between watching golfers tee off or putt on a hole.\n\nOnly armless chairs are allowed at Augusta National, and any chair will do. The vast majority of chairs on this course are Masters\u2019 green marked by the logo on the back where there\u2019s a pocket perfect for a business card to help mark it as yours.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "title": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "title": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/best_seat_for_masters_finish_requires_chair_early_arrival/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/masters-golf.jpeg173-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "title": "Best seat for Masters\u2019 finish requires chair, early arrival", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/masters-golf.jpeg173-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Teresa M.
