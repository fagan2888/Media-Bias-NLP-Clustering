ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — A deer apparently hit by a car brought itself to a New York hospital and walked into the emergency room.

Hospital officials say the deer walked through the automatic doors at the entrance to Strong Memorial Hospital’s emergency room late Monday afternoon in Rochester. Officials say the deer made it about 20 feet down a corridor before staff members corralled it.

The Monroe County sheriff’s office says two deputies happened to be at the hospital when the deer wandered in. They and hospital public safety officers strapped the deer to a gurney and wheeled it out to the parking lot.

One of the deputies put down the deer.
