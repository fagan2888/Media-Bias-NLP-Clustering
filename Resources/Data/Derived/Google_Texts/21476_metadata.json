In turn, those funds would boost programs that help victims rebuild their lives.\n\nTen Democrats signed onto the bill when it was filed in January, and it breezed through committee, offering a glimmer of bipartisanship for a chamber steeped in fights over the administration\u2019s approach to Iran, immigration and health care.\n\nAll that changed Tuesday, when pro-choice groups and their Democratic allies objected to what they called a \u201csneak attack\u201d on abortion over a provision that applies the so-called Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funds from being spent on abortion, to the penalties charged under the law on human traffickers.\n\nThose penalties would go to victims\u2019 compensation funds, and Democrats said that\u2019s a different type of money than revenue from taxpayers, so the GOP is trying to expand the Hyde Amendment.\n\n\u201cThis language paves the way for political leaders in the future to interfere even more with a woman\u2019s basic personal health decisions,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat. \u201cAnd it sets the tone for a dramatic expansion of abortion restriction for years to come.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say the language was publicly available for several weeks, has already cleared a committee unanimously and isn\u2019t groundbreaking. They questioned why Democrats were raising the eleventh-hour objection.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, who authored the bill, said Democrats have approved similar Hyde Amendment restrictions dozens of times in annual funding bills and in Obamacare.\n\n\u201cBasically they\u2019re trying to relitigate something that\u2019s been the law of the land since 1976, that\u2019s been included in a lot of pieces of legislation they voted for,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.\n\nPro-life groups said not including the Hyde language would tilt the playing field toward pro-choice groups.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department and other government agencies receive funds from many sources, but once they are received by the government, they become federal funds,\u201d the National Right to Life Committee wrote. \u201cIf such funds are transmitted to abortionists to pay for abortions, that constitutes federal funding for abortion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he will offer Democrats an up-or-down vote on their request to remove abortion language from an otherwise-bipartisan bill to help victims of human trafficking.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he will offer Democrats an up-or-down vote on their request to remove abortion language from an otherwise-bipartisan bill to help victims of human trafficking.", "title": "McConnell cedes to Reid threat to stall trafficking bill over abortion language", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/12/reid-remove-abortion-language-trafficking-bill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/5f45ac4f274fd10a6f0f6a706700b2ca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/5f45ac4f274fd10a6f0f6a706700b2ca.jpg", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he will offer Democrats an up-or-down vote on their request to remove abortion language from an otherwise-bipartisan bill to help victims of human", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "McConnell cedes to Reid threat to stall trafficking bill over abortion"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Senate, Republican Party, Harry Reid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93f1\"", "article_summary": "But Mr. Reid said his filibuster was treading a path Republicans carved, using the filibuster to thwart President Obama\u2019s priorities.\nPro-life groups said not including the Hyde language would tilt the playing field toward pro-choice groups.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about dysfunction of the Senate,\u201d said Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat.\n\u201cThe Justice Department and other government agencies receive funds from many sources, but once they are received by the government, they become federal funds,\u201d the National Right to Life Committee wrote.\nA once-promising bill to fight human trafficking inched closer to failure Thursday, as outnumbered Democrats vowed to filibuster unless the GOP removed provisions that would prevent federal funds from being spent on abortion."}
