The National Weather Service is currently assessing the damage from Friday’s storms in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota.

So far, officials confirmed 10 tornadoes hit the Midwest. The final number of tornadoes could still go up.

The National Weather Service said six of the 10 confirmed tornadoes were in Iowa.

In the calm after the storm, communities like the one in Pierson are focusing on cleaning up the damage.

On Saturday, neighbors in the small town in northwest Iowa were helping with tractors and chainsaws to clear away debris and round-up the cattle.

Neighbors said they were glad to help out at a time like this.

“This is Kevin Baker’s place; he’s a good family friend. His entire fence went down; he lost his building and about 120 cattle out. We’re making sure they are all okay,” said neighbor and friend Ethan Byers.

At least six Pierson farmsteads were destroyed by tornadoes.

Officials said one tornado was nearly one-mile wide.

Officials at Alta-Aurelia School are also cleaning up.

Students said the tornado hit the school Friday night during the football game. Everyone was inside the school but no one was hurt.

Gas lines, heating-cooling units and the roof had the most damage from the tornado.

The superintendent said his biggest worry is water going through the ceiling.

The school said is trying to figure out when students will go back to class.
