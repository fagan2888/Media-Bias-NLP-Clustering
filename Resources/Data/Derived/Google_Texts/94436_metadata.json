Johnston, associate director of the nutrition program at Arizona State University, who has been studying the effects of vinegar for more than 10 years.\n\nWhen starch is not completely digested, you get a smaller blood sugar (glycemic) response \u2014 \u201c20-40% less in healthy people and in diabetics\u201d \u2014 after eating a high-glycemic food such as a bagel, according to Johnston\u2019s findings. The vinegar has a more moderate blood-glucose impact when a fiber-rich whole grain is eaten (because there is less of a spike to begin with) and no effect when no starch is eaten.\n\nOn top of that, undigested starch may have a prebiotic effect, meaning as it passes through the intestines it becomes food for the good bacteria in your gut. Well-fed gut bacteria generally translates to a healthier you \u2014 because these microorganisms help support good digestion and our immune systems, among other benefits.\n\nJohnston stresses, however, that contrary to many of those popular book titles, \u201cvinegar is not a magic bullet for weight loss. I have seen very modest weight loss in my studies, of one to two pounds after 12 weeks.\u201d\n\nBetter blood-sugar control, possible modest weight loss and better gut health seem like valid, if not exactly miraculous, benefits. But wait: There is a catch.\n\n\u201cThere is great marketing behind apple cider vinegar, and it works to lower the glycemic response, but it doesn\u2019t have to be apple cider vinegar,\u201d Johnston says. She says the active starch-inhibiting ingredient in vinegar is acetic acid, which is in all vinegars.\n\nAnd there is not an appreciable amount of vitamins, minerals or pectin in apple cider vinegar, as is often advertised. If those are the qualities you are seeking, you\u2019d be better off eating an apple.\n\nIf you want to try to reap the benefits of vinegar, make sure you do it right, because it can be harmful otherwise. Johnston suggests diluting 1 to 2 tablespoons of vinegar in 8 ounces of water and drinking it right before eating, once or twice a day, perhaps before lunch and dinner. It\u2019s important to take the vinegar just prior to eating so it is in your stomach before any starch reaches it.\n\nAlso, never drink vinegar straight. It can be dangerous if aspirated, may cause burns to the tender tissue of the mouth and esophagus, and can lead to tooth erosion. And because vinegar could interact with medications, and its anti-glycemic effect may be dangerous to diabetics taking insulin, talk to your doctor before using it therapeutically if these are concerns for you.\n\nAnd be sure not to go overboard.\n\n\u201cJust because a little is good doesn\u2019t mean you should drink half a bottle of it,\u201d Johnston says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003356553-FL_SAR_HFNUTRIBR.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere is great marketing behind apple cider vinegar, and it works to lower the glycemic response, but it doesn\u2019t have to be apple cider vinegar,\u201d Johnston says.\nJohnston stresses, however, that contrary to many of those popular book titles, \u201cvinegar is not a magic bullet for weight loss.\nIt\u2019s important to take the vinegar just prior to eating so it is in your stomach before any starch reaches it.\nAnd there is not an appreciable amount of vitamins, minerals or pectin in apple cider vinegar, as is often advertised.\nI have seen very modest weight loss in my studies, of one to two pounds after 12 weeks.\u201dBetter blood-sugar control, possible modest weight loss and better gut health seem like valid, if not exactly miraculous, benefits."}
