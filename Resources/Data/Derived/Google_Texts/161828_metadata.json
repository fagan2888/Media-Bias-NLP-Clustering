The coaching staff is thinking about the present and the future. The training staff is thinking about the present and the future.\n\nAll are right.\n\nMudiay\u2019s right ankle injury has been complex.\n\nIt\u2019s not a garden-variety ankle sprain. It\u2019s a deltoid sprain, the medial ligament, in his right ankle. Second, it\u2019s an aggravation of the same injury that cost him nearly three months of action in his one previous professional season, in China in 2014-15. The very hint of a possible re-occurrence of that injury sent the appropriate red flags up to everyone who cares about Mudiay\u2019s well-being, most important from Mudiay himself.\n\nHe has been day to day for the last week, and his situation boils down to this: He could come back, say, Sunday against Charlotte, or he could be out for a significant period of time. It has already been 14 games. Ask Mudiay, and he\u2019ll tell you it has already been a significant amount of time. The waiting is killing him.\n\n\u201cEvery time I miss a game, it just eats me up,\u201d he said.\n\nYet he\u2019s more than willing to sit as long as he needs to and get his health in the absolute right space. Even if that means enduring the most predictable criticism some hurl his way \u2014 soft. Even if it means he stays out a game too long. It\u2019s better to miss too long than to return too early and risk further injury.\n\n\u201cSteph (Curry) went through it, how he kept reinjuring his ankle,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve just got to be careful with that type of stuff, because I don\u2019t want it to linger. I know I\u2019m 19, young, but at the same time still got to take care of myself.\u201d\n\nThis situation demands kid gloves.\n\nThe organization is right to handle it the way it has, by patiently waiting for the process to play out. Too much is at stake. There are no playoffs to rush back for. For Mudiay, this season is about getting experience, getting his feet wet in the NBA, and to that end, all of this time off has put a big dent in his progress. Still, it\u2019s necessary.\n\nAnd Mudiay also now admits he needed the break.\n\n\u201cThe games before I went out, I struggled a little bit, I\u2019ll admit that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was just some mind stuff going on with me, locker-room stuff that I needed to clear up. But that\u2019s fine now. Everything is good.\u201d\n\nNot playing much in the fourth quarters had started to get to him. He didn\u2019t play down the stretch of two Nuggets road wins, at Toronto and Philadelphia. Nuggets coach Michael Malone chose to finish games with veterans.\n\n\u201cWhen I started playing not as well as I wanted to was the road trip we took,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, I kind of had my ups and downs. But I wasn\u2019t finishing quarters and the end of games.\u201d\n\nThat stress has lifted, he says.\n\nWatching has helped. He has studied how Jameer Nelson and Randy Foye operate in the fourth quarter of pressure-packed games. Mudiay has watched how other teams and great point guards finish out games as well. He\u2019ll put all of that to use when he returns.\n\nIn due time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about just getting (the ankle) out of my head, too,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cI remember how it was the first time. The first time it happened, I was out for three months. That was more severe, but it\u2019s still kind of the same kind of area, type-thing. I just want to be careful with it.\u201d\n\nHe should be. Everyone should be.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nDeMarcus Cousins, C, Sacramento Kings\n\nIn a field stuffed full of worthy candidates, DeMarcus Cousins stood out. His huge week earned him the Post\u2019s player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, Cousins averaged 32.3 points, 13.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals. He shot 53.6 percent from the field and 46.7 percent from the 3-point line. He was a plus-12.0 for the week and the Kings won three of the four contests.\n\nBackground: For all of the volatility Cousins shows on the court, he brings an equal part of sheer dominance. His best game was Jan. 4, when his 33 points and 19 rebounds led the resurgent Kings to a win over Oklahoma City. Cousins scored over 30 points in all but one of those games \u2014 he scored 29. He nearly had a triple-double (29 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists) in a Sacramento win over the Lakers on Thursday.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: This is starting to look like the season he may get out from under the label of a talented player that can\u2019t lead his team to meaningful games in April and beyond. The Kings had won three of four games going into Saturday night to move back into realistic playoff range in a Western Conference that is keeping many sub-.500 teams in the race. The Kings were 14-14 after a 1-7 start, going into Saturday\u2019s game, and Cousins\u2019 play is a huge reason why.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Sitting Emmanuel Mudiay until he\u2019s ready is right course of action", "title": "Dempsey: Sitting Emmanuel Mudiay until he\u2019s ready is right course of action", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/dempsey-sitting-emmanuel-mudiay-until-hes-ready-is-right-course-of-action/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T17:36:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:39:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a deltoid sprain, the medial ligament, in his right ankle.\n\u201cSteph (Curry) went through it, how he kept reinjuring his ankle,\u201d Mudiay said.\nMudiay\u2019s right ankle injury has been complex.\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, Cousins averaged 32.3 points, 13.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals.\nThe Kings were 14-14 after a 1-7 start, going into Saturday\u2019s game, and Cousins\u2019 play is a huge reason why."}
