Switzerland has an insurance system similar to the U.S., but health insurers cannot profit off basic plans.\n\nThe study's authors say that our ranking is so low in part because we don't have universal health coverage; however, the data was collected before Obamacare fully rolled out. Rankings may thus rise in the future.\n\nBut the U.K. and the U.S. ranked low in terms of \"healthy lives,\" which takes into account infant mortality, life expectancy at age 60 and death from preventable diseases.\n\nAmerica spends the most on health care while Austalia spends the least. (Commonwealth Fund)\n\nThe results weren't all bad for America: We ranked well in the \"effective care\" category, scoring high on preventative care efforts.\n\nBut \"efficient care\" was a problem for us \u2014 administrative hassles between doctors and patients got in the way, as did erroneous medical testing and overuse of the ER, the report said.\n\nThe U.S. spends most of its GDP on health care \u2014 17.7% \u2014 while Australia spends the least, 8.9%.\n\nWe are picking up steam in developing new health information technology, but our quality assurance is still an issue. The report said we should take notes from other countries to improve our system in the coming years.\n\nAmerica ranked last in \"efficiency, equity and outcomes\" in 2010, 2007, 2006 and 2004, as well.\n\nThe full rankings are as follows:\n\n1. United Kingdom\n\n2. Switzerland\n\n3. Sweden\n\n4. Australia\n\n5. Germany & Netherlands (tied)\n\n7. New Zealand & Norway (tied)\n\n9. France\n\n10. Canada\n\n11.
