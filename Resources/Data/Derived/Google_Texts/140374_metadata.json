(REUTERS/The Maneater/Elizabeth Loutfi)\n\n4783997\n\nUniversity of Missouri graduate students, including hunger strike protester Jonathan Butler, have been protesting on campus in part because of cuts to the students\u2019 health-care coverage as a result of Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the cutbacks were explained in detail on an August posting on the school\u2019s website, which said Obamacare\u2019s regulations banned employers, like universities, from paying for their grad students\u2019 health insurance.\n\nGraduate students would have to buy insurance in individual markets as a result of not being eligible for the insurance plan offered to MU staff and faculty.\n\nThe St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that the Internal Revenue Service posted a bulletin offering guidance on this issue and threatened \u201csevere\u201d penalties for noncompliance.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the IRS notice says you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Steven Bloom, director of federal relations for American Council on Education told The Dispatch.\n\nIn a letter announcing his hunger strike, Butler described incidents that, he said, \u201cdynamically disrupted the learning experience for marginalized/ underrepresented students.\u201d\n\nButler wrote, \u201cIn the past 90 days alone we have seen the MSA (Missouri Students Association) President Payton Head being called the n-word on campus, graduate students being robbed of their health insurance, Planned Parenthood services being stripped from campus, #ConcernedStudent1950 peaceful demonstrators being threatened with pepper spray, and a matter of days ago a vile and disgusting act of hatred where a MU student drew a swastika in the Gateway residential hall with their own feces.\u201d\n\nMizzou also canceled 10 contracts with Planned Parenthood three months ago. The contracts had allowed MU\u2019s nursing and medical students to get experience at Planned Parenthood facilities in five cities in four states, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe cancellations were prompted when a state legislative committee was formed to investigate the organization, when undercover sting videos were released by the Center for Medical Progress.\n\nThe canceled contracts angered both student body and faculty alike, and two months later, by October, MU allowed its nursing and medical students to work at Planned Parenthood clinics. The new agreement, however, banned the students from participating in abortion services \u2014 a measure that was allowed under the previous agreements.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri president and CEO Laura McQuade was pleased the agreements were renewed but told the AP that \u201cmore must be done.\u201d She said the university had surrendered to \u201cpolitical bullying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kerry Picket", "description": "Grievances protested by University of Missouri graduate students, particularly hunger strike protester Jonathan Butler, included cutbacks to the student\u2019s", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "University of Missouri graduate students, including hunger strike protester Jonathan Butler, have been protesting on campus in part because of\u00a0cuts to the students' health-care coverage as a result o", "title": "Mizzou Protesters Angry Over Health Care Cuts Caused By Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/12/mizzou-protesters-angry-over-obamacare-cuts/", "image": {"width": 1191, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-11T142747Z_1_LYNXNPEBAA0P8_RTROPTP_4_MISSOURI-BOYCOTT-e1450730192457.jpg", "height": 501}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'In a nutshell, the IRS notice says you can't do that'", "title": "Mizzou Protesters Angry Over Health Care Cuts Caused By Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/12/mizzou-protesters-angry-over-obamacare-cuts/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-11T142747Z_1_LYNXNPEBAA0P8_RTROPTP_4_MISSOURI-BOYCOTT-e1450730192457.jpg"}, "creator": "@KerryPicket", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-12 09:40:01", "sailthru.title": "Mizzou Protesters Angry Over Health Care Cuts Caused By Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,planned-parenthood,kerry-picket", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jonathan butler,obamacare,planned parenthood,university of missouri", "sailthru.description": "University of Missouri graduate students, including hunger strike protester Jonathan Butler, have been protesting on campus in part because of\u00a0cuts to the students' health-care coverage as a result o", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-11T142747Z_1_LYNXNPEBAA0P8_RTROPTP_4_MISSOURI-BOYCOTT-e1450730192457.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Students listen at a press conference at Traditions Plaza at Carnahan Quad, on the University of Missouri campus in Columbia, Missouri, Nov. 9, 2015.\nThe contracts had allowed MU\u2019s nursing and medical students to get experience at Planned Parenthood facilities in five cities in four states, the Associated Press reported.\nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri president and CEO Laura McQuade was pleased the agreements were renewed but told the AP that \u201cmore must be done.\u201d She said the university had surrendered to \u201cpolitical bullying.\u201d\nThe canceled contracts angered both student body and faculty alike, and two months later, by October, MU allowed its nursing and medical students to work at Planned Parenthood clinics.\nThe new agreement, however, banned the students from participating in abortion services \u2014 a measure that was allowed under the previous agreements."}
