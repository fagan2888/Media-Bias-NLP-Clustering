Sturgis, SD

Sturgis' volunteer fire chief says the owner of the Full Throttle Saloon that was destroyed by a blaze last month has more than compensated the department for fuel costs incurred while fighting the flames.



The Rapid City Journal reports that a representative of the popular Sturgis biker bar dropped off a check this week.



The bill for the volunteer fire department's response to the blaze added up to over $6,000. But the department had decided to ask owner Michael Ballard for only $320, which is the cost of the fuel that the department's trucks used while battling the fire.



Volunteer Fire Chief Tom Trigg says the check was "well in excess" of the fuel costs.



The loss caused by the fire is estimated at $10 million.
