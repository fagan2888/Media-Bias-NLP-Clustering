The report also found that more than half of the government-sponsored nonprofit insurance co-ops have now failed, leaving more than 750,000 families and individuals scrambling for new health insurance.\n\n\"The increased healthcare costs compared to last year is probably making it harder for Hispanics to afford health insurance,\" said Monica Escaleras, Ph.D., director of the BEPI.\n\nPolitical partisanship appeared to play a part in influencing respondents' opinions on healthcare topics. Republicans and Independents were significantly more likely (50 and 53 percent, respectively) to think it was harder to afford health insurance as compared with Democrats (41 percent).\n\nOverall, 51 percent of Hispanics gave Obamacare a favorable rating, compared with 35 percent unfavorable.\n\nThe poll was conducted nationally April 1-30.\n\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150508/214770LOGO\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latest-fau-poll-finds-its-harder-for-hispanics-to-afford-healthcare-but-more-covered-since-obamacare-enacted-300264342.html\n\nSOURCE FAU Business and Economics Polling Institute\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.fau.edu\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "florida", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "BOCA RATON, Fla., May 6", "description": "BOCA RATON, Fla., May 6, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Latest FAU Poll Finds It's Harder for Hispanics to Afford Healthcare but More Covered Since...", "author": "FAU Business and Economics Polling Institute", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latest-fau-poll-finds-its-harder-for-hispanics-to-afford-healthcare-but-more-covered-since-obamacare-enacted-300264342.html", "image": "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150508/214770LOGO", "type": "website", "description": "BOCA RATON, Fla., May 6, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- An increasing number of Hispanics are finding it harder to...", "title": "Latest FAU Poll Finds It's Harder for Hispanics to Afford Healthcare but More Covered Since Obamacare Enacted"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "Latest FAU Poll Finds It's Harder for Hispanics to Afford Healthcare but More Covered Since Obamacare Enacted", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "FAU Business and Economics Polling Institute, florida, Surveys, Polls and Research, Hispanic, Women, Health Care & Hospitals, Education, Education, Health Insurance", "date": "2016-05-06T09:38:00Z", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"The increased healthcare costs compared to last year is probably making it harder for Hispanics to afford health insurance,\" said Monica Escaleras, Ph.D., director of the BEPI.\nRepublicans and Independents were significantly more likely (50 and 53 percent, respectively) to think it was harder to afford health insurance as compared with Democrats (41 percent).\nThe report also found that more than half of the government-sponsored nonprofit insurance co-ops have now failed, leaving more than 750,000 families and individuals scrambling for new health insurance.\nAccording to the BEPI survey, it appears Hispanic women are increasing their access to health insurance through the ACA with 52 percent of females saying they have government healthcare coverage compared to only 23.3 percent of males.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150508/214770LOGOTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latest-fau-poll-finds-its-harder-for-hispanics-to-afford-healthcare-but-more-covered-since-obamacare-enacted-300264342.htmlSOURCE FAU Business and Economics Polling InstituteRelated Linkshttp://www.fau.edu"}
