It\u2019s important to do this to make sure you get the correct amount in subsidies this year.\n\nThe Daily News recently paid a visit to the EmblemHealth Neighborhood Care center on 125th St. in Harlem, where certified marketplace enrollers are helping locals get signed up on the exchange.\n\nAt the center were two customers who enrolled in Obamacare last year, but chose to compare plans again this year. There was also a so-called \u201cinvincible,\u201d a young woman who was happy to learn she was entitled to free health insurance.\n\nAll three were helped by EmblemHealth individual insurance sales representative Assata Washington.\n\nHere are their stories:\n\nBeverley Draggon, real estate broker\n\nA lot has changed for Draggon since she signed up for Obamacare last year.\n\nDraggon, a real estate broker in Harlem, was able to purchase a 2014 plan that cost her nothing in premiums, after subsidies.\n\nBut she expects to earn more in 2015, and therefore her subsidies likely will be less robust.\n\nDraggon has also decided that her current plan\u2019s network does not suit her needs.\n\n\u201cMost of my providers don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said.\n\nDraggon decided to switch to an EmblemHealth silver plan that will cost her $235 a month, after the subsidy. All of her doctors accept the plan.\n\nDraggon said she doesn\u2019t mind the added cost. Before the launch of Obamacare, she was paying $700 a month for health insurance.\n\n\u201cI am very happy,\u201d she said.\n\nTim Heath, 54, real estate salesman, Bohemia Realty Group\n\nTim Heath was in for a shock.\n\nAssata Washington shows Beverly Draggon, of Harlem, what her new options are for 2015. (Jennifer Mitchell Photography)\n\nIn the fall, the Hudson Heights resident got a letter from New York State of Health: The plan that covers him and his wife, at a cost of $340 a month after his subsidy, will cost him $708 in 2015, the notice said.\n\nThe reason for the big jump: the marketplace said he is no longer eligible for financial assistance.\n\nIn estimating a customer\u2019s income and subsidies eligibility for the coming year, the exchange uses your most recent tax return \u2014 the return you filed for 2013.\n\nThis can create confusion for enrollees whose expected income in 2015 will be far different.\n\n\u201cI knew I needed professional help to navigate these complex plans,\u201d Heath said.\n\nWith Washington\u2019s guidance, Heath arrived at a more realistic picture of his projected income and expenses for 2015.\n\nAfter considering his options, he reenrolled in a bronze EmblemHealth plan. The cost, after the subsidy, will be $410 a month \u2014 much less than the estimate he received from the exchange.\n\nHis advice to others: \u201cI encourage people to reach out to a broker to get assistance in navigating,\u201d Heath said. \u201cThere is so much information out there that provides clarity.\u201d\n\nRebecca Cabrera, 25, job seeker\n\nA random walk down 125th St. has made a big difference for Rebecca Cabrera.\n\nCabrera happened to be in the neighborhood recently and stepped into the EmblemHealth center.\n\nUninsured since November, the Harlem resident has been thinking about her health lately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting sick,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cI\u2019ve been applying for jobs. It\u2019s stressful.\u201d\n\nWashington told Cabrera that she is eligible for Medicaid. Cabrera signed up for Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care, which will allow her to see her preferred doctor. She\u2019s grateful for the coverage.\n\n\u201cA lot of young people say (health insurance) doesn\u2019t make a difference. It does,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cIt\u2019s important no matter how old you are.\u201d\n\nWashington said she sees many people who aren\u2019t aware that they\u2019re entitled to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cCome in, bring your information,\u201d Washington said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do for you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Phyllis Furman", "twitter": {"description": "It pays to return to the marketplace.Why bother to roll up your sleeves again, if you did all the hard work last year?", "title": "As life goes on, so do Obamacare subsidies", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/life-obamacare-subsidies-article-1.2104705", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104702.1423167842!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/emblemhealth-neighborhood-care-215-west-125th-st-harlem-e.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, EmblemHealth Neighborhood Care center, New  York State of Health, Healthcare.gov", "parsely-author": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "Obamacare, EmblemHealth Neighborhood Care center, New  York State of Health, Healthcare.gov", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, EmblemHealth Neighborhood Care center, New  York State of Health, Healthcare.gov", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/life-obamacare-subsidies-article-1.2104705", "parsely-title": "As life goes on, so do Obamacare subsidies", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-05T15:46:07-0500", "sailthru.title": "As life goes on, so do Obamacare subsidies", "nydn_section": "Health", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-05T20:46:07", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104702.1423167842!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/emblemhealth-neighborhood-care-215-west-125th-st-harlem-e.jpg", "description": "It pays to return to the marketplace.Why bother to roll up your sleeves again, if you did all the hard work last year?", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "It pays to return to the marketplace.Why bother to roll up your sleeves again, if you did all the hard work last year?", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "It pays to return to the marketplace.Why bother to roll up your sleeves again, if you did all the hard work last year?", "title": "As life goes on, so do Obamacare subsidies", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/life-obamacare-subsidies-article-1.2104705", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104702.1423167842!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/emblemhealth-neighborhood-care-215-west-125th-st-harlem-e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104702.1423167842!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/emblemhealth-neighborhood-care-215-west-125th-st-harlem-e.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Draggon, a real estate broker in Harlem, was able to purchase a 2014 plan that cost her nothing in premiums, after subsidies.\n\u201cSome health plan prices went up and some went down, so you want to shop around,\u201d said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society.\nAfter considering his options, he reenrolled in a bronze EmblemHealth plan.\nAt the center were two customers who enrolled in Obamacare last year, but chose to compare plans again this year.\nAlso, your income may have changed, meaning you might be entitled to more, or less, in the way of subsidies."}
