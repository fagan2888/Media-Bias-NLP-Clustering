(Photo: FILE)Buy Photo\n\nREADINGTON A 45-year-old township man has been charged with taking a police summons, placing it between what the indictment calls his \"butt cheeks,\" wiping the paper up and down, then and tossing it at a police officer.\n\n\n\nJoseph Greenwood, of the Whitehouse Station section, was indicted on a fourth-degree charge of throwing bodily fluids.\n\n\n\nFourth-degree crimes carry a possible 18-month jail sentence, though most result in probation.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, Greenwood tossed the summons at Lt. John Insabella of the Readington Police Department on June 2.\n\n\n\nGreenwood was given the summons after being released on a municipal court charge of threatening to assault another person, court records indicate.\n\n\n\nThree months later, on Sept. 18, Greenwood was charged by Patrolman Patrick Brown with disorderly conduct and making threats to kill another person. Those charges are pending.\n\n\n\nStaff Writer Mike Deak: 908-243-6607; mdeak@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RFFa2B", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Readington man has been charged with taking a summons, placing it between his \"butt cheeks,\" then tossing it at a cop.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "A Readington man has been charged with taking a summons, placing it between his \"butt cheeks,\" then tossing it at a cop.", "title": "Cops: Man wipes 'butt cheeks' with summons, tosses it at officer", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/10/13/cops-man-wipes-butt-cheeks-summons-tosses-officer/73870500/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Readington man has been charged with taking a summons, placing it between his \"butt cheeks,\" then tossing it at a cop.", "title": "Cops: N.J. man wipes 'butt cheeks' with summons, throws it at cop", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39f973425d77e6816500e90c4fb3943d4cde13d9/c=0-337-1247-1584&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/13/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635803473027149793-summons.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Butt cheeks, Hunterdon, Readington, bodily fluids"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo A Readington man has been charged with wiping a police summons between his \"butt cheeks,\" then tossing it at a police officer.\nAccording to the indictment, Greenwood tossed the summons at Lt.
