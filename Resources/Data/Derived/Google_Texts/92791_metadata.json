It\u2019s not that he was nervous. He has, in fact, been sentenced to jail more than 90 times.\n\nHe shook because he\u2019s going through withdrawal. He needs cocaine.\n\nLatham is a professional shoplifter. Since 1978, the Buffalo man has been arrested 131 times in Buffalo and nearby suburban communities.\n\nLatham\u2019s eyebrows, goatee and stubble on his head are almost all gray. But his warm brown eyes and smooth-skinned face make it easy to imagine a younger Latham rather than the 60-year-old man in the orange jumpsuit.\n\nHe has been stealing small items \u2013 cologne, bedsheets, phones, dresses \u2013 since he was 24.\n\nWhy does he steal?\n\n\u201cDrugs,\u201d said Latham, who acknowledged being addicted to cocaine.\n\nHe then sells these small items on the street to buy cocaine. His thefts are petit larceny, a misdemeanor when the value is under $1,000. This way, if he gets caught, he winds up in jail for less than a year.\n\nDrug users across Erie County survive on such small thefts, said Paul S. Piotrowski, the Cheektowaga town justice who last month sentenced Latham to jail.\n\nMany drug addicts such as Latham become professional shoplifters, the judge suggested, and they know what they\u2019re doing. They steal items valued less than $1,000 because if they steal anything more, it\u2019s considered grand larceny and they can go to state prison for more than a year. They also know that there\u2019s no limit to how many times they can be charged with petit larceny.\n\nSo as soon as they get out of jail, there\u2019s nothing law enforcement can do to stop them from continuing to steal.\n\n\u201cFor as surprising as it may seem that someone could have been arrested that many times, that is not an uncommon occurrence,\u201d said Piotrowski, who sentenced Latham to jail multiple times during his 2\u00bd years as a judge. \u201cThere are a lot of individuals who are career criminals. \u2026 Many of them are homeless \u2013 where they stay with friends and acquaintances and don\u2019t live anywhere \u2013 and steal to support a drug habit.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that it can go on as long as it does.\u201d\n\nCheektowaga Assistant Chief of Police James J. Speyer Jr. has seen Latham get arrested time and again since he began working for the department 27 years ago.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s well-known everywhere,\u201d Speyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only one; there\u2019s quite a few of them. They\u2019re professional shoplifters.\u201d\n\nLast month, Latham pleaded guilty to a charge of petit larceny after he stole a $76 Calvin Klein cologne gift set from the Macy\u2019s department store at the Walden Galleria on April 28. Piotrowski cited his past charges and sentenced him to six months in jail.\n\nHere is a sampling of Latham\u2019s shoplifting through the years:\n\n\u2022 Sept. 20, 2013 \u2013 Stole $55.84 worth of men\u2019s underwear at Walmart in Thruway Plaza, Cheektowaga\n\n\u2022 May 5, 2013 \u2013 Stole $100 worth of sheet sets and purses from Family Dollar on Genesee Street, Cheektowaga\n\n\u2022 May 18, 2001 \u2013 Stole two cordless telephones from Radio Shack in University Plaza, Amherst. Police also charged him with possessing a stolen warm-up suit from University Medical Bookstore in the same plaza.\n\n\u2022 Jan. 23, 1992 \u2013 Sentenced to nine months in jail for shoplifting at the Dress Barn, Cheektowaga.\n\nLatham\u2019s Erie County records show 131 different cases with 180 separate charges. Often, he has been arrested on multiple charges, such as stealing from a Walden Galleria shop and being in the mall illegally (he was banned years ago) or resisting arrest. His 131 cases don\u2019t include the ones that are sealed.\n\nAnd Latham\u2019s 131 arrests are only the instances in which police caught him. It\u2019s estimated that only one in every 40 incidents of shoplifting are caught or identified, according to Speyer. Latham could very well have stolen thousands of times in the Buffalo area since 1978.\n\nPeople such as Latham, who spend their lives in and out of jail, aren\u2019t a big problem for society, Piotrowski said. They cause more harm for themselves than anyone else.\n\n\u201cMany of them are not violent, which is a good thing,\u201d Piotrowski said. \u201cMany of them go to the stores and steal a lot of merchandise, such as several bottles of expensive cologne that can be sold on the street to support a drug habit, or sometimes, in fairness to them, sometimes they buy food with it because they don\u2019t maintain a conventional lifestyle. \u2026 They do things to survive. So consequently, they\u2019re not doing heinous crimes.\u201d\n\nWhen Piotrowski was chief of the Narcotics Bureau for the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s Office 2\u00bd years ago, he worked with a many addicted people. He began to understand that they were \u201ctrapped in this culture\u201d of stealing to survive.\n\nAnd now as Cheektowaga town justice, he recognizes shoplifters who come before him on regular basis. He started his career in law in the Erie County Holding Center when he was 23.\n\n\u201cSo as a young man, I see people today that I saw in 1977, when I started in the Erie County Holding Center,\u201d Piotrowski said. \u201cNow it\u2019s 2014, and both myself and the people that I interacted with in the Holding Center, our paths have crossed again 37 years later.\u201d\n\nThe criminal-justice system offers a possible solution to frequent shoplifters who want to stop their habit: Drug Court.\n\nThere are about 100 participants in Cheektowaga Town Drug Court currently, and many were never arrested on drug charges. Most come in because they were charged with theft, Piotrowski said. Typically, the Drug Court team helps 50 percent of its clients turn their lives around, according to Piotrowski.\n\n\u201cThe Drug Court won\u2019t help me,\u201d Latham said, but Piotrowski said that as long as an arrested person wants the help, the Drug Court offers treatment programs.\n\nLatham is dependent on cocaine, but many Erie County shoplifters are addicted to heroin, Piotrowski said.\n\nJust last month, Erie County\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, said heroin addiction is a \u201chuge problem\u201d throughout the county, particularly because prescription drugs are harder to find on the streets since the 2012 state enactment of the Drug Reform Act Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing, or I-STOP.\n\nThere have been at least 17 heroin-related deaths in Erie County this year, according to Mary C. St. Mary, the medical care administrator for the Erie County Department of Health.\n\nAnd theft to purchase drugs is on the rise.\n\n\u201cWe are making more arrests for petit larceny in the local malls than we have in the last couple of years,\u201d said Scott M. Joslyn, chief of police services for the Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThe increase partially could be attributed to the rising drug use.\u201d\n\nThe Buffalo News asked Latham if he\u2019ll continue to steal after he finishes his six-month jail sentence in the fall.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered.\n\nBut if he does, he\u2019ll keep getting the same sentence.\n\n\u201cWhen you get someone who is, say, 60 years old and in and out of jail 100 times or more and has been in and out of prison, that usually doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Piotrowski said. \u201cThey\u2019re deeply entrenched in a lifestyle and a mindset that they can\u2019t get out of because that\u2019s all they know. Many of them were born into these kinds of problems.\u201d\n\nemail: lkhoury@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rickie Latham\u2019s hands shook as he sat in the Erie County Holding Center in an orange jumpsuit.
