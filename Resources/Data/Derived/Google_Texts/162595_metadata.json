Major American companies are supposed to pay a 35 percent tax on overseas earnings, but many avoid that by using a legal loophole that allows them to keep the earnings in other countries indefinitely.\n\nUnder Obama\u2019s repatriation approach, companies such as Apple, Cisco Systems and Microsoft would have a one-time opportunity to pay taxes on overseas earnings at the much lower 14 percent tax rate. In addition, the proposal would impose a permanent 19-percent tax on foreign earnings.\n\nThe Obama proposal would raise an estimated $238 billion in the coming years to underwrite an ambitious infrastructure program, while an additional $240 billion would come from the current federal tax on gas and other revenue sources. In all, the six-year, $478 billion infrastructure proposal would provide a 33 percent funding increase for major public works projects.\n\nRelated: Obama Wants Long-Term Infrastructure Plan, Not Keystone\n\nIn an appearance on C-SPAN that aired Sunday, Foxx touted the president\u2019s plan as a \u201cpro-growth business tax reform\u201d that has the virtue of reducing corporate tax rates for multi-national corporations with vast overseas holdings. While the proposal has drawn sharp fire in some quarters, Foxx argued it provided a good starting point for talks.\n\n\u201cAny time you have a pay-for for something as massive as transportation, there are going to be warts on any given proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this one meets the test of not raising tax rates, not raising deficits, but putting significant dollars into the system.\u201d\n\nThe federal Highway Trust Fund \u2013 the main revenue source for construction and repair of highways, bridges and mass transit projects \u2013 has been in crisis mode for years because of the inadequacy of its funding source. Most trust fund revenues come from an 18.4-cents per gallon gas tax that hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993.\n\nCongressional leaders had high hopes at one time of passing a six-year $100 billion transportation funding bill. But last summer, lawmakers had to settle for a short-term measure that averted a calamity in the states\u2019 infrastructure construction program. Congress essentially used a series of budget gimmicks to authorize an $11 billion, 10-month extension of funding to prevent a 28 percent reduction in infrastructure spending at the peak of the summer construction season.\n\nRelated: Governors Join Obama in Infrastructure Spending Plea\n\nWhile most GOP leaders have dismissed much of Obama\u2019s budget and tax proposals, Ryan began signaling around the time of the State of the Union address that he was looking for common ground with Obama. Speaking broadly about tax reform on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press early this month, Ryan said, \u201cWe want to work with this administration to see if we can find common ground on certain aspects of tax reform\u2026 If and when that possibility is exhausted, we will put out what we think ought to be done.\u201d\n\nRyan said Friday, \u201cThe only way repatriation can actually work to help with the Highway Trust Fund problem is through comprehensive tax reform.\u201d Sterm tax holidays and retroactive overseas tax repatriation aren\u2019t effective, he said.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican said that if Congress fails to approve corporate tax reform this year, he will be forced to find the funding for highways and bridges from some other source. \u201cIf [tax reform] doesn\u2019t happen and for one reason or another we\u2019re incapable of finding an agreement, then we\u2019re going to have to go to finding other ways of bridging the shortfall,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitico reported the position follows hints Ryan has made before that he could be open to a proposal similar to one made by Obama.\n\nRelated: Biz Group Makes Congress an Infrastructure Offer They Can\u2019t Refuse\n\nRay LaHood, Obama\u2019s former transportation secretary and an advocate for more transportation spending, said Monday he doubted the administration or Congress could convince the business community to agree to overseas tax repatriation if revenues go toward infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe business community is going to be a lot more in favor of using the repatriated funds to pay for [reduced rates under] corporate tax reform than for infrastructure, or to use it for research and development or to use it for purposes that benefit their own companies,\u201d he said. \u201cTo use it for infrastructure, I think it\u2019s going to be a real stretch.\u201d\n\nLaHood, co-founder of the bipartisan Building America\u2019s Future fund, said he agreed with groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO that Congress should increase the federal gas tax by 10 cents a gallon and index it for inflation to underwrite highway and infrastructure spending.\n\n\u201cWithout a big pot of money, we are never going to get back to being number one in infrastructure,\u201d said LaHood.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Less than four months before federal government and state officials must confront anot", "title": "How Tax Reform Could Help Save U.S. Infrastructure", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/How-Tax-Reform-Could-Help-Save-US-Infrastructure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/How-Tax-Reform-Could-Help-Save-US-Infrastructure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Less than four months before federal government and state officials must confront anot", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At a meeting with reporters last week, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI) declared, \u201cIf we can get comprehensive tax reform, that can help fix it.\u201d The former Budget Committee chair and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee has set a seven-month timetable for passage of comprehensive corporate and small business tax reform.\nIn all, the six-year, $478 billion infrastructure proposal would provide a 33 percent funding increase for major public works projects.\nIf crafted properly, Ryan said, reforms could help unlock many billions of dollars in revenues needed to prop up the Highway Trust Fund.\n\u201cIf [tax reform] doesn\u2019t happen and for one reason or another we\u2019re incapable of finding an agreement, then we\u2019re going to have to go to finding other ways of bridging the shortfall,\u201d he said.\nCongressional leaders had high hopes at one time of passing a six-year $100 billion transportation funding bill."}
