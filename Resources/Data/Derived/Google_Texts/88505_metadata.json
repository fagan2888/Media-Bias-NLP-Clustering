Djokovic has never lost a Slam match to a player that far down in the rankings.\n\nMuch of the pre-tournament buzz was about the potential quarterfinal matchup between Nadal and Djokovic, possible because Nadal\u2019s poor-for-him results dropped his ranking to its lowest point in a decade.\n\nIf everyone else wants to look ahead, the players who met in two of the past three finals at the French Open do not.\n\n\u201cI still need to win four matches to get there,\u201d Djokovic pointed out, \u201cas much as he does.\u201d\n\nDjokovic carries a 22-match winning streak into Tuesday, while Nadal has won 66 of 67 matches at Roland Garros, including 35 in a row.\n\n\u201cWhen I say I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have confidence (in) myself to try to be ready for it. I have to think that I am ready for it,\u201d Nadal said. \u201c(It) is a tournament that I love.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what else is happening at the French Open on Tuesday:\n\nSERENA STARTS\n\nSerena Williams starts her attempt to win a 20th Grand Slam singles title, and third at the French Open, by facing qualifier Andrea Hlavackova of the Czech Republic. Williams is 57-1 in first-round matches at majors, although the only loss came in Paris in 2012. As if her opponent\u2019s resume isn\u2019t daunting enough, Hlavackova might not want to think about this: The only other time she played Williams, at the 2012 U.S. Open, the American won 6-0, 6-0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "title": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "title": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/26/french_open_lookahead_nadal_djokovic_finally_get_started/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-tennis-french-open.jpeg15-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "title": "FRENCH OPEN LOOKAHEAD: Nadal, Djokovic finally get started", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-tennis-french-open.jpeg15-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Howard Fendrich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb1e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 Two most-talked-about men at this year\u2019s French Open, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, finally play their first matches on Tuesday.\nIf everyone else wants to look ahead, the players who met in two of the past three finals at the French Open do not.\n1-seeded Djokovic, whose bid to complete a career Grand Slam starts off against Jarkko Nieminen, a 33-year-old from Finland ranked 87th.\nMuch of the pre-tournament buzz was about the potential quarterfinal matchup between Nadal and Djokovic, possible because Nadal\u2019s poor-for-him results dropped his ranking to its lowest point in a decade.\nDjokovic has never lost a Slam match to a player that far down in the rankings."}
