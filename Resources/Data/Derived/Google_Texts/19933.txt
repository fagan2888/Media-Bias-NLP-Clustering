President Barack Obama is poised to grant amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants because he wants to transform the United States into a "multicultural, multilingual, multiethnic, borderless land," Pat Buchanan wrote in a commentary in Townhall The move could come in an executive order before Labor Day, judging by the comments of Obama confidante Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, according to Buchanan.Putting these 5 million on the path to citizenship would send a message to billions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America that "if you can get into America, by whatever means necessary, and lay low for a while, there is a near certainty you will be able to stay," Buchanan wrote.Obama — who already used his executive powers to grant amnesty to migrant children brought into the United States illegally by their parents before 2007— has no compunctions about doing with "his pen and his phone" what Congress will not do and is too divided to block, according to Buchanan.From the president's vantage point, the rewards outweigh the firestorm of criticism that will accompany any amnesty, Buchanan said.Obama's move would solidify Hispanics to the Democratic Party, garner praise from the Christian left, as well as understated backing from Chamber-of-Commerce Republicans, the one-time presidential candidate said.It will also draw attention away from the president's "his foreign policy fecklessness, diffident leadership, and IRS, VA, Benghazi and Obamacare foul-ups and scandals," according to Buchanan.America's transformation would ultimately lead to the demise of the GOP completing the process of "turning America blue," Buchanan wrote.New arrivals "will remake the West and America in their own image, Obama's image, the image of that Tower of Babel, the United Nations General Assembly" while also creating an economic burden the country will not be able to carry, Buchanan wrote.As is, he wrote, 50 million legal and illegal immigrants have come to the United States since 1965. Buchanan concludes, as others arrive the question becomes: "How much more diversity can we handle before there is no unity left?"
