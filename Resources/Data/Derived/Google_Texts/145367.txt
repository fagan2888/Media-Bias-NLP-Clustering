CLEVELAND (AP) — A prosecutor is seeking the death penalty against a Cleveland truck driver accused in the slayings of four people.

Cleveland.com reports (http://bit.ly/1NHMXd4 ) Cuyahoga (ky-uh-HOH'-guh) County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has filed a new indictment including specifications that would allow a jury to recommend the death penalty for 45-year-old Robert Rembert Jr.

Rembert pleaded not guilty Friday to more than 20 charges in the four slayings — three last year and one in 1997.

Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Rembert to the strangulation deaths of 47-year-old Rena Mae Payne in 1997 and 31-year-old Kimberly Hall last June.

He also is charged with fatally shooting his cousin, 52-year-old Jerry Rembert, and 26-year-old Morgan Nietzel at a Cleveland home he shared with the two.

Rembert is due back in court May 3.
