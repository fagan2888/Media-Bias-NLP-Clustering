Anthony Marcantuono Jr. and Lt. Joseph Shannon will be promoted to captain, and Sgt. Dominick Masi will be promoted to lieutenant.\n\nMayor Thomas Lankey said his administration has made it a point to settle as many of the several lawsuits against the township as possible to reduce tax dollars tied to legal expenses.\n\nBut local police and residents questioned the legality of the settlement's promotions in the wake of a recent ordinance that aims to increase the integrity and accountability of the hiring and promotional practices with a department plagued for 25 years by questionable behavior. They said the township is sending a message that local police can sue rather than test for promotions.\n\nTownship officials confirmed that the officers went through a promotional process in from mid-2012 to early 2013 and got the highest scores possible.\n\n\"The township is very comfortable in making these promotions,\" they said.\n\nAuthorities also said the settlements' savings in legal costs are significant but hard to quantify.\n\nThe settlements are subject to final approval by the township council, which is expected to consider them at Wednesday night's (Dec. 10) public meeting.\n\nTwo additional police lawsuits, alleging actions prior to the Lankey administration, appear as if they will require further litigation, authorities said. If the opportunity to resolve those cases at a minimal cost to Edison arises, township officials said they would pursue settlements. Otherwise, Edison is prepared to take those matters to verdict, they said.\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@MyCentralJersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1AcxUSr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Edison Township has proposed a settlement with three police officers who sued after being passed over for promotions in 2013, authorities said in a news release.
