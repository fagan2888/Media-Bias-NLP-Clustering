But this audience being what it is, most of them were thinking, \u201cIf Iran had gotten on with it already, we wouldn\u2019t need to sit here and listen to this Jew talk.\u201d\n\nThe man for whom this message is most sharply intended wasn\u2019t in the building today. And if he were, I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be receptive either.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid on two different occasions this year went to White House chief of staff Denis McDonough seeking a public commitment from President Barack Obama that he would veto any U.N. resolution calling for an independent Palestinian state. Both times, Obama did nothing. The requests from Reid came as he was trying to line up Democratic support for the Iran nuclear agreement. If Obama explicitly sided with Israel against the possible U.N. resolution, Reid\u2019s thinking went, it would give nervous Democrats cover to back the Iran deal, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vocally protested. The repeated requests by Reid and Obama\u2019s unwillingness to make a statement on the issue \u2014 confirmed by White House officials and Senate aides \u2014 highlights how wide the gulf between the Obama administration and Israeli government has become.\n\nLook it at from O\u2019s perspective. He knew that Reid\u2019s caucus, ever fearful of being accused by the left of disloyalty to the King, would never cross him on the Iran deal no matter how little political cover he offered them to prove that they\u2019re pro-Israel. Reid has been so dutiful in getting Senate Dems to line up behind unpopular initiatives like ObamaCare that he rode a filibuster-proof majority all the way down to minority status in the name of backing the president. He even blew up the filibuster to help Obama get his nominees confirmed. If he had crossed the White House once or twice on a big vote, O would have taken his concerns about the vote on a Palestinian state more seriously. As it is, he ended up treating Reid like \u2014 well, like Putin treats Obama.\n\nNo worries, though. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a moment of silence at the Security Council after the first Obama-enabled Iranian nuke hits Israel a decade or two from now. Unless Russia vetoes it, of course.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cUtter silence.
