The no-kill shelter is already crowded, turning down owner-surrendered cats because they don't have enough space.\n\nThe fourth is a tough time for pets, as many get scared and run away from the sound of fireworks. Many of them end up at the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society. They don't turn away strays and their kennels are filling up fast.\n\n\"What we need is people to come out and actually adopt the animals,\" Kennel Manager Monique Mixell said.\n\nMixell reports that on Thursday, 31 animals were adopted from the organization, including nine cats, 21 dogs, and one ferret. She says the high adoption rate can be attributed to it being the day before a holiday. But even with this many animals finding new homes, there are an equal number coming in to the humane society.\n\n\"We do do adoptions every single day, but a lot of the days we have more animals coming in than we have going out of course,\" Mixell said.\n\nWhich means the shelter is getting a little crowded. So crowded, that the nonprofit is not accepting owner-surrendered cats at this time.\n\nThe increase in animals also means there are more pets spending a lot of time in kennels.\n\n\"They know what it's like to be able to sleep in a bed at night, and to cuddle up and go for walks, and they're not getting that now. And from my experience personally, the shelter pets are the best. They make the best pets, it's almost like they're more appreciative.\"\n\nAnd these animals, along with the humane society staff, are in need of people to come in and adopt.\n\n37 animals were adopted on Saturday.\n\nIf you're interested in bringing home an animal from the humane society and want to see which ones are available, click on the link below.\n\nhttp://www.sfhumanesociety.com/", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "One day after the fourth of July, strays spooked by fireworks are filling the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society.
