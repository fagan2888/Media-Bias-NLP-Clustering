PhRMA filed the suit in an attempt to exclude all drugs with an \"orphan\" designation \u2014 a drug that has been developed specifically to treat a rare condition and often carries a hefty price tag \u2014 from the final rule. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled in favor of PhRMA, finding HHS doesn't have the authority to put regulations into place that implement Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 340B provisions.\n\nHowever, HRSA subsequently re-issued the policy that allows 340B-covered entities to purchase orphan drugs at 340B prices when orphan drugs are used for any indication other than treating the rare disease or condition for which the drug received an orphan designation. In October, PhRMA filed another suit seeking to vacate the interpretive rule HRSA issued.\n\nWith HRSA deciding to scrap what many in the industry are referring to as a \"mega rule,\" hospitals, health systems and drug manufacturers will have to wait to receive more guidance regarding the program. HRSA announced there will be an opportunity for the public to comment on the guidance it issues, and American Hospital Association Executive Vice President Rick Pollack said \"The AHA looks forward to working with HRSA on its efforts to improve the 340B drug pricing program, which is vital to so many vulnerable patients and communities.\"\n\nMore articles on the 340B program:\n\nAre hospitals abusing the 340B drug discount program?
