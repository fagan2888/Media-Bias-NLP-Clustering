If you were hoping, after he was defeated by Tammy Duckworth in 2012, to never hear from former Tea Party congressman Joe Walsh again, we’ve got some bad news: He’s once again making national headlines for his behavior. But there’s some good news, too: This latest bout of poor judgment may well be enough to push Walsh off the public stage once and for all.

According to Walsh himself (via Twitter), the right-wing bomb-thrower was kicked off his own radio show on Thursday after saying a bunch of racial slurs on-air. Why would Walsh do something so obviously unacceptable? In defense of the (patently indefensible) Washington Redskins’ team name, of course!

Here’s how it went down, at least in Walsh’s telling:

The station keeps cutting me off. I don't know why — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) June 19, 2014

And here comes to the General Manager. It appears I can say Redskins, which is supposedly offensive, but when I say other words, commercial — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) June 19, 2014

If Redskins is just like the "n-word" why can I say Redskins on-air without being dumped out into a commercial? — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) June 19, 2014
