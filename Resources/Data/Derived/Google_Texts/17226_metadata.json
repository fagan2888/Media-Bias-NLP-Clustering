But for a taste of what a truly ruthless and deranged system looks like, cast your eye southward to Australia.\n\nAustralia will now have its fifth prime minister since 2007, thanks to its politicians\u2019 seemingly unquenchable addiction to overthrowing their leaders.\n\nOn Monday, Malcolm Turnbull ousted Prime Minister Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party (which, despite its name, is Australia\u2019s main conservative party). Abbott only became leader after he overthrew Turnbull himself in 2009, when the Liberals were in opposition.\n\nAfter that coup, Abbott faced the Labor Party\u2019s Kevin Rudd, who had been the prime minister since 2007. But this matchup was short-lived, because Rudd was knifed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010, after the party got nervous that Rudd wasn\u2019t up to the job.\n\nGillard then called an election and oversaw a shaky minority government for a couple of years until she was dethroned by a vengeful Rudd. He then took Labor into yet another election in 2013, which it lost to Abbott\u2019s Liberals. (If you want a deeper look at Labor\u2019s astonishing internecine warfare, watch the fascinating ABC documentary \u201cThe Killing Season.\u201d)\n\nAbbott pledged an end to the turmoil that had sent voters rushing into his arms. So much for that. Monday was actually the second time members of his party tried to oust him this year. He\u2019s now had the briefest term in office since the 1970s.\n\nOverall, none of the people who have led Australia since 2007 served out even one full three-year term in government.\n\nOver and over again, the pattern is the same: a leader takes over, promises to right the ship, passes some bills, but then trouble brews. The polls start going south. Backroom hacks get nervous. Seekers of the throne start making noises about how voters would like them more than the current leader. Then, the coup. Unlike, say, Britain, where the Conservative Party has been much more comfortable with regicide than the Labour Party, Australian politicians across the spectrum enthusiastically send their leaders to the scaffold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Finished by the same chaotic system that made him, Tony Abbott leaves a sexist, anti-LGBT, climate-denying legacy", "title": "An odious wingnut gets his comeuppance: How one of the world\u2019s most boorish conservatives just lost his job", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Finished by the same chaotic system that made him, Tony Abbott leaves a sexist, anti-LGBT, climate-denying legacy", "title": "An odious wingnut gets his comeuppance: How one of the world\u2019s most boorish conservatives just lost his job", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/15/an_odious_wingnut_gets_his_comeuppance_how_one_of_the_worlds_most_boorish_conservatives_just_lost_his_job/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/tony_abbott.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Finished by the same chaotic system that made him, Tony Abbott leaves a sexist, anti-LGBT, climate-denying legacy", "title": "An odious wingnut gets his comeuppance: How one of the world\u2019s most boorish conservatives just lost his job", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/tony_abbott.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jack Mirkinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Australia, australian liberal party, Editor's Picks, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd, malcolm turnbull, Tony Abbott", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca49f\"", "article_summary": "Australia will now have its fifth prime minister since 2007, thanks to its politicians\u2019 seemingly unquenchable addiction to overthrowing their leaders.\nOn Monday, Malcolm Turnbull ousted Prime Minister Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party (which, despite its name, is Australia\u2019s main conservative party).\nAfter that coup, Abbott faced the Labor Party\u2019s Kevin Rudd, who had been the prime minister since 2007.\nAbbott only became leader after he overthrew Turnbull himself in 2009, when the Liberals were in opposition.\nBut for a taste of what a truly ruthless and deranged system looks like, cast your eye southward to Australia."}
