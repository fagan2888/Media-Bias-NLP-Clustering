(The earliest recorded use of the symbol was in the twelfth century, far, far before the French Revolution.)\n\nWhile I'm glad Fitzmorris took the rational route and said that it's pointless to ban the symbol, it's still troubling that this conversation is being held. Despite its supposed \"dark\" history, the vast majority of the uses of the fleur-de-lis throughout history have been positive. Nobody in Louisiana is displaying a fleur-de-lis to try to intimidate or scare others. The fleur-de-lis is used as a symbol of France (and its former territories), and as a religious symbol for the Holy Trinity. It's featured prominently on several royal coats of arms as well as on Quebec's provincial flag. In 2008, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) signed a bill designating the fleur-de-lis as an official state symbol.\n\nThe modern context and usage of the fleur-de-lis in Louisiana is a far cry from the Code Noir centuries ago. This is important to consider. The fleur-de-lis is a unifying symbol of Louisiana residents and Francophone peoples. It is not a symbol of racism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Outrage circus. .05/26/2016 4:07:03AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Outrage circus.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Sorry, Louisiana, Quebec, and France: The Fleur-De-Lis Might Be Racist Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/07/12/sorry-louisiana-quebec-and-france-the-fleurdelis-might-be-racist-now-n2024350", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/6/56fc023c-deda-4749-8fa4-d837284f4496.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Outrage circus.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Sorry, Louisiana, Quebec, and France: The Fleur-De-Lis Might Be Racist Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/07/12/sorry-louisiana-quebec-and-france-the-fleurdelis-might-be-racist-now-n2024350", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/6/56fc023c-deda-4749-8fa4-d837284f4496.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Sorry, Louisiana, Quebec, and France: The Fleur-De-Lis Might Be Racist Now, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0b7\"", "article_summary": "The modern context and usage of the fleur-de-lis in Louisiana is a far cry from the Code Noir centuries ago.\n(The earliest recorded use of the symbol was in the twelfth century, far, far before the French Revolution.)\nThe fleur-de-lis is used as a symbol of France (and its former territories), and as a religious symbol for the Holy Trinity.\nNow that the Confederate Flag has been effectively dealt with, the outrage machine is turning on another symbol: the fleur-de-lis.\nThe fleur-de-lis is a unifying symbol of Louisiana residents and Francophone peoples."}
