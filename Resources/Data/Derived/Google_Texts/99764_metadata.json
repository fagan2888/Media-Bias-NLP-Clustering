The Lone Star State is home to some of the largest hospitals and health systems in the country and also houses three of the top ten most populated cities in the United States \u2014 Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. The following 100 points offer information on and insight into healthcare delivery in the state of Texas, one of the most active states in the industry.\n\n1. There are 630 hospitals with 83,000 licensed beds in Texas, according to the Texas Hospital Association.\n\n2. Harris County, which includes Houston, is home to 80 hospitals \u2014 the highest number of any county in Texas, according to the THA.

There are 26 Urgent Care Association of America-certified urgent care centers in Texas, which is the seventh most in the nation. The amount of urgent care centers in Texas \u2014 and across the nation \u2014 is growing rapidly due to long waits for primary care physicians, expensive and overcrowded emergency rooms in hospitals and the growing popularity of treatment for non-emergency conditions at a lower cost provided in urgent care centers.\n\n5.

The average cost of personal health spending per capita in Texas is $5,924, whereas the average cost of personal health spending per capita in Massachusetts \u2014 the most expensive state \u2014 is $9,278.\n\n6. Governor Rick Perry notified the government in November 2012 that Texas would not set up a state-run exchange for health insurance. \"This is a federally-mandated exchange with rules dictated by Washington. It would not be fiscally responsible to put hard-working Texans on the financial hook for an unknown amount of money to operate a system under rules that have not even been written,\" said Gov. Perry in a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Instead, Texas residents enrolling in a marketplace plan must do so under the federally facilitated marketplace.\n\n7. Texas has the second most Health Professional Shortage Area designations in the country. According to the HPSA data, there are a total of 375 primary care HPSA designations in Texas.
