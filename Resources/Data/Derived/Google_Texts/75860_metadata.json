These are problems that can ruin a company\u2019s hard-built reputation and corporate executives aren\u2019t taking the risks lightly.\n\nA recent survey of 300 executives worldwide found that protecting their companies\u2019 reputations and managing the risk is a top priority and, for some, a matter of survival.\n\nThe survey by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited and Forbes Insights said 87% of the executives surveyed rated risk as \u201cmore important\u2019\u2019 or \u201cmuch more important\u2019\u2019 than other strategic risks facing their company.\n\nEighty-eight percent of respondents said their companies are explicitly focusing on managing reputation risk as a key business challenge. The survey showed that a reputation risk that\u2019s not managed properly can quickly escalate into a life or death issue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a recognition that with the increasing influence of social media and social media sites, as well as activist sites, issues can escalate very quickly,\u2019\u2019 said Clayton Herbert, group chief risk officer for Suncorp Limited, an insurance and financial services firm in Australia. \u201cThis can threaten your reputation more significantly than in the past.\u2019\u2019\n\nIndeed, the stakes are high. According to a study by the World Economic Forum, more than 25% of a company\u2019s market value, on average, is directly attributable to its reputation. Factor in the fact that a company\u2019s reputation can be tarnished in just a few keystrokes, and that percentage is only getting higher.\n\nThe 2014 Global Survey on Reputation Risk found that the responsibility for reputation risk lies with the company\u2019s top executives. About 36% said it was the role of the chief executive officer, followed by the chief risk officer (21%), board of directors (14%) and chief financial officers (11%).\n\nEven though most said their reputations were strong, they aren\u2019t unshakeable. Only 19% of companies surveyed gave themselves an \u201cA\u201d for ability to manage risk. The majority (57%) gave themselves a \u201cB.\u201d\n\nThe top reputation risks cited were those related to ethics and integrity, such as fraud, bribery and corruption. Next were security risks, including cyber breaches, followed by products and service risks involving safety, health and the environment. Also emerging were risks associated with a company\u2019s third-party suppliers and vendors.\n\nThe findings were based on a survey of C-Level executives, board members and risk executives from major industry sectors: financial services, consumer/industrial products, technology/media/telecommunications, life sciences/health care and energy/resources. All were from companies with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion.\n\nGet Free Updates! Stay in the loop with a weekly newsletter, with all our news from the previous week.
