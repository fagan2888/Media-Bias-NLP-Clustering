PA-13: Montco Commissioner Richards Backs Margolies

Written by Nick Field, Contributing Writer

Marjorie Margolies scored another endorsement today for her congressional campaign, this time from Montgomery County Commissioner Leslie Richards.

Margolies is running to re-claim a seat she held from 1993 to 1995. Pennsylvania’s 13th district contains parts of Philadelphia and Montgomery County. Allyson Schwartz is retiring this seat to pursue the governorship.

“Marjorie’s experience, both on the Hill and around the globe working to empower women in emerging democracies as head of Women’s Campaign International, is that of a fighter who understands the importance of getting more women to the decision-making table,” Richards stated. “I want that kind of leader fighting for Montgomery County in the US Congress.”

Richards ran on a ticket with Josh Shapiro when the two were elected in 2011. Since then the two have coordinated their political activities very closely, which could mean that Richards’ decision to back Margolies likely had Shapiro’s go-ahead.

“Winning Commissioner Richards’ endorsement among a field of strong candidates makes this a very big day for my campaign,” Margolies said. “Throughout this campaign I intend to carry a message that Washington can, once again, work for families in Montgomery County if we send representatives to D.C. who fight for something larger than their political career.”

Margolies has heavily promoted the female public officials that have endorsed her campaign so far. For instance, last month she announced the support of all five Philly City Councilwomen.

Other candidates in the Democratic primary include physician/activist Valerie Arkoosh, State Rep. Brendan Boyle, and State Sen. Daylin Leach.
