The rule forbids health care providers who take funding from the HHS from denying health care based on gender identity or denying patients treatment for sex-specific ailments like ovarian or prostate cancer simply because an individual identifies as a different sex.\n\n\n\n\u201cA central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care. Today\u2019s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this Administration\u2019s commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve,\u201d said Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia M. Burwell in a statement.\n\nA 2010 national survey found that 19% of trans men and women were refused services because of their gender identity, 28% said they had been harassed in medical settings, and half said they had to teach their health care provider about caring for transgender people. Though the rule will not eliminate all discrimination, it will make it easier for those who feel they have been wronged to file complaints and take legal action.\n\nThe new rule, which also clarifies protections for people with disabilities and non English speakers, comes as Obama administration has taken several steps to protect transgender individuals this week. On Friday, the administration wrote a guidance letter to U.S. public schools directing them to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Friday called the letter \u201cadvice\u201d to school administrators. \u201cWhat the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangible, real world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the country,\u201d Earnest said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration has finalized a new rule in the affordable care act that bans discrimination against transgender people", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "\"[It's] a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system\"", "title": "Discrimination Against Transgender Patients Is Now Banned Under Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/4329609/transgender-discrimination-obamacare-healthcare/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-462710288.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-462710288.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "\"[It's] a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Discrimination Against Transgender Patients Is Now Banned Under Obamacare"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "white house, obama, barack obama, hhs, health and human services, obamacare, obamacare trans, transgender, obamacare transgender, obamacare discrimination, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "White House, Obama, Barack Obama, HHS, Health and Human Services, Obamacare, Obamacare trans, transgender, obamacare transgender, obamacare discrimination, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34f2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care.\nThe Obama administration has finalized a new rule that bans discrimination against transgender people and all discrimination on the basis of sex within health programs that receive federal funding.\nOn Friday, the administration wrote a guidance letter to U.S. public schools directing them to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday the finalization of the Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities rule, a part of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Section 1557.\nThough the rule will not eliminate all discrimination, it will make it easier for those who feel they have been wronged to file complaints and take legal action."}
