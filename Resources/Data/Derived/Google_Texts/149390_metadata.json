The Republicans who are starting to grumble about the shutdown and distance themselves from the Suicide Caucus tend to represent less reliable districts. Their worries are focused on their future Democratic opponent, not a potential Republican primary challenger.\n\nSecond, the districts that have sent the Suicide Caucus to Washington also have a high proportion of uninsured people; not necessarily dirt-poor, but hardworking people in jobs that do not provide health insurance, and who would benefit most from the ACA. Yet, they vote for the tea partiers.\n\nThird, polls show that those who oppose the health care law do favor its composite parts. They just don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s packaged as a huge program. They fear government intrusion into their lives. They felt the same way about Medicare, too, back in the day.\n\nFinally, the late-night comedian Jimmy Fallon performed a prank on his show the other night. He approached passersby in the street and asked them what they thought about Obamacare. They were overwhelmingly against it. Then he asked them what they thought about the Affordable Care Act, which they favored.\n\nThis last tells us two things: Some Americans are laughably ignorant. Also, some hate Barack Obama so much that they reflexively reject a program that bears his name without bothering to do the research that shows it might benefit them.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "shutdown, government shutdown, tea party, Republicans, Obama, Biden, Suicide Caucus, Congress, House, ACA, Obamacare, health care, Affordable Care Act, Jimmy Fallon, shut down, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "I can\u2019t add much to the acre-feet of ink and quadrillions of pixels already expended on the shutdown, except to bring together a few curious phenomena: \u00a0 First, the diehard group of tea...", "title": "Government shutdown", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-10-02/news/sfl-government-shutdown-20131002_1_tea-partiers-government-shutdown-government-intrusion", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-524c80ee/turbine/sfl-chan-lowe-the-government-shutdown-20131002-001/555/555x380", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "I can\u2019t add much to the acre-feet of ink and quadrillions of pixels already expended on the shutdown, except to bring together a few curious phenomena: \u00a0 First, the diehard group of tea"}, "article_summary": "The Republicans who are starting to grumble about the shutdown and distance themselves from the Suicide Caucus tend to represent less reliable districts.\nTheir worries are focused on their future Democratic opponent, not a potential Republican primary challenger.\nThird, polls show that those who oppose the health care law do favor its composite parts.\nThen he asked them what they thought about the Affordable Care Act, which they favored.\nYet, they vote for the tea partiers."}
