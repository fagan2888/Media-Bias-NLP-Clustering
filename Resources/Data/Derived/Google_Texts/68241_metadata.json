Bill Owens, president and founder of the Coalition of African-American Pastors (CAAP), said, \u201cIf they rule for same-sex marriage, then we\u2019re going to do the same thing we did for the civil rights movement. We will not obey an unjust law.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe politicians and the courts have tried to take God out of this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis country was founded on Godly principles. We will not stand back and be silenced.\u201d\n\nOwens urged Christians of all churches to prepare for civil disobedience if the Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage and requires them to obey its decision.\n\n\u201cWe stand today to put America on notice that we will not obey an unjust law,\u201d he asserted.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News, Owens said that, should the Supreme Court decide in favor of same-sex marriage, he envisions another civil rights movement of Christians of various churches and massive civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cI see the way forward, it\u2019s the civil rights movement all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cMost gospel preachers will not obey such a decision.\u201d\n\nOwens has said many times that militant LGBT activists have hijacked the real civil rights movement \u2013 led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 and claimed it as their own.\n\n\u201cWe wanted equal rights in the original civil rights movement I was part of. They want special rights,\u201d he continued. \u201cBefore this is over, it will take civil disobedience. We will not set aside our religious beliefs over this. We will urge Christians to massively disobey any law that invades our religious freedom.\u201d\n\nOwens said that leadership in the United States has taken the nation into a \u201cdownward spiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama overrode the will of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people voted for marriage between a man and a woman. Our votes were stolen from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe celebrated the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, but now they are allowing politicians and courts to take that vote away,\u201d Owens added. \u201cWe will not be silenced.\u201d\n\nOwens warned LGBT activists will be very surprised by the repercussions of a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the U.S.\n\n\u201cMillions of people in this country will not stand by and see our civil rights violated, our right to religion, our right to worship,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe will go to jail \u2013 I see it coming.\u201d\n\nRev. David Welch, executive director of the Pastor\u2019s Council in Houston, Texas stood with Owens at the press conference in Memphis. In an interview with Breitbart News, Welch agreed many pastors are prepared to call for civil disobedience if the Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage throughout the nation.\n\n\u201cTo me the essence of the issue is that marriage was not created by the state, and it cannot be redefined by the state,\u201d he said, and continued:\n\nIt is an institution that has existed through all of human history and in Western civilization and Judeo-Christian principles. Historically, it has always been understood to be between one man and one woman. And given the references in our founding documents that there is a higher law above the Constitution even, in the laws of nature and of nature\u2019s God, then that\u2019s what we stand on. So, our position is that the Court ruling has no jurisdiction to define marriage should it choose to attempt to do so and force that upon the rest of the nation.\n\nWelch said many Christian pastors throughout the country will be prepared for imprisonment when they defy a ruling that requires them to ignore their religious convictions.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that if the Court should attempt to unilaterally force same-sex marriage on the states,\u201d he explained, \u201cthen what they essentially are doing is running the risk of filling the jails with pastors around the country who will be forced to comply with this against their convictions, and stand \u2013 as Martin Luther and Martin Luther King did \u2013 to stand to do whatever is necessary to follow our faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it comes down to declining to perform same-sex weddings, that we will be charged with a civil or criminal penalty, then we will accept the penalty,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t just about the wedding ceremony itself. This is a core, fundamental issue of our First Amendment freedom that the Court is toying with right now. Either we have the right of freedom of conscience and religion and the freedom to practice it, or we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOwens and his coalition have aggressively defended traditional marriage against the Obama administration\u2019s continued advocacy for same-sex marriage and LGBT \u201crights.\u201d In March, Owens blasted Obama when the president compared the civil rights movement to that for same-sex marriage at the 50th anniversary of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march, when black American citizens were beaten while demanding voting rights they had been denied.\n\n\u201cI marched with many people back in those days and I have reached out to some of my friends who marched with me, and all of them are shocked,\u201d Owens told Breitbart News. \u201cThey never thought they would see this day that gay rights would be equated with civil rights. Not one agreed with this comparison.\u201d\n\nIn February of 2014, CAAP also issued a press release in which it announced a campaign to call for the impeachment of then-Attorney General Eric Holder on the basis that he had violated his oath of office by \u201cattempting to impose same-sex \u2018marriage\u2019 throughout the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is a disgrace to the black community,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHe is rewriting history. We didn\u2019t suffer and die for gay marriage. We marched for opportunity, equality, justice, freedom from oppression. We are the true heirs of the civil rights movement. We now have a new movement to reclaim the \u2018real\u2019 civil rights movement.\u201d\n\nCAAP has launched a new Christian grassroots movement called RISE that seeks to unite \u201cpeople of every race, creed, culture, and background.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur nation is asking us to rise up and defend our most cherished values,\u201d the coalition states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christian Pastors: \u2018Prepare for Massive Civil Disobedience\u2019 if Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Christian Pastors: \u2018Prepare for Massive Civil Disobedience\u2019 if Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage", "title": "Christian Pastors: \u2018Prepare for Massive Civil Disobedience\u2019 if Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/gay-marriage-supreme-court-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-24T13:46:06-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/24/black-and-christian-pastors-prepare-for-massive-civil-disobedience-if-supreme-court-legalizes-same-sex-marriage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Christian Pastors: \u2018Prepare for Massive Civil Disobedience\u2019 if Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/gay-marriage-supreme-court-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Christian Pastors: \u2018Prepare for Massive Civil Disobedience\u2019 if Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "black church, CAAP, civil disobedience, civil rights movement, Coalition of African-American Pastors, LGBT agenda, Rev.
