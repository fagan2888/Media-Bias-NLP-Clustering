Remember, these kids are self-selected -- they're the ones who decide, based on their performance in high school and the incentives in front of them, that going to college is a good idea. If we change the incentives to push even more kids into college, those kids will be even worse off, on average.\n\nVerBruggen was writing about new policy prescriptions from Inside Higher Ed that analyzes the at-risk students. Students who end their first year of college with a GPA in between 2.0 and 3.0 - between a B and a C - graduate at surprisingly low rates.\n\nFirst-year G.P.A., the researchers contend, offers a powerful indication of a student\u2019s chances of graduation. Students who end their first year with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or lower are unlikely to graduate despite the best efforts of their colleges, Venit said. Students with a G.P.A. of 3.0 or above, on the other hand, graduate in high numbers. But there\u2019s also a third group: the students who end their first year with a G.P.A. between 2.0 and 3.0, who make up nearly half of total dropouts. Their fates are more uncertain. These students belong to what Venit and his colleagues call the \u201cmurky middle.\u201d\n\nAs I wrote for Townhall Magazine earlier this year, college isn't for everyone - and the downsides of incentivizing marginal students to take risks and loans to go can be devastating.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The negative outcomes for the students who struggle in college is outsized to some of the benefits..05/25/2016 23:56:03PM EST.", "author": "Kevin Glass", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The negative outcomes for the students who struggle in college is outsized to some of the benefits.", "title": "Kevin Glass - How \"College-For-All\" Harms America's Students", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/09/14/how-collegeforall-harms-americas-students-n1891482", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/255/1e084aa4-ed2c-41c6-8209-a1aecb9aa8eb.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The negative outcomes for the students who struggle in college is outsized to some of the benefits.", "title": "Kevin Glass - How \"College-For-All\" Harms America's Students", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/09/14/how-collegeforall-harms-americas-students-n1891482", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/255/1e084aa4-ed2c-41c6-8209-a1aecb9aa8eb.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "How \"College-For-All\" Harms America's Students, Kevin Glass, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fe8\"", "article_summary": "If we change the incentives to push even more kids into college, those kids will be even worse off, on average.\nBut there\u2019s also a third group: the students who end their first year with a G.P.A.\nStudents who end their first year of college with a GPA in between 2.0 and 3.0 - between a B and a C - graduate at surprisingly low rates.\nVerBruggen was writing about new policy prescriptions from Inside Higher Ed that analyzes the at-risk students.\nStudents who end their first year with a G.P.A."}
