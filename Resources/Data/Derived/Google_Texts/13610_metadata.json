Erin also needed a doctor for herself when she became pregnant in December, one who would monitor her closely because of past complications with giving birth.\n\nBut when their health insurance coverage changed under the state Affordable Care Act last fall, Kevin Schultz said they went through a nightmare ordeal with a new insurer that caused them to go through several doctors and limited their access to a local hospital.\n\nThe Schultz family is one of millions who have undergone changes in their health care after a 2010 federal law that requires citizens to obtain health insurance or face fines. Provisions of the law \u2013 which the public still is divided on, according to an August Kaiser Family Foundation poll \u2013 were enacted in 2013 to expand Medicaid coverage, as well as private insurance coverage, to more people.\n\nThe impact of the law has varied. In an April survey of 1,506 people from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization, 56 percent reported no direct impact while 19 percent said it helped them and 22 percent said it hurt them.\n\nThe Schultz family is among those who said the law has made their health care coverage more than difficult. While they\u2019ve been able to secure doctors for their children and Erin, who is due to give birth this month, the fight has left its mark.\n\n\u201cMy children do have a decent pediatrician, but we\u2019re talking about how long for a fight? This was almost a full year of fighting with insurance companies, fighting with doctors,\u201d Kevin Schultz said.\n\nHunt for doctors\n\nKevin Schultz said his problems began in September 2014, when the state changed his family\u2019s health insurance plan because of the Affordable Care Act. Previously, they were on Medicaid but now are required to receive that coverage through a private insurer, Erin Schultz said.\n\nThey were given a list of insurers and chose Harmony Health Plan, a branch of Wellcare Health Plans.\n\nBy December, Kevin Schultz wanted out.\n\nHe said the insurance company gave him a list of four doctors \u2013 in Joliet, Bolingbook and Lockport \u2013 to visit. Over the course of several months, he said he was unable to receive care from the first three doctors he visited \u2013 either because they didn\u2019t exist, couldn\u2019t accept his family as patients because of their insurance or because of the type of medical treatment they sought.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 The Herald-News", "og": {"url": "http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/09/03/joliet-family-struggles-to-find-medical-care/aeqmbuw/", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/9yqpmz49mvldiruhvn4jktvben7kx3r", "site_name": "The Herald-News", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 The Schultz family in Joliet struggled for months to find doctors who would care for them.", "title": "Joliet family struggles to find medical care"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/9yqpmz49mvldiruhvn4jktvben7kx3r", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 The Schultz family in Joliet struggled for months to find doctors who would care for them.", "site": "@Joliet_HN", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Joliet family struggles to find medical care"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1092756832", "fb": {"pages": 255829231119332}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "4d00d986-cfcf-4b10-ba43-f48747e7b36d"}}, "keywords": "#HealthCare, joliet, aca, affordable care act, illinois department of insurance, wellcare insurance, harmony insurance, harmony health plan, presence saint joseph medical center,", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87ce\"", "article_summary": "JOLIET \u2013 The Schultz family in Joliet struggled for months to find doctors who would care for them.\nThe Schultz family is among those who said the law has made their health care coverage more than difficult.\nThe Schultz family is one of millions who have undergone changes in their health care after a 2010 federal law that requires citizens to obtain health insurance or face fines.\nThis was almost a full year of fighting with insurance companies, fighting with doctors,\u201d Kevin Schultz said.\nPreviously, they were on Medicaid but now are required to receive that coverage through a private insurer, Erin Schultz said."}
