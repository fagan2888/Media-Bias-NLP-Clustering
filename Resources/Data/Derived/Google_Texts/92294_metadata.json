Missouri lawmakers are also considering paycheck protection, which requires unions to get a member\u2019s consent before deducting dues from their pay.\n\nAFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C., receives forced dues money by way of its private-sector affiliates in both states, and is hammering reform bills as \u201ccontroversial\u201d while attempting to create controversy around them.\n\nOn Tuesday, AFL-CIO shared a warning against right-to-work on its Facebook page, using a grim photo of child miners as a plea not to let legislators \u201cturn back the clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppose Right to Work laws that make the workplace unsafe for West Virginia workers,\u201d AFL-CIO wrote in a post, with the photo also asserting, \u201cRight to Work is DANGEROUS for West Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtreme politicians in Charleston are putting our communities in danger,\u201d a West Virginia AFL-CIO recording at the promoted toll-free number insists. \u201cInstead of focusing on good jobs, they are pushing a controversial and unsafe right-to-work bill that would hurt us all.\n\n\u201cThis bill would make it harder for workers to bargain for full-time jobs, safe workplaces, good benefits and fair pay,\u201d West Virginia AFL-CIO continues, warning, \u201cThis puts us all in danger.\u201d\n\nLast month, the D.C. headquarters of AFL-CIO affiliate American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees made similar claims with an infographic suggesting right-to-work is deadly.\n\nDespite assertions from AFL-CIO, AFSCME and West Virginia AFL-CIO, right-to-work laws in no way limit workers\u2019 ability to organize, join or collectively bargain through a labor union. Right-to-work only lets nonmembers opt out of paying union fees.\n\nRight-to-work has no impact on existing local, state or federal occupational safety laws, and does not restrict the ability of workers to negotiate new safety policies with employers.\n\nOn Feb. 2, AFL-CIO posted a slightly less dire graphic on its Facebook page warning right-to-work and \u201cpaycheck deception\u201d \u2014 the label unions use for paycheck protection laws \u2014 would \u201csilence the voices of Missouri workers.\u201d\n\nRight-to-work laws prevent workers from taking forced fees from nonmembers, and paycheck protection laws require unions to get member approval before deducting dues from their paychecks. Neither policy does anything to \u201csilence\u201d workers.\n\nA recording at the toll-free number for AFL-CIO\u2019s Missouri campaign does not explain how making union dues optional or requiring consent for payroll dues has the effect of silencing workers.\n\nBefore prompting for a zip code to connect callers with their state legislators, Missouri AFL-CIO warns, \u201csome politicians are pushing controversial and unnecessary laws that will hurt Missouri\u2019s middle-class families and our local schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaycheck deception and so-called right-to-work laws would silences the voices of Missouri workers and limit our rights at work,\u201d the Missouri AFL-CIO recording continues. \u201cThese bills would make it harder for workers like nurses, teachers and firefighters to bargain for better equipment, safer workplaces and fair pay. These laws hurt all of us.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO failed to respond to a Watchdog.org request for clarification or comment on its arguments against right-to-work and paycheck protection in West Virginia and Missouri.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Union coalition AFL-CIO is framing labor reforms in West Virginia and Missouri as attacks on workers' rights that would undo a century of safety laws.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Union coalition AFL-CIO is framing labor reforms in West Virginia and Missouri as attacks on workers' rights that would undo a century of safety laws.", "title": "Child miners?
