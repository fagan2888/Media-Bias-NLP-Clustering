MSU saw that only those who had a medical condition that needed to be treated would sign up for their healthcare plan, which drove up costs. Not enough students signed up for the university\u2019s plan to offset this high-risk pool, and rather than mandating students buy coverage, they cut foreign students\u2019 plans by $218 and stopped covering everyone else altogether.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that at some time, we\u2019ll be at a point where we can afford to offer it to graduate students,\u201d said Dr. F. David Muegge, director of the Taylor Health and Wellness Center. He added:\n\nAnd if we had a big voluntary pool like that, whether they\u2019re domestic or international or whatever, if they were again in a fair, representative, actuary risk pool, my dream would be that we could offer it for graduate students across the board. But we don\u2019t have that scale yet, or that heft, and then also we just don\u2019t have the economy for it just yet.\n\nDr. Muegge praised Obamacare while noting a similar model would wreak financial havoc on his university.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act wrote a lot of new requirements, you know, that take some of the excess profit out of insurance and that put a lot of requirement in as far as what they have to cover, like wellness and cancer care coverage and some of the things that people really need. So yes, I do think those are good policies, although they\u2019re not as inexpensive as the university-contracted one.\n\nForeigners on F-1 and J-1 visas, which cover full-time international students and exchange students, can choose plans that cover both them and their dependents.\n\nMSU suggests that American students sign up for Obamacare.\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Missouri State University will not offer U.S. students health insurance plans, but will require foreign students to purchase them.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Missouri State University will not offer U.S. students health insurance plans, but will require foreign students to purchase them.", "title": "Missouri State University Now Offers Health Insurance Solely to Immigrant Students", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Missouri-State-University-Twitter.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/22/university-drops-us-students-health-insurance-tells-them-to-sign-up-for-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Missouri State University will not offer U.S. students health insurance plans, but will require foreign students to purchase them.", "creator": "@k_mcq", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Missouri-State-University-Twitter.jpg", "title": "Missouri State University Now Offers Health Insurance Solely to Immigrant Students", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dr. F.
