Halfway to the deadline, state officials do not have a plan to pay for the utopian dream.\n\nThe state\u2019s single-payer system, dubbed Green Mountain Care, is expected to cost $2 billion a year. Vermont collected $2.7 billion of taxes in fiscal year 2013, so paying for the new health-care system could require a near doubling of taxes.

Good luck with that!\n\nBefore it can proceed, Vermont needs waivers from the federal government allowing it to divert Medicaid and other health-care funding into the single-payer system, and then it needs to find some way to pay the rest of the tab.\n\nDemocratic state representative Jim Condon told Vermont Watchdog it\u2019s time for Governor Peter Shumlin to shelve the ambitious plan immediately. \u201cThe deadlines for proposing financing have been missed two years in a row now, so to me that\u2019s very disappointing.

But the government cannot simply tell a doctor\u2019s office how much a procedure will cost. Different offices and hospitals have different costs, and they offer different products and services. A procedure at a big hospital in Montpelier simply doesn\u2019t cost the same as a similar procedure at a small doctor\u2019s office in rural Vermont.
