Two years after voters narrowly rejected a GMO labeling measure following a late-game, $46 million corporate advertising blitz led by Monsanto, the health insurance industry spent an estimated $57 million to successfully swamp Proposition 45, that would have given the elected state insurance commissioner the power to veto (some) excessive health insurance rate increases, a power that regulators exercise in 35 other states.\n\nHere\u2019s one part of the nonsense: one of the industry\u2019s principal arguments was that the added regulation would increase the cost of health insurance. I\u2019m not making this up! It takes some serious cojones to make that argument when you\u2019re running a health care system that costs twice as much as that of any other industrialized nation and delivers inferior health outcomes, while there is nothing to stop you from raising the rates as high as you want without having to explain yourself to anyone. And you make your point by spending $57 million worth of premium payments that otherwise could have been used to provide health care. I\u2019m willing to wager that the cost of insurance commissioner oversight would have been far less than $57 million.\n\nBut it worked. Prop 45 went down in flames 60% to 40%.\n\nMore nonsense: the industry ran scare ads that asked voters whether they wanted their health care decisions made by a single power-hungry government bureaucrat (the insurance commissioner). They just forgot to remind voters that now those decisions are made by a small circle of anonymous and very highly compensated insurance industry executives who are accountable to no one, unlike an elected insurance commissioner.\n\nThe rest of the nonsense: the industry argued that implementation of the rate review process might interfere with the ongoing rollout of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nThe subtext of this argument is the tried and true, right-wing talking point that government can\u2019t do anything right. It always gets thrown into the mix because after decades of propaganda (endless repetition of this point), even supposedly liberal voters are susceptible to this canard.\n\nThe specific deceit behind this argument is that Obamacare is really working, so we can\u2019t take the risk of messing with it. The cadaver of the politician formerly known as Nancy Pelosi was even wheeled before the public to plead for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to kill the Affordable Care Act, I would do this,\u201d Pelosi told the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle (who were so impressed they urged voters to reject the measure, as did the LA Times).\n\n\u201cACA is who I am,\u201d Pelose reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s why I stay in Congress, to protect it.\u201d\n\nOK, so the powerful San Francisco Democrat who is trying to cling to minority leadership in the House of Representatives says her main mission in public life now is to defend a law that was written by an insurance industry lobbyist and brokered in a back room deal with the insurance and pharmaceutical industries \u2013 a horrendously flawed bill that perpetuates a system that delivers substandard care at inflated prices to the American public. Reasonable alternatives (like Medicare for all) were taken off the table before public input was even considered.\n\nAll of these nonsense arguments were trotted out to deflect attention from the real issue: the health care system is horribly broken, prohibitively expensive, and since Obamacare pre-empted any attempts at real, effective reform, flawed bandaid measures like Prop 45 are all that\u2019s available to the public \u2013 and therefore better than nothing. Let\u2019s talk about anything besides the real human suffering and death the system causes unnecessarily \u2013 let\u2019s focus on the bureaucratic problems the measure might cause. (Left unsaid is that the problems are likely to arise because the industry will do what it can to inhibit the optimal functioning of any regulatory scheme it perceives as disadvantageous to its own interests.)\n\nIs Obamacare really working?\n\nThe original draft for Obamacare was written by the insurance industry \u2013 after they threatened to defeat any reform that did not leave in place their privileged role \u2013 to in effect collect a tax on health care in return for \u201cfinancing\u201d the cost of it. Supposedly they take risk for being the gatekeepers who decide who is eligible for care and who is not and what services should be covered and when. Obamacare was not an attempt to reform the basic problems of the industry. It was a deal to cover more people while leaving the parasitic insurance industry in place to collect their tax on an even larger population than before.\n\nBear in mind that in any rational system everyone would be covered the same \u2013 this business of offering scores of different plans and making distinctions about who is covered and what is covered is what you have to do to create the opportunity for profit within the system. If everyone had the same coverage, and we financed it collectively through the government \u2013 we would have no need for insurance company financing and all the layers of bureaucracy that are required to track the distinctions. The amount of insurance industry profits is a tiny fraction of the cost of the bureaucracy required to enable the profits. It adds an estimated $300 to $400 billion annually to the cost of health care.\n\nSo yes, some millions of people were able to get insurance who were denied the \u201cprivilege\u201d before. This is how Obamacare is \u201cworking.\u201d But that could have been done much more efficiently and at lower cost without the insurance industry.\n\nThose who already had insurance are now paying more for the same coverage they enjoyed before Obamacare \u2013 or they have had to reduce their coverage by paying higher co-pays and deductibles. There are more underinsured than ever. When people are underinsured \u2013 or in other words they face barriers to care in the form of high access costs \u2013 they tend not to get the treatments they really need, which in the long run actually increases the overall cost of the system, because they don\u2019t seek care until their conditions are more advanced and difficult and expensive to treat.\n\nThe insurance industry still promotes the fantasy of \u201cconsumer directed\u201d health care, which is based on the falsehood that the high costs of the system are due to consumers over-utilizing health care, and if they are forced to spend more of their own money for care they will stop being care hogs and make better health care decisions.\n\nWhen Obamacare opened the system to all those who had been denied insurance due to poverty or illness, the rates were jacked up for those already covered. This was most evident in California for those covered by individual plans in the state of California. Prop 45, by the way, applies only to those covered by individual and small group plans in California, or about 6 million people. The rest of the populations is covered by large employer funded plans or the government. These large employer plans at least have some bargaining leverage with the insurance companies, while individuals and small groups are given no opportunity to bargain for lower rates. They can take what they are offered, and since Obamacare, they no longer have the option to leave it. Thus the proposition as written applied only to those who most need protection.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said he needed the authority to control rates because the insurance companies had raised prices in California 22% to 88% since Obamacare was implemented in January 2014. The industry argued those increases were intended and justified as part of Obamacare to offset the costs of covering all the people who hadn\u2019t been previously covered.\n\nHuh? I thought they sold us Obamacare on the premise that it would control the cost of health care, not immediately increase it by up to 88%. No, the industry took advantage of the situation \u2013 that some increases in overall rates might be expected because the uninsured population might be sicker than the already covered population, even though many of the newly covered would be young healthy people who had refrained from buying insurance previously because they were not compelled to and could not afford it \u2013 and jacked the rates as high as they thought they could get away with.\n\nThe insurance companies already knew exactly what their risk was with individuals they already covered, but they took the opportunity to raise their premiums by as much as 80 percent in order to cover projected additional risk. Same people. Same ages. Same illnesses, or not. Now paying up to 80 percent more. Why not? There was no one to stop them.\n\nThe rates for my individual plan were increased in the neighborhood of 70 percent effective January 1, 2014. I bought a plan in the exchange instead \u2013 but the price of the exchange plan was comparable to the new, inflated cost of my old plan, for about the same benefits. I received a subsidy from the government for most of the cost, but the insurance company received the full, inflated cost, 70 percent more than I had been paying the previous month.\n\nWhile Pelosi was shilling for the health insurance industry, she was wringing her hands and saying that she supports the concept of cost control through rate review. Of course she offered no alternative proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, the LA Times was twisting itself in knots by pointing out that supporters of Prop 45 were falsely claiming that the proposal would make insurance affordable. Not true, said the LA Times, because insurance is already unaffordable. They got that much right!\n\nThen they said only a major overhaul in the way healthcare is delivered and paid for will make insurance affordable. Right again!\n\nThen they slipped off the path of truth once more. They said the government and the industry have already started the overhaul process. They didn\u2019t bother to mention how long this process might take. I\u2019m guessing maybe by next decade they\u2019ll work in a few superficial reforms, after the prices have doubled again, or worse.\n\nProposition 45 was not a cure. It was nothing more than a bandaid for a fatally diseased system. Obamacare didn\u2019t fix the system. It never even tried. And that\u2019s what Pelosi, the Chronicle, the LA Times and the insurance industry don\u2019t want to talk about. That\u2019s what this proposition was all about. We\u2019re still trying to fix the system that ails us, while they want to pretend that it\u2019s already been cured.\n\nJeff Sher is a journalist specializing in the health care industry.
