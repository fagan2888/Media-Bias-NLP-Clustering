He said that auditors would pay close attention to key ACA requirements governing grandfathered plans, coverage for adult dependent children, lifetime and annual limits, pre-existing conditions, and claims and appeal procedures.\n\n\u201cWhat are they looking for? They are looking for information, documentation and operational compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cI would maintain that, functionally, preparing for a Department of Labor audit for health and welfare plans is not different, but for the subject matter, than what it is in a 401(k) or a qualified plan audit.\u201d\n\nInternal Controls\n\nSpeaking during the same panel discussion, benefits attorney David C. Strosnider said plan sponsors must also demonstrate that they have implemented robust \u201cinternal controls.\u201d Specifically, he said, sponsors must provide evidence of an active and informed plan committee, committee meeting minutes and procedures.\n\n\u201cYou can't just look to the plan document, hand it over to DOL and say, \u2018The plan document says this,' \u201d said Strosnider, a partner with Roetzel & Andress in Chicago. \u201cYou have to make sure they are meeting with regularity; the meeting minutes are drafted in a way to support that you are exercising your ERISA fiduciary duty; they have people providing appropriate advice.\u201d\n\nKalish warned plan sponsors to prepare for a wide range of health and welfare issues beyond the ACA\u2014such as ones involving the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\u2014if they are notified of an audit.\n\n\u201cWhen they come in from an audit standpoint, it isn't just the Affordable Care Act. It is all these other issues. It's ERISA, it's HIPAA, it's COBRA, it's the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, it's the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act,\u201d Kalish said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael Bologna in Chicago at mbologna@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Phil Kushin at pkushin@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/consultant-warns-new-n17179891155/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Plan sponsors'", "title": "Consultant Warns of New DOL Audits Eying Compliance With Key Parts of ACA"}, "csrf-token": "8jMYwpmW0Z4mSzv02fJaljt6sQnC16hfoxAQrXsaYCT0pHPwB9myI7rYsWx94-OGA4Xrd6KFPhJHiSeTbF2upxFeDQMYWPOao8wU1OzDtkw1:atfvTv-p1JQ7PQYOMDhslwPyyYVNL3HK-DByiW8Fl31b95ZhH0J8ye2QJ1A_cEN4zhpJTd8tlNPHeq4Q3qfCQA8RA-qQORueHrVL58QDbeU1", "description": "Plan sponsors' \"grace period\" for being in full compliance with key features of the Affordable Care Act is over, a benefits", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e6d\"", "article_summary": "Kalish said that many plan sponsors will be caught off guard when DOL auditors come knocking.\nIt's ERISA, it's HIPAA, it's COBRA, it's the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, it's the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act,\u201d Kalish said.\nKalish said during the session that the audits would follow the DOL's familiar themes of information, documentation and operational compliance.\nBy Michael BolognaPlan sponsors' \u201cgrace period\u201d for being in full compliance with key features of the Affordable Care Act is over, a benefits consultant said.\nThey are looking for information, documentation and operational compliance,\u201d he said."}
