He ended up answering the phone on that busy day to a woman asking for a ride to Dallas \u2014 the woman turned out to be Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's mother.\n\n\n\nLike many Americans who were alive in 1963, many Schieffer's guests Sunday remember clearly the events of that day, but were on the front lines as the events unfolded.\n\n\n\nLuci Baines Johnson Turpin, daughter of late President Lyndon Baines Johnson, remembered the day she learned that Kennedy had been shot and her father was to be immediately sworn into office.\n\n\n\n\"We just finished lunch and walked back to our Spanish class and had not been settled in, and a young girl came running in saying the president's been shot,\" Turpin remembered. She said the teacher told them that since they didn't know the rumors were true, they'd finish their lessons.\n\n\n\nBut shortly after, \"the bells of the National Cathedral began to ring and ring and ring.\"\n\n\n\nStory continues below video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever nobody said a word about her mother and father, so she did not know if they too had been shot.\n\n\n\nIn the days ahead, Turpin said, her father remained \"strong and steady, determined to do the right thing.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the funeral \"tore your heart out,\" Turpin said.\n\n\n\n\"You looked at the Kennedy family so close, so young, so vital, so noble,\" she said. \"And this beautiful person, Jacqueline Kennedy, standing with a child in each hand so terribly alone.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to Turpin, journalists Hugh Ainesworth and Michael Cochran, along with Dr. Ronald Jones, who had been the chief surgical resident at Parkland Hospital, spoke with Schieffer about their memories.\n\n\n\nAinesworth, who was a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, was one of the first people who witnessed JFK being shot, and also was there when Jack Ruby shot Oswald.\n\n\n\n\"Within seconds, there was complete pandemonium,\" Ainesworth said of the Kennedy shooting. \"People were throwing their children down protecting them. People were running into each other, people were screaming, crying, just the most hectic thing you can imagine. And it was such a contrast because people had been so happy.\"\n\n\n\nCochran, who had been working in Fort Worth in 1963 where Schieffer worked, noted that the president's visit to that city \"had gone beautifully.\n\n\n\nThe welcome was just amazing; they obviously adored the president.\"\n\nBut he admits he was relieved when the president left Fort Worth and headed to Dallas, but minutes later a copy boy tore copy from the newsroom printer and screamed \"the president's been shot.\"\n\n\n\nJones said he remembers finishing an operation at the hospital that morning when the page operator put out a call to report to the emergency room \"stat.\"\n\n\n\nWhen he entered the room, the president was on a stretcher. Jones said he saw a small hole in the front of Kennedy's neck, and knew there would be a large exit wound.\n\n\n\nHe and other doctors tried to save the president, and Jones said he saw \"no evidence of life,\" although other reports said Kennedy was still breathing for a short time.\n\n\n\nAinesworth also recalled Ruby, Oswald's killer, as being a man who \"wanted to be somebody,\" but \"he was quite a show off. He was not a nice man. He had a huge temper and I'd seen him at the newspaper every week. He was a groupie for newsmen and cops.\"\n\n\n\nCochran also recalled being one of Oswald's pallbearers. No mourners had come to the funeral, and he and other reporters were pressed into service.\n\n\n\nBut he denied conspiracy theories that there was nobody in Oswald's coffin, saying the police checked it before it was buried.\n\n\n\nJones was also on duty when Oswald was brought to the hospital, and said that he \"said nothing\" but stayed alive for almost an hour and a half. All three men said they do not believe the Kennedy assassination was part of a larger conspiracy, but instead was the work of \"a silly little Communist,\" as Jacqueline Kennedy later called Oswald.\n\n\n\nThree key historians also discussed the aftermath of JFK's assassination: Thurston Clarke, author of \"Kennedy's Last 100 Days,\" Larry Sabato, author of \"The Kennedy Half Century,\" and Douglas Brinkley, author of \"Cronkite\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax.
