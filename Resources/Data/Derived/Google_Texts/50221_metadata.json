In addition to keeping its fighters motivated, the high pay was also reportedly a means of attracting more jihadists.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic State is estimated to pay approximately $400-$600 monthly to each fighter, with married fighters receiving an extra stipend per wife and child,\u201d the CRS report found. \u201cSome Nusrah Front fighters reportedly claimed in 2013 that their siblings and cousins fought for the Islamic State because the pay was better.\u201d\n\nAs news of 50 percent pay cuts starts to make its way out of ISIS-controlled territory, it seems likely that the group\u2019s ongoing recruitment efforts will suffer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If recent reports out of the city of Raqqa are correct, ISIS fighters just got slapped with a gigantic pay cut as their leaders struggle to deal with the increasing financial pressure imposed by U.S.-led attacks.", "title": "ISIS Terrorists Get a Big Pay Cut", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/19/ISIS-Terrorists-Get-Big-Pay-Cut", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Iraq_Terrorists_ISIL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/19/ISIS-Terrorists-Get-Big-Pay-Cut", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Iraq_Terrorists_ISIL.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If recent reports out of the city of Raqqa are correct, ISIS fighters just got slapped with a gigantic pay cut as their leaders struggle to deal with the increasing financial pressure imposed by U.S.-led attacks.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It can\u2019t be easy being a fighter for the terror group ISIS these days, what with some of the world\u2019 most powerful militaries raining bombs and missiles down on you on a daily basis.\nHowever, if recent reports out of the group\u2019s de facto capital of Raqqa are correct, ISIS fighters just got slapped with a gigantic pay cut as their leaders struggle to deal with the increasing financial pressure imposed by U.S.-led attacks.\nIn addition to keeping its fighters motivated, the high pay was also reportedly a means of attracting more jihadists.\nRelated: ISIS Is Working on a Surface-to-Air Missile: ReportAccording to a Congressional Research Service report from April of last year, ISIS paid its fighters far more than the typical Syrian or Iraqi civilian earns.\n\u201cThe Islamic State is estimated to pay approximately $400-$600 monthly to each fighter, with married fighters receiving an extra stipend per wife and child,\u201d the CRS report found."}
