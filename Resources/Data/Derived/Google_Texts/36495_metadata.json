The bill is not expected to become law.\n\nMost Popular\n\nThat may be the understatement of the millennium. The House will pass this bill on autopilot. Thereupon, the president will break out the stamp and the pen to veto it, if he doesn't simply set the thing afire on the White House lawn. It then will die a quiet death on Capitol Hill, living on only as a spectral presence in a hundred television ads aimed at gulling the rubes next fall.\n\nLet us assume, for the moment, that the president has taken leave of his senses, or is sockless drunk, and actually would sign this dead parrot. What will then occur? Right off the top, millions of women will lose not only a significant portion of their health-care, but also the uncomplicated exercise of one of their constitutional rights. As to the rest of the country, the bill kills off the federal exchanges, which help millions of other Americans get their health insurance and it 86's the subsidies that do pretty much the same thing. Millions of Americans will get tossed back into the uninsured population, meaning that they will exchange a (largely illusory) tax penalty for medical bills running anywhere from 100 bucks to a shitload of money on the economic scale.\n\nI may be na\u00efve, but I don't see President Hillary Rodham Clinton signing this bill, either.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/49/160x160/square-1449251840-hillary.jpg", "description": "Does anyone have a thermometer to take the temperature of this take?", "title": "Uber-Liberals Are Now Likening Hillary Clinton to Dick Cheney", "og": {"site_name": "Esquire", "description": "Does anyone have a thermometer to take the temperature of this take?", "title": "Uber-Liberals Are Now Likening Hillary Clinton to Dick Cheney", "url": "http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a40203/salon-hillary-cheney/", "image": {"url": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/49/1600x800/landscape-1449251840-hillary.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/49/1600x800/landscape-1449251840-hillary.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Esquire", "image": {"src": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/49/1449251840-hillary.jpg"}, "description": "Does anyone have a thermometer to take the temperature of this take?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Uber-Liberals Are Now Likening Hillary Clinton to Dick Cheney"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-04T13:33:57-05:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Uber-Liberals Are Now Likening Hillary Clinton to Dick Cheney", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020421151, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteESQ&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 171874009543995, "pages": 84169421673}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "News & Politics, hillary clinton,dick cheney", "google-site-verification": "jc-n3hu5vRQZpMR_8zTdWlZclmVbvCl2qFQ2fxka3rc", "keywords": "hillary clinton, dick cheney, liberals, democrats, salon, war hawks", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Esquire", "section": "Politics With Charles P.
