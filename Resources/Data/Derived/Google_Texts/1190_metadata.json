A married mom from Maryland, she became known as \"Glitch Girl,\" and several spoofs photoshopped the expression on her face to go with satirical versions of the site.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know why people should hate me because it\u2019s just a photo,\u201d Adriana, who is a Colombian national applying for citizenship, told ABC News. \u201cI didn\u2019t design the website. I didn\u2019t make it fail, so I don\u2019t think they should have any reasons to hate me.\n\n\u201cThey have nothing else to do but hide behind the computer,\u201d Adriana said. \u201cThey\u2019re cyberbullying \u2026 I\u2019m here to stand up for myself and defend myself and let people know the truth.\u201d\n\nWhen Healthcare.gov launched on Oct. 1, offering Americans health insurance via federally-operated exchanges, it was Adriana\u2019s smiling face that greeted visitors of the website. Her identity instantly became the target of reporters nationwide, particularly after White House officials refused to divulge her name. And as frustration with the maligned website mounted, she was quickly mocked online as \u201cGlitch Girl\u201d and became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nAdriana\u2019s saga began when she emailed a contact at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 the agency responsible for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 about having photographs of her and her relatives taken in exchange for allowing the photos to be used to market the new health care law. She was not paid, ABC News reports.\n\nAdriana, who has lived in the United States for more than six years, is currently a permanent resident applying for citizenship. She lives in Maryland with her 21-month-old son and husband of more than six years. Both her husband and son are U.S. citizens, she told ABC News.\n\nBut despite being eligible for health insurance via the Affordable Care Act, Adriana said she has not signed up for it and is neither in favor of it nor against it. Nevertheless, she was stunned by the vitriolic reaction prompted by her smiling face.\n\n\u201cLike I said, it was shocking. It was upsetting. It was sad. We were having a hard day when we read all this,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd in a way, I\u2019m glad that my son is not old enough to understand because whatever happens to you, it hurts them, too.\u201d\n\nAdriana said she was relieved when her photo was removed from the website roughly two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI wanted the picture down, and they wanted the picture down,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wanted to focus on the picture.\u201d\n\nThe photograph was removed because \u201cHealthcare.gov is a dynamic website,\u201d a Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News.\n\n\"The individuals in the images that we used for the launch of the website redesign in June and through the beginning of open enrollment signed standard releases and understood how their images would be used,\" the spokesperson said. \"We transitioned to new graphics because we believe they provide a better way to visually reinforce key information to users about options for applying at this point in time.\"\n\nDespite being targeted online, Adriana said she has been able to move past the initial controversy.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ruin my life. I still have a job. I\u2019m still married,\u201d she said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really crush me to the ground. I\u2019m fine. Now I laugh about it.\u201d\n\nSEND TIPS TO NEWSMANAGER@FOXNEWS.COM", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:26:06 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The former cover girl of ObamaCare now reportedly claims she could be the new face of cyberbullying.", "twitter": {"description": "The former cover girl of ObamaCare now reportedly claims she could be the new face of cyberbullying.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446957305058.jpg?ve=1", "title": "ObamaCare cover girl revealed -- and she has not signed up", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare cover girl revealed -- and she has not signed up\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446957305058.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-13T14:52:31Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"23a59daa-c09d-4b09-ba43-b84af5934ac0\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The former cover girl of ObamaCare now reportedly claims she could be the new face of cyberbullying.", "dc.identifier": "23a59daa-c09d-4b09-ba43-b84af5934ac0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "description": "The former cover girl of ObamaCare now reportedly claims she could be the new face of cyberbullying.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Obamacare Cover Girl Revealed -- And She Has Not Signed Up", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:26:06 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The former cover girl of ObamaCare now reportedly claims she could be the new face of cyberbullying.", "title": "ObamaCare cover girl revealed -- and she has not signed up | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1447009854003.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-11-13", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare cover girl revealed -- and she has not signed up\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446957305058.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-13T14:52:31Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/13/obamacare-cover-girl-revealed-has-not-signed-up.html\",\"post_id\":\"23a59daa-c09d-4b09-ba43-b84af5934ac0\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9421\"", "article_summary": "Both her husband and son are U.S. citizens, she told ABC News.\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know why people should hate me because it\u2019s just a photo,\u201d Adriana, who is a Colombian national applying for citizenship, told ABC News.\nAnd as frustration with the maligned website mounted, she was quickly mocked online as \u201cGlitch Girl\u201d and became fodder for late-night comedians.\nI didn\u2019t make it fail, so I don\u2019t think they should have any reasons to hate me.\nHer identity instantly became the target of reporters nationwide, particularly after White House officials refused to divulge her name."}
