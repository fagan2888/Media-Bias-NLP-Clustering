Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Tuesday that it was a political mistake to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010 because voters were looking instead for relief from the recession. Mr. Schumer, in remarks at the National Press Club, said Democrats should have built on the stimulus package that Congress passed to create programs to help middle-class Americans. “Unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,” Mr. Schumer said, according to his prepared remarks. “We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem — health care reform.” Republicans, he added, were able to exploit a sense among voters that Democrats were interested in creating new government programs that did not benefit them, helping to spawn the Tea Party movement.
