Public comments will be accepted on the proposed benchmark plans through Sept. 30, after which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will post the final list.\n\nThe ACA requires individual and small group plans that took effect after the law was enacted in 2010 to cover 10 benefit categories, including emergency services, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health and prescription drugs. Under HHS regulations states can choose plans operating in their state that meet one of several criteria on which to base the required EHBs.\n\nThe 2017 EHB benchmark plans, which are based on plans available in each state in 2014, are being updated from benchmark plans for 2014 through 2016. As was true from 2014 through 2016, the vast majority of states have proposed using one of the largest small group plans operating in their states as the EHB benchmark for 2017.\n\nFor 2017 HHS is requiring plans to cover prescription drugs across a broad range of therapeutic categories and classes, and plans must have separate visit limits on habilitative and rehabilitative services.\n\nBecause states selected their own EHB benchmark plans under the 2014-2016 approach, \u201cthere is considerable variation in EHB coverage from state to state,\u201d in addition to differences in benefit coverage within states, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report. After 2017 HHS may come up with its own requirements for EHBs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/proposed-2017-aca-b17179935443/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Benefits available under the largest small group health plans in 46 states and the District of Columbia have been proposed as benchmarks for coverage by all individual and small group plans in 2017...", "title": "Most Proposed 2017 ACA `Essential Health Benefits\u2019 Based on Small Group Plans"}, "csrf-token": "MJ0mvDLu84uFLB_rvAyiiOpGMnQ12egcj60nHEu9cvA2Lf78rs4YnW8j466bw8c1hg3VoywSN-MYBw1aZV4nlKHk8-MemuxI3pfPwe4aXxs1:ej2W0ZBATe4nsSnO8V9NkjBOej17Qat4NN0eKO9dnN2mo7sQiUoCdsEM_xa-gnzn5MWwkzBR9lfXVHEHFhbetalBxOqTA0y7LiX_36xow_M1", "description": "Benefits available under the largest small group health plans in 46 states and the District of Columbia have been proposed as benchmarks for coverage by all individual and small group plans in 2017", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Benefits available under the largest small group health plans in 46 states and the District of Columbia have been proposed as benchmarks for coverage by all individual and small group plans in 2017 under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe 2017 EHB benchmark plans, which are based on plans available in each state in 2014, are being updated from benchmark plans for 2014 through 2016.\nA list of proposed plans on which \u201cessential health benefits\u201d (EHBs) would be based has been posted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nAs was true from 2014 through 2016, the vast majority of states have proposed using one of the largest small group plans operating in their states as the EHB benchmark for 2017.\nThe ACA requires individual and small group plans that took effect after the law was enacted in 2010 to cover 10 benefit categories, including emergency services, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health and prescription drugs."}
