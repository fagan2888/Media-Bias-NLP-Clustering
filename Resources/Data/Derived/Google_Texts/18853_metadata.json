The following interview with Bill Walker was held at the Empire\u2019s office on Dec. 12. It has been edited for length.\n\nBill Walker got his start in politics lobbying elected officials across the nation to support an Alaska gas line. A few years later he was elected to the Valdez City Council. Walker became the city\u2019s youngest mayor at the age of 27 in 1979, during Alaska\u2019s golden era of oil production. Walker has served as the project manager and general counsel for the Alaska Gasline Port Authority for the last 14 years. He visited the Juneau Empire to discuss his position on issues important to Alaska.\n\nWhy are you getting into the race for governor?\n\nI generally believe that we lack leadership in Alaska, we lack direction, we lack a vision of the long-term future. We seem to live from one budget cycle to the next, one election cycle to the next, and we don\u2019t seem to have any long-term focus on where we\u2019re going and how we\u2019re going to get there.\n\nPreviously you had run as a Republican and earlier this year you declared that you would be running on the Republican ticket. Why did you decide to go Independent?\n\nA couple of reasons \u2014 I am a Republican; I still am today. When I ran last time, Gov. Hickel encouraged me to run and he also encouraged me to run as a non-partisan and I chose not to follow his advice. ... We did a poll right after the primary and it showed that had that been the general on that particular day \u2014 and anybody could have voted for anybody \u2014 I was one point behind Parnell, so I noted that. I hoped that I didn\u2019t have to run again. This is not a political itch that I have, it\u2019s not a bucket list item. I\u2019m not trying to launch a political career.\n\nExplain your stance on Senate Bill 21.\n\nMy stance on SB 21 is that I would not have voted for it. I would not have supported it but what I will do is that when I\u2019m on the ballot in the general election, I will follow the wishes of the voters, unlike some others. The voters will have decided on that issue in the primary and if the voters say it stays in place, it stays in place. If the voters say it goes away and we\u2019re back to ACES, I will sit down and negotiate something different that will be an adjustment to ACES, but it will be something good for Alaska, too. The biggest thing missing from SB 21 is anything good for Alaskans in it. There\u2019s no requirement for the oil companies to do anything, no requirements for them to drill, no requirement for them to spend any money in Alaska, so the $40 billion pushed across the table can be spent anywhere.\n\nWhat do you think about the idea of the state having an equity stake in the LNG line?\n\nThe gas line that would come to the LNG terminal, we should not be a minority owner. We should be controlling interest. I wouldn\u2019t be interested in spending five or 10 years negotiating ownership structure, because that\u2019s how long it will take in some of these processes.\n\nI would wish TransCanada all the best and a safe trip back to Canada. I would exit AGIA under the provision that allows us to exit it and I would get on with the future of the state of Alaska with us in the driver\u2019s seat, rather than continuing pushing the keys across the table to those with competing projects elsewhere.\n\nEducation funding is going to be another big issue we\u2019ll hear about in the next session, everything from charter schools to putting teachers on the State of Alaska\u2019s health care insurance program. Explain your position on education funding issues.\n\nHaving been born here and raised here, and having all my education through high school here in Alaska, I have obviously a strong bias toward education. ... I think often we don\u2019t have quite the right items on the menu, if you will, in our educational process. I\u2019d like to blend in the career and technical side into the mainstream of our education.\n\nWe spent some time in Norway and their second largest export in Norway is the intellectual knowledge of oil and gas, and we should be doing that on Arctic policy and we should be doing that on Arctic research. We are America\u2019s northern coast; we\u2019re the Arctic of our nation. I know we do a lot of that at our university now, but I\u2019d like to see that expanded and developed further. I\u2019d also like to see our educational system designed to be able to move people into the industries that are available in Alaska. I\u2019m very passionate about local hire. I\u2019m a big supporter of education; I just think we need to adjust some of our opportunities to match some of the opportunities available to our students.\n\nThe governor has decided that the state will not accept the extra money from the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. What would you have done differently?\n\nI would have done an Alaska plan. We always talk about the federal overreach, but when we don\u2019t do something then they overreach because we haven\u2019t done something. Then we complain that they overreached, shame on us for taking that stance. The rule of thumb for me is if it\u2019s good for Alaska, then we need to do it. The concern that the federal government may not continue to fund that into the future \u2014 you know, it\u2019s interesting. The assurances that he wanted from the federal government and yet when he gave away $40 billion of our revenue to Exxon, BP and ConocoPhillips, he didn\u2019t ask for any assurances. So when we receive something, we need assurances, but when we give something away we don\u2019t. I think that\u2019s absolutely backwards. If we reached a point in time when it wasn\u2019t working for Alaska, then we would stop it. We have precedent of that in Alaska when other governors have come in and stopped (other programs). It\u2019s something that we\u2019re paying for and we\u2019ll pay higher insurance rates as a result of it. I think it was a pure partisan move on his part with regard to what was best for the state.\n\nAs governor, how would you address Alaska\u2019s high rates of sexual assault and domestic abuse? Would your approach focus more on funding or policy changes?\n\nI think it\u2019s both. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that there has to be additional funding because you have to choose to fund, not just rely upon a slogan. You actually have to walk the talk on that. I think there\u2019s more that can be done but it\u2019s going to require funding. It\u2019s not going to be that just because someone has a vision of something that it\u2019s automatically going to change. There are things that can be done educationally, we can start (earlier) in the school system, you can provide certain services that aren\u2019t available now, and if we don\u2019t it only gets worse. We have the worst rates and statistics in the nation. Certainly we should acknowledge that and respond accordingly.\n\nYou did say though that you\u2019re still a Republican, even though you\u2019re running as an Independent. What is it in the Republican set of ideals that you identify with?\n\nI think the social issues. I\u2019m very conservative in that regard. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a Republican, but the social issues are not the platform that I\u2019m running on. I\u2019m running on economic development, fiscal stability, low-cost energy, jobs, education \u2014 those issues are what brought me into the race.\n\nBut those other issues you will have to address as governor.\n\nSome, some won\u2019t. I don\u2019t plan to change the social landscape differently than what it is today. I\u2019m not running to go and do that. There\u2019s been Republican leadership in the governor\u2019s office, the House and the Senate for the last several years and so we are where we are on social issues.\n\nWould you say that your personal views would influence any decisions you might make on social issues, or would that fall more to the will of the people? You say that you\u2019re running on more of a development platform, so would you take less of an active role in campaigning for a certain outcome on a social issue?\n\nI\u2019d have to address that on a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s hard for me to project that going forward. I\u2019m not aware of any coming up that would involve my role or not. I have been involved in others in the past.\n\nOne, for example, is the recently proposed rules that would more strictly define what a \u201cmedically necessary abortion\u201d is. A lot of that discussion has been divided among social conservatives and social progressives. What would you add to that conversation?\n\nI would have to look at that. I\u2019m not a person who checks my faith at the door; I\u2019ll put it that way. I am a Christian. My Christian values are important to me in my daily life and decisions. I certainly follow the Constitution and the case law that has been established, but I\u2019m not going to step away from who I am. Again, that\u2019s not the driving force that brings me to this point in my life in running for governor.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view on the relationship that Alaska should have with the federal government?\n\nI think we have to have a respectful relationship and an aggressive respectful relationship. ... When we became a state, the statehood compact had certain assurances and promises and those promises haven\u2019t really been fulfilled. I think we need to be more aggressive with the federal government on the statehood compact. I think we need to stand by local businesses and communities that are under attack, if you will, by the federal government. For example, the EPA is outlawing the ability to burn wood in Fairbanks. It\u2019s a very high cost of energy in Fairbanks. I\u2019m a big believer in the Tenth Amendment. I\u2019m a states\u2019 rights person and the Tenth Amendment basically says that the federal government can only do what it\u2019s authorized to do under the Constitution, and it\u2019s a sort of regulatory creep, if you will. I\u2019m pretty aggressive when it comes to drawing the line with the federal government and our ability to develop our state.\n\nWould you ever dip into the Permanent Fund to help balance the budget?\n\nNo. We\u2019re the most energy-rich state in the nation and we\u2019re dipping into the Permanent (Fund) Dividend? No, there\u2019s something really wrong with that. I would not do that. That\u2019s a return to Alaskans ... Our Constitution talks about maximizing the resources to the benefit of Alaskans and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing that now, but we need to do that. I would have no reason to dip into the Permanent Fund.\n\n\u2022 Contact reporter Jennifer Canfield at 523-2279 or at jennifer.n.canfield@juneauempire.com.
