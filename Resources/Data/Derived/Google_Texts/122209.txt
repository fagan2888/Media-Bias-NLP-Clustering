FORT COLLINS — In no surprise, former Colorado State football stars Bradlee Van Pelt (quarterback, 2001-03) and Joey Porter (linebacker, 1995-98) received the loudest roars Saturday night from the crowd at Hughes Stadium when introduced among CSU’s newly inducted 2013 Athletics Hall of Fame class.

Porter, who became an NFL all-pro with the Pittsburgh Steelers, has returned to campus to complete his degree requirements and serve as an undergraduate student assistant for the Rams football team.

“It’s another one of those big honors that you’re so happy that the school recognizes your talents and being one of those guys to make it to the Hall of Fame,” Porter said.

“I love CSU. And now being part of the Hall of Fame, it speaks volumes to how they feel I played the game.”

Added Van Pelt: “I really appreciate what Jim McElwain is doing with the program. I think he’s on to something. He’s regaining the excellence.”

Others inducted as CSU’s newest Hall of Famers were Marne Richardson (track, 1994-99), Willis Holland (wrestling, 1953-56), Ralph Hutton (swimming, 1968-71) and Allison Peckham (volleyball, 1998-2001).

Oops. Boise State coach Chris Petersen couldn’t have been pleased with his standout running back, Jay Ajayi, in the first quarter.

Ajayi, a sophomore, broke into the clear on a sweep around right end and appeared to have scored untouched on an 18-yard run — except that Ajayi inexplicably stepped out of bounds on the 2-yard line.

Fortunately for Boise State, and especially Ajayi, the Broncos scored a play later on a keeper by quarterback Grant Hedrick.

Broncos set the standard. Although Boise State entered Saturday night’s game with as many as three losses in a season for the first time since the 2007 team finished 10-3, the Broncos remain the nation’s winningest major-college football team since 2000.

Through Friday, Boise State had a winning percentage of .864 since 2000, topping nearest challengers Oklahoma (.819), Ohio State (.809), Texas (.787) and LSU (.782).

Remaining home games. Colorado State has two more games at Hughes Stadium: Saturday vs. Nevada and Nov. 30 against Air Force.
