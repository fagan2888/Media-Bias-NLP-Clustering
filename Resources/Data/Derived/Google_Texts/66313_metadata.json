Towards the end, he mentioned it was in this very room that he held his 2008 election night celebration that sparked his political career. The campaign hasn\u2019t decided where they\u2019re spending election night 2016 but it would quite the culmination if he\u2019s lucky enough to celebrate there again.\n\nWhy do you want to run for Congress?\n\nThe simplest yet most difficult question is always, \u201cWhy do you want to run?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow more than ever we need a voice in Congress that will advocate for the issues that really matter,\u201d Santarsiero responded, specifically citing environmental protection, education, infrastructure investment.\n\n\u201cOne [voice] that\u2019s going to stand up and hold everyone accountable,\u201d he continued. \u201cNot just the other side of the aisle but the leadership as well. I can tell you, having served in a legislature, legislatures are leadership-driven. It\u2019s the responsibility of rank-and-file members to speak out to leadership.\u201d\n\nHe touched on the frustration people have with government but asserted that it isn\u2019t an excuse to give up on the political process.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t throw up our hands and say \u2018There\u2019s dysfunction, so why do we even want to bother?\u2019 No, it still matters that we have a functional United States Congress.\u201d\n\nHarrisburg Experience\n\nWe moved on to Harrisburg, which is in the midst of its own kind of dysfunction at the moment. I asked how one overcomes that.\n\n\u201cI believe our country is very polarized right now, that\u2019s true across the board,\u201d he admitted.\n\nFor the State Representative, the answer was reaching out to as many of your new colleagues as possible. This would allow you the chance to convince them to support at least some or parts of your initiatives.\n\nNaughton and the Public Option\n\nDespite the fact that there\u2019s only two months until primary election day not many punches have been thrown in the Democratic primary. That changed this week, however, when the Santarsiero team criticized Naughton for commenting that the public option as not having \u201ca realistic path\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think one of the great failings of the Affordable Care Act is that the final legislation didn\u2019t include a public option,\u201d Santarsiero stated. \u201cI think the public option would\u2019ve been much more effective in keeping the costs down. I just think it\u2019s a fundamental part of health care reform that I think most Democrats support for that reason. I was surprised when I read it, to be honest, but if that\u2019s her position, that\u2019s her position. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things worth having a fight over,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt may not have been achievable in 2010 but it may be in 2017.\u201d\n\nBrian Fitzpatrick\n\nThe biggest development in the PA-8 race so far is the shake-up on the GOP side. At first it appeared State Rep. Scott Petri was the favorite to claim the Republican nomination. When incumbent Mike Fitzpatrick\u2019s brother Brian jumped into the race, though, he took away Petri\u2019s support and forced the lawmaker to drop out.\n\nI asked Santarsiero about this drastic change and what he thought it meant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a commentary on the Republican Party I guess that that kind of shift happened over night.\u201d\n\nHe praised his colleague Scott Petri, mentioning how they occasionally worked together in Harrisburg.\n\n\u201cYou would think that the Republican Party would want someone with experience and who\u2019s served in the district for some time. This idea of bringing in a guy from out of the district, who hasn\u2019t been here in a long time, to run is in some ways too cute by half.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cguy from out of the district\u201d was born in the district but has spent the past few years in California working with the FBI. This presents the dilemma of running against someone with a popular name but no record to attack. As a result, I queried the State Rep. on what would give him the advantage in a contest with Fitzpatrick.\n\n\u201cI think more than ever we need somebody on our side who has a base of support, who has a record of winning tough elections and I\u2019m that guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing is Brian\u2019s not his brother,\u201d Santarsiero stated. \u201cIn fairness to Brian, that means I\u2019m sure he wants to stand on his own and that\u2019s fine and we\u2019ll have that discussion about what his positions are and the extent they differ from his brother.\u201d\n\nHow do you make a mark?\n\nHow can one Congressman stand out among 435 members is a question I\u2019ve asked every candidate I\u2019ve interviewed. Santarsiero talked about his similar experience entering the PA State House and considers preparation and focus crucial.\n\nOne of the key issues he wants to tackle is environmental protection and renewable energy. \u201cThe issue of climate change, when the history of this era is written, will be the defining issue,\u201d he explains.\n\nSo what does he mean when he talks about renewable energy?\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about renewables, we talk about energy sources that actually renew, like solar and wind,\u201d he states. \u201cNatural gas, while yes it burns cleaner than coal, it\u2019s not a renewable resource. You take it out of the ground and at some point it\u2019s gone. So I really think that what we ought to be focusing on are true renewables, the development of green energy jobs across the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that we can\u2019t actually, while at the same time doing the right thing for the environment and climate change, also create jobs especially in areas that are economically depressed.\u201d\n\nI brought up the passionate opposition to fracking that I\u2019ve seen among progressives throughout the commonwealth. He sympathized with them, mentioning the dangers of fracking. He also asserted that he wants to incentivize the energy industry to build renewable jobs in the coal regions that would be hit by the technological revolution.\n\nDuring our discussion of this topic, Santarsiero unpromptedly moved to guns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to fight on gun safety,\u201d the State Rep. said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a leader on that in the State House. When I first took that up, a lot of people said that\u2019s the third rail of American politics, don\u2019t do that you\u2019re gonna really get yourself in trouble.\u201d\n\nHe went on to mention the impact meeting the mothers of Sandy Hook had on him.\n\n\u201cI respect people\u2019s rights to own firearms, that\u2019s not the issue. The issue is whether we can take reasonable steps in order to help make everybody in our country safer. I think background checks are a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court, the Constitution and More\n\nWhile he passed on my question about what committee assignments he\u2019d be interested in, he did cite former PA-8 Congressman Patrick Murphy as a role model. Santarsiero also stated that he is supporting Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary because he believes she has the experience and ability to be ready for the job on day one.\n\nSince this interview took place the day after a raucous Republican primary debate, I offered the lawmaker a chance to give his thoughts on that race.\n\n\u201cIt disturbs me a great deal that some of the discourse that has occurred in the Republican campaign has happened at all,\u201d he stated, calling Donald Trump\u2019s proposal for a ban on Muslim immigrants a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me the Republican Party needs a course correction.\u201d\n\nAs with John Fetterman earlier this month, I asked Santarsiero why trade is supported by the leaders of the Democratic Party but not candidates like himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna speak for the President because I disagree with him when it comes to both fast-track and the TPP. I actually think most Democrats are opposed to unfair trade deals and I think TPP falls into that category.\u201d\n\nSince he\u2019s a former history and AP Government high school teacher, I also inquired about his favorite Supreme Court Justices.\n\nHistorically, he named John Marshall, Earl Warren, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall as his favorites while Ruth Bader Ginsburg is his preferred current Justice.\n\nIt was around this time that the high school teacher in him took over and we had an intriguing conversation about the Constitution and structure of the American government.\n\n\u201cThis idea of strict constructionism. That there\u2019s this document that was written over 200 years ago and is to be construed only by what it said then and can\u2019t be interpreted in any way is 1. Not supported by the historical fact of what the Framers intended 2. Inconsistent with the whole notion of being able to amend it 3. Particularly crazy when you consider that the country that existed at that time was a largely agrarian republic of about 4 million people.\u201d\n\nHe went on to state that it would be foolish \u201cto think that we should be stuck in an 18th century viewpoint and that there would not be the ability of our guiding document to expand over time and fit the needs of the country.\u201d\n\nAt this moment, I took the opportunity to circle back to his earlier comments on guns and the little-known fact that the individual right to a firearm was not granted until the 2008 case D.C. v. Heller (the majority opinion was written by the recently departed Justice Antonin Scalia).\n\nHow did what he just say about the Constitution square with his assurances about the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cEvery right in the Bill of Rights has limits,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose limits revolve around the idea that your exercise of your right is fine until you get to the point where you potentially harm someone else.\u201d\n\nHe went on to talk about how the NRA is resistant to any background checks because they view them as a slippery slope (he also showed great knowledge of early American history by noting that there was no rhyme or reason to how the first ten amendments were numbered).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rhetoric that gets passed on and gets treated as gospel and it\u2019s not really the case.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he told the story of getting shouting down by NRA members at a rally in support of his background check bill. When he went to leave, one man pulled up in front of him and shouted \u201cWhy you trying to take my guns away?\u201d. Santarsiero handed the man a copy of the legislation and after reading the NRA member concluded, \u201cWell, that makes sense.\u201d\n\nFinally, I closed with one of my favorite questions, how exhausting is it to raise money for congressional campaigns?\n\nHe responded by mentioning that overturning Citizens United was one of three proposed constitutional amendments he hoped to see succeed. The others concerned redistricting reform and extending the term of a member of the House to four years to lessen the permanent campaign mentality.\n\nDespite the incredible odds such measures would face, he was hopeful that over time they could be adopted.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t think there was any hope that we can have an impact and make a difference, I wouldn\u2019t be running for Congress,\u201d he concluded.\n\nFebruary 29th, 2016 | Posted in Congress, Features, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 8 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "We talk with State Rep. and Democratic Congressional candidate in PA-8 Steve Santarsiero.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-8-steve-santarsiero-is-selling-experience-and-vision/73105/", "image": "http://www.politicspa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Steve-Santarsiero2.png", "type": "article", "description": "We talk with State Rep. and Democratic Congressional candidate in PA-8 Steve Santarsiero.", "title": "PA-8: Steve Santarsiero is Selling Experience and Vision"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "features,congress,pa-8,steve santarsiero,interview,democratic primary,2016 election", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PA-8: Steve Santarsiero is Selling Experience and VisionWritten by Nick Field, Managing EditorSteve Santarsiero has the chance to win in one of the most competitive Congressional seats in the country.\nSantarsiero talked about his similar experience entering the PA State House and considers preparation and focus crucial.\n\u201cYou would think that the Republican Party would want someone with experience and who\u2019s served in the district for some time.\nI just think it\u2019s a fundamental part of health care reform that I think most Democrats support for that reason.\n\u201cI believe our country is very polarized right now, that\u2019s true across the board,\u201d he admitted."}
