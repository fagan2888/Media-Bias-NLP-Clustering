Panama City Beach, FL---Youth football teams are playing for championship glory in the 46th SnapperBowl Classic Tournament of Champions, with some traveling from all across the country to some traveling just down the street.

The 10 year old Panama City Beach Mean Machine won the nine year old age group last year as the Barracudas. They began their road to another title by taking on the Birmingham Hurricanes over at Pete Edwards Field Thursday afternoon, which is serving as one of the three locations hosting 52 teams from 18 different states.

The other game spots are Buddy McLemore Field in Calloway and the Callaway Sports Complex.

"This is a tournament that they all end their season on," says tournament director Kenny Creel. "After this, they pack their bags, get ready for baseball and winter sports. We like to end it with a boom."

Competition runs through Saturday night, when these players, as young as five to as old as 15, will hope to finish their 2014 seasons as champions.
