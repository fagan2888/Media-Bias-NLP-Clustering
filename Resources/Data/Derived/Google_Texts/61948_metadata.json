Trump on stage as he rallied supporters in Anaheim, California, is part of a 2,000-strong \u201cChinese-Americans for Trump\u201d organization with 15 chapters across the country.\n\n\u201cI was standing in the front, close to the stage wearing the \u2018Chinese-Americans Love Trump\u2019 tee-shirt,\u201d Dr. Ling Zeng told Breitbart News. A member of Trump\u2019s event staff approached her and asked her to come onto the stage at the May 25 event.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe short encounter with Trump made a deep impression, she said. \u201cHe has a warm and strong energy. I was excited to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he shook my hand he looked into my eyes and made real contact,\u201d she said. \u201cThen he stopped to read my shirt and went back to the microphone and yelled out to the crowd: \u2018Chinese-Americans!\u2019\u201d\n\nZeng, who is a doctor of Chinese medicine and the owner of a San Diego clinic, said she is counting on Trump to end President Barack Obama\u2019s Obamacare infrastructure. She said she\u2019s seen the quality of medical care decline in the last five years. One of her friends, another doctor, stopped practicing medicine rather than deal with the hassles of Obamacare. \u201cObama is ruining our medical system,\u201d she said.\n\nZeng was at the rally with 10 other members of the group, led by Tian \u201cTian-Tian\u201d Wang, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor. \u201cI used to be a Jeb Bush fan \u2014 for like three days \u2014 then, when I saw Trump on YouTube \u2014 there were a lot of parodies and people making fun of him \u2014 but, I kept watching,\u201d Wang said. \u201cI kept watching for five hours and I thought: \u2018This guy is for real. He speaks for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWang said he started talking to his friends about Trump and the reaction was always negative. \u201cBut, then, I showed them what Trump really said compared to what the media said he said and I have never failed to convert someone,\u201d he said.\n\nChinese-Americans for Trump began with a few friends in Los Angeles and it is now an online community of 2,000 Chinese-Americans in 15 cities, he said. The largest chapter is Los Angeles with 700 members. \u201cBy January, we had 100 members and it kept growing, especially after Ted Cruz got out.\u201d\n\nYan \u201cGrace\u201d Zui, said she flew to Anaheim from Chicago, where she is the leader of that 400-strong chapter. \u201cWe all get together on the WeChat app\u2014we meet online every day any time of day.\u201d\n\nWang said his group has a good relationship with the Trump campaign and there are plans to have a private meeting with the New York billionaire in the next few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The doctor who shook the hand of GOP frontrunner Donald J.
