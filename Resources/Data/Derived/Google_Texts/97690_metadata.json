Giaffoglione, who was paralyzed from the waist down following a horrific car crash a few years back, knew how she wanted to make her way down the aisle of her upcoming wedding \u2014 and that was on her own two feet. After a year and a half of wedding planning, as well as physical therapy at CHI Health Rehabilitation Center, the determined bride-to-be stunned friends and family by walking hand in hand with her father down the aisle to her wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cWhen you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted \u2014 because I did, everybody does. When you're back up and doing it, especially having dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain,\u201d Giaffoglione told KETV. \u201cIt's not even about the walking; your emotions are floating. Everything just seems to feel so good at that moment.\u201d\n\nGiaffoglione\u2019s now-husband John Springhower was a little surprised after being told she intended to walk down the aisle, but he quickly remembered it was that determination that first caught his eye. Following over a year\u2019s worth of work with Diana Palm, her physical therapist at CHI Health Rehabilitation, Giaffoglione was fitted with a custom back brace that she would wear under her wedding dress. Since Giaffoglione is her father\u2019s only daughter, she knew walking down the aisle was just as important to him as it was to her.\n\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're going to do this,\u2019\u201d said Gina\u2019s father, Gary Giaffoglione. \u201cIt\u2019s been her dream. Obviously, it's a dad's dream of having the honor of walking your daughter down the aisle.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the wedding, Giaffoglione\u2019s father, fianc\u00e9, and immediate family were the only people in on her decision to walk down the aisle. The tearful reaction of her wedding guests made that very clear.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "paralyzed, bride, gina, giaffoglione, walk, down, aisle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Bride-to-be Gina Giaffoglione decided being paralyzed from the waist to down would not stop her from walking down the aisle at her wedding ceremony.", "title": "Paralyzed Bride Leaves Wheelchair To Walk At Her Wedding [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/paralyzed-bride-amazes-friends-and-family-ditching-wheelchair-walking-down-aisle-306324", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/06/gina-giaffoglione.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bride-to-be Gina Giaffoglione decided being paralyzed from the waist to down would not stop her from walking down the aisle at her wedding ceremony.", "title": "Paralyzed Bride Leaves Wheelchair To Walk At Her Wedding [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/paralyzed-bride-amazes-friends-and-family-ditching-wheelchair-walking-down-aisle-306324", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/06/gina-giaffoglione.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/06/gina-giaffoglione.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-06T12:15:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T12:15:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Bride-to-be Gina Giaffoglione decided being paralyzed from the waist to down would not stop her from walking down the aisle at her wedding ceremony."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d41\"", "article_summary": "When you're back up and doing it, especially having dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain,\u201d Giaffoglione told KETV.\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're going to do this,\u2019\u201d said Gina\u2019s father, Gary Giaffoglione.\nSince Giaffoglione is her father\u2019s only daughter, she knew walking down the aisle was just as important to him as it was to her.\nTelling Gina Giaffoglione she can\u2019t do something is a one-way ticket to being proven wrong.\n\u201cWhen you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted \u2014 because I did, everybody does."}
