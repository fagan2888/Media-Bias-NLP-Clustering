Consider some of the relevant developments:\n\nAt the national level, Republicans \u201cclaimed the majority in the Senate and built their majority in the House.\u201d Although Republicans do not have a veto-proof majority, they now have the ability to derail Barack Obama\u2019s agenda and to press Obama to quit blocking energy development, tax rate reductions, and more.\n\nAlthough Republicans do not have the power to repeal ObamaCare by themselves, they do have the power\u2014and perhaps their constituents can help them find the will\u2014to offer substantial rights-protecting reforms regarding health care and insurance.\n\nSome Republicans won in large part because they stopped talking about their desire to ban abortion; this is a good sign for the GOP. For example, in Colorado, Cory Gardner handily defeated incumbent Mark Udall for U.S. Senate. Although Gardner still supports some restrictions on abortion, he reversed his support for anti-abortion \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures and called for over-the-counter birth control pills (currently available only by prescription), which \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation might have banned. (For why women have a right to seek an abortion, see \u201cThe Assault on Abortion Rights Undermines All Our Liberties.\u201d)\n\nIn Colorado and North Dakota, voters defeated \u201cpersonhood\u201d ballot measures by two-to-one margins. On the other hand, Tennessee voters passed an anti-abortion measure that authorizes state legislators to further restrict abortion as they see fit.\n\nVoters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, DC, made substantial strides in reining in the immoral war on drugs by partially legalizing marijuana. Although a majority of Florida voters supported the legalization of medical marijuana, the proposal to legalize it \u201cfailed to clear 60 percent as required for constitutional amendments.\u201d\n\nVoters in Arkansas, Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota hiked the minimum wage. That will be slim consolation for those who lose their jobs\u2014mostly young people with few skills and little experience\u2014because their employers can no longer afford to pay them.\n\nDespite a few setbacks for individual rights, the election results involved a number of victories worth cheering; and, depending on whether the winning Republicans walk their talk, the results may prove to be profoundly good. Time, choices, and actions will tell. Let\u2019s hold their feet to the fire.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Republicans follow through on their campaign promises, election day will have been a net win for advocates of individual rights.", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.3", "og": {"site_name": "The Objective Standard", "description": "If Republicans follow through on their campaign promises, election day will have been a net win for advocates of individual rights.", "title": "Election 2014: Victories and Defeats for Individual Rights - The Objective Standard", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bigstock-i-voted.jpg", "height": 330}, "url": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2014/11/election-2014-victories-defeats-individual-rights/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Republicans follow through on their campaign promises, election day will have been a net win for advocates of individual rights.", "creator": "@ObjectiveStndrd", "image": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bigstock-i-voted.jpg", "title": "Election 2014: Victories and Defeats for Individual Rights - The Objective Standard", "site": "@ObjectiveStndrd", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 407490669404205}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/the.objective.standard", "section": "Individual Rights & Law", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "2014-11-05T15:56:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=4.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "barack obama, republicans, objectivism, ayn rand, personal freedom, individual rights, capitalism, economy, education, politics, religion"}, "article_summary": "Despite a few setbacks for individual rights, the election results involved a number of victories worth cheering; and, depending on whether the winning Republicans walk their talk, the results may prove to be profoundly good.\n(For why women have a right to seek an abortion, see \u201cThe Assault on Abortion Rights Undermines All Our Liberties.\u201d)In Colorado and North Dakota, voters defeated \u201cpersonhood\u201d ballot measures by two-to-one margins.\nVoters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, DC, made substantial strides in reining in the immoral war on drugs by partially legalizing marijuana.\nOn the other hand, Tennessee voters passed an anti-abortion measure that authorizes state legislators to further restrict abortion as they see fit.\nSome Republicans won in large part because they stopped talking about their desire to ban abortion; this is a good sign for the GOP."}
