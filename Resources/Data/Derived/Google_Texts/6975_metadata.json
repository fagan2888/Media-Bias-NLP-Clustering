Wauters admitted to being intoxicated at the time of procedure and told a French court that she needs vodka to stop her from shaking.\n\n\"The night of the incident, I drank half a 50cl (500 ml) bottle of a mixture of vodka and water. I was not drunk, I was at 70 percent of my capacities,\" Wauters said during her recent court hearing. \"I need vodka so that I don't shake.\"\n\nWauters, who received her license to practice medicine back in 1999, admitted that she suffers from \u201ca pathological alcohol problem,\u201d The Local reported. When Hawke, a Britain native, went into labor on Sept. 26 Wauters administered her the initial epidural before going to have \u201ca glass of ros\u00e9\u201d with some friends. After being called in to administer the second epidural, Wauter\u2019s colleagues recall the smelled of alcohol and was in a \u201cdaze.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy client will assume her responsibilities in relation to the facts that she recognizes, but she is not solely responsible,\" said Wauters\u2019s lawyer Florence Hegoburu while warning against \u201chasty conclusions.\u201d \"There are grey areas here, and the investigation will make them clearer.\u201d\n\nThe investigation would reveal that Wauters had trouble inserting Hawke\u2019s breathing tube and ended up missing her windpipe and inserting it into her esophagus during a resuscitation procedure. Hawke had trouble breathing and eventually went into a coma. When emergency services arrived they reportedly found \"a patient in cardiac arrest, cyanotic (blue) and people present who were doing nothing.\u201d Hawke was taken to Centre Hospitalier in Pau where she died four days later. The child would survive.\n\nHawke met with police a few days after the incident for questioning with 2.4 grams of alcohol per liter of blood, almost five time the legal driving limit in France. Investigators searched her home where they found 17 empty bottles of vodka. Hawke\u2019s greif-stricken widower, Yannick Balthazar, told the Daily Mail, \u201cI am going to let justice do its job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drunk, doctor, c-section", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Belgian doctor has admitted to being drunk during a botched C-section that led to the death of a 28-year-old from Britain and said she needs vodka so she doesn't shake.", "title": "Drunk Doctor Was At '70 Percent Of My Capacities' During Fatal C-Section", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drunk-doctor-involved-fatal-c-section-said-mother-needed-vodka-control-shaking-307101", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/15/drunk-doctor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Belgian doctor has admitted to being drunk during a botched C-section that led to the death of a 28-year-old from Britain and said she needs vodka so she doesn't shake.", "title": "Drunk Doctor Was At '70 Percent Of My Capacities' During Fatal C-Section", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drunk-doctor-involved-fatal-c-section-said-mother-needed-vodka-control-shaking-307101", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/15/drunk-doctor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/15/drunk-doctor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-15T14:37:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-15T14:37:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Belgian doctor has admitted to being drunk during a botched C-section that led to the death of a 28-year-old from Britain and said she needs vodka so she doesn't shake."}, "article_summary": "Wauters admitted to being intoxicated at the time of procedure and told a French court that she needs vodka to stop her from shaking.\n\"The night of the incident, I drank half a 50cl (500 ml) bottle of a mixture of vodka and water.\nI was not drunk, I was at 70 percent of my capacities,\" Wauters said during her recent court hearing.\nHawke\u2019s greif-stricken widower, Yannick Balthazar, told the Daily Mail, \u201cI am going to let justice do its job.\u201d\nHawke had trouble breathing and eventually went into a coma."}
