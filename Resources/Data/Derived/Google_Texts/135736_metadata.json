A depression in the ground next to the road was filled with votive candles, flowers and balloons.\n\nLindsey Sunday, a friend of Holman\u2019s who went to high school with her at Pomona High School in Arvada, said she had planned to get together with Holman some time this week.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw her was a few months back, but I was messaging her a lot lately,\u201d she said, her eyes damp with tears.\n\nPolice have arrested Ignacio Paul Daigle, 19, and Patrick Engle, 28, in connection with the truck theft and accident that killed Holman.\n\nThe incident began during the Tuesday evening rush hour, when a man saw a pair of thieves drive off in his Ford F-350 truck, which was pulling his trailer loaded with two all-terrain vehicles.\n\nThe man followed his truck in another vehicle and called police to report the incident.\n\nAt one point, one of the two ATVs toppled from the trailer, but the driver kept going.\n\nOfficers joined in the pursuit and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop the carjackers.\n\nThe truck went north on Wadsworth and a pursuing officer made another attempt to bring it to a stop. At that point, the truck crossed a parkway median and smashed into Holman\u2019s Jeep.\n\nShe died at the scene.\n\nWestminster police investigators are working to determine the facts of the chase \u2014 including speed, road congestion and hazards \u2014 before they can determine if it followed police policies. That process could take several weeks.\n\n\u201cStuff happens,\u201d said Jesse Salas, who knew Holman. \u201cIt is hard to blame anybody except the guys in the truck running away.\u201d\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Woman killed in Westminster collision with stolen truck remembered", "title": "Woman killed in Westminster collision with stolen truck remembered", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/woman-killed-in-westminster-collision-with-stolen-truck-remembered/", "image": {"width": 278, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160309__Jessica_Rose_Holmanp1.jpg", "height": 209}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160309__Jessica_Rose_Holmanp1.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T11:20:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T20:32:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb997\"", "article_summary": "Holman, 33, of Thornton died after the pickup crossed a median on a busy stretch of Wadsworth Parkway in Westminster near 94th Avenue.\nScores of people came for the memorial at the side of Wadsworth Parkway.\nThe truck went north on Wadsworth and a pursuing officer made another attempt to bring it to a stop.\nPolice have arrested Ignacio Paul Daigle, 19, and Patrick Engle, 28, in connection with the truck theft and accident that killed Holman.\n\u201cIt is hard to blame anybody except the guys in the truck running away.\u201dTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee"}
