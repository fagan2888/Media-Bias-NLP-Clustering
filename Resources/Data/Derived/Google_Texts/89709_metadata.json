The Anthem cyberattack in February compromised the Social Security numbers and personal data of nearly 80 million members and employees.\n\nHackers also struck Premera Blue Cross, which exposed the financial and medical data of another 11 million members.\n\nHIPAA violations have been levied against healthcare organizations for security breaches in which the Office of Civil Rights holds the health system responsible.\n\nThe largest settlement to date has been a whopping $4.8 million fine paid by New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center, after a single physician accidentally deactivated an entire computer server, resulting in electronic patent health information being posted on Internet search engines.\n\nAttorney Matt Fisher, who specializes in HIPAA as co-chairman of Mirick O'Connell's Health Law Group in Worcester, Mass. said, \"The other side that's hard to quantify, is what is the financial hit towards reputation and trust? I always see figures that say 30 percent of patients say they would switch providers if their provider suffers a breach.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/ucla-health-system-suffers-data-breach", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ronald_reagan.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses, along with medical information, were swiped by hackers in one of the largest HIPAA breaches ever reported.<b", "title": "UCLA Health System suffers data breach"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ronald_reagan.jpg"}, "description": "Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses, along with medical information, were swiped by hackers in one of the largest HIPAA breaches ever reported.<b", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UCLA Health System suffers data breach"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The UCLA Health System on Friday reported a data breach of the protected information of as many as 4.5 million of its patients.&#13; Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses, along with medical information, were swiped by hackers in one of the largest HIPAA breaches ever reported.&#13; The health system reported it noticed unusual activity on its computers last fall and began an investigation.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8991\"", "article_summary": "The UCLA Health System on Friday reported a data breach of the protected information of as many as 4.5 million of its patients.\nUCLA Health System's breach follows a series of similar cyberattacks affecting the healthcare industry in recent months.\nThe health system reported it noticed unusual activity on its computers last fall and began an investigation.\nHIPAA violations have been levied against healthcare organizations for security breaches in which the Office of Civil Rights holds the health system responsible.\nHackers also struck Premera Blue Cross, which exposed the financial and medical data of another 11 million members."}
