The rest of us pay for the military,\u201d he said of tax inverters.\n\nBurger King, based in Miami, denies that a desire to save on corporate taxes is driving the relocation, noting its effective tax rate is only slightly higher than what Tim Hortons pays in Canada.\n\nRather, it argues that Canadian customers, who would account for the bulk of revenues in a combined company, would remain more loyal if the company flew the Canadian flag.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with some Whopper lovers who pledge allegiance to the stars and stripes. Calls for a Burger King boycott are making the rounds on social media, with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, joining in the fray.\n\nBloomberg reports Congress may take up the matter of tax inversions next year, given the growing number of U.S. brands that have or plan to incorporate abroad.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Liberty Global, a Colorado company, did tax inversion last year", "title": "Liberty Global, a Colorado company, did tax inversion last year", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/liberty-global-a-colorado-company-did-tax-inversion-last-year/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T16:56:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T16:56:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8399\"", "article_summary": "Burger King now faces boycott calls in the U.S., but the Liberty Global move didn\u2019t generate anywhere near the same controversy.\nCritics have decried Burger King\u2019s plan to combine with Tim Hortons and relocate its headquarters to Canada from the U.S.as an unpatriotic tax dodge.\nDefenders of inversion argue it results from the 35 percent corporate tax rate in the U.S., among the highest in the developed world, and a policy of taxing revenues regardless of where they are made.\nRather, it argues that Canadian customers, who would account for the bulk of revenues in a combined company, would remain more loyal if the company flew the Canadian flag.\nTax inversions occur when U.S. corporations acquire foreign companies and then re-incorporate abroad to save money on taxes, sometimes without shifting any operations or headquarters staff."}
