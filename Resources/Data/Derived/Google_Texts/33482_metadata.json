Sen.

Bush to invade Iraq and, after a year, the 2001 authorization for military use against al Qaeda \u2014 the two laws Obama is relying on to attack ISIS. It would also allow U.S. troops to attack ISIS under limited circumstances. The war declaration very likely will go nowhere, and it will probably face more resistance from Republicans than Democrats; Sen.
