Ted Cruz and the coming showdown over defunding Obamacare and potential government shutdown; but Carlson wanted to hear his thoughts on Obama saying \u201cwe have overcome far darker threats\u201d than the GOP attempts to defund the healthcare law.\n\n\u201cThat is the race card being played,\u201d Carlson explained. \u201cCan you see any other explanation for it?\u201d he asked the FNS host.\n\nWallace threw his hands up and said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d before pivoting: \u201cI think to get to the real point though, they are not going to compromise.\u201d\n\nDespite Wallace\u2019s efforts to turn back to strictly talking congressional politics, Carlson did not back down, interrupting: \u201cBut what do you mean? Isn\u2019t it news if the president says to the Congressional Black Caucus, \u2018We have overcome far bigger threats\u2019? That\u2019s taking rhetoric to a new place, is it not?\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s where things got supremely awkward.\n\nWallace chuckled, paused for a good two seconds, and then amusedly replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, Tucker.\u201d\n\nUncomfortable pause again.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to talk about Obamacare?\u201d Wallace then asked.\n\nCarlson agreed, prompting Wallace to reply with a smirking \u201cokay,\u201d almost as if to pat his colleague on the head before moving on. You can sense the \u201cThou Hast Inconvenienced Me\u201d look in Wallace\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe whole thing was cringe-worthy.
