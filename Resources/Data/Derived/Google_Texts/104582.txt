Three Colorado State University graduates who founded a business based on chocolate-chip-stuffed marshmallows can add another success to their tally: a world record.

Tyler Krenzelok, Paul Jenkins and James Schrack, co-founders of Fort Collins Specialty Foods and the chocolate-filled marshmallow Stuff’n Mallows, gathered Saturday in a CSU parking lot along with hungry community members to set the Guinness World Record for “Most People Making S’mores Simultaneously,” Krenzelok said.

Participants purchased a $5 ticket, and Krenzelok said all proceeds will be donated to Koa Cares Camps, which provide camping experiences for kids with cancer at Koa Campgrounds.

The trio needed to beat 250 s’mores makers, and they proudly broke the record with 404 folks roasting the tasty treats around a fire, Krenzelok said.

“It was a blast,” he said. “It’s been a lot of work, but it feels really exciting to see all that pay off.”

Now, the Fort Collins business waits for the record to become official.

Krenzelok said Guinness requires paperwork, pictures and videos of the event and outside sources to verify participants.

“It’s a six-month approval process before we’re officially certified,” Krenzelok said.
