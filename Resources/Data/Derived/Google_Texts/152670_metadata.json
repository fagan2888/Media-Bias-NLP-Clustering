The fourth set started off close but we pulled away at the end to get the victory and now we are state-bound. We are excited and ready to compete at state.\u201d\n\nAmarillo High coach Jan Barker said it was a tough match to advance to state for the 13th time in 28 years.\n\n\u201cFor the first two sets we started strong but got behind and had to make a comeback against a strong team,\u201d Barker said. \u201cThey showed a lot of fight. Then after losing pretty badly in the third game, the girls kicked it in and never looked back. It was then that we had an 8-1 run and were able to finish it off. Making it to state with these girls is so exciting. They have so much fight in them, and the returnees were so focused on making it back again after winning it last year.\u201d\n\nSenior middle blocker Zoe Hardin, who was MVP in last season\u2019s state tournament game, said Lewisville Hebron was a difficult oppenent to face for a third time.\n\n\u201cHebron was the toughest team we\u2019ve come up against all season,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat a team three times. We had to fight harder than ever and come together as a team and play one point at a time. It was such a fun game and we cannot wait to continue the hard work at the state tournament.\u201d\n\nSenior libero Samantha Nolan said Lewisville Hebron had the goal of avenging the two losses earlier in the season.\n\n\u201cThey were out to get us and fought hard,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cEvery time they pushed, we pushed back even harder. The winning team will always be the one who finishes.\u201d\n\nSophomore outside hitter Emerson Solano said Amarillo High was able to win because of a drive to succeed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of a team that fought so hard and wanted it so bad,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe all had a next point mentality and with that we took it all the way.\u201d\n\nAmarillo High def.
