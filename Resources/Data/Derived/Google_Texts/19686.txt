MILWAUKEE (AP) - Two Wisconsin men climbing Mount Everest have survived an avalanche set off by a powerful earthquake in Nepal.

Benjamin Breckheimer, who grew up in Menomonee Falls, was trying to become the first wounded warrior to climb Mount Everest. Breckheimer, who now lives in Port Charlotte, Florida, was wounded by a homemade bomb in Afghanistan in 2009.

Breckheimer's mother, Mary Lyons, who lives in Menomonee Falls, tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1HJarzH ) that her son called her at 4 a.m. Saturday. Lyons says her son said the situation was "pretty bad" but that he was OK and would call in a few days.

Andy Land, a hospice nurse from Fond du Lac, and the rest of his climbing team led by International Mountain Guides in Ashford, Washington, all survived the earthquake.
