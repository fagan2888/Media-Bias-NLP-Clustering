Trump, he said, isn\u2019t pushing any real conservative ideas and had \u201cno solutions\u201d for his proposals.\n\n\u201cDonald agrees with everything President Obama and Hillary Clinton are doing,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe just says he\u2019ll negotiate a better deal on affordable health care. Two words that I never hear come out of Donald\u2019s mouth: small business.\u201d\n\nTo rousing applause, Cruz touched his usual talking points, concluding with a return to less government regulation in all areas.\n\nCruz told the audience he would establish a flat tax, abolish the IRS, do away with corporate subsidies and lobbyists\u2019 interests, and simplify things. From there, he launched a declaration to \u201cimmediately repeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d which he called \u201cthe biggest job-killer in the country.\u201d He then blasted the health care law, which was destroying small businesses that couldn\u2019t afford it and hurting individuals who couldn\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cIf you just graduated from college and you\u2019re wondering why there are no jobs,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cOne of the big reasons is because small businesses are getting crushed with Obamacare and can\u2019t afford it. You\u2019re a single mom, you\u2019re waiting tables, working two or three part-time jobs, and you\u2019re at 29 hours, because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours.\u201d\n\nWith that, he also said the current Washington establishment wasn\u2019t strong enough \u2013 and that he would be better.\n\n\u201cIn every battle we\u2019ve had with Obama, we\u2019ve seen what happens,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhich is, we end up not winning because Republicans pre-emptively surrender. There\u2019s a difference if you have a conservative in the White House who says \u2018if you send me a bill that\u2019s filled with corporate welfare, I will veto.'\u201d\n\nWhen Hannity asked if there were any areas of compromise, Cruz said no. He pointed to his firm pledge to voters, but then qualified his statement by saying there were acceptable times for give-and-take.\n\n\u201cThere are areas on which you can have little compromises,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have battled like crazy, and fought for lower tax rates, and we couldn\u2019t get 10 percent \u2013 I\u2019m going to fight tooth and nail for 10 percent. But if we end up cutting it to 12 percent? I\u2019ll take 12 percent. But you don\u2019t compromise on principles, you don\u2019t compromise on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nCruz and Hannity also agreed on the \u201ccultural divide\u201d between Islam and the United States. Cruz acknowledged the public\u2019s frustration with Obama, who he felt was an apologist to radical Islam and \u201cnot keeping the country safe.\u201d That was why Cruz could understand their support for Trump.\n\nFiorina touted Cruz as a true fiscal conservative \u2013 what she said the country needed in the White House.\n\nFriday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio\u2018s press team issued a statement warning Florida voters that a vote for anyone but Rubio was \u201ca vote for Donald Trump,\u201d evoking Thursday night\u2019s debate as proof Rubio was the best choice.\n\n\u201cLast night, by hitting home runs on issues important to Florida Republicans, Marco reminded voters here why they elected him in 2010,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDonald Trump once again showed that when he is pressed for policy details on important issues he has no answers. Florida voters who want to stop Donald Trump need to rally around Marco Rubio because he is the only one that has a chance of beating him.\u201d\n\nCruz addressed such strategies at the rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Washington\u2019s last gasp,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s real simple. How do you beat Donald Trump? You beat him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Ted Cruz arrived in Central Florida for a rally Friday morning, joined by Fox News anchor Sean Hannity and former candidate\u00a0Carly Fiorina, who recently endorsed the Republican White House hopeful.
