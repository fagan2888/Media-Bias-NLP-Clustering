The last of the visitors purchased tickets for looping rides, tried the rock climbing wall, bought fried foods and sausage sandwiches, or roamed the tents farm animals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about family fun. It\u2019s about getting people out,\u201d said Karen Jarmusz, a Monmouth County Parks employee and chairwoman of this year\u2019s event.\n\nIf you missed the fair, here are three reasons to go next year:\n\n1. Animal culture\n\nSarah Bond, a 17-year-old Colts Neck High School student from Marlboro, cradled an amber, black and white Belgian d\u2019Uccle chicken in her arms as fair visitors roamed the poultry tent.\n\n\u201cI love talking to them about my chickens,\u201d said Bond, who has participated in Monmouth County\u2019s 4-H Club since fifth grade. Her chicken Rose, \u201chas got great personality. A lot of people think chicken\u2019s don\u2019t have personality because they\u2019re birds, but they do, just like a dog or a cat.\u201d\n\nAnd like a cat or dog, Bond said her chickens are pets, not food.\n\nEach year, the 4-H Club and other groups fill the fair with farm animals: sheep, horses, pigs, ducks, even bees in a enclosed glass closet. Pig races, sheep herding demonstration and horse costume contests are among some of the crowd\u2019s favorite events.\n\nGene Sheninger of Wayside Farm in Rockaway Township brought his 6-year-old border collie, named Sweet, to herd sheep for a fair demonstration.\n\nSheninger tried herding solo years ago, and quickly learned the benefits of working with a dog for a partner.\n\n\u201cIt took me all day to catch my dozen sheep,\u201d he recalled, but Sweet\u2019s ability to anticipate his instructions made the job simpler.\n\nSweet knows what to do and where to do based on where Sheninger stands, or from his brief whistle blows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like poetry in motion, to watch these dogs in action,\u201d he said.\n\n2. Carnival chow-down\n\nNo fair would be complete without favorite foods like snowcones, ice cream, hotdogs and fresh lemonade. But the Monmouth County Fair also carried some unusual offerings, like Carnival Cater\u2019s fried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chicken-waffle sandwiches.\n\nBuy Photo (NEWS) 07/26/15 Freehold, NJ The Monmouth County Fair was held at East Freehold Showgrounds on Kozloski Road in Freehold from July 22-26, 2015.

Local artisans\n\nThe fair is filled with artists of all talents, from jewelry makers, pianists, jugglers to puppet dinosaurs.\n\nThe event \u201cis a lot of fun,\u201d said Ken Ingalls, who makes homemade candles for his Little House Candles company based in Plumsted. \u201cI enjoy the family aspect of it.\u201d\n\nLocal musicians such as the Amish Outlaws, Motor City Revue, Dr. Cheeko and After the Reign performed over the fair\u2019s five days, and drew attendees from across the state.\n\n\u201cI love the atmosphere. I love the entertainment,\u201d said Miriam Garcia of Middletown, who carried her 11-month-old granddaughter Lila Marie Anderson around the animal pens.\n\nGarcia said this year\u2019s trip to the fair is bitter sweet, because it\u2019s her last before she moves to Texas.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure I brought my granddaughter so she would experience it,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nJarmusz, the fair\u2019s chairwoman, said the event is about celebrating Monmouth County\u2019s agricultural heritage but also about family fun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just our way of inviting the families out for a good time,\u201d she said.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@GannettNJ.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1MQLD86", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Each year, tens of thousands of people come to the Monmouth County Fair.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Each year, tens of thousands of people come to the Monmouth County Fair.", "title": "3 things you missed at the Monmouth County Fair", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/western-monmouth-county/freehold/2015/07/26/monmouth-county-fair/30710933/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Each year, tens of thousands of people come to the Monmouth County Fair.", "title": "41st Monmouth County Fair closes", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1caf45fec49e37a36ec1c4460d41c70aa0da066/c=458-0-2005-1547&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/26/AsburyPark/B9318036590Z.1_20150726194059_000_GR1BET07M.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Monmouth County Fair, fair, county fair, new jersey, carnival"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd31c\"", "article_summary": "The 41st Monmouth County Fair \u2014 which draws about 80,000 people each year \u2014 came to a close Sunday at the East Freehold Showgrounds.\nBuy Photo (NEWS) 07/26/15 Freehold, NJ The Monmouth County Fair was held at East Freehold Showgrounds on Kozloski Road in Freehold from July 22-26, 2015.\nBut the Monmouth County Fair also carried some unusual offerings, like Carnival Cater\u2019s fried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chicken-waffle sandwiches.\nIt\u2019s about getting people out,\u201d said Karen Jarmusz, a Monmouth County Parks employee and chairwoman of this year\u2019s event.\n(Photo: Frank Galipo/Special to the Press)Buy PhotoFREEHOLD \u2013 Each year, tens of thousands of people come to the Monmouth County Fair for its animal shows, carnival food, thrilling rides and historic demonstrations."}
