The Assembly passed it 74-0 with three abstentions last month; the Senate has not yet taken a vote.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming public support for improving the way our healthcare system recognizes, works with and assists unpaid family caregivers,\u201d Douglas Johnston said, AARP\u2019s lobbyist.\n\nThe results confirm what AARP members have been saying for years -- sometimes all caretakers get is a bag of prescription bottles and a handout with directions, Johnston said.\n\n\"We're not suggesting there is a plague of poor health care in New Jersey, but there is inconsistency among health care facilities and how they work with family caregivers,\" Johnston said. \"There needs to be a basic standard.\"\n\nThe bill (A2955) would let patients admitted to the hospital identify a caregiver who will be providing assistance when the patient returns home. The hospital must include that person's name, address and telephone number in the patient's medical record.\n\nWithin 24 hours after a decision to discharge a patient is made, the hospital would have to explain what the patient needs, answer questions and offer training, which could include a live or recorded demonstration, according to the bill.\n\nThe AARP is also seeking support on a related bill (A1855) that would provide a tax credit to help pay for expenses including respite care and home improvements to accommodate the sick relative. With a maximum credit of $675 a year for couples whose income do not exceed $100,000 or $50,000 for single people, the N.J. Caregiver Assistance Act would cost the state $75 million to $150 million, according to the Office of Legislative Services.\n\nPassing the CARE Act is timely for hospitals, which are now penalized under the Affordable Care Act if readmissions rates within 30 days after discharge are deemed too high for Medicare patients.\n\nNew Jersey has the second highest rate of readmissions in the country, with 59 of 64 hospitals forfeiting as much as .66 percent of their Medicare payments, according to Kaiser Health News, an independent, nonpartisan research organization.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s dismal rankings in hospital readmission rates speak for themselves,\u201d said Evelyn Liebman, AARP\u2019s associate state director. \u201cThese are the kinds of changes we need to be seriously embracing.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey Hospital Association supports \u201cthe goals of the CARE Act \u2013 to work with patients\u2019 loved ones and ensure they have the support they need to keep their recoveries on track once they\u2019re discharged from the hospital.,\u201d said Randy Minniear, the hospital association\u2019s senior vice president.\n\n\n\n\"Some of the current language is inconsistent with existing federal and state regulations, and some could create operational issues within the hospital that could actually delay discharges for patients that are ready to go home,\u201d Minniear said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had good constructive conversations so far, and we\u2019re pretty confident we can work through those concerns.\"\n\nThe AARP-commissioned the telephone poll from April 11 and April 24, and has a margin of error of 3.2 percent.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 N.J. elderly more likely to be readmitted to hospitals\n\n\u2022 Nearly every N.J. hospital to be penalized by Medicare for high readmissions\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-assembly, nj-senate, obamacare, news", "title": "NJ caregivers for sick and elderly relatives seek more hospital support, poll says", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Within 24 hours after a decision to discharge a patient is made, the hospital would have to explain what the patient needs, answer questions and offer training, which could include a live or recorded demonstration, according to the bill.", "title": "NJ caregivers for sick and elderly relatives seek more hospital support, poll says", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/njs_growing_number_of_caregivers_for_sick_and_elderly_relatives_seek_more_hospital_support_poll_says.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2012/07/elderly-handsjpg-5f1859c7237502fd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Within 24 hours after a decision to discharge a patient is made, the hospital would have to explain what the patient needs, answer questions and offer training, which could include a live or recorded demonstration, according to the bill.", "creator": "@susanklivio", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2012/07/elderly-handsjpg-5f1859c7237502fd.jpg", "title": "NJ caregivers for sick and elderly relatives seek more hospital support, poll says", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, June 16, 2014,  6:47 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, June 16, 2014,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Susan K.
