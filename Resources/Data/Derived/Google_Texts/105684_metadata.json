For those who qualify, minimally invasive surgery is a clear solution to this problem. It nearly cuts down the number of surgical complications by half and helps to bring down overall health care costs. A new study has found that despite this clear advantage, there are unsettling disparities in the use of minimally invasive surgeries in hospitals throughout the U.S.\n\nHuge Disparity In American Health Care\n\nJohns Hopkins University researchers calculated the use of laparoscopic surgical procedures at over 1,000 U.S. hospitals in 2010, according to a recent press release. The study was published in the online British Medical Journal and included information based on appendectomy, colectomy, hysterectomy, and lung lobectomy surgeries. These are the four most common minimally invasive procedures done in the U.S. Each hospital was marked as low, medium, or high based on their actual to predicted use of minimally invasive surgery. Through their work, researchers found what Dr. Martin Makary, senior author on the study described as \u201cone of the greatest disparities in American healthcare.\u201d\n\nHundreds Of Thousands Of Patients Not Given Option\n\nMakary and his team found that, on average, the use of minimally invasive surgery for appendectomy was 71 percent, 28 percent for colectomy, 13 percent for hysterectomy, and 32 percent for lung lobectomy. Overall, however, it remained true that surgical complications were less common with minimally invasive surgery than with open surgery in each category.\n\nWhat was most salient in the information gathered was the large disparity in nationwide hospital\u2019s use of these four surgical procedures. \u201cHundreds of thousands of patients are candidates and are getting cut open because that\u2019s the way the surgeon likes to do things. This represents a disparity,\u201d Makary told Medial Daily. For example, it was found some hospitals never performed the minimally invasive surgery, while others used it for more than three quarters of their procedures. The only pattern to be uncovered was that urban hospitals were more likely to perform three of the four procedures, but other than that, no other trends emerged.\n\nWhat Is Causing This Disparity?\n\nDr. Michael Tarnoff, chief medical officer for Covidien, explained to Medical Daily that which procedure you are offered is largely dependent on what surgeon you see. \u201cIt\u2019s literally that volatile and that random,\u201d Tarnoff said. \u201cI think it's two things. It's value being measured more than volume and then forcing the hand of the surgeon to learn how to deliver that value.\u201d Tarnoff, who is currently teaching surgery at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, has been training surgeons in the art of laparoscopic surgery for years. He believes that it\u2019s never too late for these doctors to learn a new skill. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time and effort and understanding what the needs of the training is,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording Makary, there is also sometimes a \u201cperverse incentive financially\u201d for not offering ideal candidates minimally invasive procedures. \u201cSome fraction of doctors will settle for second best, or respond to the perverse incentive. From this study we learned that the variation of what\u2019s offered is massive,\u201d explained Makary to Medical Daily.\n\nSolution: Educate The Public And Train Surgeons\n\nOften making a new health care option available to the public is more difficult than the actual developments. Makary insists his study is not evidence that all surgeons need to be forced to perform this type of procedure. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair that some surgeons may not feel comfortable and they may be particularly skilled at open surgery, we should embrace that,\u201d Makary said.\n\nRather, Makary suggests, three changes be made in order to ensure that patients have the option to choose minimally invasive surgery if they are eligible: better educating patients of their options, better training for surgeons, and transparency of a hospital\u2019s performance. \u201cRight now the public has little information to guide their choices. We can only conclude that many of the patients that are undergoing traditional surgery who are candidates are having the open surgery because they are not aware of the option or the option is not being fairly presented,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "laparoscopic, surgery, use, may, be, one, greatest, disparities, american, healthcare, study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although minimally invasive surgery has been proven to produce less complications when compared to traditional surgeries, a new study has found that many surgeons simply aren't offering their patients the option.", "title": "Not All Hospitals Are Offering Patients The Best Surgical Option", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/laparoscopic-surgery-use-may-be-one-greatest-disparities-american-healthcare-study-291984", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/surgeon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although minimally invasive surgery has been proven to produce less complications when compared to traditional surgeries, a new study has found that many surgeons simply aren't offering their patients the option.", "title": "Not All Hospitals Are Offering Patients The Best Surgical Option", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/laparoscopic-surgery-use-may-be-one-greatest-disparities-american-healthcare-study-291984", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/surgeon.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/surgeon.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-08T18:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T18:41:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although minimally invasive surgery has been proven to produce less complications when compared to traditional surgeries, a new study has found that many surgeons simply aren't offering their patients the option."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20d4\"", "article_summary": "Overall, however, it remained true that surgical complications were less common with minimally invasive surgery than with open surgery in each category.\nFor those who qualify, minimally invasive surgery is a clear solution to this problem.\nThese are the four most common minimally invasive procedures done in the U.S. Each hospital was marked as low, medium, or high based on their actual to predicted use of minimally invasive surgery.\nHuge Disparity In American Health CareJohns Hopkins University researchers calculated the use of laparoscopic surgical procedures at over 1,000 U.S. hospitals in 2010, according to a recent press release.\nAccording Makary, there is also sometimes a \u201cperverse incentive financially\u201d for not offering ideal candidates minimally invasive procedures."}
