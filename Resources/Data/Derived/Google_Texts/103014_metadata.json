So, police say, the business is making illegal broad-daylight drug deals to the tune of at least $200,000 untaxed dollars a month.\n\nRead the complete story here.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that Independence Day fireworks have been canceled in various towns in California, and elsewhere, due to drought and fire risk.\n\nBut Independence Day at our own Fort Vancouver? Are you kidding?\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with the Fire Marshall\u2019s Office and Pearson Field. We are taking all precautions to keep it safe,\u201d said Cara Cantonwine, program director at the Fort Vancouver National Trust. \u201cThis year is dry. There\u2019s definitely more advance consideration of the field itself.\u201d\n\nRead the complete story here.\n\nThree weeks ago, PeaceHealth set out a belated welcome mat for hundreds of Clark County business leaders and elected officials. The operator of PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center and nine other medical centers in three states wanted to introduce itself to the community \u2014 something PeaceHealth leaders say they hadn\u2019t done since moving corporate offices here from Bellevue four years ago.\n\nFor two hours, visitors filled the vast entryway of the Columbia Center at Columbia Tech Center. PeaceHealth leaders touted the health care system\u2019s economic impact as Clark County\u2019s largest employer, with nearly 4,300 employees and $295 million in local payroll. Guests snacking on sumptuous foods checked out displays of services and technology offered at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center, the county\u2019s largest medical facility.\n\nWhile PeaceHealth officials joked about their four-year delay in introducing themselves to the community, they made no mention of another point of awkwardness about the event timing, coming in the midst of major turmoil that is rumbling through the health care system.\n\nIn just the last few months, many of PeaceHealth\u2019s top leaders have been replaced or their positions eliminated, raising questions about the direction of the nonprofit that is operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace. Meanwhile, some employee groups at two Oregon hospitals, in Eugene and Springfield, have voted to unionize over complaints about staffing levels and employee benefits; and workers in both Bellingham and Vancouver have gone public with complaints about staffing and employee benefits.\n\nRead the complete story here.\n\nPORTLAND \u2014 Though all the talk this week is about LaMarcus Aldridge leaving, the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday made sure Damian Lillard will stay long-term.\n\nThe Blazers signed Lillard to sign a 5-year extension reportedly worth $129 million. On Thursday afternoon, Lillard tweeted confirmation that he\u2019s going to be in a Blazers uniform for a while.\n\n\u201cThank you so much to Paul Allen and the Trail Blazers organization,\u201d Lillard wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll be in Rip City 6 more years! Oakland to Ogden to Oregon \u2014 TO STAY.\u201d\n\nWith Aldridge, Robin Lopez and Wesley Matthews all free agents and Nic Batum having been traded to Charlotte, Lillard could be the only returning starter from last season.\n\nRead the complete story here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Here's a quick glimpse at some of the top stories this week at columbian.com.", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Here's a quick glimpse at some of the top stories this week at columbian.com.", "title": "Morning Press: Ridgefield homicide; Pot bust; Fireworks; PeaceHealth; Blazers", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/jul/04/morning-press-ridgefield-homicide-pot-bust-firewor/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Morning Press: Ridgefield homicide; Pot bust; Fireworks; PeaceHealth; Blazers"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Blazers,Business,Carousel,Courts and Crime,Latest News,Local News,Morning Press,News,Ridgefield and Fairgrounds,Sports", "published_time": "2015-07-04 00:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05b3\"", "article_summary": "PeaceHealth leaders touted the health care system\u2019s economic impact as Clark County\u2019s largest employer, with nearly 4,300 employees and $295 million in local payroll.\nGuests snacking on sumptuous foods checked out displays of services and technology offered at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center, the county\u2019s largest medical facility.\nThree weeks ago, PeaceHealth set out a belated welcome mat for hundreds of Clark County business leaders and elected officials.\nThe discovery of a man\u2019s body in a field near Ridgefield early Wednesday morning has prompted a homicide investigation by the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\u201cThank you so much to Paul Allen and the Trail Blazers organization,\u201d Lillard wrote."}
