He sat at his desk, his hands palms upward, fingers slightly curved, as if cupping something in them. \u201cI want Hagel.\u201d he said, staring into the camera. \u201cI want Hagel. I want him.\u201d A casual observer might interpret this moment as O\u2019Reilly expressing his fierce but tender desire for Chuck Hagel, the Secretary of Defense. More experienced O\u2019Reilly viewers, however, will recognize it as a signal that the unfortunate Hagel had plummeted downward in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s estimation from pinhead to evildoer. (There are only three kinds of people in Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s world: good hardworking Americans, pinheads\u2014people who are not actually malevolent but who are too stupid to understand the way the world really works\u2014and evildoers.)\n\nI know these things about O\u2019Reilly because, for the entire month of October, I watched Fox News for approximately three hours every day, while at the same time strictly abstaining from any other sources of information about current events. The reason I engaged in this self-induced Fox News torture was that it had become clear that the right-wing media in general, and Fox News in particular, were constructing an alternate reality than the one I live in. Fox is, of course, a great driver of public opinion.\n\nOn this occasion, in which the government shutdown had resulted in death benefits not being paid to the families of soldiers killed in action, the problem was so egregious to O\u2019Reilly that it could not possibly result from pinheadedness. No, instead there must have been heinous forces at work, and one of the devil\u2019s minions was Chuck Hagel.\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly, it should be noted, is a man whose mind is entirely undarkened by doubt. I have seen him refuse even to consider the arguments of a Notre Dame theology professor who took exception to his interpretation of the life and message of Jesus. When Juan Williams told him that Jonathan Gruber from MIT had calculated that 80 percent of American citizens would find their health insurance unchanged under Obamacare, O\u2019Reilly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a second\u2026That\u2019s what some pinhead says. That\u2019s not a fact.\u201d\n\nDoubt, as well as its cousins ambiguity, complexity, subtlety and nuance, are simply not welcome on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. Voltaire said, \u201cTo be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous.\u201d Bill O\u2019Reilly, I imagine, would think that Voltaire was a pinhead.\n\n* * *\n\nA 2007 study found that in the 2000 presidential election, \u201cRepublicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News.\u201d The study\u2019s estimates \u201cimply that Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure.\u201d In addition to being influential, I also learned that Fox News is an extremely poor source of information about current events.\n\nBut its influence seems to far exceed the ability to sway a few votes one way or another. Fox and its friends seem to have become so influential and all-encompassing that it is actually creating an entirely separate version of reality in the minds of its most loyal viewers, one that with increasing frequency doesn\u2019t match reality.\n\nPerhaps the most startling pieces of evidence of this came Nov. 6, 2012, the evening of the presidential election. At about 11:25 Eastern Standard Time, Fox called Ohio, and therefore the election at large, for Barack Obama. Remarkably, Karl Rove, Bush campaign adviser and Fox News contributor, stated that Fox\u2019s decision was premature and that it was irresponsible for the network to have made it. For over 30 minutes he continued to argue this point with news anchors Brett Baier and Megyn Kelly along with Fox\u2019s own statisticians. The Fox News establishment, though it selects and covers stories with an eye toward advancing a right-wing agenda, is generally forced to recognize some indisputable facts, like vote counts. Rove, on the other hand, who provides political commentary, which makes up over two-thirds of their content, felt no such restriction. Finally, after one last arithmetic salvo from him attempting to demonstrate that the outcome was still in doubt, the exasperated Kelly said, \u201cIs this just math you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better?\u201d\n\nAfter my initial amusement at this episode, I began to find the whole thing alarming. Karl Rove is, by all accounts, a smart man. How could he and so many of his colleagues on the right have been so thoroughly, so publicly, so humiliatingly wrong? The theory I eventually arrived at was that the right-wing infosphere had become so large and self-referential that people like Rove were seduced by its alternate view of reality. What then, I wondered, would happen to someone like me, someone who has abandoned the Democratic Party because it is not progressive enough, who thinks that Barack Obama is, politically, very similar to Richard Nixon but without the personality disorders, someone who is literally a card-carrying member of the ACLU\u2014in short, a member of the evil cabal that Fox News guests routinely rail against?\n\nThus, on Oct. 1, 2013, I sat down on my couch and, armed with nothing but a remote, vowed to consume three hours of Fox News programming a day for an entire month, while strictly abstaining from any other sources of information about current events. I couldn\u2019t sample all of Fox\u2019s wares, of course, but after looking at its lineup, I chose three shows to concentrate on\u2014\u201dFox & Friends,\u201d because it seemed like it might be representative of the network\u2019s populist, aw-shucks conservatism; Shep Smith\u2019s News Hour, because Smith has a reputation as being the straightest shooter of the Fox anchors; and, of course, the network\u2019s browbeater-in-chief, Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was how similar all of the on-air personalities were. The men come in a variety of ages and weights, but are almost exclusively white, and almost all seem coated with a film of weary exasperation at the antics of the enemies of our nation. Shep Smith seems to be the exception to this. In contrast, he comes across as refreshingly candid and good-humored, and doesn\u2019t indulge in the sort of winking innuendo that passes for news on much of the rest of the network. Within a few days of the commencement of my Fox project, I developed a fervent, Stockholm syndrome-style crush on Shep Smith. (The women of Fox are attractive, which is not an unusual requirement for female TV personalities, but they are dramatically, disproportionately blond and share a particular ebullience.)\n\nThe quintessence of the Fox News style is found on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d It is the network\u2019s morning show, a competitor to \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cToday.\u201d It features three hosts, Steve Doocy, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Brian Kilmeade. Doocy seems to be the brains of the three, a blond 50-ish man with a long face who is always ready with a sarcastic smile or an eye roll at the sad state of political affairs. Hasselbeck seems as if she might be too nice for the role in which she is cast. She has only a few go-to facial expressions\u2014compassionate concern (generally reserved for children), an angry moue that comes off more as a petulant pout, and a bright smile that she occasionally tries to repurpose, Doocy-style, into one of outraged disbelief. She can\u2019t quite pull the latter off, however, and the effect is sort of disturbing, resembling a fear/aggression response more than anything else. Kilmead plays the part of the dumb little brother, often starting sentences with, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get \u2026\u201d He handles all of the sports stories, and there is something behind his small, close-set eyes that makes me think that he once spent a lot of time pushing the heads of nerdy classmates into toilets.\n\nAs the days went by, I began to get comfortable with my cast of characters, and for a while things seemed to be going pretty swimmingly. As a liberal I was skeptical of the Fox version of events, and the news coverage tends to be fairly monochromatic, but I otherwise felt on top of things. Or I did, that is, until Oct. 9.\n\nThe government was shut down on Oct. 1, and this monopolized Fox\u2019s coverage, but in a very strange way. Since the shutdown was the result of Republican action, there seemed to be a very strong editorial slant aimed at minimizing the suffering caused by it. On much of the network they referred to the event as the \u201cSenate slimdown,\u201d presumably because everybody thinks a slimdown is a good thing, and if you don\u2019t, well, it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s fault. And the network in general had a variety of experts and think tank denizens paraded across its sets assuring us all that the slimdown was actually beneficial, or at least without any discernible consequences. Except, of course, to the veterans, but that was Obama\u2019s and Hagel\u2019s fault.\n\nI, on the other hand, was not so sure of the salubrious effects of turning the entire federal government off on a whim, and the constant drumbeat of cheery shutdown news began to make me\u2014and I admit this freely\u2014a little bit paranoid. Which brings me back to Oct. 9.\n\nThat morning, one of the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d headlines\u2014quick stories that merit only a few second\u2019s mention\u2014was that \u201cthat salmonella outbreak\u201d had become so severe that furloughed CDC workers were being recalled to help deal with it. My eyes widened in surprise. What? A salmonella outbreak? I had been watching Fox News for an average of three hours a day for eight days, and this was the very first I had heard of it. I was even more disturbed by the casual tone of it all, as if they had been discussing it for weeks, and I had just missed it. My first\u2014and perhaps slightly fevered\u2014thought was that the network had soft-pedaled the story because they didn\u2019t want to give the impression that furloughing a bunch of agricultural inspectors might have been a bad idea.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I'm a card-carrying member of the ACLU.
