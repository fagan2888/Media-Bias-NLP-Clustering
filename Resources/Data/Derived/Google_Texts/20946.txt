On CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live” Tuesday, actor Richard Dreyfuss weighed in on the Obamacare rollout.

“I think for about 100 years one of the political parties has always tried to get a safety net under people and the other party hasn’t,” he said. “And now we have [Obamacare], which is an enormous accomplishment. And it started with glitches and problems — but I love to remind people that all of our national endeavors started out badly. World War II did not start well or the highway act or social security or the Hoover Dam. And what happens is they get fixed by a Congress of both parties, and that’s what should happen now. And if one party says ‘no,’ then they should anticipate having the sick and the dying and the dead on their lawns.”
