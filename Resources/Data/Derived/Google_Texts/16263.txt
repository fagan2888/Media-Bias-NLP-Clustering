Bowie University, a historically black college in Maryland, is being forced to cancel its student healthcare policy because of Obamacare.

Bowie administrators determined that the cost of complying with President Obama’s signature healthcare law would raise per semester costs from $50 for each student to $900. Instead, the university made the decision to simply end its healthcare coverage for students.

“Bowie State University has suspended offering health insurance for domestic students for the 2013-2014 academic year,” said the university in a statement.

The bad news at Bowie undercuts Obama’s assurances that his domestic policies are helping young people and African Americans. As recently as August, a spokesperson for the White House told reporters that Obama was committed to providing vigorous support for historically black colleges and their students, according to Campus Reform.

“The President and this administration have been strong supporters of historically black colleges and universities all across the country,” said Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest in a statement in August. “Funding for those colleges and universities has increased under President Obama.”

Campus Reform Reporter Kat Timpf interviewed Bowie students about the Obamacare-related cancellation of their healthcare policies. Many were unsure how they would pay for healthcare without the university policy.

Some blamed Obama for not living up to his promise to enact policies to help black students.

“It’s stupid and it’s Obama’s fault,” one student told Campus Reform. “You haven’t done anything, Obama, and I’m disappointed in you.”

Bowie students are hardly the only people finding out that they don’t like Obamacare, after all. (RELATED: Obama rallies supporters Monday evening to save Obamacare)
