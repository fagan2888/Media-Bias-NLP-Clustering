A late-night argument ends with a man grazed by a bullet Friday outside of an east Wichita bar.

One woman told police told police a man fired a gun in the direction of The Place bar near Harry and Oliver. It happened at about 11 p.m. following an altercation between three men.

The woman told police the shooter's girlfriend was talking to the men when the suspect fired in their general location, before speeding off in a white, 80s model Chevrolet Suburban with a blue stripe.

A 51-year-old man was grazed by the ricocheting bullet. He refused EMS and was treated on scene for minor injuries.

Sgt. Troy Nedbalek of the Wichita Police Dept. said it was safe to assume at least one bullet struck the building with more than a dozen people still inside.

There were no other injuries reported. A detailed description of the suspect was not given.
