The agency is now under the Commerce Department IG\u2019s umbrella.\n\nThe Denali Commission was a pet project created by former Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK) in 1998. The program, which has received more than $1.1 billion through Congress since its inception, funds infrastructure projects in rural Alaska. Steven\u2019s directed hundreds of millions of dollars to the agency and it has funded at least 2,000 projects so far. The Alaska delegation has fought to keep it as a steady funding stream for federal grants and it has dodged steep budget cuts in previous years.\n\nBut not everyone is happy about that. In fact, before Marsh resigned from his IG post last December, he launched a super bizarre campaign to get Congress to abolish the entire Denali Commission.\n\nRelated: Invalid EPA Bonuses Doled Out Like Candy\n\nThat\u2019s right. The auditor had personally asked Congress to stop funding his office and essentially lay him and his colleagues off. He wrote a letter last summer detailing the bizarre request.\n\n\u201cI have concluded that [my agency] is a congressional experiment that hasn\u2019t worked out in practice,\u201d Marsh wrote at the time. \u201cI recommend that Congress put its money elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the former auditor even detailed his proposition in a seven-page presentation complete with graphics and a bibliography\u2014which he sent to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nOf course, Marsh\u2019s elaborate request to essentially lose his job was denied.\n\nThe Denali Project remains in tact and funding new projects\u2014however, it is the subject of a separate GAO investigation where auditors are probing into questionable practices revolving around how the agency administers and awards its grants.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the better part of the last two years, a federal inspector general tasked with ove", "title": "U.S. Spent $1 Billion on a Watchdog That Didn\u2019t Bark", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/1Billion-6-Incomplete-Govt-Audits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Money_Shell_Game.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/1Billion-6-Incomplete-Govt-Audits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Money_Shell_Game.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For the better part of the last two years, a federal inspector general tasked with ove", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Denali Commission was a pet project created by former Sen.
