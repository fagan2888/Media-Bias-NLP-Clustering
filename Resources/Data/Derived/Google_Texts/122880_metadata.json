In fact, we support House Bill 1054, which would increase that to age 21. So we also support a bill that would ban minors 18 and younger from using tanning beds.\n\nThere is simply no need for youngsters to seek an artificially induced tan and subject themselves to the possibility of devastating effects years later.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, 419,254 cases of skin cancer each year are attributed to indoor tanning. Of this number, 6,199 are melanoma cases. The risk is highest in those exposed at young ages; 19 percent of adolescents have tanned indoors, according to the study.\n\nWe understand reputable tanning salons require parental consent, but we still think this bill is an important step in saving lives.\n\nSociety doesn\u2019t approve of parents letting kids smoke, and it shouldn\u2019t give the OK to using tanning beds.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ban tanning beds for youths", "title": "Ban tanning beds for youths", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/07/ban-tanning-beds-for-youths/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140207__20140210_A13_OP10E_TANNINGp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140207__20140210_A13_OP10E_TANNINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-07T17:42:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:32:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e9f\"", "article_summary": "Society doesn\u2019t approve of parents letting kids smoke, and it shouldn\u2019t give the OK to using tanning beds.\nSo we also support a bill that would ban minors 18 and younger from using tanning beds.\nIn the U.S. alone, 419,254 cases of skin cancer each year are attributed to indoor tanning.\nA recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association says the number of skin cancer cases due to indoor tanning is higher than the number of lung cancer cases due to smoking worldwide.\nIn a state that boasts 300 days of sunshine a year, there is no reason young people should be exposing their skin to indoor tanning."}
