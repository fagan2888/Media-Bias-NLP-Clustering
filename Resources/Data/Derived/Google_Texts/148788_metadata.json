But Kobe Bryant quickly surpassed him with this head-scratcher in 2010. And then, of course, there was Chris Paul on the trampoline in 2012, which was soon followed with this number by Dwyane Wade (why is she sitting on the hoop?). And we obviously can never forget the many athletic souls who opted to pose buck nekkid for ESPN\u2019s The Body Issue (hi, Kenneth). Too much, guys. Too much.\n\n(UPDATE: A smart reader pointed out that I had forgotten one NBA cover that \u2026 oy. Here, just look for yourself.)\n\nBut perhaps none are as odd as this one (OK maybe Kobe\u2019s was \u2026 that was really odd actually): Say hello to \u201cBasketball Timofey Mozgov,\u201d in the latest issue of Russian Esquire. He\u2019s wearing a lot of shirts.
