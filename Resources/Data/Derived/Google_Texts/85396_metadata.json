Maybe I get some runners in scoring position and I make the most of it.\u201d\n\nThis is the fourth time Tulowitzki has been selected to the All-Star Game, but only the third time he\u2019ll play in the game. He was inactive in 2010 because of a broken wrist.\n\nHe\u2019s approaching No. 4 with a cooler head.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of All-Star Games, I was running around with my head cut off until five minutes until the national anthem started,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I understand a little better what I need to do to prepare. I\u2019m giving myself enough time to go out there and prepare.\u201d\n\nDerby day. Tulo didn\u2019t far particularly well in Monday night\u2019s Home Run Derby, getting bumped out in the second round by Cincinnati\u2019s Todd Frazier. He hit a total of six home runs.\n\nStill, Tulo, who captained the NL squad, had a fantastic night.\n\n\u201cWhenever I think about the Home Run Derby, I think about my time as a kid, watching it on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a chance to participate in it was something special. Obviously, competitive side would have liked to have done better, but at the same time, I enjoyed it and it was something I will always remember.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "All-Star Game,Target Field,Todd Frazier,Troy Tulowitzki", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Hitting third in the All-Star Game is both an honor and a burden, but one Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki embraces.", "title": "Rockies' Troy Tulowitzki relishes hitting third in All-Star Game", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/15/rockies-troy-tulowitzki-relishes-hitting-third-star-game/18178/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/Tulo_homer-495x348.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Hitting third in the All-Star Game is both an honor and a burden, but one Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki embraces.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/15/rockies-troy-tulowitzki-relishes-hitting-third-star-game/18178/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/Tulo_homer-495x348.jpg", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Troy Tulowitzki relishes hitting third in All-Star Game", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Hitting third in the All-Star Game is both an honor and a burden, but one Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki embraces."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0293\"", "article_summary": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Hitting third in the All-Star Game is both an honor and a burden, but one Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki embraces.\n\u201cNot too many guys can say they hit third for an all-star team,\u201d Tulo said Tuesday, about three hours before the 85th All-Star Game at Target Field.\nMaybe I get some runners in scoring position and I make the most of it.\u201dThis is the fourth time Tulowitzki has been selected to the All-Star Game, but only the third time he\u2019ll play in the game.\n\u201cWhenever I think about the Home Run Derby, I think about my time as a kid, watching it on TV,\u201d he said.\nTulo didn\u2019t far particularly well in Monday night\u2019s Home Run Derby, getting bumped out in the second round by Cincinnati\u2019s Todd Frazier."}
