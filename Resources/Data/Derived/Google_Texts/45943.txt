Mother’s Day, which was held on May 10, tragically ended in a fatal shooting for one man in Atwater, California. Authorities say that the death occurred in a mobile home park near Herman Street, on Olive Avenue.

The man’s identity has been revealed as that of 22-year-old Matthew Tucker. According to his family, everything in their power was done to help their relative and get him somewhere that he would receive help in his life being saved. Their efforts were futile, however, and the man died after being transported to Mercy Medical Center.

As for the reason why this young individual was shot to death on Mother’s Day, all authorities are revealing at this point is that he was a documented gang member. They say that they will be vigoriously patrolling the aforementioned area on a regular basis as a result of the shooting, in case the situation escalates and whoever was involved comes back to hurt the man’s family or anyone else in association to whatever the conflict surrounded.
