If they land on damp soil, they\u2019ll take root and a new tree will start growing.\n\nBut Sharrow said that rarely happens in the park nowadays, thanks to human changes to the park and increased visitors.\n\nLevees built in the 1930s pen up the Virgin River and protect a paved road in Zion Canyon from damage during spring flooding.\n\nThat\u2019s kept soil dry.\n\nSoil along the riverbanks is too inhospitable for the trees to take root because the levees have left the Virgin River running straight and fast rather than slow and bendy.\n\n\u201cSo when the river floods, if any cottonwoods have grown, it takes them out,\u201d Sharrow said. \u201cIt washes away all the young seedlings.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade, the park has asked for $7 million in federal money to remove the levees and protect the road another way, but Zion has not received the money, Sharrow told KSL-TV (http://bit.ly/1SyQC1F ).\n\nHe said if Zion eventually gets money for the project, it may only solve part of the issue because the parks\u2019 unchecked deer population has been eating any cottonwood seedlings that do take hold.\n\nMountain lions, deer\u2019s national predators, tend to avoid the park because they don\u2019t like lots of people, Sharrow said.\n\nZion National Park sees about 3 million tourists a year.\n\nSharrow said the National Park Service has no plans to kill off deer, but without doing so, it may be impossible to stop the trees from dying off.\n\n\u201cThe scenic beauty of these cottonwoods along the stream is tremendous,\u201d Sharrow said. \u201cWe would really be a lesser park if we didn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KSL-TV, http://www.ksl.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cottonwood trees dotting the red rock landscape of southern Utah's Zion National Park could die out in 30 to 50 years, according to a National Park Service hydrologist.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cottonwood trees dotting the red rock landscape of southern Utah\u2019s Zion National Park could die out in 30 to 50 years, according to a National Park Service hydrologist.", "title": "Cottonwoods dotting Zion National Park dying out", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/cottonwoods-dotting-zion-national-park-dying-out/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/55ed008c5a1c8417770f6a706700c706.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/55ed008c5a1c8417770f6a706700c706.jpg", "description": "Cottonwood trees dotting the red rock landscape of southern Utah's Zion National Park could die out in 30 to 50 years, according to a National Park Service hydrologist.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cottonwoods dotting Zion National Park dying out"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ZION NATIONAL PARK, Utah (AP) - Cottonwood trees dotting the red rock landscape of southern Utah\u2019s Zion National Park could die out in 30 to 50 years, according to a National Park Service hydrologist.\nZion National Park sees about 3 million tourists a year.\nSharrow said the National Park Service has no plans to kill off deer, but without doing so, it may be impossible to stop the trees from dying off.\nLevees built in the 1930s pen up the Virgin River and protect a paved road in Zion Canyon from damage during spring flooding.\nBut Sharrow said that rarely happens in the park nowadays, thanks to human changes to the park and increased visitors."}
