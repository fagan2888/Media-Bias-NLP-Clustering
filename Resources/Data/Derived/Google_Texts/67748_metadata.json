Mike Pence.\n\nMeantime, the governor is still seeking a waiver to expand coverage as part of a larger state plan, called HIP 2.0, and he's going to Washington DC next week to negotiate.\n\nBut now one state lawmaker is criticizing the governor for not coming up with a plan sooner, or starting a state-based exchange instead.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back to the governor\u2019s reluctance and refusal to do what has been done in many other states,\u201d said state senate minority leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson.\n\n\u201cI stand by our decision not to establish a state based exchange in Indiana, the fact that a number of states have now begun to unwind is a confirmation of that,\u201d said Pence.\n\nBut also this week came dueling court rulings, which in the end, could mean people can't use government subsidies to buy health insurance on the federal exchanges, only the state-run exchanges, which Indiana doesn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cI hope it causes Congress to rethink Obamacare,\u201d said Pence. \u201cOrdering every American to purchase health insurance whether they want it or need it or not was the wrong idea to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere again, if from the beginning, we had an expansion of current Medicaid system if we had set up our own state exchanges as other states have done successfully, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that issue, would we?\u201d said Lanane.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing very good faith discussions with federal officials,\u201d said Pence. \u201cThe current plan, I\u2019m glad we were able to renew last year but obviously the need is much greater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had just put a plan into place sooner, we could have avoided these restrictions which now block the already limited number of HIP enrollees from the important health care access they need,\u201d said Lanane in a statement earlier this week. \u201cI appreciate the governor\u2019s recent commitment to working with the federal government on his new proposal, but once again, his indecision on how to expand health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act has left too many Hoosiers behind.\u201d\n\nGov. Mike Pence submitted paperwork to the federal government earlier this month to request a waiver allowing for the expansion of the Healthy Indiana Plan \u2013 but even the governor admits there\u2019s no way of knowing how long the process could take.\n\nThe governor wants to cover up to 350,000 uninsured Hoosiers, but it would take federal Medicaid money and approval from Washington, with local hospitals also helping out.\n\nSo how long could it take for the expanded plan to become a reality?\n\nOur intention will be to roll it out as soon as calendar year 2015 as is responsible,\u201d said Pence earlier this month. \u201cFrankly it\u2019s very difficult for us to estimate how long that deliberation by federal officials and how long our negotiations might take.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the negotiations, Pence said there were some items on which the state wasn\u2019t very willing to budge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made this very clear to federal officials, that any attempt by the federal government to eliminate or water down the consumer driven elements of this plan would cause the state of Indiana to reconsider,\u201d said Pence earlier this month. \u201cThis is not intended to be an entitlement, this is really intended to be a hand up not a hand out.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s no specific timetable for the federal government to respond, the governor says he\u2019s hoping his plan will eventually get approved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you want to enroll in the state's Healthy Indiana Plan, you're out of luck, at least for now.
