The tweets boasted about how he would completely repeal Obamacare and referenced Ted Cruz\u2019s outspoken support of Chief Justice John Roberts, who eventually voted to uphold Obamacare.\n\nAll five of Trump\u2019s tweets were sent via \u201cTwitter for iPhone\u201d \u2014 Twitter\u2019s app for Apple\u2019s most popular device, the iPhone.\n\nYou can see a screenshot above of one of the tweets from TweetDeck, which shows the source of tweets.\n\nIt is unclear who exactly Trump thinks should \u201cboycott Apple,\u201d but he apparently is not included.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Across America, US Patch", "description": "Trump tricked by Twitter tattle.", "title": "Donald Trump Calls For Apple Boycott -- Then Tweets From His iPhone", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/22859473/2016/02/T800x600/20160256c781e31d525.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/us/across-america/donald-trump-calls-apple-boycott-then-tweets-his-iphone-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2016-02-19T15:59:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T16:15:11-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Across America, US - Trump tricked by Twitter tattle.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7ef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBoycott Apple!\u201d Trump reportedly said in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, a day before the South Carolina Republican primary.\nIt is unclear who exactly Trump thinks should \u201cboycott Apple,\u201d but he apparently is not included.\nDonald Trump called Friday for a boycott of Apple until the tech giant agrees to help the FBI access information stored on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\nYou can see a screenshot above of one of the tweets from TweetDeck, which shows the source of tweets.\nAll five of Trump\u2019s tweets were sent via \u201cTwitter for iPhone\u201d \u2014 Twitter\u2019s app for Apple\u2019s most popular device, the iPhone."}
