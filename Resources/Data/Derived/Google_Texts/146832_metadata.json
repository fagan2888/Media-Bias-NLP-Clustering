That's what\u2019s so dangerous about this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe also know that they want to conduct an attack. But so does al Qaeda. And so now you have two competing terrorist organizations. Both of them want to get their credentials to the point where they can say, \u2018We are the premier terrorist organization.\u2019 Both want to conduct attacks in the West for that reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd guess what?\u201d he added. \u201cThat means we lose at the end. If either one ever those organizations is successful, we lose.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to concerns raised by Attorney-General Eric Holder recently about a rising terror threat from Yemen \u2013 \u201cone of the things that keeps him up at night. I would concur with him. That is an attack that many believe is going operational. And that is what we should be worried about.\u201d\n\nRogers said he believed the terrorist danger to the U.S. now is greater that before 9/11 because \u201cthe threat matrix is so wide. And it\u2019s so deep. We just didn't have that before 9/11.\u201d\n\nHe observed that ISIS controls territory the size of Indiana, possesses sophisticated weaponry and is reported to have \u201cas much as billion dollars in both precious metals, currency, and, by the way, selling oil on the black market to the tune of about a million dollars a day.\u201d\n\nRogers pointed to parallels between ISIS\u2019 viciousness and that of other terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of thing \u2013 beheading people, convert or die, burning religious relics from the past \u2013 just the sheer brutality of it is exactly what AQAP pitches. It\u2019s what Boko Haram [in Nigeria] pitches. When they took those 300 girls, that\u2019s what that was all about.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re practicing and putting into practice. That\u2019s why this policy of not dealing with it as an ecosystem, I think, is wrong and has caused the spread and danger of these organizations.\u201d\n\nSyria and Iraq \u2018one war\u2019\n\nRogers argued that the U.S. would not solve the problem of ISIS without confronting the terrorist group both in Iraq and in Syria.\n\n\u201cI think the president said they\u2019re not related. They are absolutely related,\u201d he said.\n\nRogers noted that the caliphate declared by ISIS in June has its envisaged capital in Syria (the northern city of Raqqa, which has been under ISIS control for more than a year), and took issue with any attempt to distinguish between the Iraq and Syria situations.\n\n\u201cTo say they\u2019re not related, I think just diminishes our opportunity for a strategic victory.\u201d\n\nU.S. F/A-18 fighter jets take off for mission in Iraq from the flight deck of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS George H.W.

(AP Photo/Hasan Jamali)\n\nPresident Obama this month authorized airstrikes against ISIS fighters in northern Iraq, and they continued Sunday in a bid to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces wrest Iraq\u2019s largest dam from the jihadists\u2019 control. The Pentagon said 14 strikes were carried out around the dam on Sunday, following nine the day before.\n\nBut Obama has long resisted calls to take similar measures against the same terrorist group in Syria \u2013 or indeed against any of the participants fighting in the Syrian civil war, including the Assad regime after it used chemical weapons against civilians a year ago this week.\n\nA key difference between the situations on two sides of the border \u2013 which remains legally in place even if ISIS has sought to erase it \u2013 is that attacking ISIS in Iraq helps U.S. allies in Erbil and Baghdad, whereas attacking ISIS in Syria would likely benefit Assad.\n\nRogers conceded that the situation in Syria was more complex now that it was earlier during the conflict there.\n\n\u201cThe options we had two-and-a-half years ago aren\u2019t the options of a year ago, certainly aren\u2019t the options that we have available today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDoes it mean that we can find and facilitate some of these [anti-Assad rebel] groups that would be at least more friendly to the United States? Absolutely. And it means that our Arab League partners, who have been asking for help for about two-and-a-half years on this problem, we can re-rally their cause against this growing threat [of] ISIL to, again, not only their regimes, but a clear and present danger to the United States.\u201d\n\nAppearing on Fox News Sunday, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued that what is taking place in Syria and Iraq is \u201cone war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Free Syria Army [the mainstream anti-Assad rebel group], whom we should have armed two years ago, is facing defeat, and they have called on us to bomb ISIS outside of Aleppo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we should consider doing it because this is one war. It\u2019s building from Syria into Iraq. The border is obliterated. There\u2019s no border anymore, and I think we need to fight ISIS wherever they rear their ugly heads.\u201d\n\nEngel recalled the way al-Qaeda was able to consolidate and plot against the U.S. in Afghanistan after the Soviet occupation there ended, while \u201cwe just sort of looked the other way and didn\u2019t really focus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we allow ISIS to get stronger, and stronger, if they take Aleppo, it\u2019s the end of the Free Syria Army and also would mean that ISIS would have essentially a no-man\u2019s land in Syria through Iraq, to plot and plan attacks on our homeland.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "(CNSNews.com) \u2013 The terrorist threat facing the United States is greater now than it was before 9/11 and th", "title": "Rogers: Competing Terror Groups Multiply Danger to U.S.", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/rogers-competing-terror-groups-multiply-danger-us", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/images/ISIS-video1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-18T04:36:12-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T19:28:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T04:36:12-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "(CNSNews.com) \u2013 The terrorist threat facing the United States is greater now than it was before 9/11 and th", "title": "Rogers: Competing Terror Groups Multiply Danger to U.S.", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/rogers-competing-terror-groups-multiply-danger-us", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/images/ISIS-video1.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "(CNSNews.com) \u2013 The terrorist threat facing the United States is greater now than it was before 9/11 and th", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThousands of individuals now signing up with ISIL to fight their jihad in Syria and Iraq have Western passports.\n\u201cDoes it mean that we can find and facilitate some of these [anti-Assad rebel] groups that would be at least more friendly to the United States?\nRogers conceded that the situation in Syria was more complex now that it was earlier during the conflict there.\nIt\u2019s building from Syria into Iraq.\nAnd so now you have two competing terrorist organizations."}
