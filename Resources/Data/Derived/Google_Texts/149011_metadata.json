But that didn\u2019t stop Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz from labeling it an act of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe murderous rampage by 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and his 27-year-old wife, Tashfeen Malik, which ended when both were shot to death by police as they exchanged gunfire in a residential neighborhood, might well have been an act of terrorism.\n\nRelated: Did Donald trump Just Break Facebook? And Maybe Periscope?\n\nIt might also have been a particularly horrible act of workplace violence \u2013 Farook appears to have worked with many of the victims, and had reportedly left the gathering where the shooting took place in anger not long before the attack.\n\nIt might have been a hideous combination of the two \u2013 an act of terror meant to send a political message enacted against people with whom the perpetrators had a personal grudge. The point is that we don\u2019t know.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop Cruz, the first of 14 Republican presidential candidates scheduled to appear before the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington, from drawing a direct line between the shootings and violent jihadists.\n\nHe began with an acknowledgement that all the facts are not known. \u201cAt this point, the details of what happened in San Bernardino are still unclear. But our prayers are with the families of those who were murdered, of those who were shot. And all of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump May Be Losing the Media. He Also Might Not Need it Anymore\n\nHowever, he quickly went from doubt about the cause of the shooting to certainty.\n\n\u201cComing on the wake of a terror attack in Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not the current administration realizes it or is wiling to acknowledge it, our enemies are at war with us, and I believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it.\u201d\n\nIt was a neat trick, to move from uncertainty to proof in the matter of a few seconds, and the audience ate up Cruz\u2019s tough-guy stance against terrorism. But on a broader stage, exhibiting a willingness to rush to judgment might not be the best look for a presidential candidate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As of Thursday morning, there was no reliable public information available about the m", "title": "Cruz: San Bernardino Attack Shows U.S. Is \u2018At War\u2019 with \u2018Radical Islam\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Cruz-San-Bernardino-Attack-Shows-US-War-Radical-Islam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Cruz-San-Bernardino-Attack-Shows-US-War-Radical-Islam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As of Thursday morning, there was no reliable public information available about the m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cComing on the wake of a terror attack in Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war,\u201d he said.\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop Cruz, the first of 14 Republican presidential candidates scheduled to appear before the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington, from drawing a direct line between the shootings and violent jihadists.\nAnd all of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home.\u201dRelated: Trump May Be Losing the Media.\n\u201cAt this point, the details of what happened in San Bernardino are still unclear.\nBut on a broader stage, exhibiting a willingness to rush to judgment might not be the best look for a presidential candidate."}
