McHugh Senior Apartments, built at Roosevelt Road and Loomis Street on the Near West Side.\n\n\"Sister Katie had a sense of wanting things to be fair for people, and that was one of the great motivators for her,\" said Sister Teri Hadro, the president of the Sister of Charity in Dubuque, Iowa. \"She would never let go of a good idea.\"\n\nSister McHugh, 89, died of kidney failure Thursday, Sept. 25 while in hospice care in the Mount Carmel retirement home for nuns in Dubuque, Iowa, said her niece, Mary Schneider. She had lived in Dubuque since 2009.\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1925 to Irish immigrant parents, Sister McHugh grew up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and attended St. Mary's High School on the West Side.\n\nIn January 1942, Sister McHugh joined the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and spent 2 1/2 years in the novitiate before being sent to teach primary grades at a school in Davenport, Iowa. Over the next 20 years or so, she earned a bachelor's degree from St. Ambrose University in Davenport and then a master's degree in education administration and supervision from Marquette University.\n\nSister McHugh moved to Chicago in 1951, where she taught first-graders at St. Eugene's parish for six years. She then taught eighth grade for two years in Chicago before returning to eastern Iowa, where she served for close to a decade as a principal at two schools.\n\nAfter a brief teaching stint in Maywood, Sister McHugh spent three years as the Blessed Virgin Mary's elementary personnel director. In 1972, she became director of Catholic Charities' Howard Area Community Center, which assists the marginalized and elderly.\n\nFollowing that, Sister McHugh worked as the order's representative at the Eighth Day Center for Peace and Justice and also was a founding member and volunteer with Illinois Citizens for Better Care, a group that was created to implement the Illinois Nursing Home Reform Act of 1979.\n\n\"Sister Katie was an innovator among Catholic sisters,\" Hadro said. \"She took the social justice message of the gospel seriously. And she was a connector, too \u2014 she believed that people working together could do infinitely more than working separately.\"\n\nWhile with Illinois Citizens for Better Care, Sister McHugh worked as an advocate for nursing home residents. Volunteers in the group represented \"a resident's point of view to see that they have every opportunity to speak up for what they want,\" Sister McHugh told the Tribune in 1980.\n\n\"She was probably one of the first persons to recognize that senior citizens in care facilities were not being treated fairly, so her work for Illinois Citizens for Better Care was to lobby on behalf of senior citizens' rights, especially in nursing homes,\" Hadro said.\n\nIn 1979, Sister McHugh recruited Sunny Lopez, now the director of mission integration at Bethany Methodist Communities, to be a volunteer for Illinois Citizens for Better Care. Lopez later remained with the group as a staffer.\n\n\"I remember Katie as a feisty, committed leader and advocate for the marginalized who was relentless in her commitment to serving those in need,\" Lopez said. \"Katie was a voice for the powerless and she stood up to some pretty powerful folks on some significant issues that impacted quality of care.\"\n\nLopez also recalled Sister McHugh as a \"teacher at heart.\"\n\n\"Our group was very much about education and educating nursing home residents and their families as to their rights and options,\" Lopez said.\n\nSister McHugh broadened her focus to women's issues in 1983, when she began a six-year stint serving as a regional representative for the order. Another group she was a part of, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, created the Intercommunity Retirement Network in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1989, Sister McHugh became the group's executive director, focusing her energies on what she saw was a lack of suitable housing for retired nuns and priests.\n\n\"There is a myth that nuns have all the housing they want,\" she told the Tribune in 1992. \"This is simply not the case. In fact, the situation is close to a crisis.\"\n\nIn 1993, Sister McHugh began working as the president of the Intercommunity Housing Corp., addressing affordable housing for the aging religious. The Chicago Archdiocese originally had promised the group some land for a housing project, but the group couldn't raise enough private capital.\n\nInstead, working with trial lawyer Ed Joyce, a member of the organization's board, Sister McHugh made contact with Mayor Richard M. Daley, who helped the group secure a site at the corner of Roosevelt Road and Loomis Street.\n\nHousing retired members of religious orders and lay individuals, the 68-unit building opened in 2006 as Roosevelt Place and was renamed the McHugh Senior Center in 2008.\n\n\"She had five years of running into walls, and nothing ever stopped her,\" said Joyce, who also assisted in fundraising and guaranteeing some debt and construction costs for the project. \"She was always open to a new solution. She was never like, 'Oh, we've never done it that way before.' Instead, she'd say, 'Fine, let's work around it and find a different solution.'\"\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, Sister McHugh was an important force behind a collaborative study with the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center to study Alzheimer's in older religious clergy members, including nuns and priests.\n\nHer work involved securing a grant for the study and persuading members of religious orders to have medical and psychological evaluations each year and to donate their brains after death for further study. Through Sister McHugh, the center enlisted more than 40 different religious orders and began the study in 1994.\n\n\"Our study has been funded continuously and still goes on through the National Institute on Aging. She really helped get something very big off the ground,\" said David Bennett, the center's director.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sister Catherine McHugh, active in elderly issues, dies", "date": "2014-10-26", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Sister Catherine Elizabeth \"Katie\" McHugh spent decades as a teacher and leader in Chicago's Catholic organizations, and was a force for change in areas such as nursing home care, equitable housing and health care.", "title": "Sister Catherine McHugh, active in elderly issues, dies", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-catherine-mchugh-obituary-met-20141026-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56f02a81/turbine/chi-default-open-graph-ct-logo/1200/1200x650", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81787520", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Catholic Nuns, Elder care, Nursing homes, housing, obituary, death", "news_keywords": "Catholic Nuns, Elder care, Nursing homes, housing, obituary, death", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Sister Catherine McHugh was active in elderly care and equitable housing issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19a0\"", "article_summary": "After a brief teaching stint in Maywood, Sister McHugh spent three years as the Blessed Virgin Mary's elementary personnel director.\nSister McHugh moved to Chicago in 1951, where she taught first-graders at St. Eugene's parish for six years.\nSister McHugh broadened her focus to women's issues in 1983, when she began a six-year stint serving as a regional representative for the order.\nWhile with Illinois Citizens for Better Care, Sister McHugh worked as an advocate for nursing home residents.\nBorn in Chicago in 1925 to Irish immigrant parents, Sister McHugh grew up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and attended St. Mary's High School on the West Side."}
