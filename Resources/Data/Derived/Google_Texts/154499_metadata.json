Rand Paul tries to get his name on the ballot in 2016 in both his race for re-election and in the race for president.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear,\u201d Ms. Grimes told WHAS-11. \u201cYou can\u2019t be on the ballot twice for two offices.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Kentucky law says a candidate cannot appear twice on the same ballot \u2014 something Mr. Paul could have to work around through either a legal challenge, or if the state Republican party changes the presidential nominating contest to a caucus instead of a primary.\n\nMr. Paul is openly considering a run for president, but has only officially announced he intends to seek a second term in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI will not be bullied,\u201d Ms. Grimes said. \u201cI think hopefully the people of Kentucky understand that over the course of this past year, and I will not hesitate to seek help and assistance in the opinion of a court.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky state House is controlled by Democrats and has blocked efforts by the state Senate, controlled by the GOP, to change the law.\n\nMs. Grimes was defeated by soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the race for the state\u2019s other U.S. Senate seat last month.\n\nDoug Stafford, executive director of Mr. Paul\u2019s political action committee, told the Lexington Herald-Leader it was \u201cgood to see her still fighting after such a huge loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, since she is talking again, she can finally say whether or not she voted for President Obama,\u201d Mr. Stafford said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes pledged a legal battle if GOP Sen.
