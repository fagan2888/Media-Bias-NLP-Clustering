It\u2019s one of the most powerful public tools available to any American politician. And it\u2019s free.\n\nThank their good friend so-and-so in front of a large crowd. It\u2019s a predictable staple of Barack Obama\u2019s repetitive rhetoric nowadays.\n\nIn fact, next to telling his audience to be seated and mentioning himself a few dozen times, uttering an endless list of acknowledgments is how the former Real Good Talker begins most speeches\u2013mayors, Congress members, principals, a local organizer he never met until two minutes before.\n\nSo, it was unusually revealing Tuesday afternoon that an ebullient Obama launched his ObamaCare \u2018enrollment\u2019 victory lap in the White House Rose Garden with not one single acknowledgment. He was not going to share this self-congratulatory moment with anyone.\n\n\u201cFour-score and seven years ago,\u201d the Democrat began. No, not really. But he used the same construction. \u201cSix months ago today, a big part of the Affordable Care Act kicked in as healthcare.gov and state insurance marketplaces went live,\u201d Obama intoned. (Scroll down for C-SPAN video of the full remarks.)\n\nObviously, Obama did not describe exactly how six months ago the healthcare.gov website went live\u2013by dropping dead. But he announced to the properly enthusiastic crowd of staffers that 7.1 million people had enrolled. (Applause)\n\nThe photo op was added to Obama\u2019s daily schedule only after assurances that his namesake legislative program had reached the goal his Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, had naively set back in September. Imagine how heroic Obama could have appeared now if she\u2019d low-balled estimates by saying they hoped to enroll maybe four million, five max.\n\nStill unrevealed by this most transparent administration in history is what these 7.1 million people have done and who they are: How many have really enrolled by paying? How many were previously uninsured? How many are merely grabbing at ObamaCare because their previous satisfactory plans were canceled?\n\nObama declared ObamaCare is here to stay, dismissing rising premiums as normal, although he promised they\u2019d decline, and criticism of the law\u2019s flaws as the normal mess of democracy. This law, said the president, who\u2019s exempt, \u201cis working.\u201d\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way through his 2,200-words Obama apparently had second thoughts about taking all the credit.\n\nHe thanked \u201call the members of Congress who are here today.\u201d He thanked \u201ccountless Americans who fought tirelessly to pass this law, and who organized like crazy these past few months to help their fellow citizens just get the information they needed.\u201d\n\nThen, Obama thanked two \u2014 and only two \u2014 people by name \u2014 ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said we\u2019d have to pass the bill to learn what was in it. And he thanked Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. Strangely, Obama did not thank the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Harry Reid, who runs that place for the moment.\n\nEven more striking, however, Obama did not even mention Sebelius, the face of this long, painful implementation struggle. Not one word, though she was sitting right in front of him.\n\nIn his best-seller \u201cThe Amateur\u201d (that\u2019s what Bill Clinton called Obama in private), Edward Klein describes Obama\u2019s legendary lack of gratitude among fellow Democrats and donors back in Chicago, where the president travels today to accept more campaign money.\n\nSebelius knows how this game of politics can be played. Her father, John Gilligan, was a one-term governor of Ohio, and she was governor of Kansas for six years until Obama plucked her from Topeka to try to run the cumbersome HHS. She\u2019s been with him every loyal step of these endless 1,897 days.\n\nSebelius has absorbed tons of congressional abuse, including Sen. Max Baucus, an ObamaCare architect covering his own caboose, predicting to her face that the healthcare program\u2019s roll-out would be \u201ca huge train wreck.\u201d\n\nSebelius has endured mocking and audience laughter on \u2018The Daily Show.\u2019 She took the fall for Obama during the doomed roll-out by professing to a CNN reporter that Obama knew nothing of the malfunctioning website for days after Oct. 1. Seriously? The cabinet secretary didn\u2019t mention to her boss the unfolding disaster that would make him a serial liar?\n\nSure, she made some gaffes, as all public officials do. With TV cameras rolling at a Florida photo op, Sebelius cheerily asked one ObamaCare navigator what she was doing. The worker\u2019s reply: She couldn\u2019t anything because the healthcare.gov website had crashed again.\n\nAsked if she was going to resign in those anguishing days early last October, Sebelius told reporters the people she worked for were quite satisfied with her job performance. Later, she apologetically explained that she knew she really works for the American people.\n\nIf Washington was the Kremlin, Pyongyang or Chicago, such a glaring public omission of praise for a senior aide by the supreme leader would be a sure sign she was on the way out the door of the office or airplane. We\u2019ll soon see.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama unintentionally added a moment of humor to his self-celebration of how easily ObamaCare allegedly reached 7.1 million enrollment: \u201cWe didn\u2019t make a hard sell.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nHere\u2019s why ObamaCare\u2019s \u2018enrollment\u2019 number is meaningless\n\nDespite Obama promises, thousands of vets die awaiting benefits\n\nWhy both jobs and the economy grow better under GOP governors\n\nWho you gonna believe about their Vatican meeting, Obama or the Pope?\n\nVideo courtesy of C-SPAN.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Acknowledgment from the podium.
