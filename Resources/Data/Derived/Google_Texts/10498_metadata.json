He was also the force behind the \u201cPray Without Ceasing Political Party.\u201d\n\nTwyman has organized other protests and notably claimed that God unleashed a magnitude 5.8 earthquake on the east coast in August 2011 to get lawmakers focused on job creation and a lagging economy.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Beyonce is his target.\n\n\u201cSuperstar Beyonce raised millions for President Obama during his 2012 campaign,\u201d Twyman said in a news release, noting that his group plans on \u201curging her to use her enormous influence with youth to get them signed up (for Obamacare) before the December 23 deadline.\u201d\n\nTwyman and company said they \u201cintend to bring healthcare.gov forms with us to be distributed to the loyal youthful fans that will be present waiting in in line to see the diva.\u201d\n\nSome of the signage you might see outside the Verizon Center?\n\n\u201cBeyonce, Obamacare is in Deep Trouble\u201d\n\n\u201cUse Your Clout to Get Your Youthful Fans Enrolled\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z Help President Obama\u2019s Divinely Inspired healthcare Plan Succeed\u201d\n\nIn addition, Politico noted that Twyman says he \u201ctakes issue with Christian politicians who are against providing low cost health care for 40 million people. They have forgotten the golden rule. The Bible specifically states that God wants us all to prosper and be in good health.\u201d\n\n(H/T: Weasel Zippers)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "If you're headed to Beyonce's gig in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, you might spot some folks carrying picket signs outside and taking issue with an aspect of the pop superstar's performance.
