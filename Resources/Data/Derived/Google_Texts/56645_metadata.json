You can\u2019t just be an outsider. You can\u2019t just be someone who throws stones at Washington. You have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.\n\nI can do that, I will do that if I have the chance to lead this party.\n\nHARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.\n\nSenator Graham.\n\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, thank you for having me here tonight.\n\nHow about a round of applause for Boulder, Colorado?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is a beautiful place.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGRAHAM: Looking at their academic standards, the only way I could have gotten into this university is to be invited to this debate tonight.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRAHAM: But here\u2019s my take on things. Without national security, there is no economic security. Without the sacrifice of the veteran, all of our hopes and dreams are at risk.\n\nJust a few days ago, Hillary Clinton said that the problems with the V.A. are being exaggerated by Republicans. They are not, they are real.\n\nHARDWOOD: Senator Graham, thank you very much. Becky?\n\nQUICK: Governor Jindal, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the news of the day. Just a few hours ago, the Republicans and the Democrats in the House voted on a budget deal that will increase spending by about $80 billion dollars over the next two years. You, however, have called the Republicans who have been willing to work with the Democrats to do things like this the, \u201cSurrender Party of the Republican caucus.\u201d\n\nWould you have shut the government down instead?\n\nJINDAL: Well, look, I think that\u2019s a false choice. I think this is a very bad deal. Whenever they tell us in D.C. they\u2019re going to cut tomorrow, that means they\u2019re never going to cut. Tomorrow never seems to happen. Instead, why don\u2019t we actually follow our conservative principles? Why not insist on structural reforms? Why not cut spending?\n\nI don\u2019t mean strength (ph) the growth rate, I mean, actually spend less. Why not a balanced budget in the amendment \u2014 an amendment to the Constitution? Why not a super-majority vote before they grow our taxes, before they grow the government faster than the economy?\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, $18 trillion dollars of debt. Record low participation rate in the workforce, record number of Americans on food stamps. We are going the way of Europe. The left is trying to turn the American Dream into the European Nightmare. If you\u2019re a Republican...\n\nQUICK: ...But Governor...\n\nJINDAL: ...(INAUDIBLE) willing to stand up and fight...\n\nQUICK: ...if you didn\u2019t have a choice, if you didn\u2019t control things in the house, would you take the choice of shutting things down, or would you go ahead and agree with them?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJINDAL: I think that\u2019s a false choice. If I were \u2014 I were to lead, we would pass a conservative budget, challenge the President to do the right thing. And, here\u2019s the problem, the Republicans never want to fight. Give Pelosi and Reed credit, they forced Obamacare and socialism down our throats, why won\u2019t the Republicans fight half as hard for freedom and opportunity. This was a bad budget.\n\nQUICK: Governor, thank you.\n\nPATAKI: Becky, can I comment on this question?\n\nHARDWOOD: Just hold on, Governor Pataki, we\u2019re going to go to Senator Graham on this question because we believe you are likely to be the only person on this stage tonight who supports this budget deal. Now, you just heard Governor Jindal say that it\u2019s a phony deal, it doesn\u2019t do anything, and people like you are surrendering rather than fighting by supporting it. Why is he wrong?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, let me tell you what is real. The threat to our homeland. I\u2019ve never seen so many threats to our homeland than I do today. Barack Obama is an incompetent Commander in Chief. There are more terrorist organizations with safe havens to attack the American homeland than anytime since 9/11. We\u2019re in the process of reducing our defense spending by half.\n\nI am looking at this budget with one view in mind, will it restore the ability to defend this nation. We\u2019re on track to have the smallest army since 1940, the smallest navy since 1915, this budget, if it is paid for, will put $40 billion dollars back in the defense department at a time we need it.\n\nThe number one role of the federal government\u2019s to defend this nation, I intend to be a Commander in Chief that can win a war we cannot afford to lose.\n\nHARDWOOD: Thank you, Senator Graham...\n\nPATAKI: ...John, can I quickly comment on this one...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARWOOD: ...Governor, we\u2019re going to get to you in just a moment, we\u2019re going to try to keep this shorter...\n\nPATAKI: ...But, I want to speak on this issue...\n\nQUINTANILLA: ...Question, in the meantime, for Senator Santorum. You have advocated a flat tax, so we\u2019d like to ask you about fairness. Why is it fair to tax all Americans at the same rate, as opposed to taxing more affluent Americans at higher rates?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSANTORUM: Well, if you look at my flat tax, it actually takes the best of what Steve Forbes, Art Laffer (ph), many have been advocating for a long time, which is a very strong pro-growth tax code \u2014 very simple. And, it adjusts it to make sure that it is not regressive.\n\nWe have a $2,750 per person tax credit \u2014 that\u2019s $2,750 off the taxes due, not a deduction, a credit. And, we think \u2014 in fact, if you run the numbers, no American who\u2019s going to be paying more taxes under our proposal, so, we\u2019ve accomplished both.\n\nWe have a system that has a low single rate, but we take care of American families. I\u2019m talking about $2,750 per person. That means a family four, that\u2019s $11,000 dollar tax credit. That\u2019s a very, very strong pro-family \u2014 and if you looked at the Wall Street Journal today, and so many of the publications that have been out there, they\u2019ve talked about how the biggest problem of the hollowing out of the middle of this country. For workers to be able to raise is actually, the breakdown of the American family.\n\nWilliam Galston (ph), a liberal, said that on the pages of the Wall Street Journal today that the key to poverty is families. So, we put forth a pro-growth \u2014 Steve Forbes plan, combined it with a pro- family plan, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s going to work out, and work effectively.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John \u2014 Becky?\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki, let\u2019s get to your point. You wanted to make a comment on the budget. You want to get in on the idea, what would you do if you were in Washington? Would you compromise...\n\nPATAKI: ...I think it was a bad deal, but I would have voted for it for a very simple reason. Barack Obama is the first president in American history to hold our military hostage. He knew that we needed funding for overseas contingency operations, $40 million dollars that would go to support our troops. And, he was prepared, and had vetoed it, unless this deal went through.\n\nI have two sons, they both served overseas. One in Iraq, and one in Afghanistan, and I understand that we have got to do far more to help our military, help our veterans, and help protect our security. This is a bad deal, but to protect our military, I would have signed it. Uh, it\u2019s not going to be the case, if I have a chance to lead this country, we\u2019re going to reduce the deficit, shrink the government, lower the tax burden and grow the private sector because that\u2019s how you solve deficits.\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki, thank you.\n\nJohn?\n\nPATAKI: Thank you.\n\nHARWOOD: Governor Jindal, a question about fiscal policy, especially since you noted that this deal doesn\u2019t solve the long-term debt situation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen you came into office with a budget surplus in the state of Louisiana, now, years later, the state legislature faced a $1.6 billion budget gap and the Republican state treasurer called one of your approaches to that problem \u201cnonsense on a stick,\u201d quoting him.\n\nAre you going to do for the federal budget what you did for the Louisiana budget?\n\nJINDAL: Absolutely, Jhon. And what we did is we cut state spending. We\u2019ve cut our budget 26 percent, according to Cato and other analysis, the only candidate that\u2019s actually reduced government spending.\n\nLook, the left always complains there\u2019s not enough money for government. We have 30,000 fewer state employees than the day I took office, eight credit upgrades, we\u2019re a top 10 state for private sector job creation.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a choice. You grow the government economy or the American economy. When I became governor, we had 25 years in a row of outmigration. We were coming back from Katrina. The question many were asking, will Louisiana rebuild, should Louisiana rebuild?\n\nSeven years in a row, more people moving into the state than were leaving the state.\n\nWe now have more people working than ever before, erg a higher income than ever before.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve reduced the size of government. That\u2019s exactly what we need to do in DC. In DC, the Republicans slowed the growth rate, they claimed victory. That\u2019s not enough.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest with where we are today. We are running off of a cliff. Look, we\u2019ll be the next Greece and we can talk and we can rearrange the chairs. Over over $18 trillion of debt, no wonder our economy has been stagnant. We haven\u2019t had real growth.\n\nIf you\u2019re a young student here, you\u2019ve not seen a robust American economy.\n\nHARWOOD: But Governor Jindal, as you know, many Republicans are opposed to the approach that you\u2019ve taken in Louisiana. They complain that you have tried so hard to avoid anything that could be called a tax increase so that you could run for president saying you\u2019d never raised taxes, David Vitter, the Republican who\u2019s now running to succeed you, has told voters, I won\u2019t be like Jindal, I\u2019m not using the governorship as a stepping stone to higher office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJINDAL: Well, Jhon, a couple of things.\n\nNot only did we not raise taxes, we did the largest income tax cut in the state\u2019s history. And I\u2019m proud of that record. I think that\u2019s the kind of leadership voters want in DC.\n\nLook, if you want a Republican that\u2019s going go grow government spending, if you want a \u2014 a president or if you want a candidate who\u2019s going to income taxes, I\u2019m not your guy.\n\nIf you want somebody that\u2019s going to do and say the things that can\u2019t be said, can\u2019t be done, I\u2019m asking a vote for me to join my cause. That\u2019s how dangerous these times are. This is \u2014 this is a \u2014 this is \u2014 these are dangerous times for America. I think we have a chance to rescue the idea of America, but if we don\u2019t do it now, four years will be too late from now.\n\nSo, yes, I\u2019m proud we cut taxes, we cut spending, 30,000 fewer state government bureaucrats than the day I took office. I absolutely will do that in DC.\n\nHARWOOD: Governor Jindal, thank you.\n\nJINDAL: Thank you.\n\nHARWOOD: We\u2019re going to take a quick break.\n\nThe Republican presidential debate continues live from Boulder, Colorado in a moment.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nQUINTANILLA: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live in boulder, Colorado, on cNBC. We resume our questions now with Jim Cramer, the host of cNBC\u2019s Mad Money.\n\nCRAMER: Thank you. Governor Pataki, in the wake of the Sony hack last year, you said, quote, \u201cat the very least, we should declare cyber-war on North Korea.\u201d\n\nWhat does a cyber-war look like? And if our companies are getting attacked by foreign governments, do we need a military response?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPATAKI: No, I don\u2019t think we need a military response, but we need a coordinated response. And I have to say that I think the Obama administration has been completely lax, to say the least, in dealing with these cyber-attacks, not just by governments like North Korea, but by, particularly, Chinese and other companies.\n\nAnd what I would do is put in place a policy where if we know a company, say, a Chinese company, is hacking into American companies, stealing trade secrets, as we know they do every day, we will retaliate against that company and say that that company\u2019s not going to be allowed to continue to do trade with the United States.\n\nI would also look at what we\u2019re doing at the federal level and put in place what Israel has done: a \u2014 one federal agency dealing with cybersecurity and charged with working across silos to make sure we have the best technology.\n\nAnd, Jim, I\u2019ve gotta tell you something, talking about cybersecurity. Hillary Clinton put a server, an unsecure server, in her home as secretary of state. We have no doubt that that was hacked, and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and others.\n\nThat alone should disqualify her from being president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRAMER: Senator Graham, you\u2019re a hawk. Was that tough enough?\n\nGRAHAM: Here\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re being walked all over because our commander in chief is weak in the eyes of our enemies. Do you think Putin would be in the Ukraine today if Ronald Reagan were president? Why are the Chinese stealing our intellectual property, hacking into our system? Why are they building islands over resource-rich waters? Because they can get away with it.\n\nAt the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, the foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be replaced, and the last person you want to find to replace his foreign policy is his secretary of state.\n\nSo to the Chinese, when it comes to dealing with me, you\u2019ve got a clenched fist or an open hand. You pick. The party\u2019s over, to all the dictators. Make me commander-in-chief and this crap stops.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRAMER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSenator Santorum. We know that a troubling amount of air pollution on the west coast comes from China. Should we enact a pollution tax on products imported from China and give our manufacturers a level playing field?\n\nSANTORUM: What we should be \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be putting tariffs on anything. That hurts working men and women in this country. What we should be doing is making our manufacturing more competitive.\n\nOne of the reasons I introduced the 20/20 plan, a 20 percent flat tax on corporations, as well as on individuals, is so we can be competitive, so we can bring those manufacturing jobs back.\n\nYou want to talk about cutting pollution? You do a little back- of-the-envelope. We \u2014 we produce, per dollar of GDP, about one-fifth of the CO2 and other pollutants that China produces. So we\u2019re five times more efficient in producing goods here, as far as the environment \u2014 environment is concerned.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we \u2014 if we really want to tackle environmental problems, global warming, what we need to do is take those jobs from China and bring them back here to the United States, employ workers in this country.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost two million jobs \u2014 two million jobs \u2014 under this administration in manufacturing \u2014 15,000 manufacturers have left this country. Why? Because of bad tax policy, bad regulatory policy and, yes, bad trade policy.\n\nWe need to have a president that\u2019s going to pledge, as I have \u2014 I\u2019m going to make America the number-one manufacturer so working men and women can have good paying jobs again in America.\n\nCRAMER: Thank you, Senator. John?\n\nHARWOOD: Governor Jindal, Senator Santorum just raised the issue of corporate taxes, and cutting corporate taxes is very popular in your party because our rate, at 35 percent, is one of the highest in the world. But nobody has figured out how to identify a set of loopholes that would allow that tax rate to be lowered. So can you tell us specifically what loopholes you\u2019d do away with?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJINDAL: Absolutely, John. I\u2019d go further. My tax plan, like everybody\u2019s, like a lot of Republicans\u2019 \u2014 look, I\u2019d get rid of the death penalty and the marriage penalty, and I\u2019d simplify the brackets to 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent, so that an average middle-class family \u2014 a teacher marries a law enforcement official (ph)...\n\nHARWOOD: We\u2019re talking corporate taxes.\n\nJINDAL: ...I \u2014 I\u2019m gonna get that. Pays 25 percent today, would pay 10 percent under my plan. But my plan does three things different from other people\u2019s plans.\n\nOne \u2014 remember, I said 2 percent. I think everybody should pay something, even if it\u2019s only 2 percent. That\u2019s the most important 2 percent in my plan.\n\nI know a lot of Republicans brag \u2014 y\u2019all can clap, it doesn\u2019t scare me. Go ahead. I heard some people.\n\nThere are millions of \u2014 there are millions of folks that wouldn\u2019t pay taxes in Jeb\u2019s plan and Trump\u2019s plan. I think that\u2019s a mistake.\n\nIn terms of the corporate tax, secondly, I\u2019d get rid of the corporate tax. We do have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. I\u2019d get rid of it. I\u2019d get rid of all the corporate welfare. Make the CEOs pay their same tax rates the way the rest of us do.\n\nAnd third, I\u2019d purposely shrink the size of government. You know, that is a \u2014 that is an intentional feature of my plan. We\u2019ve got a choice: do we grow government \u2014 the government economy, or the American economy?\n\nSo I say get rid of the corporate tax, bring those jobs and investment here to the United States, stop sending jobs and investment overseas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHARWOOD: Thanks, Governor. Becky?\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s happened on Wall Street. Some of your colleagues in the Republican Party, including some of the people on this stage, have bashed Wall Street. They say that it was largely responsible for the financial crisis.\n\nYou\u2019re a former governor of New York, and you relied very heavily on Wall Street for income. Do you think they\u2019ve gone too far?\n\nPATAKI: I think they have gone too far. I think we\u2019ve seen Wall Street really blossom and do very well while the rest of the country is struggling, and it\u2019s because we have this corrupt connection between Wall Street and Washington.\n\nAnd, John, you were just talking about what loopholes would you get rid of. I would get rid of virtually every single one of them. They cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion a year. I would throw them all out.\n\nHARWOOD: So the tax credit right now that we have for domestic manufacturing, which manufacturers say is...\n\nPATAKI: No, I wouldn\u2019t. I was going to say...\n\nHARWOOD: ...important, you would get rid of that?\n\nPATAKI: ...no, I would keep \u2014 first, yes, but what I would do is ii would lower the tax on manufacturing to the lowest in the developed world \u2014 12 percent.\n\nWe all have plans. I have a plan. We all have plans. My plan, the Tax Foundation said, would create five and a half million new jobs over the next decade.\n\nThe difference, though, is I will get my plan enacted because, when I was governor of New York, I passed sweeping tax code \u2014 cuts in a Democratic state with a Democratic legislature.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI \u2014 you know, Bobby, you\u2019re talking about your tax cuts? I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage, more than everybody on the next stage, combined. By more than the other 49 states, in New York state.\n\nI don\u2019t just have a plan. I will enact tax cuts, get rid of those loopholes and make the system fairer for all Americans.\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki, thank you.\n\nPATAKI: Thank you.\n\nQUICK: Carl?\n\nQUINTANILLA: Senator Graham. You have said you believe that climate change is real. You\u2019ve said you accept tax increases as part of a budget deal with Democrats. You\u2019ve co-sponsored a Senate immigration bill providing a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally.\n\nAre you in the wrong party\u2019s debate?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRAHAM: No, I \u2014 I think I\u2019m trying to solve problems that somebody had better solve.\n\nNow, you don\u2019t have to believe that climate change is real. I have been to the Antarctic. I\u2019ve been to Alaska. I\u2019m not a scientist, and I\u2019ve got the grades to prove it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I\u2019ve talked to the climatologists of the world, and 90 percent of them are telling me that greenhouse gas effect is real. That we\u2019re heating up the planet. I just want a solution that would be good for the economy, that doesn\u2019t destroy it.\n\nI want to fix an immigration system. I\u2019m not gonna tell you, if you like your doctor, you can keep it \u2014 keep him. Do you like your health care, you\u2019re gonna keep it. I\u2019m tired of telling people things that they want to hear, that we know we\u2019re not gonna do.\n\nWe\u2019re not gonna eliminate the corporate tax. But we can make it lower. We\u2019re going to fix immigration, only if we work together. I want to secure the border because, if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to get hurt and hit again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI want to fix a broken visa system. I want to increase legal immigration, because we\u2019re gonna have a shortage of workers over time. As to the 11 million, I want to talk about fixing the problem. We\u2019re not going to deport 11 million people and their legal citizen children.\n\nBut we will deport felons. And those who stay will have to learn our language to stay, because I don\u2019t speak it well but look how far I\u2019ve come.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRAHAM: At the end of the day, folks, I am trying to solve a problem and win an election. I am tired of losing.\n\nGood God, look who we\u2019re running against. The number one candidate on the other side thought she was flat broke after her and her husband were in the White House for eight years. The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don\u2019t think he ever came back.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIf we don\u2019t beat these people, who the hell are we going to beat?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator, you\u2019re well over your minute but thank you for that.\n\nWe will be back from Boulder, Colorado, in just a moment.\n\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\n\nQUICK: Welcome back, everyone. This is the Republican Presidential Debate on CNBC, live from the University of Colorado.\n\nSenator Santorum, I\u2019d like to go to you. You have talked an awful lot about how you want to protect American jobs by eliminating the number of immigrants who come into this country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut very recently, the CEO of Toll Brothers (ph) told that he can\u2019t get by without immigrants because they make up more than half of his workforce at this point. We\u2019re not talking about people who are making minimum wage but he can\u2019t find Americans who want to do these jobs for $20-an-hour-plus jobs.\n\nWhat would happen if your plans are successful? What happens and how would we fill that hole in the economy, that gap that\u2019s created?\n\nWell, as you know, Becky, we have the lowest labor participation rate in 50 years and we also have the slowest growth in wages in the history of our country, any 20-year period. In fact, the last quarter had the lowest wage growth ever recorded. And so you look at the fact that we\u2019ve brought in 35 million \u2014 35 million legal and illegal immigrants over the last 20 years, more than any period in American history, we have low wages, low participation waits. Maybe \u2014 rates.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s something going on like we aren\u2019t \u2014 we aren\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have the \u2014 the right match, right?\n\nWe don\u2019t \u2014 we aren\u2019t giving the training and the investment in our workers and we\u2019re bringing in people to compete against low wage workers. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\n\nWe are \u2014 we have an immigration policy that Senator Graham supported that brings in even more low wage workers into this country. He says he wants to solve problems, that\u2019s great. But you\u2019re not solving problems for American wage earners. You\u2019re not solving problems for workers in America who have seen their wages flat line and have been disaffected enough to leave the workplace.\n\nWe need to get better training and better skills, including vocational education and \u2014 and training in this \u2014 in those \u2014 and \u2014 and cut \u2014 community colleges. But the bottom line is, we have to make sure that we are not flooding this country...\n\nQUICK: All right...\n\nSANTORUM: \u2014 with competition...\n\nQUICK: Senator, I\u2019m sorry your minute is up.\n\nSANTORUM: \u2014 for low wage workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQUICK: Thank you very much, Senator Santorum.\n\nSANTORUM: (INAUDIBLE) and I...\n\nQUICK: And Graham, Mr. Graham, yes, that was a question to you, too.\n\nGRAHAM: The first thing...\n\nQUICK: You have 30 seconds.\n\nGRAHAM: \u2014 that we have to do is come to grips with the reality that we\u2019re facing as Americans. In 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security recipient. Today, there\u2019s three. In 20 years, there are two.\n\nI want to make sure that no American company leaves America because you can\u2019t find a worker.\n\nAmerican workers always get the first preference. But if you can\u2019t find an American worker, after you advertise at a competitive wage, I don\u2019t want you to be at a loss. Bring people in based on merit. Let\u2019s take a broken immigration...\n\nQUICK: Senator Graham, thank you.\n\nGRAHAM: \u2014 system...\n\nQUICK: I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s your 30 seconds...\n\nGRAHAM: \u2014 and make a merit-based immigration system that will help our economy. We\u2019re going to need workers in the future.\n\nQUICK: Senator Graham...\n\nGRAHAM: Let\u2019s just choose rationally.\n\nQUICK: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUICK: Gentlemen, hold on a second.\n\nPATAKI: Let me \u2014 let me try to get a word in edgewise.\n\nQUICK: Go ahead,\n\nSANTORUM: That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\n\nPATAKI: In Washington, they talk over each other...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each one...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s have \u2014 let Governor Pataki have a chance to speak.\n\nPATAKI: Yes. Very simply, you guys talk over each other in Washington all the time. I\u2019m not used to that. I listen when people talk.\n\nWe have a skills gap. You mentioned the construction company. The construction industry says one of their biggest problems are they can\u2019t find the craftsmen to do the work.\n\nWhat we have to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPATAKI: \u2014 do in America is honor blue collar work again. We have to honor the carpenter, the plumber, the electrician, who can actually build something and instead of just saying that a college degree live \u2014 delivers prestige, let\u2019s celebrate those who do things with their hands and elevate their skills using training in high school and community...\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki...\n\nPATAKI: \u2014 colleges so that we can...\n\nQUICK: \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was a...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPATAKI: \u2014 have a better quality workforce that we honor...\n\nQUICK: Governor Pataki...\n\nPATAKI: \u2014 as they build America\u2019s future.\n\nQUICK: I\u2019m sorry to talk over you, sir.\n\nThat was a minute.\n\nPATAKI: Thank you.\n\nQUICK: Thank you very much.\n\nPATAKI: Thank you.\n\nQUICK: Carl?\n\nQUINTANILLA: My question for Governor Jindal, Paul Ryan says he would take the speaker job if it did not take away from his family time. The Department of Labor says 13 percent of American workers are eligible for paid family leave and the U.S. is the only developed nation in the world not to have guaranteed paid maternity leave for new moms.\n\nShould the government work to change that?\n\nJINDAL: Look, I think the government should work to change that, but that doesn\u2019t \u2014 does not mean I\u2019m for the government mandating that.\n\nWe already have too many government mandates out of DC.\n\nDo I want people to have paid leave?\n\nSure.\n\nDo I want people to earn higher wages?\n\nSure.\n\nDo I want them to have better benefits?\n\nSure. The government can\u2019t wave a magic wand and make that happen.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. The last seven years, President Obama has tried to teach the American people that government is the answer to all of our problems.\n\nWhere has that gotten us?\n\nWe\u2019re on a path toward socialism. The way that folks can get better paying jobs with better benefits is if we have a growing economy. That means to repeal all of ObamaCare, a lower flatter tax code.\n\nThat means that we have an energy plan that makes sense. That means that we embrace an all of the above approach to energy. Those are good paying jobs \u2014 $50,000, $70,000, $90,000 a year jobs with benefits.\n\nBut this president won\u2019t let us produce more energy on our domestic federal lands and waters. He won\u2019t allow the Canadians to build the Keystone Pipeline. He\u2019s got an EPA that\u2019s doing everything they can to kill private sector jobs in America.\n\nSo, yes, I want families to have better paying jobs and better benefits, but we\u2019re not going to get that with a government mandate, we\u2019re going to get that with a growing economy.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Governor, thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nQUINTANILLA: John?\n\nHARWOOD: Senator Graham, Americans have gotten used to seeing headlines about more and more big corporations relocating overseas to cut their tax bill. Now, many in Washington think the way to stop that is to lower our corporate tax rate.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen, tax reform takes time. It hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nIn the meantime, do you fault those companies for leaving?\n\nDo companies owe anything to their country, as well as their shareholders?\n\nGRAHAM: We owe to every businessperson and worker in America the best environment in the world to create a job. We owe that to American businesses. Thirty-five percent corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world.\n\nWe need to lower it so they don\u2019t leave. The goal is to help the middle class. We can talk about corporations all day long but my goal is to help the middle class, somebody who makes too much to be on government assistance but still lives paycheck to paycheck.\n\nWhen the kid gets sick you don\u2019t go on vacation.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGRAHAM: That\u2019s the purpose of my presidency, to grow the economy here. And let me tell you, our Democratic friends have a list a mile long of more government. That\u2019s not going to grow the middle class, that\u2019s going to create a burden on your children, which they\u2019re already overburdened. The best way to grow the middle class is to make it a good place to create a job.\n\nYou know why Boeing came to South Carolina when they could have gone anywhere to build the 787?\n\nBecause we wanted them. We had a low-tax structure.\n\nHARWOOD: Senator Graham.\n\nGRAHAM: A permitting structure that allowed them to build the building even faster than they thought they could build it. We welcomed them there. I\u2019m going to take the South Carolina attitude \u2014\n\nHARWOOD: I want to remind candidates, you\u2019ve got a one-minute limit on the \u2014 on the response.\n\nBut I just want to follow up, Senator Graham. Four years ago, the nominee of your party said that corporations are people, too.\n\nIf that is true, the question is, do they owe any obligation to the country?\n\nGRAHAM: I think everybody owes an obligation to the country. The ones that I\u2019m most worried about are the 1 percent of Americans in uniform, who have been fighting this war for 14 years. They need a commander in chief who knows what the hell they\u2019re doing.\n\nMy first job as President of the United States is to rebuild the military and use it smartly. Admiral Mullen said the debt is a big threat to our national security. He\u2019s right. But people go where they\u2019re welcome when it comes to job creation.\n\nIf I\u2019m President of the United States you will be welcomed in America.\n\nHARWOOD: Senator Graham \u2014\n\nGRAHAM: This will be the place to come \u2014\n\nHARWOOD: \u2014 thank you very much.\n\nGRAHAM: And if I\u2019m president of the United States \u2014\n\nHARWOOD: We\u2019re moving on.\n\nGRAHAM: \u2014 our enemies \u2014\n\nQUICK: You guys are making this just like home. This is just like (INAUDIBLE).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARWOOD: Senator, we\u2019re moving on.\n\nI\u2019d like to bring on my colleague, Rick Santelli \u2014 Rick.\n\nRICK SANTELLI, CNBC HOST: Thanks, John.\n\nGovernor Pataki.\n\nPATAKI: Hey, Rick.\n\nSANTELLI: How are you doing tonight?\n\nPATAKI: I\u2019m doing great.\n\nSANTELLI: Listen, America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, they\u2019ve kept interest rates near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAnd, by the way, they had a meeting today, you think they raised rates?\n\nNo.\n\nShocking, isn\u2019t it?\n\nPATAKI: Not at all.\n\nSANTELLI: Listen, it\u2019s been a rough ride for American savers and retirees, they really rely on this interest income. And it\u2019s been a bonanza for the stock market, a bonanza.\n\nAnd for investors that like the little bit more risk, it\u2019s been a bonanza for them as well.\n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is, do you think this policy is fair and do you support it?\n\nPATAKI: No, I don\u2019t support it. But let me go back a little bit here. We need to grow our economy faster. We\u2019ve had the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. And it\u2019s because of policy in Washington and policy at the Fed.\n\nAnd let me go back to Washington. In 2009 \u2014\n\nHARWOOD: Senator, that \u2014 I mean, Governor, if that\u2019s true, why was our economy limping six years ago and now it\u2019s the strongest in the world?\n\nPATAKI: John, no question Barack Obama inherited a economic disaster in 2009.\n\nBut what did he do?\n\nInstead of focusing on pro-growth policies in the economy, he rammed through ObamaCare, the worst law of my lifetime, that hurt small businesses, hurt companies, raised taxes and almost completely eliminated one industry because of its taxes.\n\nThe Fed had to act. And the Fed did act and appropriately in reducing interest rates but they\u2019ve reduced them now for seven straight years, that\u2019s never happened before. They\u2019ve been zero for way too long.\n\nThey should raise the rates; the Fed should get out of manipulating the market and the Fed also, by the way, should reduce its balance sheet, $2.7 trillion. Let some of those bonds mature and put the money back in the banking system so our economy can grow.\n\nSANTELLI: Thanks, Governor.\n\nSenator Santorum, in the 2012 presidential debate, you were for the export-import bank, which facilitates government funding for U.S. exports. American companies like GE and Boeing are among the beneficiaries.\n\nBut you said that killing the bank here \u2014 and I\u2019m going to quote you \u2014 \u201cis the last thing a true conservative should be doing.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know, government-backed funding isn\u2019t normally what I hear from true conservatives.\n\nSo why is this situation different?\n\nSANTORUM: A true conservative wants to create a level playing field. That\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re \u2014 that\u2019s what government is supposed to do. They\u2019re not supposed to favor one group over another.\n\nAnd when it comes to our manufacturers, the level playing field is not in the United States. It\u2019s international. And so the federal government should have laws, tax laws, regulatory laws and, yes, finance laws. There\u2019s 60 other ex-im banks all over \u2014 all over the world.\n\nEvery major competitor for the United States\u2019 manufacturing dollar has one of those banks.\n\nAnd guess what? They use those banks a heck of a lot more than their \u2014 than the United States of America does, number one.\n\nSo in order to have a level playing field, which is what conservatives talk about all the time, level playing field, then we have to have export financing and here\u2019s why.Because export financing doesn\u2019t help Boeing, or G.E.\n\nG.E. just lost a contract, you know what they did? They went to . They got the X.M. (ph) bank in France to support it, and what did they do? They moved manufacturing out of South Carolina, out of Texas, moved to \u2014 Hungary, and to France. G.E. is still making money. G.E. is still doing well, but American workers are out of jobs. That\u2019s why we have to have this level playing field so we can compete with the rest of the world.\n\nMALE: Thank you, Senator.\n\nQUINTANILLA: CNBC\u2019s coverage of the Republican presidential debate continues, live from the University of COlorado after this short break.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(INAUDIBLE)\n\n(INAUDIBLE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nQUINTANILLA: Welcome back to the University of Colorado, and the Republican Presidential Debate on CNBC.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nQUINTANILLA: A question for Senator Santorum. People in this state have loved Coors Beer since it was founded in 1873. I can atest...\n\n(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, the brewer later became part of SABMiller, but, now SAB may be bought by Budweiser owner, InBev. Is it right to have a third of brewers in this country owned by one company, and do you fear a company that size will have too much power over consumers.\n\nSANTORUM: Well, first, since you mention Colorado, I want to thank the people of Colorado because four years ago you \u2014 gave me the honor of winning the nomination out here in the state of Colorado. On a night we won three states, and it catapulted us to win 11 states ultimately, so, I just want to thank you very, very much for that support, and \u2014 in response to that, I do drink a lot of Coors beer, so...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI try to help. The answer is pretty simple. The answer is simple. There are no shortage of breweries around the United States of America. I \u2014 I do \u2014 as I travel around the country, I do pints and politics, and I go to breweries all over the place, and there \u2014 there\u2019s almost no town in America anymore that doesn\u2019t have a brewery, so I don\u2019t think we need to worry too much.\n\nThey\u2019re obviously \u2014 if there\u2019s \u2014 if there\u2019s some anti- competitive issues, you know, we have agencies to look at that. But, no, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not concerned that Americans are not going to have choices in beer.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Well, let\u2019s get to that. I mean, another example, for example, is Walgreens.\n\nSANTORUM: And I care about, by the way. I care about choices.\n\nQUINTANILLA: I\u2019m sure you do.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWalgreens/Rite Aid. Big deal, consolidation in drug stores, semiconductors, food. What is the line at which something becomes anti-competitive in your view?\n\nSANTORUM: Well, I \u2014 I would say this, that what you\u2019re seeing is \u2014 in health care, you\u2019re seeing a lot of consolidation, and that consolidation is occurring because of Obamacare.\n\nYou\u2019re seeing it particularly in an area that I am concerned about, and that\u2019s in insurance \u2014 health insurance. You\u2019re seeing the big health insurance companies fold up.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen Obama try to seed health insurance companies, and they\u2019ve all failed, I think, except one. Why? Because we have a system of Obamacare with minimum loss ratios that make it virtually impossible for a small insurer to operate effectively.\n\nAnd this was the motive behind Obamacare. This wasn\u2019t incidental. This was deliberate, to make it so impossible for small insurers to survive...\n\nQUINTANILLA: Senator.\n\nSANTORUM: ...that they consolidate into a small group. Then the left can say, \u201cthere is no competition, we need a single payer.\u201d That\u2019s why we have to repeal Obamacare.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nQUINTANILLA: Thank you. Becky.\n\nQUICK: Governor Jindal, I want to go back to something that you mentioned before with your tax plan. I know that you want to put a 2 percent tax on all families, just to make sure everyone has some skin in the game.\n\nBut every working American pays 6.2 percent, when it comes to Social Security taxes. They pay another 1.45 percent of Medicare. Isn\u2019t that skin in the game?\n\nJINDAL: A couple things. You\u2019re talking about payroll taxes that fund programs. People pay for their Medicare, they pay for their Social Security.\n\nI want every American to worry and care about how those folks in D.C. are spending our money. If $18 trillion of debt \u2014 they\u2019re misspending our money. Earned success is so much more fulfilling than unearned success.\n\nI don\u2019t want us to continue to create one class of Americans that pays income taxes, that pays for government, another class of Americans that\u2019s growing more and more dependent on government.\n\nThat\u2019s what we have today. Socialism is bad, not only for taxpayers, but people that they say they\u2019re trying to help. There\u2019s dignity in work, dignity in self-sufficiency.\n\nI wanna quote you a president. Our (ph) previous president said this: he said, \u201cthe problem is, is that tax rates are too high, government income revenues are too low.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cparadoxically, lowering tax rates now is the best way to produce higher government revenues later.\u201d No, that wasn\u2019t President Reagan, as many are probably guessing at home. That was President Kennedy.\n\nI see you know the answer. That was President Kennedy. Imagine if he were alive today \u2014 and if he was at that last Democratic debate, imagine if you tried to say that in a party that\u2019s veering towards socialism. That wouldn\u2019t be welcome in today\u2019s Democratic party.\n\nQUICK: Governor, thank you.\n\nHARWOOD: Governor Pataki, you\u2019ve indicated you believe climate change is real and caused at least in part by human activity. So, in 60 seconds, tell us what the federal government should do about it.\n\nPATAKI: Yeah, absolutely. I \u2014 one of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts. I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous that, in the 21st century, we\u2019re questioning whether or not vaccines are the appropriate way to go. Of course they are. And it\u2019s also not appropriate to think that human activity, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, doesn\u2019t make the earth warmer. All things being equal, it does. It\u2019s uncontroverted.\n\nI think part of the problem is that Republicans think about climate change, say, \u201coh my God, we\u2019re gonna have higher taxes, more Obama, more big government, the EPA shutting down factories.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the solution that I see. I want Republicans to embrace innovation and technology. You know, there\u2019s one country in the world that has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the rest of \u2014 of the world. You know what that is? The United States.\n\nOur emissions are lower than they were in 1995. Not because of a \u2014 of a government program, but because of fracking, private sector creation...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARWOOD: Is there a role for government?\n\nPATAKI: ...replace coal plants \u2014 government\u2019s roles \u2014 is to incentivize innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit in America. We could have far more clean energy.\n\nWe could have next-generation nuclear, thorium reactors that have no risk of meltdown. We could have solar panels on every home that are four times more efficient than today.\n\nHARWOOD: So, subsidies for those programs? For \u2014 for those alternative energy sources?\n\nPATAKI: R&D \u2014 R&D credits. Let the private sector do this, develop this innovation. And not only would we solve our problems, we would have clean energy, cheaper energy here.\n\nWe could export those technologies to places like China and like India so we would grow our economy, have a far greater impact globally, have a secure domestic source of energy, and cleaner, healthier air.\n\nThat\u2019s the solution. Embrace science, embrace innovation and change.\n\nHARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Carl?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nQUINTANILLA: Question for Senator Santorum.\n\nSANTORUM: Thank you. Can I just say something about that?\n\nQUINTANILLA: After this question maybe.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThe 2015 Nobel Prize winner for economics argues that slow growth causes poverty, and that leads to inequality. What would you do to ease inequality? And what would you do solve poverty? By the way, thanks to Larry Kudlow, CNBC, for this question.\n\nSANTORUM: Well, if you look at our plan that I introduced, the 2020 Clear Vision for America, we increase growth by 10 percent, 1 percent a year. So we go from 2.3 to 3.3, in repealing Obamacare, it\u2019s another .7. So you\u2019re looking at 4 percent growth, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nAnd unlike Donald Trump and Bobby Jindal, we don\u2019t add $10 trillion to the deficit. In fact, our plan, while it creates as many jobs as their plan does and grows the economy as much as theirs does, we are a revenue-neutral plan because I believe that we need to reduce the size of government, yes, but we also need to reduce our deficit, and we need to get our budget balanced so we can start paying down this debt. And adding a trillion dollars with a tax cut and getting no more growth is not the way to do it.\n\nBut that\u2019s only half of it. The word \u201ceconomy\u201d comes from the Greek \u201ceuthokis\u201d (ph) which means family. The family is the first economy. And the one thing that we do not talk about enough is how stable families are vitally important for the middle of America to be prosperous and to grow and be safe. And I will have policies, not just tax policies, but others that will make sure that families are strong again in America.\n\nQUINTANILLA (?): Governor Jindal, I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds on this.\n\nJINDAL: Well, thank you.\n\nLook, if Senator Santorum wants to concede the tax cut wing of the Republican Party, I\u2019m happy to fight for that side of the Republican Party. He\u2019s exactly right. I explicitly want to shrink the size of government; 22 percent over 10 years is not too much. We cut our state budget 26 percent in eight years.\n\nThis is a fundamental choice. We mustn\u2019t become a cheaper version of the Democratic Party, a second liberal party. We need to proudly say we\u2019re willing to cut taxes, shrink government, grow the American economy. President Kennedy said it to the Democratic Party. Why can\u2019t we say it in the Republican Party in 2015, let\u2019s cut taxes.\n\nHARWOOD: Governor, if you cut spending and cut government so much, why did your legislature have such a big deficit?\n\nJINDAL: John, our budget is balanced. We balanced our budget every year for eight years. Yeah, we\u2019ve had to cut spending. You know what? We privatized or closed nine of our 10 charity hospitals. We did statewide school choice; $1.6 billion (ph) budget cut.\n\nYou\u2019re quoting an old number from the beginning of the year. We closed that gap. What they talk about, just like D.C., government\u2019s the only place where you give them less money than they wanted, they count it as a cut. They take last year\u2019s budget. They add inflation. They call it a baseline. We need to do zero-based budgets. We need to say just because you got money last year, you don\u2019t have it this year.\n\nLet me close, though. We balanced our budget. We didn\u2019t raise taxes. In eight years, we never raised taxes. We cut taxes. Our \u2014 our taxpayers, our families have been better off for it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARWOOD: No, we\u2019re going to move on. I\u2019m going to bring on my colleague Sharon Epperson.\n\nEPPERSON: Thank you, John.\n\nSenator Graham, one in every four workers has saved less than $1,000 for retirement. Millions of Americans rely on their Social Security benefits for the majority of their retirement income. Now, you called for reforms to Social Security, but what would you do to fix the other part of the problem for future retirees and get people to save more?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, Social Security is not just a concept to me. I know why it exists; 50 percent of today\u2019s seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. I promise you, if you make me your president, I will save Social Security because I know why it exists.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re looking for good beer policy, I\u2019m your best bet. My dad owned a bar.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI know beer. We grew up, my sister and myself, in the back of that bar in one room with my mom, my dad and my sister who\u2019s nine years younger. When I was 21, my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Neither parent finished high school. She died within a year. We were wiped out from the medical bills. And if it wasn\u2019t for a Social Security survivor benefit check coming into my family, we wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have made it because my dad died 15 months later.\n\nSo I...\n\nEPPERSON: But Senator Graham...\n\nGRAHAM: Wait a minute, please. I\u2019m 22 and we\u2019re wiped out. I am 60. I\u2019m not married. I have a military retirement. I\u2019m in good shape. I would give up some of my benefits to help those who need it more than I do.\n\nTo young people here, I will ask you to work a little bit longer because we have to. The purpose of my presidency is to save this country and to save Social Security by working across the aisle just like Ronald Reagan. This is the biggest issue facing this nation.\n\nEPPERSON: Thank you, Senator Graham. Thank you, Senator Graham.\n\nGovernor Jindal, you\u2019ve been a strong supporter of for-profit colleges. These are institutions that educate many veterans, minorities and working class Americans. They make up about 11 percent of the college population at these schools, but they account for 44 percent of student loan defaults. Should for-profit schools be held accountable when they take taxpayer money and leave students deep in debt?\n\nJINDAL: (INAUDIBLE) absolutely they should be accountable. They should be accountable to their students through the market. Look, you either trust the American people to make their own choices or you don\u2019t.\n\nI know the Left thinks we need to be protected from ourselves. President Obama is trying to limit competition to the higher education market. As a result, you\u2019re going to see tuition prices continue to go up. We\u2019ve had $1 trillion of student debt and counting. And he wants to exempt certain schools from the same oversight he wants to apply only to the for-profit market.\n\nFor some reason, the private sector is a bad word to this president. It\u2019s not in the real world.\n\nIn Louisiana, we fought so that the dollars follow the child and so the child following the dollar. What that means, from K-12, what that means is that parents and their families can decide what\u2019s the best way for their children to be educated. Higher education, we have a TOPS program, where, again, we will help if a student maintains a 20 ACT, 2.5 GPA, we\u2019ll pay for their tuition. They can take those dollars for private school of their choice in the state as well.\n\nYou either trust the American people or you don\u2019t. I know the Left doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you get ObamaCare. They want to tell us what kind of insurance to buy. That\u2019s why you get Common Core, they want to take away our gun rights under the Second Amendment. They want to take away our religious liberty rights.\n\nSo, yes, there\u2019s accountability. There\u2019s accountability to students through choice and competition. We don\u2019t need the nanny state to protect us from ourselves.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Governor Jindal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHARWOOD: And thank you, Sharon (ph).\n\nThis is the Republican Presidential Debate, live from Boulder, Colorado. We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(MUSIC PLAYING) (APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nQUICK: Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado, and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.\n\nGentlemen, this is our lightning round, where we have some questions for you we hope you can answer in 20 seconds or less. And we will go right down the line on this.\n\nGovernor Jindal, I\u2019ll start with you.\n\nWe\u2019re wondering, what are the three apps that you use most frequently on your cellphone?\n\nJINDAL: I was just saying to my colleagues, I may be the last person in this audience without an iPhone. I\u2019m actually one of the last folks \u2014 I still have a BlackBerry in my pocket. And I basically use it for scheduling. I use it to keep up when my wife is here and my three kids at home.\n\nThe only games on that phone are Bricklayer. I use it to keep up with the news through the Internet. I may be the last American out there without an iPhone.\n\nQUICK: No, no.\n\nJINDAL: My apologies.\n\nQUICK: I \u2014 I\u2019m with you. I still have a BlackBerry, too.\n\nSenator \u2014 Senator Santorum, how about you?\n\nSANTORUM: MLB, NHL, so I\u2019m a big sports fan. And \u201cThe Wall Street Journal.\u201d Those are the three apps I use the most.\n\nQUICK: Thank you.\n\nGovernor?\n\nPATAKI: The one I use the most is Uber. You know, I used to get driven...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPATAKI: \u2014 when I was governor, I had a driver. I don\u2019t anymore, but...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPATAKI: And it\u2019s an example of what millennials are doing to change America for the better. And I tweet a lot, too.\n\nSo Uber, Tweet \u2014 Twitter and then I communicate with my family.\n\nQUICK: Thank you.\n\nSenator Graham?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, the only reason I have an iPhone is because I gave my number to Donald Trump. Don\u2019t do that.\n\n(LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor...\n\nGRAHAM: Donald has done more to upgrade my technology than my whole staff.\n\nNumber one, Fox News. Sorry about CNBC.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRAHAM: We\u2019re in a Republican primary here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks. Thanks a lot.\n\nQUICK: We take your time back. Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Time is up.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cut his microphone.\n\nQUINTANILLA: We\u2019ve got one more. One more lightning round.\n\nGovernor Jindal, should the day after the Super Bowl be a national holiday?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJINDAL: Well, absolutely, when the Saints go back to repeat, we were talking about beer sales earlier, all those folks from being hung over in Louisiana from drinking to celebrate Drew Brees winning this, I think it would be a great day to take off.\n\nNo, look, on a serious note, I do want to say this about the Super Bowl and our athletes. They can be great role models for our children and I\u2019m obviously a Saints fan. Drew Brees and his wife great role models, great Christians.\n\nSo, yes, it should be a holiday.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Senator?\n\nSANTORUM: Well, since we\u2019re usually in the Super Bowl at the Pittsburgh Steelers...\n\nSteeler nation, anybody?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nSANTORUM: No. I was in...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANTORUM: \u2014 I was in Kansas City over the weekend to watch the Steeler game and about a third of the crowd were Steeler fans. So I\u2019m usually not alone when I call on Steeler Nation.\n\nBut we are used to being in the Super Bowl, so actually, it is in Pennsylvania already.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Governor?\n\nPATAKI: I \u2014 I am a long suffering Jets fan. So my answer is obviously no, there\u2019s no reason to take off the day after the Super Bowl.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPATAKI: But let me just add this. The Mets are going to win tonight. Let\u2019s go, Mets.\n\nQUINTANILLA: Finally, Senator?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I think a national holiday would be the day that commander-in-chief Barack Obama doesn\u2019t have that job.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGRAHAM: But unlike these other three, I want to win New Hampshire. Go Tom Brady. Go Patriots.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRAHAM: Sorry, Colorado is late in the...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Panderer.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nQUICK: Jhon?\n\nHARWOOD: OK, now we\u2019re at the point of the evening where we\u2019re just about to give our candidates a holiday from this debate, but not before they tell us in 30 seconds their closing statements.\n\nSenator Graham, you\u2019re first.\n\nGRAHAM: Somebody said \u2014 or maybe I saw it on the bill of a cap \u2014 that let\u2019s make America great again.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGRAHAM: America is great.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGRAHAM: I intend to make America strong again. I\u2019m going to be the champion of the middle class, where I came from. If you make me your president, our best days are ahead. I\u2019m ready to be commander- in-chief, ladies and gentlemen, on day one. I intend to war \u2014 win a war that we cannot afford to lose.\n\nI will be a commander-in-chief worthy of the sacrifice of those brave Americans who have been defending our nation. They have had our back. God knows, they have had our back... HARWOOD: Senator Graham...\n\nGRAHAM: \u2014 and I intend to have their back as commander-in- chief. Make me commander-in-chief.\n\nHARWOOD: Thank you, Senator Graham.\n\nGovernor Pataki?\n\nPATAKI: Thank you for the opportunity to be with this great audience tonight.\n\nI\u2019m a limited government conservative and I mean by that that not just when it comes to economic issues leaving them to the state, but social issues, as well.\n\nAnd in that I differ from every single other candidate seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nI take the Tenth Amendment very, very seriously.\n\nI\u2019m a Republican who embraces science and understands we have to work with the next generation of millennials to have the innovation and technology so that we can grow a 21st century economy.\n\nAnd I\u2019m a Republican who understands in Washington, when you\u2019re a leader, you have to put aside partisan politics to do what\u2019s right for the people.\n\nWe are one America. If we work together across party lines, there\u2019s no problem we can\u2019t solve and the 21st century will be America\u2019s greatest century.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nHARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHARWOOD: Senator Santorum?\n\nSANTORUM: I grew up in a steel town of Western Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh, and when I announced for president, I announced from the factory floor. When I talk about making America the number one manufacturer again in the world, it\u2019s not just talk. When I talk about having the opportunity for people to rise again, it\u2019s not just because it polls well.\n\nI represented the old steel valley of Pittsburgh. I represented a 70% Democratic district, and won with 60% of the vote. Why? Because I aligned myself with working men and women who feel that neither party, and certainly not Washington D.C. cares about them.\n\nYou elect me, we will get American workers on the side of the Republican party, and we can not be stopped if we do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHARWOOD: Senator Santorum, thank you. Governor Jindal?\n\nJINDAL: My message is to conservatives, this is our hour. Thanks to the insanity, the incompetence of the Democratic party, the American people are ready to turn our government over to us. It\u2019s not enough to let just any Republican, however. The reality is the idea of America is slipping away.\n\nAs Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans, we believe that our best days are always ahead of us, and they can be again. We must win this election. We cannot allow Hillary Clinton to take us down this path towards socialism \u2014 further down this path.\n\nI\u2019ve got the courage to apply our conservative principles. I can\u2019t do it alone. With your help, with God\u2019s grace, we can save the idea of America before it\u2019s too late.\n\nHARWOOD: Governor Jindal, thank you very much. Carl?\n\nQUINTANILLA: That concludes our first part of the evening.\n\nEND", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151028202028, "twitter": {"description": "The debate on Wednesday, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., as transcribed by the Federal News Service.", "title": "Transcript: The \u2018Undercard\u2019 Republican Presidential Debate", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/transcript-the-undercard-republican-presidential-debate.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004005587"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/us/politics/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/transcript-the-undercard-republican-presidential-debate.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004005587", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/transcript-the-undercard-republican-presidential-debate.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 28, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "CNBC", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Debates (Political),Jindal  Bobby,Santorum  Rick,Pataki  George E,Graham  Lindsey,CNBC", "news_keywords": "CNBC", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Graham, Lindsey", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The debate on Wednesday, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., as transcribed by the Federal News Service.", "tom": "Text", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "news-event", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/us/politics/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The debate on Wednesday, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., as transcribed by the Federal News Service.", "CN": "election-2016", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Text", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-01-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "CNBC", "published": "2015-10-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "29transcript1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160122141838, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/transcript-the-undercard-republican-presidential-debate.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/us/politics/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The debate on Wednesday, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., as transcribed by the Federal News Service.", "title": "Transcript: The \u2018Undercard\u2019 Republican Presidential Debate"}, "pdate": 20151028, "des": "Debates (Political)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "news", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news-event/election-2016", "tagline": "Here\u2019s the latest news and analysis of the candidates and issues shaping the presidential race.", "uri": "/news-event/election-2016", "display-name": "Presidential Election 2016", "identifier": "election-2016", "type": "news-event"}, "articleid": 100000004005587, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Transcript: The \u2018Undercard\u2019 Republican Presidential Debate", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/us/politics/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50/jimcoloradorepubdebate-50-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Text"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf2e\"", "article_summary": "Senator \u2014 Senator Santorum, how about you?\nThat\u2019s not going to grow the middle class, that\u2019s going to create a burden on your children, which they\u2019re already overburdened.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyPATAKI: No, I don\u2019t think we need a military response, but we need a coordinated response.\nThe number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don\u2019t think he ever came back.\nQUINTANILLA: CNBC\u2019s coverage of the Republican presidential debate continues, live from the University of COlorado after this short break."}
