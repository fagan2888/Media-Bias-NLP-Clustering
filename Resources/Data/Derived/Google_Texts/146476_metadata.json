Military branches are currently researching the performance of females who volunteered for infantry officer and enlisted training courses, and the service chiefs have repeatedly said that standards will not be lowered to accommodate women in combat roles.\n\nHowever, critics of the initiative say it comes with social and health costs that are counterproductive. And they say they are deeply skeptical of claims by military leaders that standards will not be altered.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon and the White House see this as being about equal opportunity\u2014it\u2019s not about that,\u201d said retired Army Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis, author of the book Deadly Consequences: How Cowards Are Pushing Women into Combat, in an interview. \u201cWhat kind of nation pushes its young women into direct ground combat? A nation that is willing to compromise security even more and a nation that will not survive in the long term.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey has said all military occupational standards will be reviewed as women are integrated into combat roles by the end of 2015. The services also say exemptions could still remain for certain positions and units.\n\n\u201cIf we do decide that a particular standard is so high that a woman couldn\u2019t make it, the burden is now on the service to come back and explain to the secretary, why is it that high?\u201d Dempsey said in January. \u201cDoes it really have to be that high?\u201d\n\nCritics say that leaves the door open to artificially lowered standards. While current law stipulates that military occupations should be \u201cwithout differential standards or evaluation on the basis of gender,\u201d a February memo by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said the services have liberally interpreted that provision in the past.\n\n\u201cThe use of the term \u2018gender-neutral physical standards\u2019 raises questions depending on how it is defined,\u201d the memo said. \u201cA plain reading of the term suggests that men and women would be required to meet the same physical standards in order to be similarly assigned.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, in the past, the services have used this and similar terms to suggest that men and women must exert the same amount of energy in a particular task, regardless of the work that is actually accomplished by either.\u201d\n\nA report released last month by the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) notes that the Marine Corps\u2019 implementation plan for women in combat includes similar criteria. Scores for men and women on the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) and Combat Fitness Test (CFT) were \u201cgender-normed\u201d in 2009 in order to \u201caccount for physiological differences between genders,\u201d according to footnotes in the plan.\n\nFor example, women receive higher scores on the CFT \u201cManeuver Under Fire\u201d event\u2014previously pass-fail\u2014for completing it in the same time as men. A male trainee would earn the minimum of 60 points for completing it in 3 minutes and 58 seconds, while a female would earn 88 points for completing it in the same time.\n\nAs a result, a male would fail the CFT by accruing 189 points or less on three \u201cgender-normed\u201d exercises, while a woman with the same performances would earn a total of 247 points and qualify for the second-highest rating class.\n\n\u201cIt is a way\u2014whether deliberate or not\u2014it is a way to give credit to women at a different rate than men,\u201d said Elaine Donnelly, CMR president and former member of the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, in an interview. \u201cThe problem is there is no \u2018gender-norming\u2019 on the battlefield. There is no \u2018gender-norming\u2019 when someone is in a burning vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt elevates the risk that you will have more casualties,\u201d she said.\n\nThree female Marines passed the infantry training course at Camp Geiger, N.C., for the first time last month, while a fourth was unable to complete her final tests after suffering a stress fracture in her leg. Ten women have tried and failed to pass the more rigorous Infantry Officer Course (IOC) at Quantico, Va.\n\nCapt. Maureen Krebs, Marines spokeswoman, said the women who volunteered for the Camp Geiger course did not receive \u201cgender-normed\u201d scores on the PFT and CFT and had to meet the same standards as men. The three women who successfully passed the course will not be immediately allowed to join an infantry unit while the Marine Corps conducts more tests.\n\n\u201cStandards will not be lowered,\u201d Krebs said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve reviewed all 335 of our primary [Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs)] and validated the physically demanding tasks for them. They are task based or performance based standards that all Marines in that MOS must be able to perform; for example, a tank Marine must be able to load a tank round.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently there are 47 female Marines, company grade officers, and staff non-commissioned officers, who were assigned to 19 battalions which were previously closed,\u201d she said. \u201cThis assignment experiment began in June 2012.\u201d\n\nStill, Donnelly expressed concerns that the success of women at Camp Geiger might prompt Marine Corps leaders to reevaluate the more demanding IOC.\n\n\u201cThese gender political pressures being what they are, the pressure is already on the IOC to make it possible for someone to at least pass that course,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.) has attempted to prevent that from happening. Hunter, a former Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, began advocating in February for a provision in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would codify equal standards for women and men in combat training.\n\nThe current version of the NDAA, which the House passed on Thursday and is expected to be taken up in the Senate early next week, contains language mandating that \u201call members of the Armed Forces serving in or assigned to the military career designator must meet the same physical and performance outcome-based standards.\u201d\n\nJoe Kasper, communications director for Hunter, said in an interview that the congressman felt the vague \u201cgender-neutral\u201d language in the law needed to be updated.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not thrilled about lifting the [combat] exemption, but he recognizes it\u2019s where we are, and because of that we have to maintain the high state of readiness,\u201d Kasper said.\n\nKasper said Hunter believed that special operations forces in particular were not prepared to lower their elite standards in order to admit women.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear how many women are actually interested in entering combat. Just 13 percent of female respondents to a recent online survey conducted by the Military Times said they would take a combat job, while 77 percent said no.\n\nA group of female Marines also told Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in July that incorporating women into combat roles could lead to lower standards and increase sexual assault rates.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t met a female Marine or a female in general who is standing up and shouting, \u2018I want to be infantry,\u2019\u201d one captain said.\n\nHowever, they may not have a choice. When Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D., Calif.) asked Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Milstead at a committee hearing in July about whether combat assignments could be voluntary for women, he said no. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re called orders,\u201d he said.\n\nMaginnis, the retired Army lieutenant colonel, noted that the United Kingdom decided not to assign women to the infantry in 2002 and 2012 because of a steep increase in injuries during a \u201cgender-free\u201d training experiment.\n\n\u201cThey came to the conclusion that this didn\u2019t make sense; there\u2019s no reason that women should have to suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no political and military reason to move forward with women in direct ground combat.\u201d\n\nA recent DOD study also found that sexual assault rates were twice as high among women who deployed and experienced combat. Maginnis said interviews he conducted with service members for his book confirmed high rates of sexual abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMaginnis added that female soldiers typically get promoted at equal or faster rates than men and are proficient in many positions. He is concerned about the small percentage in actual combat scenarios, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only talking about the \u2018tip of the spear,\u2019 the people that are actually doing the killing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to compromise those who are actually doing the jobs for political correctness, you could care less about the security of this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "May also increase injuries, deaths, sexual assaults", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The push to integrate female soldiers into formerly all-male combat roles and units could increase injuries, deaths, and incidences of sexual assault and ultimately harm national security, experts say", "title": "Female Integration into Combat Roles Could Harm National Security", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/female-integration-into-combat-roles-could-harm-national-security/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FemaleMarines-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The push to integrate female soldiers into formerly all-male combat roles and units could increase i", "creator": "@TheWiserChoice", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FemaleMarines-150x150.jpg", "title": "Female Integration into Combat Roles Could Harm National Security", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @TheWiserChoiceThe push to integrate female soldiers into formerly all-male combat roles and units could increase injuries, deaths, and incidences of sexual assault and ultimately harm national security, experts say.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t met a female Marine or a female in general who is standing up and shouting, \u2018I want to be infantry,\u2019\u201d one captain said.\nA group of female Marines also told Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in July that incorporating women into combat roles could lead to lower standards and increase sexual assault rates.\nMaginnis added that female soldiers typically get promoted at equal or faster rates than men and are proficient in many positions.\nAnd they say they are deeply skeptical of claims by military leaders that standards will not be altered."}
