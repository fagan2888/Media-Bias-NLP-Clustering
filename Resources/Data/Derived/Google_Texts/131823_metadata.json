Allan Levene is running for the House of Representatives in his home state of Georgia -- as well as Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii.\n\nWhile Levene's plan is unorthodox, it also seems to be legal.\n\nThe Constitution says a person elected to the House must be a resident of the state they will represent when elected, but says nothing about the primaries. So, Levene's logic goes, he doesn't have to pick one race unless and until he wins a primary.\n\nLevene's reasoning is simple: he wants to be a member of Congress and feels he is too old to follow a traditional path by working his way up in local government. A naturalized citizen originally from England, he told FoxNews.com he feels compelled to serve.\n\n\u201cI have such a debt to this country, a debt of gratitude to the United States for taking me in and letting me become a citizen about 40 years ago that I have to repay it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to.\u201d\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nThough his plan certainly risks turning off voters in the states where he does not live, Levene said he got the idea when he was studying the Constitution and realized it was legal.\n\n\u201cThe Founding Fathers wrote in the Constitution -- they didn't really understand you could fly from state to state because people couldn't really travel before, they could only really focus on one state where they lived,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes have changed so I am running in four states.\u201d\n\nFirst up on Levene\u2019s agenda is his home state, Georgia, where he is running to replace GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey in the state's 11th District. Gingrey announced last year he will seek the Republican nomination for Senate in the race to replace GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss.\n\nThe 11th district is holding its open primary in May, three months earlier than the other states where Levene is running. Levene says he is focusing on that race for now, but if he is does not win the primary he will turn his focus to the other three.\n\nOne of the main issues Levene is running on is jobs. He said he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate to zero, with the hopes of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and creating a \u201ctax haven\u201d for overseas businesses. He also has a proposal he says will stop overspending in Congress by forcing incumbents out of office. His plan would allow lawmakers to be in office no more than eight years or nix their pensions.\n\nAll four of the districts Levene is running in are districts in which the incumbent is not seeking another term. Levene says he chose them for various reasons, but does not feel the fact he does not live in them should impact his electability.\n\n\u201cI can represent the public no matter where I live,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, K. Mark Takai, a Hawaii state representative running as a Democrat in the same race for Hawaii's 1st district, is skeptical of that claim. Takai told FoxNews.com while he respects Levene's right to run in multiple states as long as it's legal, he finds his strategy a \"bit odd\" and is not sure it will resonate with Hawaiians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the heart of democracy. The heart of representative government (is) you want someone to represent you who represents your community and its people,\" Takai said.\n\nHowever, Levene says he is already garnering strong interest in Hawaii and some interest in Michigan, because his ideas are ones that resonate across state lines.\n\n\u201cPeople are people everywhere, and they are all interested in the same thing,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/House of Representatives", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 10:31:22 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time.", "twitter": {"description": "A 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446996215919.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Republican candidate running for Congress in 4 different states", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/House of Representatives\"],\"author\":\"Stephanie McNeal\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Republican candidate running for Congress in 4 different states\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446996215919.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-02T05:00:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"5f97e600-2a5b-4e60-89aa-b4848e00d657\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time.", "dc.identifier": "5f97e600-2a5b-4e60-89aa-b4848e00d657", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "houseofreps", "description": "A 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Republican Candidate Running For Congress In 4 Different States", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-31 10:31:22 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time.", "title": "Republican candidate running for Congress in 4 different states | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446996215919.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-02-02", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/House of Representatives\"],\"author\":\"Stephanie McNeal\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Republican candidate running for Congress in 4 different states\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446996215919.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-02T05:00:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/republican-candidate-running-for-congress-in-4-different-states.html\",\"post_id\":\"5f97e600-2a5b-4e60-89aa-b4848e00d657\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Stephanie McNeal"}, "article_summary": "The 11th district is holding its open primary in May, three months earlier than the other states where Levene is running.\nAllan Levene is running for the House of Representatives in his home state of Georgia -- as well as Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii.\nAll four of the districts Levene is running in are districts in which the incumbent is not seeking another term.\nHowever, K.
