"She's so lovely and told me she's excited to have me on tour," the Australian singer-songwriter told Billboard backstage at Governors Ball 2015 in New York.

The "Riptide" singer also shared the story of how he came up with his stage name.



"I was at university about three or four years ago and I went to a used bookstand and picked up this book," he explains. "About 20 pages into it there's a character called Vance Joy. I just liked the way the name sounded and the way it looked on the page. I had a secret little dream to do music and also perform under an alias. So I started to call myself Vance Joy."
