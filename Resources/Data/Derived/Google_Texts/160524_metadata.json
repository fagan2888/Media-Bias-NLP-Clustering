That would put our workers and our businesses at a massive disadvantage. We can\u2019t let that happen. We should write those rules.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans favor fast-track legislation but many Democratic oppose it, with their labor allies fearing it will lead to the loss of unionized jobs. Last year, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to consider a bill, and a majority of House Democrats are on record opposing it.\n\nThe president said he recognizes that past trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s \u201chaven\u2019t always lived up to the hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should close ourselves off from new opportunities, and sit on the sidelines while other countries write our future for us,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe should seize those opportunities.\u201d\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, has called for hearing next week to consider trade policy, possibly including the new bill. But the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, said a deal isn\u2019t ready yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With congressional negotiators nearing a deal to speed approval of trade agreements, President Obama called on lawmakers Saturday to complete the legislation that is opposed by many Democrats and labor groups.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With congressional negotiators nearing a deal to speed approval of trade agreements, President Obama called on lawmakers Saturday to complete the legislation that is opposed by many Democrats and labor groups.", "title": "Obama calls on Congress to grant him \u2018fast track\u2019 trade authority", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/21/obama-calls-congress-grant-him-fast-track-trade-au/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/21/Obama_National_Monuments.JPEG-07fa7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/21/Obama_National_Monuments.JPEG-07fa7.jpg", "description": "With congressional negotiators nearing a deal to speed approval of trade agreements, President Obama called on lawmakers Saturday to complete the legislation that is opposed by many Democrats and labo", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama calls on Congress to grant him \u2018fast track\u2019 trade au"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Senate"}, "article_summary": "With congressional negotiators nearing a deal to speed approval of trade agreements, President Obama called on lawmakers Saturday to complete the legislation that is opposed by many Democrats and labor groups.\n\u201cThis is bipartisan legislation that would protect American workers, and promote American businesses, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\u2019t just free, but are fair,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his weekly address.\nMr. Obama said the trade agreement is important because \u201c95 percent of the world\u2019s potential customers live outside our borders.\u201d\u201cMany of them live in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 the world\u2019s fastest-growing region,\u201d he said.\nSEE ALSO: Obama vows to \u2018squeeze every last little bit of change\u2019 out of final two yearsMr. Obama is trying to finish a 12-nation Pacific trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the centerpiece of his long-range plan to rebalance U.S. policy toward Asia.\n\u201cAnd as we speak, China is trying to write the rules for trade in the 21st century."}
