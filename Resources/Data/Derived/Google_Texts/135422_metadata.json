And I then asked them, as they were planning their crimes, how they would react if they knew that a particular homeowner was armed. Would they:\n\nbreak into the house because you once heard a politician or journalist assert that gun ownership doesn\u2019t deter crime? decide after a bit of reflection about potential costs and benefits that it might be more prudent to find another house to rob?\n\nMy goal was to help well-meaning leftists understand that criminals respond to incentives. And even the really stupid ones will seek to maximize how much they can steal while minimizing the risk of bad outcomes.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a criminal, one potential bad outcome is getting shot by an armed homeowner.\n\nThe same cost-benefit analysis applies to mass shooters. Regardless of whether these shooters are motivated by feelings of inadequacy or Islamofascist ideology, their goal is to kill as many people as possible before being stopped.\n\nSo it makes sense, from their warped perspective, to seek out \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\n\nAnd when these nut-jobs start shooting in places where there\u2019s very little likelihood that they\u2019ll encounter immediate armed resistance, that means a higher body count.\n\nWhich is what happened at Fort Hood. And in Santa Barbara. And in Newtown, Connecticut. And at the Aurora movie theater. And at Virginia Tech. And now in Chattanooga.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo from the recent shooting spree by Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez. Notice the sign, right by all the bullet holes, stating that \u201cFirearms Are Prohibited In This Facility.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, this sign didn\u2019t stop the attack. It may have even encouraged the attack.\n\nIn any event, the rule did affect one group of people, as Sean Davis explained forThe Federalist.\n\nThe gun-free zone sign didn\u2019t prevent the shooter from firing a gun at completely innocent individuals within the zone. It did, however, prevent them from defending themselves.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the really depressing part of this tragedy. The military personnel targeted by the terrorist weren\u2019t unarmed because Chattanooga had bad policy.\n\nThey were unarmed because of federal government policy. Writing for Fox News, John Lott explains this bizarre policy.\n\nArmy regulations are very clear stating that personnel cannot have firearms during their official duties. Last year the Obama administration instituted interim rules that clearly prohibit privately owned weapons from all federally leased office and land, including recruiters\u2019 offices. \u2026With the exceptions of military police, military personnel are banned from having weapons on base, in federally leased buildings, or while they are carrying out official duties. For would-be terrorists among us there is an abundance of possible targets. \u2026Allowing military personnel to at least defend themselves reduces the number of easy targets that terrorists/killers can attack.\n\nAmen. Let members of the military have the ability to defend themselves.\n\nAnd expand concealed-carry laws so that citizens also have greater ability to thwart crime and mass shootings.\n\nP.S. I shared above a great cartoon from Chuck Asay. You can click here to see another. And these two posters make the same point quite effectively.\n\nP.P.S. While folks on the left are one of the targets of my IQ test, not all liberals are misguided on the gun issue. As you can read here and here, there are a couple of them who put reason ahead of ideology.\n\nP.P.P.S. It\u2019s also encouraging to note that some lawmakers realize it\u2019s a good idea to have more protection for schoolchildren.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chattanooga, Chattanooga Tennessee, gun free zones, gun control, gun-free zone", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "In the it Chattanooga shooting, Aurora, and Newtown it made sense from the perpetrators' warped perspective to seek and commit crime in gun-free zones.", "title": "Deadly Impact of Gun-Free Zone on Display in Chattanooga Shooting", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gun-Control-Failure-One-Photo.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2015-07-18T14:33:31-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/07/18/deadly-impact-of-gun-free-zone-on-display-in-chattanooga-shooting/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the it Chattanooga shooting, Aurora, and Newtown it made sense from the perpetrators' warped perspective to seek and commit crime in gun-free zones.", "creator": "@danieljmitchell", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gun-Control-Failure-One-Photo.jpg", "title": "Deadly Impact of Gun-Free Zone on Display in Chattanooga Shooting | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/07/18/deadly-impact-of-gun-free-zone-on-display-in-chattanooga-shooting/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/28168", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/28168", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Policy", "tag": "Military", "published_time": "2015-07-18T14:31:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T14:33:31-04:00"}, "description": "In the it Chattanooga shooting, Aurora, and Newtown it made sense from the perpetrators' warped perspective to seek and commit crime in gun-free zones."}, "article_summary": "The gun-free zone sign didn\u2019t prevent the shooter from firing a gun at completely innocent individuals within the zone.\nThe military personnel targeted by the terrorist weren\u2019t unarmed because Chattanooga had bad policy.\n\u2026Allowing military personnel to at least defend themselves reduces the number of easy targets that terrorists/killers can attack.\n\u2026With the exceptions of military police, military personnel are banned from having weapons on base, in federally leased buildings, or while they are carrying out official duties.\nWould they:break into the house because you once heard a politician or journalist assert that gun ownership doesn\u2019t deter crime?"}
