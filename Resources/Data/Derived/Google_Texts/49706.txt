Police are looking for four men who allegedly kidnapped a woman in south Wichita and forced her to give them her debit card.

It happened around 1:45 a.m. Saturday in the 1500 block of East El Monte, near I-135 and Hydraulic. Sgt. Roger Runft said a 19-year-old woman was outside her home when four men pulled up in a car.

The victim told police one of the men pulled a gun and forced her into the car. They drove to the QuikTrip at Hydraulic and Wassall, where one man used her debit cart to withdrawal $300.

When the suspects were done at the QuikTrip, they drove back near the woman's residence and threw her from the car, Sgt. Runft said. She was not injured.

Sgt. Runft said the victim was unable to provide detailed descriptions of the suspects and their car. Officers are currently reviewing surveillance video from the QuikTrip.

Anyone with information is asked to call police or Crime Stoppers at (316)267-2111.
