The city of Coon Rapids and its police officers unions have reached a three-year contract agreement that includes raises each year.

Officers will receive a 2.25 percent pay increase in 2014, 2.5 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016. Officer salaries start at $51,300 and top out at $73,274 this year. The sergeant salary is $89,400.

"The increases were consistent with what's been offered citywide," said Police Chief Brad Wise.

The City Council approved terms of the deal on March 4. Members of the Law Enforcement Labor Services Local 207 and Law Enforcement Labor Services Local 362, which represents the city's police sergeants, ratified the contract in February.

Coon Rapids employs 64 sworn officers.

Officers had seen smaller bumps in previous years, the chief said.
