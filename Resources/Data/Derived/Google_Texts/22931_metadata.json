I'm hoping she's innocent but then a good guilty until proven innocent show trial is always fun to watch. My concern is May is flirting with disaster with Marco Rubio and Donald Trump. She's being accused of giving panties to a guy called \"Mario\" but Trump has them in his hands. I'm also looking for clarification with this problem. Putout is a victim in all of this for sure. If she is not guilty of the panty problem, I'm thinking the avatar issue is also the work of her twin sister Wil?\n\nComrade Walrus, have you volunteered as co-conspirator counsel for the defense? The purpose of a show trial is the presentation and documentation of evidence proving guilt, and while Sister Wil Putout may have briefly worn the evidence, (briefly...panties, see what I did there?) are not the initials on the panties MP? As the Donald is not a Member of Parliament, might they be the initials of the accused? So it seems!\n\n\n\nComrade Putout's filthy frothy panties will be stored in a Ziploc bag and entered into evidence.\n\n\n\nSay, just why would a Member of the Party be at the Rethuglikkkan convention without panties?

I was being followed by Captain Craptek on the way out last month. I wanted noone to follow me so I gave half the list of chastity belt codes to my comrade for a promise he would not track me to my whereabouts. I do not know who to tell about that problem, because I completely forgot who was on the list. I for one did not put me in the list since I did not use a 5 digit code lock.

Can we take a break and pass the peanut butter around?\n\n\n\nForgive my tardiness to the show trial comrades, as I am fashionably late. However I have some damning evidence against \"Comrade\" Putout that I think the collective should know about....\n\n\n\nDuring one of my many late night wanderings of the gulags, I overheard that disgusting pig Rush Limbaugh from Putouts quarters. Upon further investigation I discovered a secret radio that she has been concealing along with her rations of nuts. Why she has been hoarding nuts is not something I wish to spend too much time thinking about, but I can only assume that Craptek is somehow involved.\n\n\n\nSo not only has she been listening secretly to non-party-approved media, she has also been using unauthorized energy to power that radio and thus contributing to global warming all while hoarding goods for nefarious purposes. I nearly vomited when I stumbled on this, Comrades.\n\n\n\nEmergency State Of The Cube Speech\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN CRAPTEK: (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Everybody be seated. Thank you very much. (Applause continues.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause continues.) Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Please be seated. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nLet me begin by thanking The People\u2019s Cube for their extraordinary hospitality and to thank all the great progs, proles, and even the trolls who are in attendance here today.\n\n\n\nThroughout TPC\u2019s history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare, and then there are the years that come along once in a generation, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course for our collective. This is one of those years.\n\n\n\nWe start 2016 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly 300 million pixels have now been lost, and on Friday we're likely to learn that we lost more pixels last year than at any time since Last Tuesday.\u2122 Just in the past week, another 2.8 million pixels that require and need new images have had to settle for reworked photos. Creation has hit a 10-year low. Many art galleries cannot borrow pixels or make images. Many families cannot play Pong or use Etch-a-Sketch. Many lurid sites are watching their pornography disappear. And many, many comrades are both anxious and uncertain of what the future will hold.\n\n\n\nNow, I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this production slow down could linger for years. The underproduction rate could reach triple digits. Our output could fall one terabit short of its full capacity, which translates into more than 10 million lost images for a family of four. We could lose a generation of potential and promise, as more young TCP\u2019ers are forced to forgo dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our site could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing in the world.\n\n\n\nIn short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.\n\n\n\nThis crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the artwork cycle, and we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from Internet boardrooms to the halls of power at TPC itself.\n\n\n\nFor years, too many TPC Komissars made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking pixels with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability. Sites made downloads without concern for whether members could use them, and some members took advantage of cheap pixels to take on storage requirements they didn\u2019t have. Komissars issued pixels without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring social points instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our Website, our pixel markets and our Komissars.\n\n\n\nNow, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond our ability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness. It will take time, perhaps many years, but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity.\n\n\n\nWe should never forget that our workers are still more unproductive than any on Earth. Our visual propaganda is still the envy of the world. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative Progs and the most advanced steam technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still the Website that has overcome great fears and improbable odds.\n\n\n\nIf we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again. That is why I have moved quickly to work with my Pixel Equality Team members and leaders of TPC on a Pixel Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump- start pixel creation and long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture of \"anything goes\" that helped create it. And this change must begin in the Gallery of Visual Agitation. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It is time to finally change the ways of TPC so that we can set a new and better course for the USSA.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to the pixel deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of art production, clever cartoons, and confidence in TPC.\n\n\n\nIt is true that we cannot depend on Komissars alone to create pixels or long lasting works of art, but at this particular moment, only Komissars can provide the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a shortage this deep and severe.\n\n\n\nOnly Komissars can break the cycle that is crippling our Website -- where a lack of Photoshopping leads to lost images which leads to even less Photoshopping; where an inability to download and borrow pixels stops production and leads to even fewer pixels.\n\n\n\nThat's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need to put pixels on the hard drives of TPC Comrades, create new images, and invest in our future. That's why we need to restart the flow of pixels and restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never happens again.\n\n\n\nAnd this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save or create at least 3 trillion pixels over the next few years. It is not just another TCP-works program; it's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there are millions of TPC comrades trying to draw pictures even as, all around the country, there's are so many images to be modified. And that's why we'll invest in priorities like new servers and Wacom tablets; art lessons and a new pen nibs that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the images created will be in the Private Gallery, while our plan will save the Public Gallery jobs of ad agencies, Thought Police officers, Webmasters and others who provide vital services.\n\n\n\nTo finally spark a thriving People\u2019s State-Run Store #86, we will double the production of pixels in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75 percent of TPC buildings and improve the download speed of 2 million USSA homes, saving progs billions on their pixel bills. In the process, we will put other comrades to work in new pixel production facilities that promise pay at some point in the future and might not be outsourced -- jobs coloring B&W images, building solar panels and wind turbines to power TPC headquarters, constructing comfortable, fast cars for all Komissars, and developing the new image technologies that will lead to even more jobs for proles, more savings for Komissars, and a nicer, more comfortable planet in the bargain.\n\n\n\nTo improve the quality of our images while lowering their cost, we will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years all of USSA\u2019s pixel re-distribution records are computerized. This will improve waste, add red tape, and increase the need to repeat expensive pixel testing. But it just won't save billions of pixels and dozens of Komissars, it will save The Children\u2122 by reducing preventable waste and abuse that pervades our pixel distribution system.\n\n\n\nTo give The Children\u2122 the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been less competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges and public universities with 21st-century digital sketch pads, graphics software and free Master of Advanced Street Theater degrees. We'll provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston can compete with kids in Beijing for unpaid intern positions at the future TPC Website.\n\n\n\nTo build a work force that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild the USSA. Yes, we'll put proles to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy and needed infrastructure projects, but we'll also do more to retrofit the USSA for a global economy. That means updating the way we distribute our electricity by starting to build a new TPC smart grid that will save Komissar\u2019s money, protect Komissar\u2019s power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver free, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our TPC complex. It means expanding broadband lines across the USSA so that a poor black artist in a downtown hovel can connect and sketch with their rich counterparts anywhere in the world. And it means investing in the science, research and technology that will lead to new graphics breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new ways of producing free stuff.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to cities, proles and families who are bearing the brunt of this pixel shortage. To get people drawing again, 95 percent of prole families will receive a thousand-pixel increase in their monthly allocation. This is the first stage of a working-class pixel increase that I propose for our next budget. To help TPC\u2019ers who have sold their iPads and can't find free ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extension of unemployed pixel worker insurance and O-care coverage to help them through this crisis. Komissars at every level will have to tighten their belts, but we'll help struggling proles avoid harmful pixel cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the pixels to maintain essential services like Thought Police, firing squads, and re-education camps.\n\n\n\nNow, I understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our Komissars have already expended a good many pixels, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more free stuff or faster pixel download speeds. And that's why the Pixel Recovery and Reinvestment Plan won't just throw pixels at our problems; we'll invest in what works. The true test of the policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Progish or Rethuglikkkan ideas, whether they're Regressive or Progressive ideas, but whether they create pixels, grow our Website, and put Next Tuesday\u2122 within reach of USSA proles.\n\n\n\nInstead of Komissars doling out pixels behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we download will be made transparently, and informed by our independent experts wherever possible. Every TPCer will be able to hold TPC accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their pixels are being downloaded. And as I announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary downloading that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and The Children\u2019s\u2122 future than it is right now.\n\n\n\nWe have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the pixel industry recovers, the deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people don't have confidence that we're getting our pixel house in order. And that's why our goal is not to create a slew of new TPC programs, but a foundation for long-term pixel growth.\n\n\n\nThat also means a recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects. I understand that every Komissar has ideas about how to distribute pixels, and many of these projects are worthy. They benefit \u201cspecial\u201d communities. But this emergency must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be a time when Komissars put the urgent needs of our Website above their own narrow interests.\n\n\n\nNow, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. We must also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the distribution system we all depend on. That means using our full arsenal of brushes, color wheels, and selection tools to get artwork flowing again to TPC families, while restoring confidence in our site. It means launching a sweeping effort to address the mal-distribution crisis so that we can keep responsible downloaders supplied. It means preventing the catastrophic failure of hard drives whose collapse could endanger the entire Internet, but only with maximum protections for TPC and a clear understanding that Komissar support for any prole is an extraordinary action that must come with significant restrictions on the proles that receive support. And it means reforming a weak and outdated download system so that we can better withstand pixel shocks and better protect photographers, artists and visual propagandists from the reckless greed and risk- taking that must never endanger our site again.\n\n\n\nNo longer can we allow TCP wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longer can we allow special interests to put their Cubes on the economic scales. No longer can we allow the unscrupulous downloading and selling that leads only to destructive cycles of bubbling and busting pixels.\n\n\n\nIt is time to set a new course for this Website, and that change must begin now. We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but I urge Komissars to move as quickly as possible on behalf of TPC. For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more TPC\u2019ers will lose their pixels; more proles will lose available RAM; more wet-dreams will be deferred and denied; and our Website will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.\n\n\n\nThat is not the Website I know. It is not a future I accept as a Komissar of TPC. A world that depends on the strength of our site is now watching and waiting for TPC to lead once more, and that is what we will do.\n\n\n\nIt will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better. But that is all the more reason for Komissars to act without delay. I know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We have already tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning.\n\n\n\nAnd that is why the time has come to build a 21st-century Website in which equal distribution of quality pixels is once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Komissars to work with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next few weeks. That's why I'm calling on all TPC\u2019ers to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles, a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship, and insist that the first question each of us asks is \"What's in it for me?\" not \"What's good for the country my children will inherit?\"\n\n\n\nMore than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront these challenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down power outages, denial of service attacks, and hackers themselves. And if we do -- if we are able to summon that spirit again; if are able to look out for one another and listen to one another, and do our part for our community and for The Children\u2122 - then I have no doubt that, years from now, we will look back on 2016 as one of those years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for The People\u2019s Cube.\n\n\n\nThank you, Marx bless you, and may Marx bless The People\u2019s Cube.

Thank you so much.Let me begin by thanking The People\u2019s Cube for their extraordinary hospitality and to thank all the great progs, proles, and even the trolls who are in attendance here today.Throughout TPC\u2019s history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare, and then there are the years that come along once in a generation, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course for our collective. This is one of those years.We start 2016 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly 300 million pixels have now been lost, and on Friday we're likely to learn that we lost more pixels last year than at any time since Last Tuesday.\u2122 Just in the past week, another 2.8 million pixels that require and need new images have had to settle for reworked photos. Creation has hit a 10-year low. Many art galleries cannot borrow pixels or make images. Many families cannot play Pong or use Etch-a-Sketch. Many lurid sites are watching their pornography disappear. And many, many comrades are both anxious and uncertain of what the future will hold.Now, I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this production slow down could linger for years. The underproduction rate could reach triple digits. Our output could fall one terabit short of its full capacity, which translates into more than 10 million lost images for a family of four. We could lose a generation of potential and promise, as more young TCP\u2019ers are forced to forgo dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our site could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing in the world.In short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.This crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the artwork cycle, and we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from Internet boardrooms to the halls of power at TPC itself.For years, too many TPC Komissars made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking pixels with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability. Sites made downloads without concern for whether members could use them, and some members took advantage of cheap pixels to take on storage requirements they didn\u2019t have. Komissars issued pixels without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring social points instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our Website, our pixel markets and our Komissars.Now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond our ability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness. It will take time, perhaps many years, but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity.We should never forget that our workers are still more unproductive than any on Earth. Our visual propaganda is still the envy of the world. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative Progs and the most advanced steam technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still the Website that has overcome great fears and improbable odds.If we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again. That is why I have moved quickly to work with my Pixel Equality Team members and leaders of TPC on a Pixel Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump- start pixel creation and long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture of \"anything goes\" that helped create it. And this change must begin in the Gallery of Visual Agitation. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It is time to finally change the ways of TPC so that we can set a new and better course for the USSA.There is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to the pixel deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of art production, clever cartoons, and confidence in TPC.It is true that we cannot depend on Komissars alone to create pixels or long lasting works of art, but at this particular moment, only Komissars can provide the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a shortage this deep and severe.Only Komissars can break the cycle that is crippling our Website -- where a lack of Photoshopping leads to lost images which leads to even less Photoshopping; where an inability to download and borrow pixels stops production and leads to even fewer pixels.That's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need to put pixels on the hard drives of TPC Comrades, create new images, and invest in our future. That's why we need to restart the flow of pixels and restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never happens again.And this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save or create at least 3 trillion pixels over the next few years. It is not just another TCP-works program; it's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there are millions of TPC comrades trying to draw pictures even as, all around the country, there's are so many images to be modified. And that's why we'll invest in priorities like new servers and Wacom tablets; art lessons and a new pen nibs that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the images created will be in the Private Gallery, while our plan will save the Public Gallery jobs of ad agencies, Thought Police officers, Webmasters and others who provide vital services.To finally spark a thriving People\u2019s State-Run Store #86, we will double the production of pixels in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75 percent of TPC buildings and improve the download speed of 2 million USSA homes, saving progs billions on their pixel bills. In the process, we will put other comrades to work in new pixel production facilities that promise pay at some point in the future and might not be outsourced -- jobs coloring B&W images, building solar panels and wind turbines to power TPC headquarters, constructing comfortable, fast cars for all Komissars, and developing the new image technologies that will lead to even more jobs for proles, more savings for Komissars, and a nicer, more comfortable planet in the bargain.To improve the quality of our images while lowering their cost, we will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years all of USSA\u2019s pixel re-distribution records are computerized. This will improve waste, add red tape, and increase the need to repeat expensive pixel testing. But it just won't save billions of pixels and dozens of Komissars, it will save The Children\u2122 by reducing preventable waste and abuse that pervades our pixel distribution system.To give The Children\u2122 the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been less competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges and public universities with 21st-century digital sketch pads, graphics software and free Master of Advanced Street Theater degrees. We'll provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston can compete with kids in Beijing for unpaid intern positions at the future TPC Website.To build a work force that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild the USSA. Yes, we'll put proles to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy and needed infrastructure projects, but we'll also do more to retrofit the USSA for a global economy. That means updating the way we distribute our electricity by starting to build a new TPC smart grid that will save Komissar\u2019s money, protect Komissar\u2019s power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver free, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our TPC complex. It means expanding broadband lines across the USSA so that a poor black artist in a downtown hovel can connect and sketch with their rich counterparts anywhere in the world. And it means investing in the science, research and technology that will lead to new graphics breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new ways of producing free stuff.And finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to cities, proles and families who are bearing the brunt of this pixel shortage. To get people drawing again, 95 percent of prole families will receive a thousand-pixel increase in their monthly allocation. This is the first stage of a working-class pixel increase that I propose for our next budget. To help TPC\u2019ers who have sold their iPads and can't find free ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extension of unemployed pixel worker insurance and O-care coverage to help them through this crisis. Komissars at every level will have to tighten their belts, but we'll help struggling proles avoid harmful pixel cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the pixels to maintain essential services like Thought Police, firing squads, and re-education camps.Now, I understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our Komissars have already expended a good many pixels, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more free stuff or faster pixel download speeds. And that's why the Pixel Recovery and Reinvestment Plan won't just throw pixels at our problems; we'll invest in what works. The true test of the policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Progish or Rethuglikkkan ideas, whether they're Regressive or Progressive ideas, but whether they create pixels, grow our Website, and put Next Tuesday\u2122 within reach of USSA proles.Instead of Komissars doling out pixels behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we download will be made transparently, and informed by our independent experts wherever possible. Every TPCer will be able to hold TPC accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their pixels are being downloaded. And as I announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary downloading that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and The Children\u2019s\u2122 future than it is right now.We have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the pixel industry recovers, the deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people don't have confidence that we're getting our pixel house in order. And that's why our goal is not to create a slew of new TPC programs, but a foundation for long-term pixel growth.That also means a recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects. I understand that every Komissar has ideas about how to distribute pixels, and many of these projects are worthy. They benefit \u201cspecial\u201d communities. But this emergency must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be a time when Komissars put the urgent needs of our Website above their own narrow interests.Now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. We must also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the distribution system we all depend on. That means using our full arsenal of brushes, color wheels, and selection tools to get artwork flowing again to TPC families, while restoring confidence in our site. It means launching a sweeping effort to address the mal-distribution crisis so that we can keep responsible downloaders supplied. It means preventing the catastrophic failure of hard drives whose collapse could endanger the entire Internet, but only with maximum protections for TPC and a clear understanding that Komissar support for any prole is an extraordinary action that must come with significant restrictions on the proles that receive support. And it means reforming a weak and outdated download system so that we can better withstand pixel shocks and better protect photographers, artists and visual propagandists from the reckless greed and risk- taking that must never endanger our site again.No longer can we allow TCP wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longer can we allow special interests to put their Cubes on the economic scales. No longer can we allow the unscrupulous downloading and selling that leads only to destructive cycles of bubbling and busting pixels.It is time to set a new course for this Website, and that change must begin now. We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but I urge Komissars to move as quickly as possible on behalf of TPC. For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more TPC\u2019ers will lose their pixels; more proles will lose available RAM; more wet-dreams will be deferred and denied; and our Website will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.That is not the Website I know. It is not a future I accept as a Komissar of TPC. A world that depends on the strength of our site is now watching and waiting for TPC to lead once more, and that is what we will do.It will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better. But that is all the more reason for Komissars to act without delay. I know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We have already tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning.And that is why the time has come to build a 21st-century Website in which equal distribution of quality pixels is once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Komissars to work with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next few weeks. That's why I'm calling on all TPC\u2019ers to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles, a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship, and insist that the first question each of us asks is \"What's in it for me?\" not \"What's good for the country my children will inherit?\"More than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront these challenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down power outages, denial of service attacks, and hackers themselves. And if we do -- if we are able to summon that spirit again; if are able to look out for one another and listen to one another, and do our part for our community and for The Children\u2122 - then I have no doubt that, years from now, we will look back on 2016 as one of those years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for The People\u2019s Cube.Thank you, Marx bless you, and may Marx bless The People\u2019s Cube.
