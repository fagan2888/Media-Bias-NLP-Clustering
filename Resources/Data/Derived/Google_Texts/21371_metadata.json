At the time, Pamela Torgerson, director of Southwest UniServ, the district headquarters for KNEA, said the decision could turn out badly.\n\n\u201cMy concern with that is that without any kind of organizational backing, it\u2019s going to be hard for the teachers there to enforce their negotiated agreement,\u201d Torgerson said. \u201cSo, if they get into trouble during bargaining, they have to go to mediation on their own. And if things work out even worse and they decide to go to fact-finding, they\u2019re pretty much on their own.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Crandall said, the opposite has happened. Negotiations prior to the current school year were smooth and uneventful, he said. The rocky part, he said, has been KNEA\u2019s response following its expulsion from Deerfield USD 216.\n\n\u201cI was a member of KNEA for 27 years and the president of our local association here for over 15 years, and I did not see how they manipulate statements and try to \u2018bully\u2019 others that oppose them until after I helped us to decertify,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to tell some of our younger teachers they need to be scared, especially now with the new tenure rule, and it\u2019s got some of our new teachers antsy.\u201d\n\nSo antsy, he said, that he has heard KNEA is filing paperwork to have Deerfield faculty re-vote on the union\u2019s decertified status.\n\nUnion representatives didn\u2019t respond to calls for comment.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after teachers in the Deerfield, Kan., school district voted to leave their union, leaders say the doom-and-gloom predictions haven\u2019t come true.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A year after teachers in the Deerfield, Kan., school district voted to leave their union, leaders say the doom-and-gloom predictions haven\u2019t come true.", "title": "One Year Later: Kansas Teachers Vote to Leave Union", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/859245_447232398690896_323401824_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-20T22:24:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tnlRj2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A year after teachers in the Deerfield, Kan., school district voted to leave their union, leaders say the doom-and-gloom predictions haven\u2019t come true.", "title": "One Year Later: Kansas Teachers Vote to Leave Union", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/859245_447232398690896_323401824_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12,state reforms", "published_time": "2014-08-21T03:01:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T22:24:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "education, teachers union, state reforms, KNEA, kansas teachers union"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaabf\"", "article_summary": "OSAWATOMIE, Kan. \u2014 More than a year after teachers in the Deerfield, Kan., school district voted to leave their union, leaders say the doom-and-gloom predictions from the state\u2019s largest teachers union haven\u2019t come to pass.\nIn May 2013, faculty in Deerfield Unified School District 216 voted to decertify KNEA, meaning the union no longer could negotiate with local board of education members on teachers\u2019 behalf.\nAt the time, Pamela Torgerson, director of Southwest UniServ, the district headquarters for KNEA, said the decision could turn out badly.\n\u201cThings are going pretty well, actually,\u201d said Doug Crandall, a teacher who also is president of the newly revived Deerfield Educators Association.\n\u201cMy concern with that is that without any kind of organizational backing, it\u2019s going to be hard for the teachers there to enforce their negotiated agreement,\u201d Torgerson said."}
