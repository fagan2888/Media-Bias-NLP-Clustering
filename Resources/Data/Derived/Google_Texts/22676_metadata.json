For business schools able to offer the right courses, this is a big opportunity.\n\n\u201cClearly you need skills in entrepreneurship, in how to be innovative and in how to scale something up in a cost-effective way,\u201d says Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School professor widely recognised for her healthcare research. \u201cThose skills are not traditionally taught on healthcare administration courses \u2013 those are skills that business schools focus on.\u201d\n\nThe need for business innovation in healthcare has never been so urgent. In Europe, cash-strapped governments with ageing populations are struggling to meet demand for increasing levels of care without pushing up spending. In response, the drive is for greater efficiency and collaboration between different practitioners and specialists. \u201cThe healthcare system is about much more than just treating patients,\u201d says Steve Chick, head of the Healthcare Management Initiative at Insead, which runs executive programmes for practitioners and policy makers. \u201cThe co-ordination of care is critical and that\u2019s where business schools can play a big role.\u2019\n\nIn the UK the severe budgetary squeeze on the National Health Service at a time of increasing demand for healthcare means NHS leaders need to do more with less.\n\n\u201cThe current decade ... is presenting those leading healthcare with the biggest challenges we\u2019ve seen since the establishment of the NHS,\u201d says Chris Ham, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, a leading healthcare think-tank.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging markets \u2013 many of which are still combating infectious diseases and infant mortality \u2013 face an additional burden in the rising incidence of conditions such as cancer and diabetes.\n\nPerhaps the most radical changes are taking place in the US. Healthcare in the country \u2013 public and private \u2013 is now 17.9 per cent of GDP, against 9.3 per cent in the UK, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nSweeping reforms in the US under the Affordable Care Act are reshaping care delivery and health insurance. With costs rising and mergers creating supersized hospital groups, a once fragmented industry is increasingly made up of large networks requiring accomplished leaders.\n\n\u201cThere will be more positions within those systems that will attract MBA talent and for which their skills are relevant,\u201d says June Kinney, associate director for the MBA in Health Care Management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton school.\n\nThe transformation of US healthcare systems is changing the kinds of candidates institutions are looking for, says Andrew Chastain, managing partner at Witt/Kieffer, an executive search firm focusing on healthcare. Consolidation and reforms are generating demand for executives skilled in operations, finance, supply chain management and IT.\n\nConsolidation is also bringing to an end the days when senior healthcare executives were responsible for managing everything from operations to finance and strategy. \u201cThose are getting sucked up to corporate, as you\u2019d see in any market that starts to consolidate,\u201d says Mr Chastain.\n\nIf positions for mainstream MBA graduates are growing in the healthcare sector, an increasing number of medical professionals are looking to pursue a health-focused MBA.\n\nWith its MBA Health Sector Management programme, The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University is among a number of schools offering MBAs \u2013 some run jointly with medical schools \u2013 designed for healthcare professionals. At Harvard Business School\u2019s Health Initiative, an MBA caters to students from fields such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals insurance and public health, and the school has several courses on entrepreneurship in healthcare. More recently, executive programmes have been emerging. Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business has just launched a two-year Business of Medicine MBA for practising physicians who are moving into leadership positions.\n\nBut if they are to keep up with the sector\u2019s growing demand for management education, business schools will have to expand dramatically the number and type of programmes they offer healthcare professionals. This will not be easy. Given the highly specialised nature of healthcare and the range of professional roles it encompasses \u2013 from surgeons to insurance brokers \u2013 schools will find it tough to recruit faculty staff capable of teaching the necessary skills.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for business schools is to take what they know and adapt it to healthcare,\u201d says Prof Herzlinger. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a lot of specific knowledge.\u201d\n\nA cultural shift will also be required before the MBA becomes a degree to which doctors or health administrators naturally turn. In the US, healthcare management education is largely provided by schools of public health and healthcare administration, not business schools.\n\nIn the UK, says Mr Ham, relatively few healthcare leaders have opted for a business school course. \u201cHistorically, MBAs were not seen in the NHS as having value,\u201d he explains.\n\nAcademics and policy makers believe this needs to change. And given the sector\u2019s size (it is the biggest employer in some markets) and the challenges it faces, management education could play an important role in equipping the next generation of leaders and introducing new business models to healthcare systems.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge opportunity for business schools,\u201d says Prof Herzlinger. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious mismatch between what the people who are changing healthcare need and the kind of education that\u2019s being provided.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "MBA ranking, MBA rankings, Business school rankings, ft mba ranking, financial times mba ranking, ft mba rankings, financial times mba rankings, financial times mba, Business school ranking, FT Business school rankings, Financial Times Business school rankings", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Times", "description": "Seismic demographic, political and economic shifts are demanding radical changes to global healthcare systems.
