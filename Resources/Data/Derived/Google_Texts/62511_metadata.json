In the beer-drinking cultures of Belgium and Germany, a 16-year-old can ask for beer or wine.\n\nDo you detect a flaw in this story?\n\nProhibition has been gone for over 80 years. Most agree that it was worse than the disease it was meant to eradicate \u2014 the scourge of drunkenness. Nowadays, backers of drug legalization rightly hold up Prohibition as their model for failed policy.\n\nYet we see few arguments for lowering the national drinking age from the current 21 to 18, where it was until 1984. On the contrary, the public is still being pummeled by \u201cexpert\u201d studies linking virtually any alcohol consumption to a variety of maladies, from cancer to road fatalities.\n\nBritain has just issued the U.K. chief medical officer\u2019s new guidelines for alcohol consumption. They\u2019re just short of nuts. They make no distinction between the ability of men and women to process alcohol. Wiser guidelines note that female bodies can\u2019t take as much.\n\nThe doctors set a weekly limit for drinking at a strangely low six pints of beer or four large glasses of wine. A 30-year-old male weightlifter or a 74-year old female \u201cwisp of a thing,\u201d same guideline.\n\nThe report goes on. Any amount of alcohol consumed on a regular basis raises the risk of mouth, throat and breast cancers. An Associated Press story on the guidelines authoritatively announces, \u201cAlcohol is a known carcinogen.\u201d How is that?\n\nThe Harvard School of Public Health has noted a link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer, but with an asterisk. \u201cGetting extra folate (a B vitamin) may cancel out this alcohol-related increase,\u201d according to its report titled \u201cAlcohol: Balancing Risks and Benefits.\u201d\n\nAs for the benefits, Harvard cites numerous studies showing moderate drinking seems to lower the risk of cardiovascular death. The British report made the most grudging nod in that direction. It said that red wine might be good for heart only if you are a woman over age 55 and drink no more than two glass a week.\n\nWould the good doctors please explain why moderate drinkers live longer than those who don\u2019t drink at all?\n\nThere\u2019s this urge to simply lay blame for all kinds of societal ills possibly related to alcohol on alcohol only. True, alcoholism is a curse for those afflicted and their loved-ones. What makes it a curse is the addiction part. Some people simply shouldn\u2019t drink.\n\nDrunken driving is a menace, but the problem is drinking and driving, not the drinking itself. The bar fly who pours himself into a taxi at the end of the evening is no danger on the road \u2014 far less so than the teetotaler fiddling with the car\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nBinge drinking is both unhealthy and unsightly. It reflects mostly immaturity and a lack of education on civilized drinking. Some of it, ironically, stems from drinking bans on college campuses. Former Kenyon College President S. Georgia Nugent has made this argument. She\u2019s written that students heading off to a party knowing no alcohol will be served engage in \u201cpre-gaming,\u201d that is, consuming huge quantities in advance.\n\nBritain has never taken this nanny talk seriously enough to raise its legal drinking age from the current 18. By the way, the drinking age in Canada is 19 and in almost all of Latin America, 18.\n\nAmerica stands pretty much alone in treating people old enough to marry, vote and fight in wars like children. Time to let 18-year-olds drink and manage themselves.\n\nE-mail Froma Harrop at fharrop@gmail.com.Follow her on Twitter: @FromaHarrop\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Harrop: Let 18-year-olds drink alcohol", "title": "Harrop: Let 18-year-olds drink alcohol", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/22/harrop-let-18-year-olds-drink-alcohol/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160122__20160124_Z00_OP24C_HARROPp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160122__20160124_Z00_OP24C_HARROPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-22T12:38:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:14:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Harvard School of Public Health has noted a link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer, but with an asterisk.\nThere\u2019s this urge to simply lay blame for all kinds of societal ills possibly related to alcohol on alcohol only.\nBy the way, the drinking age in Canada is 19 and in almost all of Latin America, 18.\nYet we see few arguments for lowering the national drinking age from the current 21 to 18, where it was until 1984.\nBritain has never taken this nanny talk seriously enough to raise its legal drinking age from the current 18."}
