Instead, they will be asked to pay more; the city lost $4.5 million in water sales last year because of the conservation efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to tell the consumer that \u2018Yeah, well, you guys did a great job out there conserving water, but lo and behold, we got hurt financially, so we\u2019ve got to raise your rates,\u2019 \u201d the assistant city manager, Jim Dockery, said.\n\nWichita Falls, whose total rainfall over the last three years was 33 inches below normal, is not alone in its water conservation conundrum. Several Texas cities have collectively lost tens of millions of dollars by restricting outdoor water use, which has been a main source of revenue. At the same time, most of their expenses, like paying off debt and infrastructure maintenance, have increased, forcing utilities to raise rates for everyone, regardless of their water use.\n\nThe losses have prompted credit ratings agencies to look closer at the finances of public utilities in Texas. One agency, Fitch, downgraded some of Fort Worth\u2019s water and sewer debt last year, and last week the firm downgraded the debt of the city\u2019s wholesale water supplier. Fort Worth lost $11 million last year because of water conservation.\n\n\u201cThis business is extremely weather-dependent,\u201d said Mary Gugliuzza, the Fort Worth water utility\u2019s spokeswoman. Rainy summers can also hurt a city\u2019s bottom line because residents do not need to water their lawns as much.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFort Worth\u2019s goal, like that of many other cities in Texas, is to change its rate structure to avoid such ups and downs. Today, about 17 percent of the utility\u2019s revenue comes from fixed monthly charges that all water customers pay regardless of how much they use; by 2018, Ms. Gugliuzza said, 25 percent of its revenue will come from such charges. Mr. Dockery said Wichita Falls is considering a similar transition.\n\nStill, the changes will be hard to swallow politically. Consumers have underpaid for water for decades, said Sharlene Leurig, a program director at Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group with which many Texas cities have consulted on water rate structures.\n\n\u201cPeople truly don\u2019t understand that the cost of having reliable water is not the cost of the water itself,\u201d Ms. Leurig said. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of all the infrastructure you have to put in place to provide that water reliably and safely.\u201d\n\nWichita Falls is spending about a million dollars on a pipeline that will deliver treated wastewater to a large manufacturing company, and the city will lose an additional $100,000 a year by selling the reused water at a discount.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying to save water, is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Dockery said. He added that the city has had to defer important maintenance projects because of the lost revenue.\n\nCities across Texas hope that utility revenues will bounce back once the rain returns. But even if the drought lifts, officials know that water users\u2019 habits have changed. They will never be the water-guzzlers they might have once been.\n\nWhile that is good news for conservationists, the phenomenon that credit ratings agencies call a \u201cdrought shadow\u201d will result in higher costs for all users, even the most water-conscious.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140208195313, "twitter": {"description": "Several Texas cities have lost tens of millions of dollars by restricting water use, a main source of revenue, and they are now raising rates to offset the losses.", "title": "Texans Answer Call to Save Water, Only to Face Higher Rates", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/us/texans-answer-call-to-save-water-only-to-face-higher-rates.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002696043"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/us/09ttConserve-1391715572791/09ttConserve-1391715572791-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/us/texans-answer-call-to-save-water-only-to-face-higher-rates.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002696043", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/us/texans-answer-call-to-save-water-only-to-face-higher-rates.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Texans Answer Call to Save Water, Only to Face Higher Rates", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 8, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "keywords": "Water,Conservation of Resources,Drought,Texas", "news_keywords": "Water,Drought,Texas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Neena Satija", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/us/09ttConserve-1391715572791/09ttConserve-1391715572791-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NEENA SATIJA", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Several Texas cities have lost tens of millions of dollars by restricting water use, a main source of revenue, and they are now raising rates to offset the losses.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/us/09ttConserve-1391715572791/09ttConserve-1391715572791-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Several Texas cities have lost tens of millions of dollars by restricting water use, a main source of revenue, and they are now raising rates to offset the losses.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-02-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Texas", "published": "2014-02-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "09ttconserve", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140209032603, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/us/texans-answer-call-to-save-water-only-to-face-higher-rates.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/us/09ttConserve-1391715572791/09ttConserve-1391715572791-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Several Texas cities have lost tens of millions of dollars by restricting water use, a main source of revenue, and they are now raising rates to offset the losses.", "title": "Texans Answer Call to Save Water, Only to Face Higher Rates"}, "pdate": 20140208, "des": "Drought", "articleid": 100000002696043, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Texans Answer Call to Save Water, Only to Face Higher Rates", "col": "The Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Instead, they will be asked to pay more; the city lost $4.5 million in water sales last year because of the conservation efforts.\nEven though the 100,000 residents of this northwest Texas city have substantially cut their water use, their dry lawns may no longer continue to save them money on their water bills.\nHe added that the city has had to defer important maintenance projects because of the lost revenue.\n\u201cPeople truly don\u2019t understand that the cost of having reliable water is not the cost of the water itself,\u201d Ms. Leurig said.\nOne agency, Fitch, downgraded some of Fort Worth\u2019s water and sewer debt last year, and last week the firm downgraded the debt of the city\u2019s wholesale water supplier."}
