But if you dig into the details, you can find the numbers that really matter. Here\u2019s some of what CBO reported about government spending in its forecast.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the federal budget has worsened dramatically over the past several years, in the wake of the 2007\u20132009 recession and slow recovery. \u2026If current law remained generally unchanged\u2026, federal spending rises from 20.5 percent of GDP this year to 25.3 percent of GDP by 2040.\n\nAnd why is the burden of spending going up?\n\nWell, here\u2019s a chart from CBO\u2019s slideshow presentation. I\u2019ve added some red arrows to draw attention to the most worrisome numbers.\n\nAs you can see, entitlement programs are the big problem, especially Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and ObamaCare.\n\nEven CBO agrees.\n\n\u2026spending for Social Security and the government\u2019s major health care programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and subsidies for health insurance purchased through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act\u2014would rise sharply, to 14.2 percent of GDP by 2040, if current law remained generally unchanged. That percentage would be more than twice the 6.5 percent average seen over the past 50 years.\n\nBy the way, while it\u2019s bad news that the overall burden of federal spending is expected to rise to more than 25 percent of GDP by 2040, I worry that the real number will be worse.\n\nAfter all, the forecast assumes that other spending will drop by 2.2 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2040. Yet is it really realistic to think that politicians won\u2019t increase \u2013 much less hold steady \u2013 the amount that\u2019s being spent on non-health welfare programs and discretionary programs?\n\nAnother key takeaway from the report is that it is preposterous to argue (like Obama\u2019s former economic adviser) that our long-run fiscal problems are caused by inadequate tax revenue.\n\nIndeed, tax revenues are projected to rise significantly over the next 25 years.\n\nFederal revenues would also increase relative to GDP under current law\u2026 Revenues would equal 19.4 percent of GDP by 2040, CBO projects, which would be higher than the 50-year average of 17.4 percent.\n\nHere\u2019s another slide from the CBO. I\u2019ve added a red arrow to show that the increase in taxation is due to a climbing income tax burden.\n\nThese CBO numbers are grim, but they could be considered the \u201crosy scenario.\u201d\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) produced their own analysis of the long-run fiscal outlook.\n\nLike the CBO, CRFB is too fixated on deficits and debt, but their report does have some additional projections of government spending.\n\nHere\u2019s the key table from the CRFB report. Not only do they show the CBO numbers for 2065 and 2090 under the baseline scenario, they also pull out CBO\u2019s \u201calternative fiscal scenario\u201d projections, which are based on more pessimistic (some would say more realistic) assumptions.\n\nAs you can see from my red arrows, federal spending will consume one-third of our economy\u2019s output based on the \u201cextended baseline scenario\u201d as we get close to the end of the century. So if you add state and local spending to the mix, the overall burden of spending will be higher than it is in Greece today.\n\nBut if you really want to get depressed, look at the \u201calternative fiscal scenario.\u201d The burden of federal spending soars to more than 50 percent of output. So when you add state and local government spending, the overall burden would be higher than what currently exists in any of Europe\u2019s welfare states.\n\nIn other words, America is destined to become Greece.\n\nUnless, of course, politicians can be convinced to follow my Golden Rule and exercise some much-needed spending restraint.\n\nThis would require genuine entitlement reform and discipline in other parts of the budget, steps that would not be popular from the perspective of Washington insiders.\n\nWhich is why we need some sort of external tool that mandates spending restraint, such as an American version of Switzerland\u2019s Debt Brake (which you can learn more about by watching a presentation from a representative of the Swiss Embassy).\n\nHeck, even the IMF agrees that spending caps are the only feasible solution.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Mitchell articles, Daniel J.
