At least two explosions have been heard near the Stade de France stadium, and French media is reporting of a hostage-taking in the capital.\n\nThe AP\u2019s twitter feed has the death toll climbing to at least 26 people. And President Francois Hollande has been evacuated due to an explosion at the main sports stadium.\n\n* This is going to be a pretty big deal when the decision comes down:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday decided to hear its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, agreeing to determine how far states may go in regulating the procedure without violating a woman\u2019s constitutional rights. It will be one of the court\u2019s most consequential rulings on the morally and politically divisive subject, and it will land just months before Americans choose a new president. The divide over protecting the unborn and safeguarding the right of a woman to choose is among the starkest differences between the Republican and Democratic candidates. Numerous states have enacted restrictions that lawmakers say protect a woman\u2019s health but abortion providers contend are merely pretext for making it more difficult to obtain an abortion or even making the procedure unavailable within a state\u2019s borders.\n\nI\u2019m convinced that there is no more disingenuous argument in all of American politics than when anti-choicers saying all their efforts to shut down abortion clinics are just intended to preserve women\u2019s health.\n\n* When you think charismatic leader known for bringing a majority of Americans behind him, the first name that comes to mind is Mitt Romney, right?\n\nSorry Mitt Romney fans: He\u2019s just not that in to running for president. Fresh off a new Washington Post report that GOP establishment leaders are calling on Romney, who has run and lost twice before, to reconsider his decision to stay out of the 2016 race, associates of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee tell CNN there are a lot of \u201cin bound\u201d calls but that there are \u201cno signs\u201d he\u2019s changed his mind. One friend of Romney\u2019s said there were some calls to Romney confidant Beth Meyers and others in his circle asking him to consider being a lifeline to the Republican Party and its chaotic primary fight.\n\nGive Romney some credit for (seemingly) realizing what a terrible idea this would be.\n\n* Robert Bentley, the governor of Alabama, is considering accepting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which would extend health coverage to 300,000 of his citizens.\n\nThis is particularly significant because right now Alabama is the stingiest state in the nation: if you make over 18 percent of the poverty level, or the princely sum of $4,365 a year for a family of four, the state considers you too rich to get Medicaid.\n\n* Harry Enten notes that when it comes to the assent of the party establishment, Hillary Clinton has more support than any presidential candidate in history.\n\n* Rebecca Leber interviews Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, who offers a preview of what sort of president she\u2019d be on environmental issues.\n\n* Pay close attention to this argument from Brian Beutler:\n\nIf the next president is a Democrat, he or she will be severely encumbered by the GOP\u2019s vise-like grip on Congress. The cardinal imperative of electing a Democrat in 2016 is to prevent Republicans from consolidating control of government and using it to regressive ends. Against that backdrop, the question of who\u2019s best equipped to advance progressive goals fades into near-irrelevance, behind the less-inspiring question of which candidate has the best chance of winning\u2014and the symbolic question of whether Clinton\u2019s gender should override doubts about her progressive bona fides. Is Hillary Clinton the most electable candidate? And even if she is, would her administration recall the \u201890s-era Democratic transgressions against poor and marginalized constituencies so much that it overrides the historic prerogative to elect a female president?\n\nThese questions and arguments are going to loom larger in importance as the voting begins.\n\n* Marco Rubio is charging that Ted Cruz is an amnesty-loving amnesty-lover, because he once offered an amendment to give undocumented immigrants work permits. Sahil Kapur investigates, and finds that now Cruz and his people say his amendment was just a poison pill meant to kill the bill.\n\nThis is the first time I can remember a senator proudly saying that his proposed legislative measure was a poison pill offered disingenuously.\n\n* Simon Maloy takes a deep dive into where the bickering Cruz and Rubio actually agree and disagree on immigration.\n\n* Jonathan Bernstein explains why electing a GOP president who promises to rein in Obama\u2019s reckless deficit-busting spending will almost certainly lead to larger deficits. \u2014 gs\n\n* Steve Benen brings us up to date on the latest from the GOP Congress: Republicans want to vote (again) on repealing Obamacare, but some don\u2019t want to repeal the Medicaid expansion. As Benen notes:\n\nRepublicans are eager to gut the American health care system, except for the popular parts that are actually delivering health security to American families\u2026.some Republican lawmakers are starting to realize that it\u2019s vastly easier to talk about \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d than it is to actually take Americans\u2019 benefits away to scratch a partisan itch.\n\nThis really isn\u2019t hard to solve. Just say the Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t actually Obamacare, vote to repeal only the unpopular stuff, and call it full repeal. \u2014 gs\n\n* The Center for American Progress does a thorough examination of the misery that governor-elect Matt Bevin of Kentucky would bring about if he follows through on his pledge to pull the state out of the Medicaid expansion and shut down its successful insurance exchange.\n\n* Robert Schlesinger explains why you shouldn\u2019t worry, neither Donald Trump nor Ben Carson will be the GOP nominee.\n\n* At The Week, I argued that Hillary Clinton should join Bernie Sanders and come out in favor of postal banking.\n\n* And I guess this was bound to happen sooner or later: Here\u2019s someone who says Ben Carson saved her daughter\u2019s life, but she\u2019s worried about the damage he could do as president, and documents how bad it could be for that daughter if Carson were to succeed in repealing the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Evening Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/13/evening-roundup/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-08-12/Reuters/2015-08-12T154047Z_01_NYK504_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-CARSON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/13/evening-roundup/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "plum line", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "plum line"}, "article_summary": "Just say the Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t actually Obamacare, vote to repeal only the unpopular stuff, and call it full repeal.\n* Jonathan Bernstein explains why electing a GOP president who promises to rein in Obama\u2019s reckless deficit-busting spending will almost certainly lead to larger deficits.\n* At The Week, I argued that Hillary Clinton should join Bernie Sanders and come out in favor of postal banking.\n* Robert Schlesinger explains why you shouldn\u2019t worry, neither Donald Trump nor Ben Carson will be the GOP nominee.\nAnd President Francois Hollande has been evacuated due to an explosion at the main sports stadium."}
