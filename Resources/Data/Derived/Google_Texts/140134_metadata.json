In the alternative, the lawyer would like the judge to order a new trial and set aside the verdict.\n\nNoting how the jury found Mid-Atlantic Military Family Communities, a subsidiary of Lincoln Military Housing, negligent for the mold, Stephen M. Smith said, \u201cI think there was confusion among the jurors,\u201d because the housing community was also not found to be in violation of the lease agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s contradictory.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday a spokesman for Lincoln Military Housing declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit involved the family of the Gunnery Sgt. Joe Federico and the Mid-Atlantic Military Family Communities.\n\nDuring the two-week trial in the U.S. District Court, Smith blamed the mold at the Norwich Manor complex for a variety of illnesses, including the claim that the mold caused the family to suffer permanent brain damage.\n\nU.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson initially ruled that the complex\u2019s defense attorneys failed to provide damning evidence to the plaintiffs in a timely fashion. He ordered the defense attorneys to stipulate at trial that mold was found in the property and remediation was required.\n\nThe defense was free to argue that the mold was not the cause for the injuries in question and that the complex owners made a reasonable initiative to fix the water problem.\n\nAdditional lawsuit among former tenants are expected, and Smith said 19 people have filed and more people are calling daily.\n\n\u201cHundreds. This may be going on for years and years,\u201d said Smith.\n\nSource: Marine\u2019s family gets $350K in mold lawsuit involving Norfolk military housing\n\nPhoto credit: pilotonline.com\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marine's family gets $350K in mold lawsuit involving Norfolk military housing$350K awarded to Marine\u2019s family.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "Marine's family gets $350K in mold lawsuit involving Norfolk military housing$350K awarded to Marine\u2019s family.", "title": "Marine's Family Gets $350K in Mold Lawsuit - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/571000ae3b7a4.image_.jpg", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/marines-family-gets-350k-in-mold-lawsuit/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-17T14:38:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Marine\u2019s family gets $350K in mold lawsuit involving Norfolk military housing$350K awarded to Marine\u2019s family in mold lawsuit in Norfolk military housing that was infested with mold, according to the family\u2019s lawyer.\nSource: Marine\u2019s family gets $350K in mold lawsuit involving Norfolk military housingPhoto credit: pilotonline.comJoin the Discussion\nJoe Federico and the Mid-Atlantic Military Family Communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s contradictory.\u201dOn Thursday a spokesman for Lincoln Military Housing declined to comment.\nHe ordered the defense attorneys to stipulate at trial that mold was found in the property and remediation was required."}
