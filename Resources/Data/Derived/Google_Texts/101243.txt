As Leah already reported, Sen. Bernie Sanders had a great night. He won resounding victories in the Washington State and Alaska caucuses, garnering 70+ percent of the vote. Now, the self-described Democratic socialist can add Hawaii to his list of victories, finishing his sweep of yesterday's primary contests. In Hawaii, Sanders crushed Clinton 70/29.

Democratic voters were feeling the Bern this weekend.
