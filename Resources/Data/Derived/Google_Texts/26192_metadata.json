That means many are forced to put off preventative care measures and eventually turn to expensive, overstressed emergency rooms once they become severely ill.\n\nNow, state officials are trying to find ways around the federal government's prohibition and provide various kinds of coverage to immigrants who don't qualify for Obamacare. Using state funds, California and New York are pioneering ways to offer comprehensive coverage for undocumented immigrants and others with temporary work visas. A handful of other states offer limited insurance coverage to subsets of immigrant populations. But experts warn such programs remain in the minority, and that the overall lack of health care coverage for immigrants in the United States could result in much higher medical bills in the future.\n\nBy 2016, 5.1 million undocumented immigrants in the United States will be uninsured, a group of UCLA researchers has estimated. In 2012, there were an estimated 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Under the 1986 policy EMTALA, hospitals cannot turn away a person in need of care, regardless of immigration status or ability to pay. Emergency treatment costs to Medicaid amounts to about $2 billion a year, mostly for illegal immigrants, according to a 2013 report by Kaiser Health News. In 2009, research by the Center for Immigration Studies estimated the cost of treating uninsured and undocumented immigrants at $4.3 billion per year at safety-net facilities like emergency rooms and community health clinics.\n\nAdvocates for immigrant health coverage say these sums might be less exorbitant if undocumented immigrants had regular primary care, which would be more accessible if they had insurance. \u201cThose bills could\u2019ve been drastically reduced,\u201d Frank Rodriguez, president of the Latino Health Care Forum, which offers health care outreach and enrollment assistance to the uninsured and underinsured in Texas, said. \u201cThere are no preventative health measures, so they [undocumented, uninsured immigrants] end up having to use emergency care.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, argue that providing health care to illegal immigrants will encourage more illegal immigration and that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for social services for those in the country without legal status. \"County hospitals are overwhelmed with uninsured people, and they've been forced to come up with more money to accommodate these people \u2014 largely because they've encouraged them to come in,\" Ira Mehlman, media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, has told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nUnauthorized immigrants could theoretically buy private health insurance, but that option is usually prohibitively expensive. \u201cUnauthorized immigrants are not eligible for almost any of the federal, state and local health care programs, and they tend to work in jobs that don\u2019t carry employer coverage,\u201d Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said.\n\nThe other health care option for undocumented immigrants is federally qualified health centers, which are reimbursed by and receive other funding from the government and do not ask questions about immigration status. But \u201cfederally qualified health centers don\u2019t do much primary health care because they\u2019re not reimbursed [for it],\u201d Rodriguez said. If a person sought primary medical services at such centers, they would likely have to pay out of pocket, albeit on a sliding fee scale. \u201cThe undocumented immigrants won\u2019t go,\u201d he said. Alvaro Huerta, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, called it \"shortsighted\" not to give undocumented and deferred action immigrants access to primary care, given how cost-effective such care be. \u201cEvery principle of health reform, [for the] documented or undocumented, says, put your money into preventative care, because you\u2019re going to be spending 100 times the investment in preventative care when people wind up sick in emergency rooms or hospitals,\" he said. On Jun. 15, 2012, the Obama administration issued an executive order granting certain undocumented immigrants immunity from deportation and making them eligible for work permits. A few months later, the administration explicitly restricted its policy so that these immigrants were not eligible for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. California has long been the vanguard for ensuring that immigrants have access to health care and insurance. It allows deferred action grantees under Obama's policies to enroll in Medi-Cal or a parallel public health insurance program, and lawmakers have also proposed legislation to grant all undocumented immigrants eligibility for the same two programs. Most recently, in December 2014, State Senator Ricardo Lara of California introduced SB 4, a bill that tries to make all undocumented immigrants eligible for Medi-Cal. Some counties in California also offer coverage to all undocumented immigrants. My Health LA, for instance, is a program in Los Angeles County specifically for the undocumented population. According to Steven Abramson, director of development and marketing for ChapCare, about 10 percent of the clinics\u2019 patients are covered under that program. In order to qualify, they have to prove that they live in the county and that their income level is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not perfect, but it\u2019s definitely better than the alternative, which is having nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn New York, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for coverage through the state\u2019s health care exchange. Nor are they eligible for Medicaid, unless a woman is pregnant. But unlike in other states, an immigrant who has received a work visa under Obama's immigration policies is eligible for Medicaid or another form of public health insurance, depending on income.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolute common sense,\" said Robert Hayes, the CEO of Community Healthcare Network NYC, which runs 11 federally qualified health centers plus a mobile van in New York City and serves undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile immigrants tender to be younger and thus healthier than the general population, if they develop chronic illnesses like diabetes that go undetected or untreated because of a lack of health insurance, the cost of treatment would be far higher down the road.\n\n\"These are usually young, healthy people now, that we could keep healthy, but like all of us will need medical care at some point in their lives,\" Huerta said. \"It\u2019s critical to get these people, who are American in everything but a piece of paper, access to care they need now before it becomes something we\u2019re paying for in the long run.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "immigration, health care reform 2015, daca, deferred action, daca expansion health care, daca 2015, obamacare illegal immigrants, obamacare unauthorized immigrants, affordable care act illegal immigrants, unauthorized immigrants health care, fqhcs, medi-c", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Health care and immigration reform policies explicitly prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining health insurance, but someone still has to pay when they need care.", "title": "Immigration, Health Care Reform 2015: States Move To Help Undocumented Immigrants Without Medical Insurance", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-health-care-reform-2015-states-move-help-undocumented-immigrants-without-1820458", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/18/rtr4o8ju.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care and immigration reform policies explicitly prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining health insurance, but someone still has to pay when they need care.", "title": "Immigration, Health Care Reform 2015: States Move To Help Undocumented Immigrants Without Medical Insurance", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-health-care-reform-2015-states-move-help-undocumented-immigrants-without-1820458", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/18/rtr4o8ju.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/18/rtr4o8ju.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-02-19T15:19:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T00:07:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health care and immigration reform policies explicitly prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining health insurance, but someone still has to pay when they need care."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb227\"", "article_summary": "Most recently, in December 2014, State Senator Ricardo Lara of California introduced SB 4, a bill that tries to make all undocumented immigrants eligible for Medi-Cal.\nBy 2016, 5.1 million undocumented immigrants in the United States will be uninsured, a group of UCLA researchers has estimated.\nIn New York, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for coverage through the state\u2019s health care exchange.\nUsing state funds, California and New York are pioneering ways to offer comprehensive coverage for undocumented immigrants and others with temporary work visas.\nA handful of other states offer limited insurance coverage to subsets of immigrant populations."}
