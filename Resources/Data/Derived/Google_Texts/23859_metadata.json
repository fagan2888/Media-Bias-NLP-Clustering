Last week, more than 40,000 German steel workers took to the streets to protest against dumping from China.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Beech; Additional reporting Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE and Ruby Lian in SHANGHAI; Editing by Eric Walsh and Lincoln Feast)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Representatives of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, South", "title": "U.S., other countries call for urgent action on steel overcapacity", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/US-other-countries-call-urgent-action-steel-overcapacity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-steel-overcapacity_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/US-other-countries-call-urgent-action-steel-overcapacity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-steel-overcapacity_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Representatives of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, South", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Washington pointed the finger at China for the talks failure, saying Beijing needed to cut overcapacity or face possible trade action from other countries.\nIn a separate statement, U.S. officials said they would continue to lobby for action on steel with trade partners.\n\"The United States will continue to engage bilaterally and multilaterally with trading partners, including China, to take meaningful action to meet that goal.\"\nChina, the world's top steel producer and exporter, is also the fifth-largest importer of steel, buying an equivalent of 13.57 million tonnes of crude steel last year.\nThe Chinese government has taken the most concrete measures and is paying enormous price to cut overcapacity, said Zhang."}
