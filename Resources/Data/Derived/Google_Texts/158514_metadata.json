The University of Georgia\u2019s Selig Center for Economic Growth has forecast a 2.4 percent gain, compared with 2.3 percent statewide.\n\nSimon Medcalfe, a professor of finance in Augusta University\u2019s Hull College of Business, said he is optimistic that 2016 will be better than this year \u2013 and possibly as good as the previous year.\n\n\u201cThis year in terms of economic growth was a littler slower than 2014, so hopefully we can get back into a little faster growth rate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2014, Augusta was the second-fastest growing area in the state. Now it\u2019s running around fourth.\u201d\n\nThe latest job figures from the Georgia Department of Labor, released Thursday, showed that Augusta\u2019s labor market grew by 3,100 jobs, or 1.4 percent, in November, compared with the same month the previous year. That was the fourth-biggest gain in jobs, behind Savannah, Columbus and Gainesville.\n\nEmployment growth is crucial to a region because it offers the unemployed and under-employed the opportunity to increase their income, which boosts consumer spending \u2013 something that economists say is roughly two-thirds of the overall economy. New jobs also bring new workers to the area, helping fuel the home construction and real estate development industries.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for people to relocate to the area in the coming year, including ongoing construction of new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, expansion of existing industries \u2013 such as the planned 60,000-square-foot addition at ADP \u2013 and, above all, the continued buildup of high-tech personnel at Fort Gordon, where the military is relocating the Army Cyber Command headquarters and associated cybersecurity operations.\n\nVitner wrote that the increase in military spending \u201cleaves Augusta vulnerable to whims of the federal budget process\u201d and that \u201ccyber warfare and cyber security are two high priority programs that likely have plenty of runway ahead of them.\u201d\n\nThe Selig Center\u2019s Jeff Humphreys writes in his 2016 economic outlook that the Army post buildup \u201cwill make Augusta a place where military contractors will congregate.\u201d Indeed, federal contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Unisys, Booz Al\u00adlen Hamilton and Chiron have established operations in the area to be close to the military\u2019s cyber operations.\n\nUnisys\u2019 recently opened service center in downtown Augusta, for example, is expected to hire 400 workers during the next few years on top of the 300 already housed in the riverfront office. Dale Dye, the site\u2019s executive director, said it\u2019s likely the facility \u2013 which already is considered the company\u2019s flagship sup\u00adport center \u2013 will likely grow beyond 700 employees.\n\n\u201cWe already have the volume to fill this place up,\u201d Dye said of the 74,000-\n\nsquare-foot space formerly occupied by the National Science Center\u2019s Fort Discovery. \u201cAugusta offers such a rich talent pool that we can do that.\u201d\n\nSuch service-sector jobs are expected to fuel most of the metro area\u2019s employment growth in 2016, as it has during the past few decades. The broad category, which includes retail, education, health care, financial services and transportation, will ameliorate the effects of weaker growth in goods-producing sectors, such as manufacturing and mining.\n\nEconomists have cited brisk growth in Augusta\u2019s leisure and hospitality sector, which grew a whopping 11 percent during the past year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good indicator people have disposable income to spend,\u201d Medcalfe said.\n\nOne of the biggest industries in Augusta \u2013 health care \u2013 has seen more modest gains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real change there, where normally we\u2019ve seen consistent growth,\u201d Medcalfe said. \u201cI\u2019d like to say it\u2019s because were getting healthier as a nation, but basic observation seems to suggest that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nThough certain health care positions, primarily in the nursing field, are in perennial demand, the overall weakness in health-care sector growth might be related to apprehension over the Affordable Care Act, Medcalfe said. Georgia is one of several states that have not expanded their Medicaid program under the act, which affects the bottom line of hospitals that provide service to the poor and previously uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cThere may be some uncertainties over how (Obamacare) will be implemented and how people will take up insurance and services,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be some holding back, a wait-and-see attitude.\u201d\n\nAll in all, the state and local economy is ending the year with strong momentum that is expected to continue in 2016. Last week\u2019s interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve \u2013 its first in nine years \u2013 is an indicator that faith in the economy is returning to pre-recession levels.\n\n\u201cThe take-home message is that the Fed is confident in the growth of our economy, which is a good thing,\u201d Medcalfe said. \u201cMost investment decisions are a confidence issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/widetile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/smalltile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/largetile.png"}, "article_summary": "The University of Georgia\u2019s Selig Center for Economic Growth has forecast a 2.4 percent gain, compared with 2.3 percent statewide.\n\u201cThis year in terms of economic growth was a littler slower than 2014, so hopefully we can get back into a little faster growth rate,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real change there, where normally we\u2019ve seen consistent growth,\u201d Medcalfe said.\nAn influx of cybersecurity-related tech jobs, an increase in leisure and hospitality activity, and an overall improvement in consumer confidence should help the Augusta metro area enjoy vigorous employment growth in 2016.\nNew jobs also bring new workers to the area, helping fuel the home construction and real estate development industries."}
