Last spring, Afroza Chowdhury told the police that her living conditions were unsafe and her ex-husband continually threatened her life.

She was taken in for a mental health evaluation, telling doctors at Contra Costa County hospital in California that she told her husband she would rather kill herself than be killed by him.

After the evaluation, hospital staff put Chowdhury in a taxi cab bound for the one place she’d explicitly said she couldn’t bear to go—back home to her husband.

Before she could even reach that troubled destination, on April 5th, Chowdhury opened the cab as it sped down Highway 4, leaping to her death.

According to the Mercury News, the instance is raising questions about county hospitals’ practice of sending home patients in cabs who are mentally unstable, and who could be a possible a threat to themselves or others.

Chowdhury’s son, Tony Ahmed, expressed his utter dismay over what happened:

“I have a sister who lives back in Bangladesh, and obviously they’re asking me, ‘What kind of hospital releases a 60-year-old woman in the middle of the night?'” he said, taking several long pauses to hold back tears. “If I knew she was at the hospital — 100 percent — me and my wife would have come and picked her up.”

Ahmed and his lawyer have requested public records from the Antioch police over what transpired before his mother’s suicide, but to no avail.

In the medical records obtained, Chowdhury told doctors that she wasn’t suicidal. That said, the rationale that would put a woman who cited physical abuse in a cab back to her alleged abuser is “terrible,” according to one expert.

According to California state law, a person can be denied release from the hospital if they’re a danger to themselves or others, or are too mentally unstable to look after themselves.
