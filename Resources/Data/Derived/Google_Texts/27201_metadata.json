Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Mark Kirk (Ill.) voting with Democrats.\n\n\u201cToday, Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have made it illegal for any company to deny their employees and dependents specific health benefits required by federal law, like birth control,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said after the vote. \u201cSenate Republicans continue to demonstrate that they are out of touch with women across America.\u201d\n\nReid switched his vote to \u201cno\u201d on the bill before the vote was closed, giving him the option of bringing it up again.\n\nDemocrats put forward the bill to reverse the effects of last month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, which found that the government could not mandate that certain employers provide birth-control coverage if it conflicts with their religious beliefs.\n\nRepublicans have cheered the ruling as a victory for the First Amendment, and say the protections that the high court afforded the Hobby Lobby chain under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act should remain in place.\n\nOn the left, the backlash to the ruling has been intense. Democrats want to harness that anger as they try to turn out their voters in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWomen across the country are watching,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray Patty MurrayLawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Wash.). \u201cWho should be in charge of a woman\u2019s healthcare decisions? Should it be a woman \u2014 making those decisions with her partner, her doctor and her faith? Or should it be her boss \u2014 making those decisions for her based on his own religious beliefs?\u201d\n\nRepublicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the issue. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) called the Democratic bill an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis legislation is more than an insult to the people it would target, it is an embarrassment to the party leadership that has embraced it,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cThe majority has put their finger to the political wind, and all they want is a show vote. \u2026 They ought to be ashamed,\u201d added Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first freedom mentioned in the Bill of Rights \u2014 you\u2019d think everyone here would be on the side of upholding it.\u201d\n\nStill, Republicans have signaled they are worried that the court ruling could backfire on them in November, and introduced an alternative bill on birth control Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWe plan to introduce legislation this week that says no employer can block any employee from legal access to her FDA-approved contraceptives,\u201d Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said this week. \u201cThere\u2019s no disagreement on that fundamental point.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill includes language from Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate whether birth control should be sold as an over-the-counter drug. A prescription from a doctor is now needed to obtain most forms of contraception.\n\nOn Wednesday, McConnell said his party thinks that rather than \u201crestricting Americans\u2019 religious freedoms, Congress should instead work to preserve a woman\u2019s ability to make contraceptive decisions for herself.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are pushing a similar message, but dispute that religious freedom is the central issue. They say the Supreme Court\u2019s decision allows corporate bosses to dictate healthcare decisions to women, and want the ObamaCare mandate put back in place.\n\n\u201cWomen should call the shots when it comes to their healthcare decisions. Not their boss. Not their government. Not anyone else. Period,\u201d Murray said. \u201cBut we are here today because five men on the Supreme Court disagree.\u201d\n\nReid vowed that Senate Democrats would not give up on the bill, and noted that they were only two senators short of success, since Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) missed the vote but supports the legislation.\n\n\u201cDespite Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats will keep working to end this type of discrimination against women,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe will continue to stand up to ensure that a woman\u2019s boss cannot interfere with her personal healthcare decisions.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats said they would try to force a vote on companion legislation in their chamber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really as personal as it gets,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said of the birth-control ruling.\n\n\u201cI wish [the justices] could have had a conversation with their mothers, with their wives, with their daughters, with their sisters, with anybody else who had any knowledge of the ramifications of public policy in the personal lives of women.\u201d\n\n--This report was originally published at 2:36 p.m. and last updated at 8:34 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Bill responding to Hobby Lobby decision falls four votes short of moving forward.", "description": "Bill responding to Hobby Lobby decision falls four votes short of moving forward.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Bill responding to Hobby Lobby decision falls four votes short of moving forward.", "title": "Dem birth control bill stalls", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212451-senate-republicans-block-birth-control-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/birthcontrol_hobbylobby_063014getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-17T10:54:47-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212451-senate-republicans-block-birth-control-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Bill responding to Hobby Lobby decision falls four votes short of moving forward.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dem birth control bill stalls"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-17T10:54-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212451-senate-republicans-block-birth-control-bill", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-16T20:34-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ramsey Cox", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Ramsey Cox", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, birth control mandate, Burwell v.
