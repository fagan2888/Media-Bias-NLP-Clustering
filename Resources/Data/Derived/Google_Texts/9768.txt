The boyfriend of a woman whose toddler daughter was found dead inside a trash bag on a Boston Harbor beach this summer and became known as Baby Doe has been charged with murder.

Prosecutors announced the charge against Michael McCarthy on Friday. McCarthy is being treated at a Boston hospital for drug issues and can’t be reached for comment.

Baby Doe’s mother, Rachelle Bond, is under arrest on a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. She’s in custody and also can’t be reached for comment.

The name of the girl has been revealed as Bella Bond. She had come to be known as Baby Doe over the course of a monthslong investigation that included a massive social media campaign to learn her identity.

The Massachusetts House speaker says the mother and her boyfriend are blaming each other for the girl’s death.

The girl was 2½ years old when she died. Her body was found June 25 inside a trash bag on Deer Island in Winthrop by a woman walking a dog.
