(Diane Weiss/Associated Press)\n\nWhat is a city for?\n\nIt\u2019s a crucial question, but one rarely asked by the pundits and developers who dominate the debate over the future of the American city.\n\nTheir current conventional wisdom embraces density, sky-high scrapers, vastly expanded mass transit and ever-smaller apartments. It reflects a desire to create an ideal locale for hipsters and older, sophisticated urban dwellers. It\u2019s city as adult Disneyland or \u201centertainment machine,\u201d chock-a-block with chic restaurants, shops and festivals.\n\nOverlooked, or even disdained, is what most middle-class residents of the metropolis actually want: home ownership, rapid access to employment throughout the metropolitan area, good schools and \u201chuman scale\u201d neighborhoods.\n\nA vast majority of people \u2014 roughly 8o percent \u2014 prefer a single-family home, whether in the city or surrounding communities. And they may not get \u201ccreative\u201d gigs at ad agencies or writers collectives, but look instead for decent-paying opportunities in fields such as construction, manufacturing or logistics. Over the past decade, these jobs have been declining rapidly in \u201cluxury cities\u201d like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nIn contrast, such jobs, which pay $60,000 to $100,000 annually, have been growing \u2014 particularly as the industrial and energy sectors have recovered \u2014 in cities like Houston, Austin, Nashville and Salt Lake City. These locales also feature housing, relative to incomes, that is more affordable.\n\nOf course, few urbanists wax poetic about Dallas or Des Moines. They lack Brooklyn\u2019s hipster charm, and often maintain some of the trappings of the suburbs. But these \u201copportunity cities\u201d offer what Descartes called \u201can inventory of the possible\u201d \u2014 urbanity as an engine of upward mobility for the middle and working classes.\n\nEver since the Great Recession, many in America\u2019s urban-focused pundit class have written off these cities, particularly in the Sunbelt, as places where the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d has gone to die. Yet over the past 30 years, and now again, virtually all of the fastest-growing American metropolitan areas were located in the West or the South. In 2012, nine of the ten fastest-growing large metropolitan areas were in the Sunbelt, including big Texas cities like Austin, Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, along with Denver, Raleigh and Phoenix. In 2013, Houston alone had more housing starts than the entire state of California.\n\nAt the same time, immigrants \u2014 traditionally the most determined seekers of upward mobility \u2014 are now also flocking to places like low-cost Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, which ranked second to New York in the last decade as a destination for the foreign-born. Immigrants are even heading in large numbers to locales such as Charlotte and Nashville, where foreign-born populations have doubled over the past decade. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly given the prevailing tone of media coverage, these cities also have enjoyed generally faster growth in both college graduates and people ages 20 to 29 than New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n\nThese trends can also be seen in population projections. The U.S. Conference of Mayors study predicts that Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston will grow to be nearly as large as Chicago by 2042. If the same growth rate were to continue through 2050, both Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston would be ahead of Chicago by 2050.\n\nTo a large extent, this growth is fueled by middle-class movement to regions that offer both better economic prospects and more affordable housing prices. Before 1970, housing prices were largely even, relative to incomes, across the nation. Today, in large part due to regulatory and tax policies, they differ by as much as two to three times between cities like Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, on the one hand, and New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nThen there is the critical issue of employment. Since 2008, Houston has added more than 185,000 jobs and Dallas 115,000, more than New York, which is much larger. Los Angeles and Chicago still remain well below their 2008 employment levels.\n\nIt is also often alleged that these are primarily \u201ccrummy,\u201d low-income jobs, but the opportunity cities have generally enjoyed strong mid-skilled growth and, over the past decade, also higher levels of STEM jobs. Since 2001, Houston has led the nation\u2019s large metropolitan areas in the percentage growth of net STEM jobs; Dallas-Fort Worth and Phoenix have expanded these jobs more than San Francisco, even accounting for the current social media bubble. Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago have suffered a net loss since 2001.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, these are overwhelmingly the places where people choose to start families and raise children. All 10 of the cities (metropolitan areas) with the largest shares of children 0-14 years of age are opportunity cities, with Salt Lake City, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Riverside-San Bernardino and San Antonio taking the top five positions. On the other hand, luxury cities, such as San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle and Miami, tend to rank in the bottom third, according to American Community Survey data.\n\nMeanwhile, cities like New York and San Francisco continue to reflect the media\u2019s preferred form of urbanism, first articulated by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that, to survive, a city must be primarily \u201ca luxury product,\u201d a place that focuses on the very wealthy whose surplus can underwrite the rest of the population.\n\n\u201cIf we can find a bunch of billionaires around the world to move here, that would be a godsend,\u201d Bloomberg, himself a multibillionaire, suggests. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the revenue comes to take care of everybody else.\u201d\n\nThis reliance on the rich, notes a Citigroup study, creates a \u201cplutonomy,\u201d an economy and society driven largely by the wealthy class\u2019s investment and spending.\n\nLuxury cities, increasingly, are less places of aspiration than geographies of inequality. New York, for example, is by some measurements the most unequal of major U.S. cities, with a level of inequality that approximates South Africa before apartheid. New York\u2019s wealthiest 1 percent earn a third of the entire municipality\u2019s personal income \u2014 almost twice the proportion for the rest of the country.\n\nOther luxury cities exhibit somewhat similar patterns. A recent Brookings report found that virtually all the most unequal metropolitan areas \u2013 with the exception of Atlanta and Miami \u2014 are luxury regions, including San Francisco, Boston, Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nSmaller luxury cities such as San Francisco are generally the ones gentrifying fastest, notes a recent Cleveland Fed study. They also tend to be, as urban analyst Aaron Renn has noted, \u201cwhite cities,\u201d with relatively small and often shrinking populations of historically disadvantaged minorities. San Francisco\u2019s black population, for example, is roughly half of what it was in 1970. In the nation\u2019s whitest major city, Portland, African Americans are being driven out of the urban core by gentrification, partly supported by city funding. Similar phenomena can be seen in Seattle and Boston, where long-existing black communities are gradually disappearing.\n\nWhat this all suggests is that the future of American urbanism cannot follow the trajectory of luxury cities that, by their very nature, are difficult places for the vast majority of the population to live. Instead, the new role models \u2014 including for the hard-hit cities of the Rustbelt \u2014 will be found in those regions that have been able to provide the basic elements of middle-class aspiration: decent jobs, affordable housing and the chance to start a growing business.\n\nFor years, Rustbelt cities have pegged their aspirations on mimicking \u201cluxury cities.\u201d But now local scholars, like Cleveland State\u2019s Richey Piiparinen, believe these areas need to follow the opportunity city model. He points out that lower costs and a more family-friendly appeal is allowing Cleveland to attract more young, educated people to their region than they now send to places like Chicago or New York\n\nTo achieve an urbanism that works for most Americans, cities need to develop a very different focus, emphasizing such things as affordability, middle-class jobs and opportunity. No doubt the luxury city model will continue to flourish in places, particularly for the well-heeled, but this paradigm is not applicable to most places, or most people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We obsess over New York and SF.
