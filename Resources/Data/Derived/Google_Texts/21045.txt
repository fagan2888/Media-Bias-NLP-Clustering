Getty Poll: Schumer's approval sinks to 15-year low

Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer's approval rating is at a 15-year low in his home state of New York, according to the results of a new Quinnipiac University survey out Tuesday, though more than half said the No. 3 Senate Democrat's opposition to the Iran nuclear deal would make no difference in whether they would vote for him next year.

Schumer's approval stands at 54 percent to 32 percent, his lowest approval marks since drawing 52 percent to 18 percent in May 2000. At the same time, 56 percent to 34 percent said Schumer deserves to be reelected, while 61 percent to 27 percent said it would be a good thing for the state for Schumer to become the Senate Democratic leader once Nevada Sen. Harry Reid retires.

Nearly six in 10 voters agree with Schumer that the Iran deal will make the world a less safe place (57 percent to 32 percent) and nearly the same share said they opposed the agreement (59 percent to 32 percent). Twenty-four percent of voters said Schumer's opposition to the deal would make them more likely to vote for him, while 17 percent said it would make them less likely, and 55 percent said it would not factor into their decision in 2016.

Schumer's colleague, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, drew even lower numbers among voters with an approval rating of 49 percent to 25 percent, her lowest since February 2012, when she received 47 percent to 26 percent approval.

The poll was conducted Sept. 10-15, surveying 1,066 voters in New York state voters via land lines and cellphones with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.
