Big time! Trifecta!\u201d Levin said, before highlighting three \u201creckless comments\u201d Trump recently made that irked him.\n\nFirst on his list was the billionaire\u2019s harsh criticism of Scalia, who Levin said is one of the few justices who has worked for decades to \u201csave this Republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoining in with a leftist on CNN to twist what Antonin Scalia said during a Supreme Court hearing on affirmative action. Just joining in and dumping on him? He deserves better than that. A lot better than that.\u201d\n\nThe influential conservative voice did not stop there.\n\n\u201cEmbracing ethanol subsidies?\u201d he rhetorically asked. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get rid of ethanol subsidies, ladies and gentleman, how we are going to address an over $200 trillion debt? We\u2019re not! We\u2019re not! It\u2019s not good for people, it\u2019s not good for agriculture, it\u2019s not good for the economy, it\u2019s not good for your purse \u2014 it sucks!\u201d\n\nLevin then took on Trump for calling Cruz a \u201cmaniac\u201d and questioning his temperament to be president.\n\n\u201cAnd then we have a guy who has stood up to Mitch McConnell, who is viciously attacked in every liberal newspaper, every liberal outlet, by the establishment. Who led the fight against Obamacare. And he\u2019s referred to as a \u2018maniac?\u2019 I\u2019m sure Mitch McConnell loved that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Wall Street Journal editorial page loved that. He\u2019s a \u2018maniac?\u2019\u201d\n\nLevin said that even those who are \u201cmoderately conservative\u201d would \u201cdisagree with Donald Trump\u201d on those three issues.\n\nLevin\u2019s sharp criticism of Trump came after Rush Limbaugh delivered a stinging critique of the candidate, alerting conservative voters to the same remarks which he said \u201craised a red flag.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook:\n\nFollow @oliverdarcy\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Conservative radio talk show host Mark Levin went after Republican frontrunner Donald Trump Monday, unleashing on the real estate mogul for his recent criticism of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  \"I think my friend Donald Trump really screwed up this weekend!
