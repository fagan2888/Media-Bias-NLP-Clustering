After all, not long ago any hint the Fed was ready to delay liftoff tended to boost equities and other assets perceived as risky.\n\nBut after Wednesday\u2019s dovishly-interpreted minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s July meeting, stocks have taken it on the chin. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% is off 1.4% Thursday, after a turbulent run Wednesday, which ended with a triple-digit loss for the Dow.\n\nJens Nordvig, currency strategist at Nomura, offers up a compelling rationale, in a Thursday note.\n\nIf the Fed indeed doesn\u2019t act in September and some Fed policy makers move their \u201cdots\u201d\u2014points on the central bank\u2019s so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d that represent individual expectations on rates\u2014to 2016, expectations for a December rate increase might stand at no better than 50-50, Nordvig wrote.\n\nIf so, that would mean there is room for a rally of around 10 basis points in the January Fed-funds futures contract and a rally of 10 to 15 basis points from Wednesday\u2019s close for the two-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, -5.53% Bond yields rise as debt prices fall.\n\n\u201cNormally, this would be considered positive for risk assets, but given that a delay may be partly linked to global economic slowing, it is not obvious that this would be the case this time around,\u201d Nordvig said.\n\nIn other words, it is all about context. A rate delay amid a benign global environment has generally been viewed as a positive, but if a hike is delayed because investors fear growth is endangered, it is a different story.\n\nLately, global growth concerns have been amplified by a sharp selloff in emerging-market currencies and equities, which in turn reflect plunging prices for oil and other commodities. China\u2019s yuan devaluation last week threw more fuel on the fire.\n\n\u201cThe big drag from the emerging world will continue into next year, even as growth in the developed world holds up. The result? More disappointment,\u201d wrote economists at IHS Global Insight. After being stuck in a range of 2.5% to 2.8% for four years, global growth might not break out as forecasters had hoped in 2016, they said in a research note.\n\nMeanwhile, the prospects of a Fed delay have implications for other markets as well, with the U.S. dollar, which has soared since mid-2014 on rate-hike expectations, setting back, while gold futures rebounded sharply after weeks of heavy selling that drove the yellow metal to a six-year low.\n\nIn a note, Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, said a more cautious outlook on rate hikes could impact markets in the following ways:\n\n\u2022 It could weaken the dollar index DXY, -0.27% which is testing a cluster of moving averages at 96.40. Below here opens the way to 94.60 \u2013 the 200-day [smoothed moving average] \u2013 and the lowest level since June. \u2022 A weaker dollar could fuel a short term recovery in commodity prices, Bloomberg\u2019s commodity index is at its lowest level since 2002, and oil looks desperately oversold. \u2022 If commodity prices rally then it could be an Indian summer for commodity FX bulls. \u2022 It could keep the euro above water. [The euro] EURUSD, -0.0089% has been stubbornly range-bound around $1.10 and hasn't fallen as much as expected. A weaker buck could support EURUSD downside in the next few weeks, with $1.0850 a medium-term support level. A break above $1.1220 \u2013 the high from 12th August \u2013 is a bullish development that opens the way for more late summer upside from the euro.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "For a long time, stocks have tended to gain whenever expectations for a Fed rate increase were pushed back.
