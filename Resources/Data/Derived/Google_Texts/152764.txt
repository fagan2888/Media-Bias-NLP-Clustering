Bill Maher returned to his HBO show “Real Time” Friday night after a break to discuss Donald Trump’s “nonsense” campaign, saying the real estate mogul “could go all the way.”

“For all those people who say Donald Trump could not go all the way, I don’t think they’re right. They didn’t say he would get this far. And obviously, I don’t know what the results are from last night, but Fox tried to put a stake in him and I don’t think they did,” Mr. Maher said, Mediaite reported.

He noted that people laughed off former President Ronald Reagan as a joke before he became president.

GOP campaign strategist Steve Schmidt agreed with Mr. Maher, saying it was “crazy to dismiss [Mr. Trump‘s] chances of becoming the Republican nominee,” Mediaite reported.

He argued that Mr. Trump was using a strong message that garnered him lots of popularity, but he admitted “a lot of what he is saying is nonsense talk.”

Mr. Maher asked, “What does it say about your party that the guy who’s leading you say is full of nonsense?”

Mr. Schmidt responded that Mr. Trump’s polling numbers suggest that Republicans are simply fed up with Washington politics and have completely lost trust in their government.
