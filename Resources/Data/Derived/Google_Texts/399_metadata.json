A week ago we received unexpected news that the federal government wouldn\u2019t make good on its obligations. These were obligations to help pay for care,\u201d said Julia Hutchins, the CEO of Colorado HealthOP.\n\nThe co-op was hoping to get up to $16 million through an incentive in the Affordable Care Act. Congress only approved 12 percent of the $3 billion nationwide, meaning Colorado HealthOP would get no more than $2 million.\n\nMORE FROM COLORADO.GOV: Division of Insurance moves to protect Colorado consumers, takes action against HealthOP\n\n\u201cFor a small local company having a significant change in the amount that you\u2019re owed is devastating,\u201d Hutchins said.\n\nColorado Division of Insurance spokesman Vincent Plymell told CBS4 \u201cthey are financially unsustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were expecting some money from a federal program and got notified earlier this month they wouldn\u2019t be getting as much as they were expecting,\u201d said Plymell. \u201cThe state has requirements for insurance companies; they have to keep so much in reserve, think of it as a rainy day fund.\u201d\n\n2016 rates haven\u2019t been approved by the state yet for the 20 other carriers, and this closing could mean higher rates for some.\n\n\u201cThis obviously has an impact on all our calculations, obviously in terms of the number of plans, the plans available to consumers this is also going to impact the tax credits people receive,\u201d Plymell said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is health insurance isn\u2019t getting any cheaper. They\u2019ll see plans that cost more and offer less and certainly that don\u2019t have the same consumer focus that we do,\n\n\u201d said Hutchins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re victims to politics. It\u2019s unfortunate, health care reform, no matter how you think about it, we were a private market solution to drive down health care costs. This is about people in Colorado needing health care and who was there for them and we were there for them when a larger carriers stood on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nJeff Todd joined the CBS4 team in 2011 covering the Western Slope in the Mountain Newsroom.
