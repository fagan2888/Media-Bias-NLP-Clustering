Stan Dalone, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nNew York City knows Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s penchant for new health initiatives too well. So it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s making one last effort to regulate something else before his term ends. His latest target: tanning salons.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who begin indoor tanning before 35 years old have a 75 percent higher chance of developing melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, and the leading cause of death from skin disease.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that tanning increases the risk of skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer,\u201d Daniel Kass, NYC deputy health commissioner for environmental health, told the NY Post. \u201cWe want to make sure kids are not using these salons.\u201d\n\nThe plan, which will be submitted to the Board of Health on Tuesday, would include a number of new regulations, including:\n\n\u00b7 A requirement that the Health Department inspect tanning salons, ultraviolet machines, and timers at least once every two years.\n\n\u00b7 Find and shut down unlicensed salons.\n\n\u00b7 Require ultraviolet equipment operators to undergo training.\n\n\u00b7 Limit salon use to those ages 17 and over.\n\n\u00b7 Educate the public about the dangers of tanning salons and ultraviolet radiation \u2014 this campaign would take place at the actual salons.\n\nAbout 900 New York City residents suffered from melanoma in 2012, Kass told the Post, and another 100 died from the skin cancer as well.\n\nA recent study found that 25 to 30 percent of white women, ages 18-34, had used an indoor tanning bed at least once in the previous year. Fifteen percent of those women also reported using the beds frequently. Concerns go beyond cancer too, since it\u2019s been shown that frequent salon attendance could be an addiction. Another recent study found that 26 out of 178 subjects with basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer, continued to go back to the salon after being diagnosed with cancer. Of those who returned, 58 percent showed signs of tanning dependence.\n\nBloomberg appointed all the Department of Health\u2019s members, so it\u2019s expected that the law will pass. The Health Department believes that having more resources than the state will make regulation of salons more effective.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tanning, salon, ban, skin, cancer, melanoma, basal, cell, carcinoma, bloomberg, new york city,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an effort to prevent some of the 9,000 deaths from skin cancer each year, the Bloomberg administration announced plans to regulate tanning salons and limiting minors from using them.", "title": "New York City Mayor Bloomberg Plans To Regulate Tanning Salons To Prevent Skin Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-city-mayor-bloomberg-plans-regulate-tanning-salons-prevent-skin-cancer-259753", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/tanning-bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an effort to prevent some of the 9,000 deaths from skin cancer each year, the Bloomberg administration announced plans to regulate tanning salons and limiting minors from using them.", "title": "New York City Mayor Bloomberg Plans To Regulate Tanning Salons To Prevent Skin Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-city-mayor-bloomberg-plans-regulate-tanning-salons-prevent-skin-cancer-259753", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/tanning-bed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/tanning-bed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-10-13T16:52:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:48:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an effort to prevent some of the 9,000 deaths from skin cancer each year, the Bloomberg administration announced plans to regulate tanning salons and limiting minors from using them."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe266a\"", "article_summary": "About 900 New York City residents suffered from melanoma in 2012, Kass told the Post, and another 100 died from the skin cancer as well.\n\u00b7 Educate the public about the dangers of tanning salons and ultraviolet radiation \u2014 this campaign would take place at the actual salons.\nSkin cancer is the most common form of cancer,\u201d Daniel Kass, NYC deputy health commissioner for environmental health, told the NY Post.\nPeople who begin tanning before age 35 are 75 percent more likely to develop skin cancer.\nHis latest target: tanning salons."}
