And has it always been this way?\n\nCat-Fight Antics\n\nIn 2009 I was asked by a major high-circulation newspaper to provide commentary on the good, the bad and the ugly outfits at the Oscars. A ritual of judgment that fuels negative commentary and by virtue sells more media both electronic and print.\n\nRelated: Slide Show - 12 Oscar Actresses and Their Extravagant Bling\n\nIn my considered response, I wrote only positive critiques and distinctly remember writing that the favored trend of the day was wearing a grin and that reflected happiness is the best fashion accessory that can be worn.\n\nMy commentary did not run in the press. It was no doubt not worthy of generating newspaper sales because I didn\u2019t abide by the cat-fight antics inherent in this ceremony.\n\nThe armchair critique of Oscars fashion is part of broader cultural trend equally fuelled by the plethora of reality TV shows where we all can be expert on food, romance, health and renovations. This has been an entrenched custom in fashion for a number of years where the best and worst dressed lists appear across the globe with glossy magazines, daily newspaper editions and fashion blogs all competing to capture our attention.\n\nFashion Flashback\n\nIf we revisit 1950s Hollywood, the Oscars ceremony was a very different and a decidedly tame affair. Historically the stars of a film would be most likely dressed by the wardrobe supervisor at the film studio such as the iconic Adrian at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) or the legendary and most popular costume designer in Hollywood during this time Edith Head, who started at Paramount Studios and then moved to Universal.\n\nThe alternate option was to purchase a preferred gown from a local dressmaker or store.\n\nRelated: The Money Behind the Oscar Hopefuls\n\nIt did, however, start to change as described by New York-based fashion commentator and creative director of luxury department store Barney\u2019s, Simon Doonan, who titled his blog page on January 14 this year Frockophany! and stated:\n\nIn the late \u201980s, [\u2026] fashion and celebrity began to flirt with each other. By the \u201990s the two copulated \u2026 and the red-carpet designer devil-baby was born. The fashionification of Hollywood began in earnest.\n\nWhat Doonan refers to is the massive marketing cogs that moved into motion, whereby major fashion houses with obscene marketing dollars to invest started offering the Hollywood glitterati dresses gratis.\n\nDoonan writes in this same article: \"Why would designers fling free gowns at the only people on Earth who actually need them, and can afford them?\"\n\nThe reason is that every media outlet around the globe has access to information about which Hollywood celebrity wore what. Charlize wore Dior Haute Couture, Angelina wore Elie Saab, Cate wore Armani Priv\u00e9 and Nicole wore L\u2019Wren Scott \u2013 depending on which red carpet event you are channelling at the time.\n\nSelling Hollywood Allure\n\nThe outfits adorning the stars are often straight from the catwalk and not even released for retail sale at the time of the ceremony. Seeing them worn gives the public the impression that the star validates this look and you too should aspire to have something this desirable, this fabulous.\n\nIt is a marketing tool to attract those who can afford them to aspire to look just like Charlize, Angelina, Cate and Nicole.\n\nRelated: The Jewelers Behind the Oscar Bling\n\nFor most of us, these exquisitely produced outfits could only be worn in our dreams but the label name spreads across the globe so as to evoke a desire to align to the glamour, prestige and luxury of our favoured actors. It is a blatant attempt to sell more lipsticks, handbags and perfumes to give the world entr\u00e9e to Hollywood allure.\n\nIn one night the designers' PR machines go into overload to make their label the most noticed. Reader in Cultural and Historical Studies at London College of Fashion Pamela Church Gibson\u2019s book Fashion and Celebrity Culture interrogates this phenomenon with a high level of disdain:\n\nWhat we should concern ourselves with is the way in which celebrity culture is increasingly driving the very machine of fashion \u2026\n\nA recent article in the London edition of The Sunday Times by fashion editor Claudia Croft announces that some high-profile designers are rejecting the Oscar circus because \"the huge fees that actresses demand to wear a designer\u2019s creation on the Hollywood red carpet were not worth it.\"\n\nA rather bizarre shift from the days when celebrities bought their own outfits to now seeing themselves as a global brand charging a fee, suggested to be in the vicinity of $1 million dollars, so as to generate momentous publicity.\n\nSnubbing the Trend\n\nIt could, of course, backfire. What if not only the mass press but armchair critics across the globe watching the Oscars exclaim: \u201cOh my goodness, did you see what she was wearing?\u201d Followed by judgmental remarks, such as, \u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d or worse: \u201cWhat a dog.\u201d\n\nThere is a perception that as long as the designer's name is out there the world is hearing of the brand and when buying their lipstick they will subliminally respond to the likes of luxury brands Dior, Chanel, Prada or Balenciaga.\n\nI don\u2019t abide by this sentiment and it fits within the same misconstrued myth that any publicity is good publicity. Good publicity equals good publicity and bad publicity is just that! I do, however, pay tribute to those actors who decide to shun the whole media circus and subsequent fashion roller-coaster. They include stars such as English actress Helena Bonham Carter, who channels her own Goth style no matter what the fashion trend. Hallelujah to American actress Sharon Stone, who in 1998 created an Oscars milestone moment when she adorned a plain Gap shirt from her husband\u2019s closet with a Vera Wang skirt.\n\nAs a result, Gap probably sold more shirts than any other designer that year.\n\nAnd the Blokes?\n\nMost of the discourse and interrogation of Oscars fashion appears to be focused on the female. What about the male actor counterparts?\n\nAlthough the past decade has seen an evolutionary shift strengthening the men\u2019s fashion stakes, a quick scan of websites shows that most men adorn a traditional tuxedo, with few exceptions.\n\nThis is not about to start cash registers ringing in fashionland. Pamela Church Gibson acknowledges that there has been a cultural shift in men\u2019s fashion interest since the 1980s with aligned interest in referencing celebrity style icons.\n\nAlthough there is strong male interest in celebrity figures \u2026 the most widespread imitation of celebrity through body shape, dress and adornment, which for the most is gender specific [is young women] \u2026 Internet sites are not dominated by men in search of masculine styles of celebrity dress to copy.\n\nFor 2014 the buzz is now well underway, with websites and magazines destined for attracting attention at supermarket checkouts starting the roller-coaster by guessing who will wear what.\n\nPost March 2, around the world a plethora of copies of the dress worn by Charlize, Angelina, Cate and Nicole will fill mass fashion racks on high streets globally, unless of course we exclaim: \u201cWhat on Earth was she thinking\u203d\u201d\n\nSee further Oscars 2014 coverage on The Conversation.\n\nKaren Webster does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
