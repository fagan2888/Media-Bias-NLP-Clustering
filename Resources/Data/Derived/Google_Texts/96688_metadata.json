I mean, how can people be upset that people have affordable healthcare? How is that a bad thing? I mean, that\u2019s like being opposed to safe drinking water and safe food and breathable air!\n\nOh wait\u2026\n\nAnd yeah, Starnes did the typical over-the-top reaction thing to the SCOTUS decision:\n\nSCOTUS: You can't keep your doctor. You can't keep your health insurance. You can't keep your Constitution. \u2014 toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) June 25, 2015\n\nBut that was when I discovered what truly funny is in a nice catch by the folks at Right Wing Watch: Todd Starnes = Catastrophically Stupid Comedy Gold.\n\nMore and more I think of Starnes as the male counterpart of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, the one they hired to say things so stupid nobody else would say them.\n\nSpeaking Saturday at the misnamed \u201cFaith and Freedom Conference,\u201d the hysterical Starnes was all about the mythical \u201cwar on Christianity\u201d meme, especially the potential for other people to have the same rights Christians do.\n\nYou would think there was an arena full of lions awaiting him at the end of his speech. \u201cThis is not just about marriage; this is about whether or not a government can begin to put limitations on the conscience and the convictions of people of faith,\u201d he complained.\n\nYes, because equal rights for others are somehow chains on Christians.\n\nIt is not gays who are facing \u201cconsiderable adversity,\u201d nossir. Instead, \u201cOur businesses, and our families, and our churches are in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nOld Todd has been watching too much of his own network, methinks.\n\nBut Starnes took hope from the Bible. Not from any book containing Jesus of course. That would be just silly. I mean, Jesus likes poor people and he isn\u2019t \u201cwrathy\u201d enough despite throwing a tantrum in the temple (Mark 11:15-19, 11:27-33, Matthew 21:12-17).\n\nWhat\u2019s knocking a table over compared to plagues of insects?\n\nSo Starnes goes right for the book of Exodus and his god sending a \u201cswarm of hornets to clear the battlefield\u201d (Exodus 23:28).\n\nAgain, you would think a guy who calls himself a Christian would go for a Jesus quote, but Starnes says this pre-Jesus passage ought to be the \u201cbattle prayer of every patriot saint.\u201d\n\nOh sweet little baby Jesus and his AR-15. You mean you\u2019re all saints now?\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d and \u201clove your neighbors\u201d and \u201cdo not cast the first stone.\u201d I don\u2019t even ask anymore. They just tell me I have to be one of them to understand.\n\nAnd trust me: I know that\u2019s true.\n\nSo here is where Starnes gets really whacky:\n\nWhen the public schools tell students that our Founding Fathers were a bunch of terrorists: Send the hornets, Lord! Clear the field! When a teacher tells a little boy he can\u2019t pray over his meal: Send the hornets, Lord! Clear that field! When the Pentagon tells them to take down a cross on a Christian chapel: Send those hornets! Clear the field! When the Supreme Court says they know better than God: Send the hornets, Lord! Clear the field! And, when the president says that America is no longer just a Christian nation: Don\u2019t send the hornets, Lord. Send the mosquitoes and the gnats, and the bumblebees and the lightning bugs and the cicadas! Send every critter you got, Lord! Clear the field!\u201d\n\nYou did not just say that!\n\nHe did. He did say it. And he acted like he was serious about it, whether he truly was or not. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to believe people really believe this stuff (sadly, I know people who do). We more progressive types sometimes have to open our minds to realize that in some minds, this stuff is true.\n\nSo Starnes wants the Supreme Court cleared by bugs. I admit to a certain humor in watching Justice Scalia driven from the court by a swarm of hornets, but he wants President Obama attacked by bugs too.\n\nNo hornets, but mosquitoes (he doesn\u2019t say which of the several varieties he prefers \u2013 some carry yellow fever, some malaria, etc), gnats of all things, bumblebees (not as mean as hornets, sorry), lightning bugs (?) and of all things, cicadas.\n\nBumblebees would be great. Given the great bee die-off, we could use an infusion of bees, so I suspect an environmentally-sensitive guy like Obama would be overjoyed.\n\nWhy lightning bugs? They\u2019re pretty. You just have to be careful if you try to catch one in your hand. I will never get over an old memory of mine from about the time I was six when I tried to carry one into the house and smushed it in my hands.\n\nI felt so bad.\n\nI don\u2019t want Obama to feel bad. So that\u2019s just mean.\n\nAnd cicadas? This is one of those WTF moments you can only scratch your head over (assuming you haven\u2019t passed out from laughing). I mean, cicadas are annoying but they\u2019re not inimical to humans, like say, hornets.\n\nThey only \u201cbite\u201d you if they mistake you for a tree. They might mess up the White House grounds, but heck, in some cultures and in some eras, if God sent a swarm of cicadas after them, they wouldn\u2019t be upset. Instead, they\u2019d jump up and down in joy and shout, \u201cFood!\u201d\n\nSo c\u2019mon, Todd.\n\nFirst of all, flip your Bible over to the New Testament or stop calling yourself a Christian. Second, stop pretending that equal rights for others equals an attack on you. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re just being stupid, dude. But hey: Fox News guy here. Just do us all a favor and don\u2019t mate with Elisabeth Hasselbeck. The world couldn\u2019t take that kind of stupid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Send the hornets!\" ought to be the \u201cbattle prayer of every patriot saint.\u201d Oh sweet little baby Jesus and his AR-15.
