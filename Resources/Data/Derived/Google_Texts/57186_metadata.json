It strengthens our approach to violence prevention by changing the way we deliver services and prevent perpetrators from reoffending.\n\n\u201cThe It Stops Here reforms have been drawn from various sources including existing evidence, agency experience, the wisdom of service providers and, most importantly, the views of those who have experienced violence.\u201d\n\nIn 2011 the Auditor-General\u2019s report said: \u201cDomestic and family violence damages too many people in our community,\u201d the report said.\n\n\"Organisations do not have a strategy for working together across the State in response to domestic and family violence.\"\n\n\u201cThere is no shared understanding between organisations of each other\u2019s roles in providing a more responsive system that encourages people to seek help and provides them with support when they do so.\u201d\n\nDomestic violence is the single greatest cause of death, ill health and disability for women aged under 45.\n\nIn 2012, NSW Police recorded almost 30,000 domestic violence-related assaults.\n\nThe Government received more than 200 responses containing over 700 pages of feedback from the community on how to improve the system.\n\nOther initiatives in the It Stops Here strategy includes a trial whereby offenders who become the subject of an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) are given legal advice to help them understand their obligations to bring down the number of breaches\n\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTSPOTS* 1.BOURKE \u2013 4,295 per 100,000 head of population 2.WALGETT \u2013 2,705 3.MOREE PLAINS \u2013 1,679 4.COONAMBLE \u2013 1,258 5.WENTWORTH \u2013 1,061 6.INVERELL \u2013 949 7.WELLINGTON \u2013 894 8.HAY \u2013 814 9.LACHLAN \u2013 787 10.FORBES - 784 *NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research 2012\n\nThe strategy will be funded from the $9.8 million, three-year Domestic and Family Violence Funding Program, announced in 2012.\n\nThe overhaul of the response system addresses a key area of Nanette of concern among domestic violence victims such as Nanette.\n\nNanette, whose psychotic ex-boyfriend was deported to Germany after serving just three years of a 25 year sentence, said both the police and legal system failed to act prior her horrific attack in in 2006.\n\nThe assault, which occurred after Nanette returned from overseas where she had fled to escape for two months, was so horrific she suffered a brain injury, but it was the process after the attack that really failed victims, she said.\n\n\u201cVictims are the ones who get the life sentences. We have to watch out backs, change out names, protect ourselves and fight for our rights in a system that is very offender-biased,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnything that goes towards a more victim-centred approach is welcomed.\n\n\u201cI am still trying to get my life together.\u201d\n\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE SNAPSHOT:\n\n-Estimated cost of family violence alone to the Australian economy was $13.6 billion\n\n-Domestic and family violence is estimated to cost the NSW economy more than $4.5 billion each year.\n\n-Scathing NSW Auditor General report says Government\u2019s not doing enough to address underlying problem\n\n-In 2010, NSW Police responded to over 126,000 incidents involving domestic and family violence.\n\n-Domestic violence present in half of all households where children are abused\n\n-Nearly 20 per cent of homelessness is as a result of domestic violence\n\n-Australian studies indicate that domestic and family violence contributes to death, ill health and disability among women under 45 years of age more than any other single factor, including smoking or obesity.\n\n-Two in three victims of violence do not go to the Police\n\n-On average, domestic and family violence kills 36 people each year, but only one in ten victims were known by Police to be in an abusive relationship in the year before their deaths.\n\n-Nearly half of the 92,215 victims and 81,772 perpetrators, who came to the attention of Police in 2010 over family and domestic violence incidents, had a history of such incidents over the preceding five years.\n\n-Twelve per cent (10,680) of victims had been victimised five or more times and 16 per cent (12,980) of perpetrators had been identified as perpetrators five or\n\nmore times.\n\n-Domestic and family violence generates a significant amount of work for Government, including nine per cent of police call-outs, 13 per cent of persons charged in Local Courts and significant health and welfare activity.\n\n*NSW Auditor General report into Domestic Violence 2011", "article_metadata": {"description": "DOMESTIC violence victims will for the first time be &#8220;case managed&#8221; from co-ordination crisis centres to be set up across the State as a part of a radical overhaul of State government&#8217;s response system.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "DOMESTIC violence victims will for the first time be &#8220;case managed&#8221; from co-ordination crisis centres to be set up across the State as a part of a radical overhaul of State government&#8217;s response system.", "title": "\u2018It stops here\u2019: Domestic violence strategy revealed", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/it-stops-here-domestic-violence-strategy-revealed/story-fni0cx12-1226828045845", "image": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/047154-734787ec-95d8-11e3-8c37-1fa32af9e54c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/047154-734787ec-95d8-11e3-8c37-1fa32af9e54c.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226828045845, "keywords": "response system, legal advice, welfare agencies, domestic violence matters, vulnerable women, responsive system, agency experience, Domestic violence strategy, co-ordination crisis centres, life sentences, online dating service, central west, family violence damages, State government, stopping victims, victim-centred approach, failing victims, service providers, domestic violence, family violence, domestic violence cases, domestic violence victims, violence prevention, emergency housing, relentless campaign, legal system, shared understanding, launch sites, ,Orange,New South Wales,Australia, ,,,Germany, Mark Murdoch", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Feb 16 11:36:21 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Feb 16 11:36:21 EST 2014", "author": "LINDA SILMALIS CHIEF REPORTER"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbcc\"", "article_summary": "The NSW Police Domestic Violence Liaison Officers (DVLOs) and the Women\u2019s Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Services (WDVCAS) will be responsible for implementing the new referral pathways in the launch sites.\nIn September this newspaper revealed the number of domestic violence cases had risen by 30 per cent in the past five years to 130,000, and police are now spending up to 40pc of their time on domestic violence matters.\n\"Organisations do not have a strategy for working together across the State in response to domestic and family violence.\"\nThe sites were chosen based on the high rates of domestic violence in the surrounding suburbs.\nThe overhaul of the response system addresses a key area of Nanette of concern among domestic violence victims such as Nanette."}
