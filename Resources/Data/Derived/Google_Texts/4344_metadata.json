Results of this study indicate that Partners for Kids successfully improved the value of pediatric healthcare over time through cost containment, while maintaining quality of care.\n\n\n\nPartners for Kids (PFK) is a pediatric ACO serving approximately 300,000 Medicaid-eligible children in Ohio, designed to address rising costs and concerns about the quality of care delivered to low-income patients. In 1994, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital partnered with community pediatricians to create PFK, a physician-hospital organization with governance shared equally between Nationwide Children\u2019s and physician primary and specialty practice groups. ACOs are responsible for healthcare costs and quality across a defined population. To succeed, the ACO must improve value by reducing costs while either maintaining or improving the quality and outcomes of care.\n\n\u201cWe believe this study is the first evaluation of a pediatric ACO. Our data demonstrate the potential for an ACO to minimize the growth in cost of care for a pediatric population, all while maintaining or improving quality of care,\u201d says lead author Kelly Kelleher, MD, MPH, vice president of Community Health Services at Nationwide Children\u2019s and a member of the faculty at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.\n\nThe study assessed the value of care provided by PFK from January 2008 through December 2013. Costs of care were compared to overall reported costs of Medicaid within Ohio. Quality measures were derived from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Pediatric Quality Indicators, which focus on potentially preventable complications and hospitalizations and provide targets for interventions at both the provider and patient level. Four additional measures targeted specifically by PFK included neonatal intensive care days; emergency department visits due to asthma; diabetes care management; and 3- to 6-year-old well-child checks.\n\nResults of cost comparisons indicated that PFK had lower cost growth than Medicaid fee-for-service programs and Medicaid managed care plans. From 2008 to 2013, costs per member per month for PFK grew at a rate of $2.40 per year. Managed care plans grew at a rate of $6.47 per year and Medicaid fee-for-service costs grew at a rate of $16.15 per year.\n\nQuality metrics based on AHRQ indicators stayed consistent on most other measures, showed improvement for three measures (including two measures of overall quality of care), and declined on two measures. PFK-specific quality measures showed improvements including fewer NICU days, fewer visits to the ED for asthma and a significant increase in the number of well-child visits. A slight deterioration was seen in diabetes care management.\n\nOverall, the results indicate the PFK model substantially reduced growth in the cost of care compared to other Ohio Medicaid plans. In addition, quality-of-care measures held steady, with some small changes in both directions.\n\n\u201cPFK delivered on the promise of the ACO to reduce the rate of health care cost growth while maintaining or improving the quality of care,\u201d Dr. Kelleher states.\n\nPediatric ACOs may prove to be efficient models of reforming healthcare, Dr. Kelleher says. The National Committee on Quality Assurance, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving health care quality, is developing an accreditation and measurement proposal for ACOs. PFK will participate in its analysis.\n\n\u201cWhile an additional 30 million Americans will have access to health coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the difficult work of creating a system of better care, better health and lower cost will occur gradually, through pilot projects designed to encourage innovation, improve effectiveness and reduce costs,\u201d explains study co-author Richard Brilli, MD, chief medical officer at Nationwide Children\u2019s and a member of the faculty at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. \u201cOne of the primary vehicles through which the new law encourages such innovation is through provisions that establish Accountable Care Organizations in Medicare and for pediatrics, in Medicaid or CHIP.\u201d\n\nAbout Partners for Kids\n\nPartners for Kids is a physician hospital organization (PHO) currently composed of over 900 physicians caring for children and adolescents, including primary care physicians, pediatricians, specialty care providers and our sponsoring hospital, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nSince 1994, our network has offered a comprehensive range of health care services to health plans under our managed care agreements. Our primary goal is to improve quality and access for the patients who we jointly serve throughout the Central and Southeastern Ohio regions.\n\nAbout Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nRanked 7th of only 10 children's hospitals on U.S. News & World Report\u2019s 2014-15 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Children\u2019s Hospitals Honor Roll,\u201d Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital is one of the nation\u2019s largest not-for-profit freestanding pediatric healthcare networks providing wellness, preventive, diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitative care for infants, children and adolescents, as well as adult patients with congenital disease. Nationwide Children\u2019s, also ranked among the Top 10 on Parents magazine\u2019s 2013 \u201cBest Children\u2019s Hospitals\u201d list, has a medical staff of 1,100 and nearly 10,000 employees providing state-of-the-art pediatric care for one million patient visits annually. As home to the Department of Pediatrics of The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Nationwide Children\u2019s physicians train the next generation of pediatricians and pediatric specialists. The Research Institute at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital is one of the top ten National Institutes of Health-funded freestanding pediatric research facilities. Nationwide Children\u2019s remains true to the original mission since its founding in 1892 of providing care regardless of a family\u2019s ability to pay.
