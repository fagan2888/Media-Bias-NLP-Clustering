Children are in revolt, school boards under fire. Even the School Nutrition Association is alarmed by the consequences of the first lady\u2019s signature \u201cHealthy Kids Act\u201d of 2010. You can see for yourself, but be warned: The photos tweeted by students under the hashtag #thanksMichelleObama are not for the faint of heart. Forget about the battles over immigration, Iran, or Obamacare. The coming clash over school lunch will shape America\u2019s future. After all, it will largely determine whether or not our children think all politicians are fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem here is not one of intent. Michelle Obama isn\u2019t naive or misguided for believing that nutrition is important, or that sound menus might help improve children\u2019s health. But it\u2019s both naive and arrogant to think that federal legislation is the best mechanism for achieving those goals. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to find a more egregious example of the nanny-state run amok.\n\nSwept up by the euphoria of good intentions, a Democrat-led Congress pushed the bill through in 2010. The resulting regulations establish caps on calories, outlaw traditional flour-based pasta, and limit the fat content of milk. Don\u2019t even think about serving white bread. You know things have gone too far when New York\u2019s senators have to petition the federal government to declare \u201cGreek yogurt\u201d to be an acceptable source of protein for 8-year-olds. Senator Susan Collins\u2019s victorious defense of the Maine potato was a tour de force.\n\nThe unintended consequences of this unprecedented meddling would be laughable if it didn\u2019t represent such a tragic waste of time and money. A government audit reveals that during the past two years, more than 1 million students have walked away from school lunch programs. More than 80 percent of schools report an increase in the amount of food waste. And school lunch administrators report a significant increase in costs.\n\nIn an interview with Cooking Light magazine, the first lady reassures us that all will be fine once we\u2019ve raised a generation whose only experience was horrible school lunches. \u201cIf all they know are whole grains and vegetables, by the time they\u2019re graduating . . . they won\u2019t know anything different.\u201d That sounds more like indoctrination than education, all the more so when her own children attend private schools that are exempted from the rules.\n\nSet aside for a moment the ridiculous level of micromanagement \u2014 would it really be a national scandal if the staff at your local elementary school indulged students with 2 percent milk? The more fundamental question is why we won\u2019t allow states to set reasonable goals for feeding their own students. Does Michelle Obama feel that school administrators in Nashua, Newton, or Hartford are less trustworthy than federal bureaucrats?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually important, doesn\u2019t the federal government have anything better to do? Apparently, the first lady doesn\u2019t think so, nor do the legislators who pushed for the sweeping rules in the first place. For them, it\u2019s about control and the kind of self-gratification that comes from writing bills that tell other people to do the right thing \u2014 or else. It\u2019s also about the paternalistic and dangerous idea that anything that\u2019s a good idea should be a law, and preferably a federal law: Wear your seat belt, eat whole-grain pasta, and \u2014 please! \u2014 only 1.8 gallons per toilet flush.\n\nNo one should condone poor decision-making, and no one should belittle the value of maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. But the fact that some people will make poor lifestyle choices is the natural result of a government that allows people to make choices in the first place. The alternative \u2014 a government that actively legislates, regulates, and manipulates personal behavior \u2014 is far worse.\n\nThese rules aren\u2019t the end of the world. They\u2019re just foolish, expensive, and statist. The federal government should get out of the menu business. It\u2019s hard to believe, but school food was better in the old days. Just ask any 12-year-old \u2014 or a grumpy old man. It\u2019s one thing on which they can finally agree.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 Michelle Obama speaks out on lunches\n\n\u2022 Jeff Jacoby: Federal overreach \u2014 then and now\n\n\u2022 Tom Keane: Big Government is watching you\n\n\u2022 Letter: Beating back regulatory overreach on school meals", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1691057354", "eomportal-id": 258245, "description": "I\u2019ve reached the age where discussing \u201cthe way things used to be\u201d with my children takes on the aura of a script for Dana Carvey\u2019s \u201cGrumpy Old Man\u201d character.
