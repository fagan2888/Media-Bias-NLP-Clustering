She lost her job and burned through every penny she had -- and then some. Affordable health insurance is keeping her alive and afloat today, but that could soon change just as suddenly.\n\nTyson, 59, needed a liver transplant in 2013 after the Hepatitis C she\u2019d had for years rapidly worsened. Luckily, her doctors found a donor within three weeks and the surgery went well, but her recovery was complicated when her Hepatitis returned. A new drug called Sovaldi, which costs more than $80,000, cured her, but Tyson couldn\u2019t go back to work and her employer cut her off.\n\nWith that job went the health benefits, forcing Tyson to pay $600 a month for COBRA coverage, plus another $200 for medications, at a time when she wasn\u2019t bringing home a paycheck.\n\n\u201cI was faced with no insurance, faced with no income and I want to live,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI was about to lose everything -- my house, my car, my dignity. I mean, my life.\u201d\n\nWhen enrollment under the Affordable Care Act started in the fall of 2013, Tyson, who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, signed up for a subsidized plan that cost $19 a month. Alabama relies on a federally run health insurance exchange, which makes Tyson vulnerable to losing her coverage if the Supreme Court rules against the law later this year after hearing oral arguments Wednesday.\n\nTyson still hasn\u2019t been able to find work, despite a full recovery. Without a job, she tries to get by on $900 a month in disability benefits and $90 in food assistance. Subsidized health insurance has helped her maintain her health and manage her expenses, but her situation is precarious.\n\n\u201cI have nothing left. I\u2019m struggling today,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nWithout the subsidies, Tyson simply wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the insurance. \u201cNo way. If I did keep it, I would be choosing between having a roof over my head and my life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere would I cut corners? It would be food -- I would be trying to go to food banks.\u201d\n\nSo after narrowly avoiding a medical and financial disaster two years ago, Tyson could end up facing a life-or-death threat again: unable to afford doctor visits or drugs she needs to keep taking to prevent her body from rejecting her new liver.\n\n\u201cIt would be a waste of me even getting a transplant, basically,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more personal stories about the real-life effects of the Supreme Court case, go to Courting Disaster: Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These Six Lives Hang In The Balance.\n\nThe audio interviews in this feature were produced and edited by Ibrahim Balkhy and Brad Shannon.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2015-03-04 06:00:19 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "Courting Disaster: After Liver Transplant, Anxiety About Health Care Costs Without Obamacare", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/03/courting-disaster-lose-everything_n_6784756.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2672668/images/o-SHEILA-TYSON-OBAMACARE-SUPREME-COURT-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2672668/images/o-SHEILA-TYSON-OBAMACARE-SUPREME-COURT-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "JeffYoung", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Courting Disaster: After Liver Transplant, Anxiety About Health Care Costs Without Obamacare"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-03 06:00:19 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6784756", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "health care,health care reform,obamacare,Supreme Court,obamacare supreme court,obamacare lawsuit,Obamacare subsidies", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "health care,health care reform,obamacare,Supreme Court,obamacare supreme court,obamacare lawsuit,Obamacare subsidies", "published_time": "2015-03-03 06:00:19 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-03-03 06:00:19 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "For more personal stories about the real-life effects of the Supreme Court case, go to Courting Disaster: Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These Six Lives Hang In The Balance.\nSubsidized health insurance has helped her maintain her health and manage her expenses, but her situation is precarious.\nAffordable health insurance is keeping her alive and afloat today, but that could soon change just as suddenly.\nTyson, 59, needed a liver transplant in 2013 after the Hepatitis C she\u2019d had for years rapidly worsened.\nAlabama relies on a federally run health insurance exchange, which makes Tyson vulnerable to losing her coverage if the Supreme Court rules against the law later this year after hearing oral arguments Wednesday."}
