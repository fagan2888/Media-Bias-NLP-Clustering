It turns out one-fifth of the state's groundwater, which helps supply public water systems, contains high levels of contaminants that could be toxic. (Video via KQED)\n\nIf you live in the state, or have visited recently, you probably didn't notice the water looking any different than \u2014 say \u2014 normal drinking water. The USGS says that's because the ground acts as a natural filter, taking out any particles that can be seen with the naked eye. (Video via Dasani)\n\nBut just because the water looks clear doesn't mean it's free of contaminants.\n\nThe study looked at roughly 11,000 wells, which service 99 percent of Californians who get their water from the public water system, and found arsenic, uranium and manganese. But so far, the state's drought is still the more pressing issue.\n\nThe USGS only looked at public water wells, but it's possible the contaminants could also be present in California's more than 250,000 private wells.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey found that a fifth of California's groundwater contains potentially toxic contaminants.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey found that a fifth of California's groundwater contains potentially toxic contaminants.", "title": "California's Water Contains Potentially Toxic Materials", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/california-s-water-contains-potentially-toxic-materials/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1437012515.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey found that a fifth of California's groundwater contains potentially toxic contaminants.", "title": "California's Water Contains Potentially Toxic Materials", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/california-s-water-contains-potentially-toxic-materials/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1437012515.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=1mc2Y4djqjpmCqFEPQ9Spm1MaJ5VKMxy&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://49177", "iphone": "newsy://49177", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://49177", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "California water supply,U.S. Geological Survey,USGS,Water,contaminated,toxic water,California,study,findings,California drought,groundwater,public water supply,water wells,science", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1437012515.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05ee\"", "article_summary": "The agency's research, beginning in the early 2000s, looked at California's public water supply.\nA study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey found that a fifth of California's groundwater contains potentially toxic contaminants.\nThe USGS only looked at public water wells, but it's possible the contaminants could also be present in California's more than 250,000 private wells.\nIt turns out one-fifth of the state's groundwater, which helps supply public water systems, contains high levels of contaminants that could be toxic.\nThe study looked at roughly 11,000 wells, which service 99 percent of Californians who get their water from the public water system, and found arsenic, uranium and manganese."}
