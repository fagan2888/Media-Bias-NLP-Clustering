Germany is a popular market for global retailers\u2019 locations, according to a new survey. G. Schober/S. Brauer Photos\n\nGermany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, according to a new study released Wednesday by property consultancy CBRE.\n\nAbout 40% of the 115 retailers world-wide polled by CBRE said they plan to open a store in Germany this year.\n\n\u201cGlobal retailers continue to be attracted to Germany largely due to the opportunity to target more than 30 large cities with high purchasing power,\u201d said CBRE in its report.\n\nFollowing Germany are the U.K., to which 33% of retailers said they would be interested in expanding, and France, which received a nod from 31%.\n\nFrance\u2019s \u201cmature market with several strong cities and a large number of very successful shopping centers across the country\u201d is attractive to retailers, CBRE said, with the focus being on Paris. Recent changes to rules about Sunday trading days in France also are raising the country\u2019s appeal, with some areas now allowing 12 such days a year rather than five, and certain tourist zones letting shops stay open on Sunday all through the year.\n\nBy region, however, the results are more mixed. Retailers based in the U.S. are most interested in expanding to the Asia-Pacific region, with roughly 43% of U.S. retailers polled saying they are looking to Japan, China and Hong Kong for growth.\n\nAbout 47% of retailers based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said Germany is their top target market. Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, 50% of retailers said they are targeting South Korea.\n\nGlobally, CBRE said retail brands originating in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. are the most active. Of the brands looking to expand overseas, 16% came from each of these, while 11% came from Italy.\n\n\u201cPhysical stores remain the destination of choice for consumers,\u201d said CBRE in its report. \u201cRecognizing this, retailers continue to open stores in diverse locations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Germany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, ahead of the U.K. and France, according to a new study from property consultancy CBRE.", "title": "Global Retailers Lately Love Germany Most, Study Finds", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/04/global-retailers-lately-love-germany-most-study-finds/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF795_munich_P_20150304111433.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Global Retailers Lately Love Germany Most, Study Finds", "description": "Germany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, ahead of the U.K. and France, according to a new study from property consultancy CBRE.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Saabira Chaudhuri", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Germany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, ahead of the U.K. and France, according to a new study from property consultancy CBRE.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-04T17:23:52-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/04/global-retailers-lately-love-germany-most-study-finds/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-6243", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Germany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, ahead of the U.K. and France, according to a new study from property consultancy CBRE.", "title": "Global Retailers Lately Love Germany Most, Study Finds", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/04/global-retailers-lately-love-germany-most-study-finds/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF795_munich_P_20150304111433.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-6243", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-04T17:24:10-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd187\"", "article_summary": "About 47% of retailers based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said Germany is their top target market.\nAbout 40% of the 115 retailers world-wide polled by CBRE said they plan to open a store in Germany this year.\nGermany is a popular market for global retailers\u2019 locations, according to a new survey.\n\u201cRecognizing this, retailers continue to open stores in diverse locations.\u201d\nBrauer PhotosGermany is the world\u2019s most popular retail-expansion market, according to a new study released Wednesday by property consultancy CBRE."}
