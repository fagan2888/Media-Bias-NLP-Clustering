It's the affluent consumers,\" said Pam Danziger, president of Unity Marketing. \"I don't think it's unexpected that you're going to see their financial situation going closely with the stock market.\"\n\nThe LCI has followed the same general trend line as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials since it began 10 years ago. But it has bounced around a bit more than the indexes, which aside from 2014's early dip have seen a more steady rise in the years after the recession.\n\n(Read more: Coach looks to shed mom 'baggage' at Fashion Week)\n\n\n\nDanziger attributed this movement to the level of uncertainty that remains in Washington over issues such as Obamacare and unemployment. It's also tied to a new way of thinking among the affluent group's lower-tier earners, who in many cases have tapered their spending from $3,000 handbags to $300 options.\n\n\"It'd be nice to see [the LCI] go up, but I don't think it'll ever reach where it was in 2004,\" she said.\n\n(Read more: More changes needed at New York Fashion Week)\n\n\n\nHana Ben-Shabat, a partner in the retail practice of consulting firm A.T. Kearney, said the volatility seen in stocks so far this year will likely put a dent in retail consumption if it continues. This is especially true among the aspirational luxury shoppers, who can't afford luxe goods on a regular basis but splurge on special items. Since their net worth isn't as high to begin with, when their investments take a hit, they are typically the ones who feel the least comfortable with their finances.\n\n\"The minute people have a real or perceived risk for their assets or their total net worth they will think twice before they spend,\" she said.\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Krystina Gustafson.
