Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and David Vitter, R-La., have merged in an unlikely pairing to rein in the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending powers to Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nThe two introduced bipartisan legislation in the spring that would hinder megabank bailouts should another financial crisis hit the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt is time to end too big to fail,\u201d Warren said Wednesday during an event at the Cato Institute. \u201cIt is still a serious issue in this economy and more importantly, it is a serious issue in politics. We\u2019re trying to find a way to beat it back and to get us back to an economy that works better, not just for those at the top, but for everyone.\u201d\n\nWhen the 2008 financial crisis hit the U.S., the bailouts under Congress\u2019 $700 billion TARP package dominated headlines and political debate. But Warren noted the lesser-known $9 trillion in overnight loans the Federal Reserve was quietly \u201cshoveling out the backdoor\u201d that primarily funneled into just three financial institutions.\n\nThose loans, allotted under the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending authority, were issued below market interest rates, effectively giving those three big banks subsided loans at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nWarren and Vitter\u2019s bill would require the Federal Reserve to loan at a penalty rate of interest five points above the Treasury\u2019s lending rate at the time the loan is issued.\n\n\u201cThe point here is not to give you below market rates so that we can subsidize you, the point is to say if you\u2019re having to turn to the Fed for help in a crisis, then the Fed in that sense should be like other market lenders,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe legislation would retain the Federal Reserve\u2019s role as a lender of last resort, but it would require big banks that take a loan to pay a price for it.\n\nThe bill also restricts the Federal Reserve from lending money to financial institutions during times of economic distress unless the problem is deemed \u201csystem-wide\u201d and is the result of the market itself freezing, rather than the outcome of a poor business decision.\n\nThough Dodd-Frank\u2014passed in 2010 as a response to the 2008 financial crisis\u2014had a system-wide requirement, it was not explicitly defined, leaving the Federal Reserve broad flexibility in interpretation. The haziness led to the Federal Reserve counting just two financial institutions as satisfying the system-wide condition.\n\nWarren and Vitter\u2019s legislation would increase that threshold to five financial institutions.\n\nAnother problem with the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending powers is its measure for insolvency, Warren said.\n\nAccording to Warren, the Federal Reserve currently considers a financial institution insolvent solely if it has explicitly filed for bankruptcy.\n\nShe added that this allows the Federal Reserve to \u201cintercept\u201d large financial institutions that may be on their way to bankruptcy, but because they have not officially filed as such the Federal Reserve can extend them a loan.\n\n\u201cIf you advertise to the market that the Fed is here and no need for any large financial institution ever to have to go to the bankruptcy court house or to declare itself insolvent, but instead having trillions of dollars available to backup these giant institutions, I think that changes fundamentally the behavior of the big banks themselves, the behavior of those who lend the money and the behavior of those investing.\u201d\n\nVitter said this has created a market advantage for those \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, forcing smaller and midsized banks to compete for capital and investments against those big banks that have the government to fall back on.\n\n\u201cThe ultimately irony is that we\u2019ve come out of the crisis too big to fail, and I think mostly what we\u2019ve done is created a greater disadvantage to the small players who essentially had nothing to do with the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve titled the playing field even further in favor of megabanks against smaller community banks and credit unions.\u201d\n\nVitter said to move the bill forward in the Senate, broad-based public debate needs to overcome the string of banking interests that have lobbying arms across Capitol Hill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sens.
