Critics of the ruling say the decision does nothing to help Vermonters escape the state\u2019s troubled health care exchange.\n\nThe King v. Burwell case had the potential to make Obamacare unaffordable for 6.4 million Americans receiving subsidies on the federal program. Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, believes the court was swayed by this consequence, instead of looking at the law objectively.\n\n\u201cThe court was afraid that if they didn\u2019t let the president tax and spend without congressional authorization, Obamacare would throw cancer patients out of their health plans,\u201d Cannon told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nWhile President Barack Obama claimed a ruling for the plaintiffs would have victimized millions of Americans, Cannon said it is the Affordable Care Act that has created victims.\n\n\u201cThe 6.5 million people in the Healthcare.gov states were deceived by this administration when they told them that Healthcare.gov coverage would be affordable. It\u2019s not,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nAccording to Cannon, federal subsidies also trigger taxes against as many as 70 million employers and individuals in states that use the federal exchange, and those taxes continue to lack proper authorization for use as subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is acting illegally against 70 million Americans, and spending 20 billion dollars this year, without any congressional authorization \u2014 and contrary to the express terms of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\nStates like Vermont, which operate their own exchanges, expected federal subsidies to continue regardless of the ruling. However, Randy Brock, a former Vermont state auditor and state senator, said he does not think Vermont is in the clear.\n\n\u201cOne of the big dangers of the subsidy problem \u2026 is that you can\u2019t trust the federal government,\u201d Brock said. \u201cTime and time again, the federal government has offered money to the states to do certain things, that the states have then done. But in a federal-state partnership, if the senior partner, the federal government, decides later that it will not meet its share of the burden, that burden passes to the states.\u201d\n\nBrock added that the federal government can\u2019t be trusted to provide the current level of subsidies indefinitely. He said many federal programs, including special education, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and Medicaid, have left Vermont picking up the tab.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been stung repeatedly with this scenario over many, many years, you should foresee this happening (again),\u201d he said.\n\nMoving forward, Brock said, the debate should be about how to lower health care costs so subsidies are no longer necessary.\n\nOther Vermont voices reacted to Thursday\u2019s ruling.\n\nIn a news statement, Darcie Johnston, founder of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, accused the Supreme Court justices of \u201clegislating from the bench.\u201d Nevertheless, she said the ruling was an opportunity for Vermont to shut down its troubled exchange and transition to Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cThis would save VT taxpayers millions in operating costs and provide more affordable choices in health insurance to all Vermonters,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, she a true fix of health care requires \u201ca repeal or replacement that at least has some more free market, patient centered choices.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., praised the Supreme Court for recognizing \u201cthe common-sense reading of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when the United States is the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all Americans \u2014 and 35 million of our citizens today still lack insurance \u2014 it would have been an outrage to throw 6.4 million more people off health insurance,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.\n\nContact Emma Lamberton at elamberton@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Critics of Obamacare say the King v.
