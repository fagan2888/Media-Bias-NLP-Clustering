At the same time, police officers and pundits have argued that demonstrators are jeopardizing community safety, pointing to rising violent crime rates in recent months. As the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d theory goes, police have slowed down enforcement due to public scrutiny, which has lead to more crime, including homicides. In the absence of tough policing, chaos reigns.\n\nBut a new report from the Sentencing Project reveals the shooting of Brown and subsequent police backlash last August did not cause the uptick in St. Louis homicides last year.\n\nCREDIT: The Sentencing Project\n\nIn 2014, there were 159 homicides in St. Louis, compared to 120 in 2013 \u2014 an increase of 32.5 percent. Drawing on local police data, the Sentencing Project discovered that the ratio of monthly homicides, from 2014 to 2013, was highest in the first quarter of the year. The ratio of homicides jumped between February and April, decreased in April and May, and rose again in June \u2014 months before Brown was killed. And while the number of homicides climbed after August 2014, the ratio was never as high as it was in April. In other words, homicides occurred most frequently in the first part of the year, and therefore, evidence does not support a causal relationship between the events that unfolded in Ferguson and subsequent homicides.\n\nCREDIT: The Sentencing Project\n\nAdditionally, little evidence supports the notion that non-homicide violent crimes, including robbery and assault, in St. Louis were instigated by police grievances in Ferguson. Although the ratio accelerated between September and December, it was also high at the beginning of the year. And similar to the ratio of homicides, the ratio of violent crimes decreased over a two-month period, but increased again in May, long before Brown was shot. If anything, the most promising evidence in support of the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d was the ratio of property crimes in St. Louis, which remained relatively consistent until August, and increased thereafter.\n\nBut law enforcement officials and media outlets continue to make sweeping generalizations about the state of policing and increased criminal activity nationwide. Notably, a Wall Street Journal article written by Heather Mac Donald pointed to high rates of gun violence in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City and police disillusionment in those cities. \u201cSimilar \u2018Ferguson effects\u2019 are happening across the country as officers scale back on proactive policing under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric. Arrests in Baltimore were down 56% in May compared with 2014,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEven if officer morale were to miraculously rebound, policies are being put into place that will make it harder to keep crime down in the future. Those initiatives reflect the belief that any criminal-justice action that has a disparate impact on blacks is racially motivated.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times published another article about the spike in murders after Freddie Gray\u2019s death in Baltimore, MD, emphasizing officers\u2019 hesitance to enforce the law. \u201cAt the time of her announcement, Ms. Mosby\u2019s charges [for the officers involved] were seen as calming the city. But they enraged the police rank and file, who pulled back,\u201d the article asserts. \u201cThe number of arrests plunged, and the murder rate doubled in a month. The reduced police presence gave criminals space to operate, according to community leaders and some law enforcement officials.\u201d\n\nTwo anonymous Baltimore Police Department officers told CNN that the latest murder rate can be attributed to calls for less aggressive policing in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. Union leader and Lt. Kenneth Butler of the BPD also claims that fear of suspension and criminal charges has scared cops out of policing effectively in the city.\n\nIn response to these claims, Executive Director Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project told ThinkProgress, \u201cEvery city is going to be unique. There are certain trends that can affect crime rates nationally, but we do know that crime is very much subject to local circumstances. It can be demographics, the proportion of young men in a given population, the size and the kind of policing that goes on, the employment rates, types of drug abuse. All those factors can vary quite substantially.\u201d\n\nApplying the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d to New York City is hard to do, for example, since the police slowdown following Eric Garner protests did not have a negative impact on the city\u2019s crime rate, according to Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. After two officers were killed during the weeks of demonstrations, the NYPD staged its own protest by refusing to arrest people for petty crimes. Many thought the move would prompt chaos, but crime actually dropped in every borough.\n\nMauer thinks the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d is a dangerous concept, saying, \u201cIt gets us back the era of the 1980s when police had crime policy developed by soundbites and anecdotes. We had the War on Drugs and \u2018three strikes, you\u2019re out.\u2019 Far too often one sensationalized crime was made to stand in for the entirety of the crime problem. It\u2019s not a reasonable or ethical way to go about doing research, and it doesn\u2019t inform us about public policy and what we should be doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"There are certain trends that can affect crime rates nationally, but we do know that crime is very much subject to local circumstances.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"There are certain trends that can affect crime rates nationally, but we do know that crime is very much subject to local circumstances.\u201d", "title": "The Myth Of The \u2018Ferguson Effect\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/06/17/3670203/ferguson-effect-isnt-real-in-st-louis/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AP941006020734.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"There are certain trends that can affect crime rates nationally, but we do know that crime is very much subject to local circumstances.\u201d", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AP941006020734-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Myth Of The \u2018Ferguson Effect\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AP941006020734.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AP941006020734.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-17T08:00:41+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd287b\"", "article_summary": "As the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d theory goes, police have slowed down enforcement due to public scrutiny, which has lead to more crime, including homicides.\nJustice The Myth Of The \u2018Ferguson Effect\u2019 CREDIT: AP Black Lives Matter protesters in Miami in 2014Ever since unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson, MO last year, people across the country have taken to the streets en masse to protest police brutality and the mistreatment of black men and women.\nMauer thinks the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d is a dangerous concept, saying, \u201cIt gets us back the era of the 1980s when police had crime policy developed by soundbites and anecdotes.\nIf anything, the most promising evidence in support of the \u201cFerguson Effect\u201d was the ratio of property crimes in St. Louis, which remained relatively consistent until August, and increased thereafter.\nThere are certain trends that can affect crime rates nationally, but we do know that crime is very much subject to local circumstances."}
