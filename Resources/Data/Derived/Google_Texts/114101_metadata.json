On average, premiums nationwide are projected to rise 7.5 percent next year.\n\nWhat is different about Indiana? Kathleen Falk, Midwest regional director for HHS, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters that private insurers are \u201cgetting a better feel for how and what they should set their rates at.\u201d\n\nBut Mike Cahill, chief executive officer of Fort Wayne-based Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana, said later: \u201cIf we have any better feel for it, we have a more educated guesstimate. But it\u2019s still a guesstimate.\u201d\n\nCahill said insurers are still guessing at their rate structures because the federal marketplace is only 2 years old, insurers must set their rates several months ahead of open-enrollment periods and more insurance companies are joining the program each year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough experience out there to set rates,\u201d Cahill said in a phone interview.\n\nOpen enrollment in the marketplace will begin Sunday and run through Jan. 21. People who enroll by Dec. 15 will have coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nHHS uses the second-lowest-cost Silver plans as its benchmark for determining tax credits for qualifying customers. Its projections for 2016 premium increases for that plan range from a 35.7 percent price jump in Oklahoma to Indiana\u2019s 12.6 percent decrease.\n\nCahill said he thinks some Indiana insurers have set lower premiums because of a federal program set up to cover possible financial losses. But funding for the program known as the \u201crisk corridor\u201d has disappeared, he said.\n\n\"I think a lot of the new players in the market made the assumption that the government was going to be there to backstop them a little bit,\" he said. \"So they might have guessed a little bit too low (on premiums), and now they\u2019re not going to see the money. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out in 2016.\"\n\nPHP insures nearly 10,000 people through the Affordable Care Act. Other insurers providing coverage in northeast Indiana are Ambetter, Anthem, CareSource, MDwise and UnitedHealthcare.\n\nA review of their 2016 second-lowest cost Silver plans at HealthCare.gov shows a monthly premium range of $383 to $524 before tax credits. The average monthly tax credit for qualifying Hoosier customers was $319 this year. More than 219,000 Indiana residents are enrolled.\n\nFalk said 36 percent of enrolled Hoosiers switched plans from 2014 to 2015, saving on average $379 for the year after tax credits. That was a greater average savings for plan switches than in Illinois and Michigan but less than in Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWe saw a significant percentage (of enrollees) in each of these states did choose a different plan, with the presumption being they chose one that better fit their needs and their finances. ... It behooves people to shop,\u201d Falk said.\n\nThe nonprofit Neighborhood Health Clinics will have two local \"Coffee Talks\" where people can learn about enrolling and sign up for coverage.
