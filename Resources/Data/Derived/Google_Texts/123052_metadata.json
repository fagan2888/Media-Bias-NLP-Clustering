So far, U.S. agencies have sent mixed messages on the issue, industry officials said.\n\nHistorically, drugmakers use coupons and debit cards to encourage the use of high-priced medicines rather than less expensive older treatments and generics pushed by insurers using high co-pays as a cudgel. In the case of Amgen Inc.\u2019s Neulasta for chemotherapy patients, the company pays as much as $10,000 a year to help patients get the medicine. Amgen is among a group of companies continuing their aid programs.\n\n\u201cThis can be a significant issue for a middle-income family,\u201d said Mit Spears, general counsel at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the Washington-based lobbying group for the industry. \u201cI have a real hard time, just as a conceptual model, thinking the help you give a patient could be viewed as a kickback.\u201d\n\nMerck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, is the world\u2019s fifth-largest drugmaker by market capitalization, while Glaxo, based in London, is the seventh-biggest. New York-based Pfizer Inc., the world\u2019s fourth-largest, and AbbVie Inc., based in North Chicago, Illinois, declined to disclose what they\u2019re doing.\n\nPractice Continuing\n\nAmgen, meanwhile, is joined by Novartis AG, Sanofi, Eli Lilly & Co., Gilead Sciences Inc. and Johnson & Johnson as companies that said in interviews they\u2019ll continue the practice. The uncertainty, an unintended consequence of Obamacare, may mean arbitrary hardship for low-income patients who need help the most, said Nancy Davenport-Ennis, chairwoman of the National Patient Advocate Foundation.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, caps out-of-pocket costs for medical treatment as $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. However, that\u2019s a significant amount that many families on a budget would struggle to pay, said Davenport-Ennis, whose Washington-based nonprofit connects patients with assistance that can help offset the costs of their care.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the household incomes people going into the exchange marketplaces have, I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re going to be able to afford this,\u201d she said.\n\nDueling Statements\n\nEven though PhRMA believes the assistance is allowed, Spears agreed there\u2019s confusion. \u201c\"There\u2019s a natural kind of head scratching,\u201d he said. The dispute centers on dueling statements that came five days apart from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within HHS that oversees the Obamacare insurance marketplaces.\n\nIn an Oct. 30 letter, Sebelius said her department doesn\u2019t consider the private health insurers who provide coverage under Obamacare to be federal programs, which would presumably make it legal for drugmakers to help with patient co-payments. While CMS wrote in a guidance memo on Nov. 4 that it \u201cdiscourages this practice and encourages issuers to reject such third-party payments.\u201d\n\nSince then, the government has failed to make a definitive ruling on the practice, issuing no more guidance on the matter. Merck and Glaxo have kept assistance programs for non-Obamacare patients.\n\nHigh Co-Pays\n\nHigh co-pays for costly drugs are increasingly a feature of many insurance plans, even those with the most coverage. To keep the cost of premiums low, 9 of 10 plans offered through Obamacare feature specialty tiers that often force patients to pay a percentage of the cost of the most expensive drugs -- from 20 percent to 50 percent -- instead of a fixed co-pay of $20 or $50, according to a study by Washington-based health consulting firm Avalere Health LLC.\n\nWhile Merck wants to offer assistance to patients who need help with the co-pays, it won\u2019t because of \u201cthe uncertainty surrounding the roll out of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Kelley Dougherty, a Merck spokeswoman. \u201cMerck plans to revisit this decision once more information is available.\u201d\n\nGlaxo also won\u2019t provide assistance to Obamacare patients \u201cat this time,\u201d Emily Beamer, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\n\nOn the other side is New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, the world\u2019s biggest maker of health-care products. The company is offering the financial help because \u201cwe believe that decision is supported\u201d by Sebelius\u2019s letter, said Mark Wolfe, a J&J spokesman.\n\nPersonal Crisis\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement. The 2010 law is designed to bring health insurance coverage to 25 million more people by 2017. The system, though, may be unfair if it continues to mean some patients can get help while others can\u2019t, depending purely on the medicine they\u2019re prescribed, Davenport-Ennis said.\n\nFor Jeffrey Brandt, 60, paying the cost of his medicines without assistance would push his family into a financial crisis, according to his daughter, Tricia.\n\nBrandt is in many ways the ideal Obamacare beneficiary. The Dallas man bought a \u201cgold\u201d plan on Texas\u2019s insurance marketplace and in January was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer for which he\u2019s now covered.\n\nYet he also faces $900 in weekly co-pays for the chemotherapy drugs he\u2019ll take for seven months. He may get financial help from Amgen and Roche Holding AG, makers of two of the more than dozen drugs prescribed to fight his cancer. Roche\u2019s Avastin, for example, can cost from $45,000 to $109,000 for a course of treatment, according to the company.\n\nOut-of-Pocket Cost\n\nUnder his Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas \u201cgold\u201d plan -- the second-highest coverage level under Obamacare -- he must spend $3,250 out of pocket before the plan covers his co-payments, on top of what his daughter says is a $500 monthly premium. Louis Adams, a spokesman for the insurer, didn\u2019t comment on the issue when reached by e-mail yesterday.\n\nThe help can be the difference between being covered and financially secure, and covered yet unable to afford care, said Davenport-Ennis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a system that\u2019s fraught with opportunities for the very people who need that assistance the most to be left on the sidelines without the benefits for which they were enrolling,\u201d she said.\n\n$50,000 Yearly\n\nIn the past, Brandt made about $50,000 a year, according to Tricia Brandt, who is managing his care. He had to stop work as a construction contractor while being treated for his cancer, and is using his savings to pay his premiums and the drug co-pays.\n\n\u201cHe just started chemo,\u201d Tricia Brandt said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to help pay for all of his prescriptions because he doesn\u2019t have an income right now.\u201d\n\nBrandt\u2019s co-payments are about as much as his daughter\u2019s weekly income from the 70 hours a week she works as an accountant. She said she\u2019ll move into a smaller apartment in two weeks to cut her expenses to help fund his care.\n\n\u201cI started cleaning houses on nights and weekends. I don\u2019t know else to do,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Tricia Brandt has time between jobs, she fills out assistance applications to drugmakers, hoping that help for her father comes through. Even if they get that help, it could be cut off if the government decides that such co-payment programs are illegal.\n\nTricia Brandt said she is hopeful for her father. \u201cAs long as we can keep his treatment steady, he\u2019ll knock it,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him, \u2018You concentrate on getting better, I\u2019ll concentrate on taking care of the cost.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Drew Armstrong", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-26/obamacare-causes-merk-glaxo-to-end-co-pay-assistance", "title": "Obamacare Causes Merck, Glaxo to End Co-Pay Assistance", "description": "Abandoning a long-held industry tradition, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck &amp; Co. won\u2019t help low-income Obamacare patients pay for their high-priced drugs.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Drew Armstrong", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Washington,Drugs,Amgen Inc,Nancy Davenport-Ennis,Health,GlaxoSmithKline PLC,Merck & Co", "news_keywords": "Washington,Drugs,Amgen Inc,Nancy Davenport-Ennis,Health,GlaxoSmithKline PLC,Merck & Co", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-26/obamacare-causes-merk-glaxo-to-end-co-pay-assistance", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Causes Merck, Glaxo to End Co-Pay Assistance", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-26T15:36:07.990Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Abandoning a long-held industry tradition, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck &amp; Co. won\u2019t help low-income Obamacare patients pay for their high-priced drugs.", "parsely-tags": "Washington,Drugs,Amgen Inc,Nancy Davenport-Ennis,Health,GlaxoSmithKline PLC,Merck & Co,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-03-26T15:36:07.990Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-26/obamacare-causes-merk-glaxo-to-end-co-pay-assistance", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Abandoning a long-held industry tradition, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck &amp; Co. won\u2019t help low-income Obamacare patients pay for their high-priced drugs.", "title": "Obamacare Causes Merck, Glaxo to End Co-Pay Assistance"}, "fb": {"status": "Abandoning a long-held industry tradition, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck &amp; Co. won\u2019t help low-income Obamacare patients pay for their high-priced drugs."}, "parsely-post-id": "N2SZG56KLVRE01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2885\"", "article_summary": "Abandoning a long-held industry tradition, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck & Co. won\u2019t help low-income Obamacare patients pay for their high-priced drugs.\nIn the case of Amgen Inc.\u2019s Neulasta for chemotherapy patients, the company pays as much as $10,000 a year to help patients get the medicine.\n\u201cMerck plans to revisit this decision once more information is available.\u201dGlaxo also won\u2019t provide assistance to Obamacare patients \u201cat this time,\u201d Emily Beamer, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\nMerck and Glaxo have kept assistance programs for non-Obamacare patients.\nWhen Tricia Brandt has time between jobs, she fills out assistance applications to drugmakers, hoping that help for her father comes through."}
