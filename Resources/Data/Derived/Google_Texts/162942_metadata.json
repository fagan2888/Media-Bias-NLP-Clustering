Instead, it was meant to destroy the existing health care system, and in the process pave the way for liberals to step in with the comprehensive health care fix the far left has always really longed for: single payer.\n\nThere\u2019s often a hint of conspiracy surrounding the accusation, as if President Obama and the White House senior staff had hatched some meticulous plot to spend a year struggling to pass a health care law that they intended to fail in a series of carefully planned disasters sometime down the road, which would create the perfect opening for their true, secret goal.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought the notion was rather far fetched. Obamacare was a stalking horse for a modified version of Obamacare, not a single payer conspiracy scheme. But The New Republic\u2019s Noam Scheiber suggests that conservative activists worried that Obamacare will lead to single payer might be at least partially onto something\u2014maybe not in their belief that Obamacare was explicitly designed as a gateway to single payer, but in their worry that the health law will eventually lead to some sort of nationalized health system. And unlike those concerned conservative activists, Scheiber thinks this is a good thing.\n\nThe gist of Scheiber\u2019s theory (delivered in response to a griping Michael Moore op-ed about the health law in The New York Times) is that the law will create a unified, organized constituency for change. Private coverage in the exchanges will be too expensive for many, and dealing with private insurers will upset some beneficiaries. That will make existing government run health insurance options more attractive. \u201cBy pooling millions of people together in one institutional home\u2014the exchanges where customers buy insurance under Obamacare\u2014the Affordable Care Act is creating an organized constituency for additional reform,\u201d he writes.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that as Obamacare\u2019s flaws continues to be exposed, liberals like Scheiber, as well as a some Democratic legislators and even presidential candidates, will push for a single payer overhaul. But I don't think it's likely to happen in the forseeable future.\n\nFor one thing, it assumes that irritation with Obamacare\u2014a law designed and implemented exclusively by Democrats\u2014will somehow generate public support for additional Democratic health legislation that is even more sweeping. But judging by the beating Democrats have taken at the polls over last few months, public frustrations with Obamacare will turn the electorate toward Republicans. Democrats won\u2019t be given a second chance, with a mandate to do even more.\n\nScheiber\u2019s theory also overlooks how tough passage of Obamacare was in the first place\u2014and how much support the administration had to get from health industry stakeholders in order to eke out a legislative victory. Single payer would be even tougher. Moderate Democrats who were nervous about Obamacare the first time around would be even less likely to support single payer, especially given how the law cost Democrats at the voting booth. And there\u2019s no way that doctors, insurers, hospitals, and other major health industry groups would play nice with a single-payer push. Quite the opposite: Even beyond the insurers, much of the industry would see single-payer as a de facto nationalization of the health system, and they would fight the transition with everything they could muster.\n\nFinally, Scheiber\u2019s argument rests on the odd idea that individuals with private coverage will become jealous of people with Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nI might be willing to believe that some people would prefer Medicare to private coverage, but Medicaid isn\u2019t going to become a consumer favorite any time soon. Here\u2019s Scheiber:\n\nThere\u2019s the likelihood that, one day soon, especially if Medicaid becomes more generous, the working-class person who makes 175% of the poverty level will look at his working-class neighbor making 130% of the poverty level and think, wow, his health insurance seems a lot better than my private Obamacare plan.\n\nThat\u2019s some rather wishful thinking. For starters, Medicaid isn\u2019t likely to become more generous: State budgets are already straining under the burden of Medicaid spending, and the federal budget squeeze means that it's more likely that the federal share of the program will be cut back. Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to imagine someone with private health insurance looking jealously at a program that has no statistically significant effect on physical health outcomes and that has even been found, in a couple of narrow instances, to produce health outcomes that are worse than no insurance at all.\n\nMight Obamacare lead to a handful of state-level experiments with single-payer variants? Possibly, although that mostly means that very liberal states with heavily consolidated insurance markets will explicitly transform their insurance industries into public utilities.\n\nThere\u2019s a weird overlap between conservative fears and liberal hopes when it comes to single payer: Both seem to think that Obamacare makes a universal government-run system more likely. But both are wrong.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "If you spend any significant amount of time talking to conservative activists who oppose Obamacare, you\u2019ll eventually hear some variant on the theory", "title": "Sorry, Liberals: Obamacare Won\u2019t Lead to Single Payer", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/06/sorry-liberals-obamacare-wont-lead-to-si", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_01/-whitehousegov.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If\nyou spend any significant amount of time talking to conservative\nactivists who oppose Obamacare, you\u2019ll eventually hear some variant\non the theory that Obamacare was never meant to work.
