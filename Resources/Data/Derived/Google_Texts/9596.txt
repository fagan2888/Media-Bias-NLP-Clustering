EDITOR: On Feb. 18, 22 and 26, the Marathon County Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO had the honor and privilege of interviewing several candidates for School Board, County Board, City Council and mayor. The MCCLC is made up of union locals that have chosen to work together in solidarity to fight for the rights of working class citizens. We believe workers are the consumers who drive the economy, and without well-paid workers, we cannot have a thriving and prosperous economy that benefits everybody.

The candidates were given questions on the minimum wage; prevailing wage; workplace benefits; the condition of our roads; plans for the Wausau Center mall; restoring a healthy work environment in City Hall; and repairing relationships within the community, just to name a few. After lengthy discussion, review of written questionnaires and answers to these questions, we were able to reach a consensus on which candidates to endorse.

The Marathon County Central Labor Council endorses Jay Kronenwetter for mayor of Wausau. For Wausau City Council, we endorse Robert Mielke (District 11), Patrick Peckham (District 1), Rebecca McElhaney (District 6) and Joe Gehin (District 9). For Marathon County Board, the MCCLC endorses John Enk (write-in candidate for District 11), John Durham (District 26) and Ed Gale (District 36). Last, we endorse Theresa Miles, Mary Thao and Jane Rusch for Wausau School Board.

Please make sure you are registered to vote and that you have plans to get to the polls on April 5! A lot is at stake!

Joel Lewis,
