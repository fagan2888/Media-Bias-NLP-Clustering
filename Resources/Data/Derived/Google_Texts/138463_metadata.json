Live a healthier life.\n\n\"The only way to reduce health costs is to produce better health outcomes,\" Forrester said.\n\nForrester is trying to prove his point. The one-time Republican candidate for Senate and governor is president of Integrity Health, a company that manages health benefits for employers including the Toms River and Long Branch school districts. And he says the program helps them cut down on the cost of care, saving taxpayers millions by improving their employees' health.\n\nBut his strategy is about to be put to the test. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is scheduled in 2018 to put an excise tax \u2013 the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" \u2013 of 40 percent on health insurance plans that are considered expensive \u2013 namely, those with premiums and health savings accounts worth at least $10,200 for an individual employee and $27,500 for a family.\n\nBuy Photo Doug Forrester, president of Integrity Health, talks about the Partnership Health Center in Toms River, including the physical therapy room.

The Princeton-based company was hired by Toms River Regional Schools in 2009 to administer its health program.\n\nAmong its features: Integrity opened the Partnership Health Center on Washington Street, where the district's 2,000 employees and their dependents can go for routine checkups, blood work, X-rays, physical therapy and prescription drugs.\n\nBehind the scenes, three health care coordinators follow up with patients, making sure they are taking their medicine and making it to appointments.\n\nBuy Photo Phlebotomist Jessica Szpila works in the lab at Partnership Health Center for employees of the Toms River School District.

For example, they go to the health center instead of an expensive hospital emergency room. Or they see a doctor who helps them in one office visit instead of lots of followups.\n\nToms River school officials think it's working. The district's annual budget for employee health and prescription costs is $45.9 million. Its health costs have risen on average 5.8 percent a year for the past four years. By comparison, the state's health benefit plan has increased on average 9.2 percent a year during that time. It amounts to savings of $1.5 million a year, said William Doering, business administrator for Toms River schools.\n\n\"We do believe we are saving significant dollars,\" Doering said.\n\nThe pressure is on to save even more. The Cadillac tax is on the horizon. And it is steep.\n\nMany health economists say there is good reason for it. Obamacare wants to slow down health care costs that were growing so fast that they consumed 17 percent of the nation's economy.\n\nBuy Photo Doug Forrester, president of Integrity Health, talks about the Partnership Health Center in Toms River with Dr. Charles Bauberger. (Photo: Doug Hood/Staff Photographer)\n\nPaying for services, not outcomes\n\nIt was fueled in part, they say, by a system that rewarded health care providers for delivering as many services as they could, regardless of the patients' outcomes. And consumers had little idea of how much their visit cost; their insurance was provided through their employer, their bill was paid by someone else.\n\nOne way to change that: tax expensive insurance plans, forcing employers to pay either a huge price or shift more of the burden onto employees. Consumers then would need to think twice about, say, visiting the doctor for a cold instead of simply buying over-the-counter medicine.\n\n\"Many people think the current tax (system) makes people over-consume health care relative to other goods,\" said Katherine Hempstead, director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a research group based in Plainsboro.\n\nThe tax stokes one of Obamacare's biggest complaints. Employers are shifting more of the cost of health care onto their workers during a time when workers' pay hasn't been rising. It can create more financial hardship. And workers might avoid seeing a doctor when they should.\n\nEmployers facing the Cadillac tax \"are going to do what we\u2019re already seeing happening \u2013 decreasing the quality of coverage they provide,\u201d said Jim O'Connor, the Wall-based chief executive officer of CBIZ Employee Services Organization, a consulting firm.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. Charles Bauberger talks with physician assistant Lisa Bonin at the Partnership Health Center for employees of the Toms River School District.

Another Obamacare fight looms, only this time the law is facing a challenge not only from conservatives, but also from some of President Barack Obama's supporters \u2013 labor unions.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has called on Congress to repeal the tax. But it isn't clear how Congress would make up for the estimated $87 billion that it was expected to raise.\n\nIn New Jersey, where property taxes are the nation's highest, there is an added issue. Can school districts afford to pay the 40 percent excise tax?\n\n\"We are concerned, but are interested to see how it is rolled out, if and when it is,\" Doering said. \"And whether the thresholds established a few years ago will remain the same or not.\"\n\nThe plan for Toms River school employees isn't free. They, like other school employees statewide, have been paying increasingly more for their premiums the past four years. But in the eyes of the Cadillac tax, it doesn't matter who pays for the premiums, the employer or the employee. All that matters is the total.\n\nForrester said he has begun to look at ways to get Toms River schools under the current threshold, but he declined to elaborate. Nonetheless, he thinks there is only one way out. Prevent consumers from getting sick. And when they do get sick, make them healthy as quickly as possible.\n\nIf he were in charge of the state's pension and benefits program again, \"I would say, look, there just isn\u2019t any way we can protect the public purse over time unless we deal with health outcomes,\" he said.\n\nMichael L. Diamond; 732-643-4038; mdiamond@gannettnj.com\n\nDO YOU HAVE A \"CADILLAC\" PLAN?\n\nYou should check with your employer.\n\nAn estimated 16 percent of employers have at least one plan that would be subject to the tax, according to Kaiser Family Foundation, a research group.\n\nThe average individual premium in New Jersey was $5,678 in 2013, Kaiser said. And the maximum individual contribution for health savings accounts in 2015 is $3,350. Together, it amounts to $9,028, which is below the $10,200 threshold.\n\nBut health care inflation likely will put more employers at risk. Kaiser estimates 22 percent of employers will be above the limit in 2023 and 36 percent in 2028.\n\nBuy Photo Phlebotomist Jessica Szpila works in the lab at the Partnership Health Center in Toms River.
