It was a place where people were supposed to come to have dreams, to be able to realize their dreams. We weren\u2019t supposed to be people who were managed.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want to do is create, or recreate, that \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude that propelled us to the top, and not that \u2018what-can-you-do-for-me\u2019 attitude that will propel us to the bottom.\u201d\n\nCarson concluded the eight-minute appearance with a simple statement that demolished the premise of the American welfare state \u2013 and the Obamacare leviathan emerging from it.\n\n\u201cWhen you rob someone of their incentive to go out there and improve themselves, you are not doing them any favors,\u201d Carson said, both drawing applause and causing visible discomfort on the panel led by star and former welfare mother Whoopi Goldberg.\n\n\u201cWhat would be much more empowering is to use our intellect and our resources to give those people a way up and out.\u201d\n\nHe might or might not run for president, but there isn\u2019t a better spokesman for conservative values in America today.\n\nDo yourself a favor and take a few minutes to watch the appearance here.
