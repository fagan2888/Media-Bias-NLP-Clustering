Sorting through the options can be time-consuming, and the need to find help may arise during a crisis, when decisions must be made quickly.\n\nHoping to help consumers make those choices -- and to help themselves stand out in a competitive field -- some home health agencies are seeking voluntary accreditation by independent organizations.\n\n\"This market is crowded,\" said Margherita C. Labson, executive director of the home care program at the Joint Commission, one of the major health care accreditation organizations. \"These companies had no credible way of distinguishing themselves as better than others in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe nonprofit Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals and other health providers, is one of three groups recognized by the federal government as accreditors of a variety of home health agencies.\n\nIts seal of approval is one route toward the certification a provider needs to receive payment from Medicare, the federal health program for those older than 65. The other two groups are the Community Health Accreditation Program and the Accreditation Commission for Health Care.\n\nMedicare pays for home care only in limited circumstances, such as when a person needs temporary nursing care after a hospitalization.\n\nStill, companies that provide longer-term home care, including for people needing help with daily tasks like bathing and dressing, also may seek accreditation -- even if they don't accept Medicare or Medicaid and rely mostly on private payments or other insurance.\n\n\"We wanted some measure of quality beyond our own internal measures,\" said Sharon Roth Maguire, the chief clinical quality officer at BrightStar Care, a Chicago-based home care franchiser with 261 locations nationally that does not accept Medicare.\n\nBrightStar is one of two large home care operators recognized by the Joint Commission for having at least 95 percent of its franchise locations accredited. The second is CareMinders, based near Atlanta. To become accredited by the Joint Commission, an agency must undergo detailed reviews and on-site visits, including direct observation of patient caregiving, every three years.\n\nRoughly 7,000 home health providers are accredited by the Joint Commission, and an estimated 35 percent of them provide either skilled nursing care or personal care, Labson said. The others provide services like physical therapy, medical equipment and special pharmacy services.\n\nNew regulations also are driving interest in home health accreditation, Labson said. Hospitals are now penalized if patients are readmitted too quickly after being discharged, so they are looking for providers who can demonstrate that they can help make the transition to home go smoothly.\n\nA lack of accreditation does not necessarily mean the agency is not offering quality care, but it offers one way to gauge its commitment to high standards.\n\nAgencies pay fees to be evaluated for accreditation, so that can add to the costs -- especially if you are seeking someone to provide personal care like help with bathing or eating, rather than nursing care, which might involve cleaning and dressing wounds or administering medication. Smaller operators may offer quality care, but may not yet be able to afford the accreditation process.\n\nWhile accreditation is usually voluntary, Florida requires home health providers to be accredited by one of the three major groups to be licensed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/01/hfaging21.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d88\"", "article_summary": "The other two groups are the Community Health Accreditation Program and the Accreditation Commission for Health Care.\n\"This market is crowded,\" said Margherita C.
