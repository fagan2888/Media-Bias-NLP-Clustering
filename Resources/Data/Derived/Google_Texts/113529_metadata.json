Since 2005, he\u2019s written the uber-opinionated, fair-but-dangerously unbalanced opinion blog \"Attytood,\" covering a range of topics (but mostly politics and the media these days); it\u2019s been named best blog in the state by the Associated Press Managing Editors and best blog in the city by Philadelphia Magazine. He\u2019s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015\u2019s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream. Prior to coming to Philadelphia, he worked at New York Newsday, where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting.\n\nRemind me again why \"Pufferfish\" is a front-runner for president in 2016?\n\nThe vetters were stunned by the garish controversies lurking in the shadows of his record. There was a 2010 Department of Justice inspector general\u2019s investigation of Christie\u2019s spending patterns in his job prior to the governorship, which criticized him for being \u201cthe U.S. attorney who most often exceeded the government [travel expense] rate without adequate justification\u201d and for offering \u201cinsufficient, inaccurate, or no justification\u201d for stays at swank hotels like the Four Seasons. There was the fact that Christie worked as a lobbyist on behalf of the Securities Industry Association at a time when Bernie Madoff was a senior SIA official\u2014and sought an exemption from New Jersey\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act. There was Christie\u2019s decision to steer hefty government contracts to donors and political allies like former Attorney General John Ashcroft, which sparked a congressional hearing. There was a defamation lawsuit brought against Christie arising out of his successful 1994 run to oust an incumbent in a local Garden State race. Then there was Todd Christie, the Governor\u2019s brother, who in 2008 agreed to a settlement of civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission in which he acknowledged making \u201chundreds of trades in which customers had been systematically overcharged.\u201d (Todd also oversaw a family foundation whose activities and purpose raised eyebrows among the vetters.) And all that was on top of a litany of glaring matters that sparked concern on Myers\u2019 team: Christie\u2019s other lobbying clients, his investments overseas, the YouTube clips that helped make him a star but might call into doubt his presidential temperament, and the status of his health.\n\nThe Democrats had another year to use this widely available information about Christie, yet chose not to. What's the matter with them? Unlike the Sixers, they really seem to have successfully tanked on purpose.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160524, "editdate": "20131103T15:00:33", "twitter": {"title": "POTUS 45?
