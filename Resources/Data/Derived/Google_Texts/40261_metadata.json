Requested by Gov. Jerry Brown amid this year\u2019s budget negotiations, the sessions on transportation and health care will force lawmakers to focus on the two topics in hopes of striking some historic deals.\n\nBut compromises may be tough to come by.\n\nDemocrats hoping to solve the problems by raising taxes \u2014 including the dreaded gas tax \u2014 can no longer rely on supermajorities, which they lost last year.\n\nBecause tax and fee increases require support from two-thirds of lawmakers in both houses of the Legislature, Democrats will need the help of Republicans, some of whom have indicated they\u2019re open to hiking the gas tax for the first time in more than 20 years, but only if the money is restricted to transportation improvements. Democrats also have dangled the idea of boosting tobacco taxes to close the health care gap.\n\nThe white-hot tax issues should make the next four weeks among the most exciting Sacramento has seen in years. All eyes will be on Brown, who is poised to ask the Legislature to tax Californians without getting their approval at the ballot box for the first time since he took office in 2011.\n\n\u201cRepublicans who fear the end of their careers will need talking points that clearly articulate why the tax benefits their districts,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution who was a top aide to former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. \u201cVoting for taxes isn\u2019t exactly a ticket to longevity in these districts. They have a lot at stake.\u201d\n\nCapitol observers predict Brown will lead negotiations behind the scenes and say he\u2019s pulled off the impossible before. He persuaded Democrats, for example, to cut funding for safety net programs to balance the budget and got farmers and environmentalists to support the same water bond.\n\nOnce again, the stakes are enormous. California\u2019s roads and highways are deteriorating and becoming more expensive to repair by the day. And failing to pass a new tax on health care plans would create a billion-dollar hole in the budget overnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will be an important test of Brown\u2019s ability to deliver some really tough votes,\u201d said David McCuan, a political expert at Sonoma State University.\n\nSpecial legislative sessions are somewhat rare. In California, only governors have the power to call for them. And when they do, McCuan said, they\u2019re often trying to control the Legislature\u2019s agenda. They differ from regular legislative sessions in that lawmakers may introduce bills only on a single topic.\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called eight special sessions on the budget to force Republicans who didn\u2019t trust him and Democrats who didn\u2019t like him to work together to solve a series of messy financial crises. Last year, Brown called a special session to create a stronger \u201crainy day fund.\u201d\n\nThe special sessions this year will run concurrently with the Legislature\u2019s regular session, which is scheduled to end Sept. 11.\n\nBrown telegraphed his support for raising prices at the pump in his January inaugural address when he asked Democrats and Republicans to do the \u201cimpossible\u201d and craft an agreement to improve transportation infrastructure. Current revenue from California\u2019s 42.35-cent gas tax covers only a fraction of the state\u2019s annual highway repair needs.\n\nLast week, business organizations such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group said any deal should seek to raise at least $6 billion annually by raising gas and diesel taxes and increasing vehicle registration and license fees.\n\nThose priorities mirror legislation sponsored by Sen. Jim Beall, D-San Jose, that would raise the gas tax 12 cents, boost the diesel tax 22 cents and increase vehicle registration fees $100 for electric vehicles and $35 for gas-powered vehicles and hybrids. The roughly $4 billion the plan would generate annually would help pay for a $59 billion backlog of repairs on state roads and $78 billion in repairs for local roads.\n\nThe American Public Works Association estimates that every $1 spent to keep a road in good condition avoids $6 to $14 later to rebuild that road once it has deteriorated beyond repair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re literally putting ourselves in a hole if we wait any longer to find a way to finance this stuff,\u201d Beall said.\n\nHe spent his summer break crisscrossing the state to lobby for the bill and said he believes a few Republicans will agree to support the transportation tax and fee increases when the time comes. Perhaps not wanting to play their hand, Republican legislative leaders have declined to comment on the special sessions.\n\nIn the health care special session, lawmakers will try to pass a new tax on health care plans as well as a package of anti-smoking bills that aim to lower the state\u2019s health care costs by reducing the number of Californians who use tobacco products. A new $2-per-pack cigarette tax has been floated but not formally introduced.\n\nUC San Francisco researchers estimate that tobacco products cost the state $18 billion annually in direct health care costs and lost productivity associated with illness or premature death.\n\nSeveral tobacco-control bills that died in the regular session will have new life \u2014 and better chances \u2014 in the special session, including legislation seeking to increase the legal smoking age to 21 and regulate e-cigarettes.\n\nThose bills last month failed to clear an Assembly policy committee whose members have accepted more than $170,000 from the nation\u2019s two largest tobacco companies. But in the special session, the proposals will be vetted by all new policy committees.\n\n\u201cAnything you can do to reduce smoking will have a very large, very rapid impact on health care costs,\u201d said Stanton Glantz, a tobacco expert at UCSF. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you can do that would have such a big effect so fast, so lawmakers are wise to take this on.\u201d\n\nStill, creating a new framework to tax managed health care plans remains the Brown administration\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 priority,\u201d said a source close to the governor who was not authorized to speak publicly about special session negotiations.\n\nThe tax structure California uses now must be phased out by the end of the fiscal year because it doesn\u2019t comply with new Obama administration rules that dictate how health care plans may be taxed by the states.\n\nCurrently, the state taxes only plans that accept Medi-Cal patients and uses all the money it collects to help finance the health insurance program for low-income Californians, which now covers one-third of the state\u2019s residents after it was greatly expanded under the Affordable Care Act. The new tax must hit all plans whether they accept Medi-Cal patients or not.\n\nConvincing Republicans to back a new health care tax will be much harder than getting them to support a transportation tax or fee, political experts say.\n\n\u201cThe transportation taxes have broader appeal, but the health care problems are more urgent,\u201d said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who directs the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. \u201cGetting both taxes passed is going to be more than twice as hard as getting one.\u201d\n\nContact Jessica Calefati at 916-441-2101.
