A head-on crash has closed the Sagamore Bridge https://t.co/atPzGYe30n pic.twitter.com/MgEQsM6MEl — Boston.com (@BostonDotCom) November 6, 2015

I really enjoy cranberry sauce, but I have some serious doubts about how they go about making the stuff on Cape Cod. Well, that, or a truck accident that spilled cranberries across a bridge there early this morning was an unfortunate accident where no people were killed but one was seriously injured, and many berries were sacrificed.

Around 6:30 this morning, there was a head-on collision between a truck full of cranberries and another vehicle on the Sagamore Bridge on Cape Cod. Two people were injured, presumably the drivers of both vehicles: one sustained serious injuries and was transported to a hospital in Rhode Island. The other had minor injuries and declined going to a hospital.

The state police announced two hours later that the fruit had been cleared and the bridge re-opened. From 6:30 to 8:30, the spill came just in time to disrupt rush hour, yet was too early for Thanksgiving.

Food jokes aside, we hope that both injured people make a swift recovery, and that they aren’t tired of terrible cranberry jokes and puns yet. Or ever.
