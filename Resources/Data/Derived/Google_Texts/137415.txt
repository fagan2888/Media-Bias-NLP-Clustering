Blue and purple jellyfish-like sea creatures have washed up by the thousands on Oregon beaches over the last few days.

The creatures are called velella velella. They’re also commonly called “purple sailors,” “little sail,” and “by-the-wind sailors.”

They typically live in the open ocean, but when warm water and storms draw them near shores, the wind blows them onto beaches, where they die in piles, KGW reported.

“They have a sail fin that has a slight bend to it and that helps them curve again from the beach and stay off the beaches,” Steve Green from the Coastal Interpretive Center told CNN.

The Oregonian says velella velella can be beautiful to look at but give off a fishy smell as they decay. They don’t sting people who touch them, but Oregon State University experts say not to walk barefoot through a pile of them since they contain a mild neurotoxin.
