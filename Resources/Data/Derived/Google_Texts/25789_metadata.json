The $1.9 million renovation took nearly six months to complete, but the property has undergone substantial improvements over the last four years.\n\nThe property was previously deteriorating, having been foreclosed upon and abandoned, Pappacoda said.\n\nHope Springs Villas was funded by a grant from the county\u2019s Neighborhood Stabilization Program through a Housing and Urban Development grant. The recently completed improvements include the completely renovated apartments, repaving of the parking lot, landscaping and lighting upgrades, new appliances, new roofing, renovated property manager\u2019s office, new laundry room and upgraded HVAC and electrical system, Pappacoda said.\n\nThe Neighborhood Stabilization Program was established for the purpose of stabilizing communities that have suffered from foreclosures and abandonment, authorized under the Housing & Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008. The program\u2019s major goal is to purchase and redevelop foreclosed and abandoned homes and residential properties, and also stabilize communities within strategic targeted areas, according to the press release.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "Lake County and LifeStream Behavioral Center officials will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday for nearly three dozen affordable housing units in Leesburg that took almost $2 million to renovate.", "title": "3-dozen affordable housing units unveiled", "url": "http://www.dailycommercial.com/news/article_d7b606b1-bfaf-5eda-843c-06762c69bfef.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailycommercial.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/42/7421cd54-a71a-11e4-ae7a-6bbcfdbdf059/54c928d7d5c85.image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailycommercial", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 108599415991304}, "keywords": "leesburg,lifestream,lake county,lake_county,leesburg,news", "google-site-verification": "h_JIwo5TKFCMaJN3XKwQEjqiSRq1nDT50zFNlwpyIqo", "news_keywords": "leesburg,lifestream,lake county,lake_county,leesburg,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lake County and LifeStream Behavioral Center officials will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday for nearly three dozen affordable housing units in Leesburg that took almost $2 million to renovate."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7356\"", "article_summary": "The complex consists of 35 affordable housing units which include a manager\u2019s apartment, laundry room, 18 two-bedroom units and 16 one-bedroom units, Elisha Pappacoda, the county\u2019s public information officer, said in a press release.\nLake County and LifeStream Behavioral Center officials will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday for nearly three dozen affordable housing units in Leesburg that took almost $2 million to renovate.\nThe complex, called Hope Springs Villas, is located at 1171 Bentley Road, where the ceremony will be held at 11 a.m.\nHope Springs Villas was funded by a grant from the county\u2019s Neighborhood Stabilization Program through a Housing and Urban Development grant.\nThe $1.9 million renovation took nearly six months to complete, but the property has undergone substantial improvements over the last four years."}
