For booklovers everywhere, it\u2019s the ne plus ultra of e-book readers.\n\nAfter years of devoting the bulk of its creative efforts to developing ever-fancier Kindle Fire tablets (a Mayday button to summon instant help! Faster processors, fancier graphics capabilities, and the potential for deploying the Firefly button to identify all kinds of digital content\u2026) it\u2019s nice to see the Amazon geeks go back to the drawing board to come up with a better e-reader.\n\nRelated: Holiday Shopping Alert \u2014 The Most Dangerous Toys for Kids\n\nReaders don\u2019t necessarily want to read on tablets or phones. I\u2019m not saying that many don\u2019t end up doing so, but if you\u2019re reading a lot, staring at a backlit screen in the way that you tend to when you\u2019re reading line after line of digital text (you know, book style, as opposed to the way that you\u2019re reading this column or any other digital media) is going to drive you crazy or wreak havoc on your eyesight.\n\nThe Paperwhite, launched in the fall of 2012, was a step in the right direction. It uses built-in LEDs to illuminate the e-reader\u2019s screen, and they were adjustable, to boot. And the advances in e-ink technology has meant that so far (touch wood) it is the only Kindle device I\u2019ve owned that hasn\u2019t succumbed to the dreaded \u201cscreen freeze,\u201d in which the screensaver bleeds into the text beneath it, making it impossible to read. \u201cYou just read too much,\u201d one Amazon tech support person scolded me, when a Kindle Keyboard (generation 3) succumbed to this malady less than six months out of the box.\n\nBut if you\u2019re an avid reader, well\u2026 reading a book on the Voyage is probably akin to the experience that an auto aficionado has driving a Ferrari 458 Spider or a Lamborghini Veneno \u2014 at a fraction of the price. It\u2019s still expensive by e-reader standards, but if you spend more than two hours a day with your nose in a book, and the price doesn\u2019t immediately cause you to say, \u201cNope, can\u2019t afford it,\u201d you need to consider it. Because it\u2019s state of the art e-reading; it finally delivers on the promise.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nWhen you\u2019re reading, you immerse yourself in a book \u2014 something known to those who study this kind of stuff as \u201cdeep reading.\u201d You need to remove distractions, from backlighting to stuff that pops up (ooh, look, an e-mail alert!) to superfluous actions that require you to pull your attention away from the word \u2014 things like how you hold the device (or the book), how you turn the page (or the cyber page), how readable (or unreadable) the print is, and whether you can easily jump to and from the text to the footnotes or from one point in a chapter to another. Kindle Paperwhite does a good job; Kindle Voyage does an extraordinary job of all that.\n\nRelated: 16 Amazing Pocket Products\n\nFor starters, the device itself is truly featherweight: It\u2019s only 6.3 ounces, a full ounce lighter than the Paperwhite. It\u2019s smaller and thinner \u2014 and feels significantly lighter and smaller in the hand than the differences in dimensions and weight alone would suggest. To anyone who says this doesn\u2019t matter, try reading for two or three hours straight while holding a Kindle in one hand and then tell me that weight doesn\u2019t matter. (And yes, you do want to hold it one hand, so that you can save the other one for turning the page, sipping your cup of tea or coffee, or whatever else you\u2019re doing, like eating your dinner\u2026.)\n\nThe screen resolution is something else that you\u2019ll appreciate more when you\u2019re using the Voyage than you will in the abstract. What\u2019s the difference between 300 pixels per inch and 221 pixels per inch? You can tell if you go looking for it \u2014 jagged edges to the text. But it\u2019s something that you\u2019re more likely actually to feel, viscerally, when you\u2019ve been reading for a long time: The text stays sharp and doesn\u2019t blur.\n\nRelated: 13 Great Holiday Gifts for Work\n\nWhile a lot of the other features are great (the degree of subtle LED lighting varies automatically, instead of having to be adjusted manually), the biggest winner for me is not having to use touchscreen controls. The touchscreen is OK when it comes to searching for or buying a book \u2014 especially since there\u2019s a greater degree of precision in the touchscreen technology here than, say, on my Samsung Galaxy, meaning fewer frustrating typos and less temptation to hurl the device across the room. But page turns? That\u2019s finicky stuff. I don\u2019t really want my finger moving across my line of sight while I\u2019m trying to read \u2014 or trying repeatedly to get the page turn to work in just the right way. That\u2019s smartphone/tablet technology, not ideal e-reader technology.\n\nSo I\u2019m a big fan of the new page-turn system that makes its debut in the Voyage. The screen, for the first time, is set flush with the body of the Kindle device, and along both sides are haptic sensors. Hit the upper one on either side and it goes back one page; the lower one will take it a page forward. A big deal has been made about the \u201cfeedback\u201d feeling. \u201cIsn\u2019t it like an electric buzz?\u201d someone asked me. Actually, it\u2019s closer to the sensation of depressing a page turn button on the (now defunct) standard Kindle. Only there are no moving parts.\n\nSo, what\u2019s missing? Well, there is no speaker. But so what? If you\u2019re a reader, you bought this to read. Amazon has a great line of (less expensive) Fire tablets that offer super sound; you can listen to your audiobooks or text-to-speech function on one of those devices, or on an older Kindle.\n\nThe storage still isn\u2019t what it could or should be. Yes, there is the cloud, but there are still some places where WiFi isn\u2019t working or available. (That\u2019s the reason I was willing to pay the extra $80 for the 3G, which works amazingly well worldwide.) But I\u2019d be willing to put up with an extra half an inch of space or extra ounce if it meant I didn\u2019t have to delete a book from the device simply in order to download another one.\n\nOddly enough, the biggest \u201cmiss\u201d by Amazon has nothing to do with the Voyage itself, but with the lack (so far) of a reasonable cover for the device. Amazon\u2019s own Origami cover is a bizarre misstep: They have prioritized design over function and come up with a product that seems aimed more at users of a Kindle Fire, who might want to prop up their devices in order to watch a movie. Try to prop up a Voyage using one of these pricey covers and then turn the page, and over it goes. Nor is the cover designed in such a way that you can hold it comfortably. In fact, you\u2019ll want to bypass Amazon\u2019s website altogether and go hunting for Voyage covers on eBay, where a far greater assortment seem to exist, at far better prices.\n\nBut after years of wondering when Amazon would prioritize the concerns of the avid readers who spend thousands of dollars a year downloading e-books \u2014 and who have de facto given it the market clout to bully giant publishers like Hachette \u2014 I\u2019m just delighted that the day has finally come when I can gripe about something as small as the design of the Kindle\u2019s cover.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The new Kindle Voyage is not just a fancy Kindle Paperwhite.", "title": "Amazon\u2019s Kindle Voyage Is the Lamborghini of E-Readers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/04/Amazon-s-Kindle-Voyage-Lamborghini-E-Readers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12042014_Amazon_Kindle_Voyage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/04/Amazon-s-Kindle-Voyage-Lamborghini-E-Readers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12042014_Amazon_Kindle_Voyage.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The new Kindle Voyage is not just a fancy Kindle Paperwhite.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02c2\"", "article_summary": "Kindle Paperwhite does a good job; Kindle Voyage does an extraordinary job of all that.\nThe new Kindle Voyage is not just a fancy Kindle Paperwhite.\nThe screen, for the first time, is set flush with the body of the Kindle device, and along both sides are haptic sensors.\nThe screen resolution is something else that you\u2019ll appreciate more when you\u2019re using the Voyage than you will in the abstract.\nTry to prop up a Voyage using one of these pricey covers and then turn the page, and over it goes."}
