While the administration is tempering expectations by projecting only modest sign-up growth, it is intent on recruiting healthier and therefore less-costly people in a bid to keep a lid on rising premiums and ensure the new insurance marketplaces thrive.\n\nTo that end, advocacy and community groups plan to make person-to-person pitches at hipster hangouts like Ben\u2019s, not to mention at sports bars during college championships and at movie theaters for the openings of the new Star Wars and the next installment of The Hunger Games.\n\nThe economic and political stakes could not be higher. In several states, insurance premiums will rise by double digits this year, though most people eligible for Obamacare health plans receive federal subsidies (though not everyone understands they are eligible.) Many middle-class families make too much money to qualify for the federal tax breaks yet struggle to afford health insurance, leaving them vulnerable to potentially high medical bills from an emergency.\n\nSome eye-popping rate hikes by dominant carriers have already sparked outrage from Republicans and concern from consumer advocates. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee will raise individual rates by more than one-third, while the Blue plan in Minnesota will jump by nearly 50 percent.\n\nBut those examples could ultimately prove to be aberrations when everything shakes out. Three of the largest states \u2014 Florida, New York and California \u2014 will see average premium hikes of less than 10 percent for next year.\n\nPolls show that affordability remains a major barrier even for people with Obamacare coverage. Forty-four percent of people surveyed by the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation described paying their premiums \u201cdifficult,\u201d while a majority (56 percent) said they might consider dropping their insurance if the costs rose over the next few months.\n\nCristina Calvillo-Rivera, who manages outreach for Young Invincibles, a millennial-focused advocacy group, says her group will promote benefits like free preventive care and birth control for women.\n\n\u201cThey want to know, \u2018Why am I paying $50 to $100 a month for health insurance?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nBut the law\u2019s critics remain skeptical that will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t the uninsured jump on this? Because it is not a good value for the money,\u201d says Chris Conover, a critic of the law and a research scholar at the Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research at Duke University. \u201cOnly people with lowest income will get pulled in and enticed by the subsidies.\u201d\n\nFor backers of the law, the politics of this enrollment season are more urgent than ever against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in which every Republican is vowing to repeal the law. The more people who benefit from Obamacare, the harder it becomes for Republicans to undo or weaken it, even if the GOP wins the White House. And Republicans on the campaign trail, as well as some in Congress are not backing down from their pledges to repeal the law.\n\nThe Democrats \u201cknow it will take us into bankruptcy if we don\u2019t watch it, and they know the additional costs are just about to alight on people\u2019s desks,\u201d says Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nIn the face of that opposition, advocacy and community groups say they plan to work hard not just to reach the uninsured but to make sure the more than 9 million paying Obamacare customers re-up during the three-month open enrollment season.That includes Americans who will lose their insurance plans at the end of this year, thanks to the failure of nine co-ops. Other enrollees will contend with rising premiums, or changes in their income and are being urged to shop around for alternative plans. Critics argue that people may simply drop out of Obamacare rather than deal with the bureaucratic hassle of finding another plan.\n\n\"We\u2019re getting really focused,\u201d says Jodi Ray, project director of Florida Covering Kids and Families at the University of South Florida in Tampa, one of the many groups signing people up. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing the cast-the-wide-net thing anymore.\u201d\n\nThe administration and advocacy groups plan to concentrate their efforts this year in a handful of cities: Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Northern New Jersey, and Miami, which have large concentrations of people eligible for subsidized coverage\n\nThey\u2019ll also lean on \u201ctheme weeks\u201d to reach out to particular groups. The week of Nov. 16, for instance, has been designated LGBT and Native-American outreach week, says Calvillo-Rivera.\n\nFor Latinos, much of the outreach effort this year hinges on digital media, advertising, texting, and in-person service \u2014 a very targeted strategy that blends lessons learned from both political campaigns and marketing. In Austin, Texas, a not-for-profit called Insure Central Texas plans to do a bilingual phone bank and call the 12,000 individuals they\u2019ve enrolled in Obamacare so far to ensure that they keep their coverage.\n\n\u201cThe focus on renewal will be stronger this year,\u201d says Rachelle Rubinow, with Community Catalyst, an advocacy group based in Boston that works with Latinos. \u201cWe\u2019re promoting the benefits of coming back to the marketplace.\u201d\n\nInsure Central Texas\u2019s data from the first enrollment season showed that only 12.6 percent of the people they originally enrolled in 2013 signed up for a second year of coverage. The messages about re-enrolling in insurance plans confused many people in Texas, says Elizabeth Colvin, director of Insure Central Texas.\n\nHer clients mixed up paperwork, or made mistakes on applications about re-verifying their income, leading to confusion and dropped coverage. Colvin expects the same amount of churn this year during open enrollment season.\n\nThe National Health Alliance for Hispanic Health, with a $1.3 million grant, will take the notion of one-on-one help a little further this year by incorporating text messaging that allows Latinos to make sign-up appointments to get help enrolling.\n\nThe Obama administration has also made clear that it won\u2019t be shy about pointing out that the penalty for not having insurance has risen for the second year. The hammer that began as $95 in 2014 will now be $695 for an individual, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher, in 2016.\n\nResearch from Enroll America found that one-third of consumers who enrolled in Obamacare the first year did so because of the penalty.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019re very clear and explicit about that $695 penalty, so that people understand the choice that they\u2019re making,\u201d says Lori Lodes, communications director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nPaul Demko contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Signing up younger, healthier people is a make-or-break issue as the health law\u2019s third open enrollment season gets underway Nov. 1.", "title": "The Ben's Chili Bowl recruiting strategy for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obamacare-young-people-enrollment-215127", "image": "http://static.politico.com/71/a0/1b21d1394a2c819fc17bcc0ef3e7/bens-chili-bowl.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Signing up younger, healthier people is a make-or-break issue as the health law\u2019s third open enrollment season gets underway Nov. 1.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca225\"", "article_summary": "The messages about re-enrolling in insurance plans confused many people in Texas, says Elizabeth Colvin, director of Insure Central Texas.\n\u201cThey want to know, \u2018Why am I paying $50 to $100 a month for health insurance?\u2019\u201d she says.\nIn several states, insurance premiums will rise by double digits this year, though most people eligible for Obamacare health plans receive federal subsidies (though not everyone understands they are eligible.)\nMany middle-class families make too much money to qualify for the federal tax breaks yet struggle to afford health insurance, leaving them vulnerable to potentially high medical bills from an emergency.\nThe fate of Obamacare\u2019s next enrollment push may be decided in places like Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl."}
