The European Parliament urged the government to unblock the court by publishing a recent ruling, something the government refuses to do.\n\nIn their resolution the EU lawmakers said that actions taken by Poland's government and president have led to the \"effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal which poses a danger to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\"\n\nThe resolution was adopted in Strasbourg, France by a 513-142 vote with 30 abstentions. It is non-binding, but could pave the way for further EU procedures and indicates that Poland's international reputation has been damaged under the Law and Justice government that took office in November.\n\nThe resolution drew criticism from Poland's ruling party lawmakers, who said it misrepresented the situation in Poland and sided with Poland's opposition parties.\n\nThe opposition politicians said the vote was a sign that things are going in the wrong direction under the current government.\n\nIn January, the EU opened a preliminary assessment of the rule of law in Poland \u2014 the first step in a drawn-out procedure that could ultimately lead to suspending Warsaw's voting rights in the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThe resolution suggested the procedure should advance if Poland, an EU member since 2004, fails to follow the recommendations voted in on Wednesday.\n\nThe resolution stressed all EU members must observe the bloc's values and principles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "European Parliament: Poland's policies threaten democracy - AP News: WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The European Parliament on Wednesday condemned .05/27/2016 9:31:36AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The European Parliament on Wednesday condemned Polish government policies, saying they", "title": "AP News - European Parliament: Poland's policies threaten democracy", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/13/european-parliament-polands-policies-threaten-democracy-n2147921", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The European Parliament on Wednesday condemned Polish government policies, saying they", "title": "AP News - European Parliament: Poland's policies threaten democracy", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/13/european-parliament-polands-policies-threaten-democracy-n2147921", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "European Parliament: Poland's policies threaten democracy, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The European Parliament on Wednesday condemned Polish government policies, saying they paralyze a top court and threaten Poland's democracy and the rule of law.\nThe resolution drew criticism from Poland's ruling party lawmakers, who said it misrepresented the situation in Poland and sided with Poland's opposition parties.\nThe European Parliament urged the government to unblock the court by publishing a recent ruling, something the government refuses to do.\nThe resolution suggested the procedure should advance if Poland, an EU member since 2004, fails to follow the recommendations voted in on Wednesday.\nThe resolution stressed all EU members must observe the bloc's values and principles."}
