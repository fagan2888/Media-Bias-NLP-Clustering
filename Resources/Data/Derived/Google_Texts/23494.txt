The Internal Revenue Service warns that unscrupulous tax preparers have told consumers to pay them directly instead of the federal government to settle potential fines assessed to those who don't have health insurance.

Under the Affordable Care Act, uninsured residents who don't qualify for a coverage exemption are required to make a payment with their 2014 federal income tax return. The IRS has since received several reports of tax preparers instructing clients to make that payment, known as an individual shared responsibility payment, directly to the preparer.

Officials at the IRS are reminding taxpayers that the payment should only be made with their tax return or in response to a letter from the IRS, never to an individual.

Several of those targeted in the scam already have coverage or qualify for an exemption, the IRS said, but scammers use several different methods to convince taxpayers that they still must pay the penalty.

Scam artists tend to use a variety of methods to extract the payment, including targeting individuals who speak limited English or telling people that they must pay the individual preparer due to their immigration status, the IRS said in a press release.

Some have also promised a lower payment amount if a client pays them directly, the IRS said.

The IRS said individuals should choose their tax professional carefully and report scams to the federal agency.

Several groups are exempt from the individual shared responsibility payment, including those who don't earn enough to file a federal tax return, members of federally recognized Native American tribes, religious objectors, prisoners, undocumented immigrants and others.
