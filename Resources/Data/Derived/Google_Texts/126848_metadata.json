Roberts Jr. said late Wednesday that partisan extremism is damaging the public\u2019s perception of the role of the Supreme Court, recasting the justices as players in the political process rather than its referees.\n\nDivisive battles over confirmations and mischaracterization of the merits of the court\u2019s decisions worry him, Roberts told a ballroom crowd of about 1,000 people at a celebration of Law Day at New England Law-Boston, a private law school.\n\nCriticism of the court \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d Roberts said, as long as it is not based on a misunderstanding of how the court differs from the political branches.\n\n[How conservative Roberts became a GOP target]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually discussed as, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re in favor of this or you\u2019re in favor of that,\u2019 \u201d Roberts said in response to questions from the law school\u2019s dean, John F. O\u2019Brien.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held a hearing in July to discuss possible solutions to what he calls Supreme Court \"activism,\" citing recent decisions made on Obamacare and same-sex marriage. (U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary)\n\n\u201cIn fact, our ruling is that whoever does get to decide this or that is allowed to do it, and that it\u2019s not unconstitutional, that it\u2019s consistent with the law,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut we often have no policy views on the matter at all, and that\u2019s an important distinction.\u201d\n\nThe court is under heavy criticism from all sides in the presidential campaigns, with Republican Donald Trump suggesting he would appoint justices who would overturn the court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision saying gay couples have a constitutional right to marry and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders making a rejection of the court\u2019s Citizen United campaign finance decision a litmus test for their potential nominees.\n\nAnd before the justices adjourn in June, the court will decide cases involving a host of issues at the heart of the political debate: affirmative action in university admissions, abortion restrictions, the ability of religious objectors to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage obligation, and President Obama\u2019s plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\n[Supreme Court adds to political docket with review of Obama\u2019s power]\n\nA target of Republicans\n\nRoberts himself \u2014 once touted by Republicans as a prototypical Supreme Court nominee \u2014 has become a focus on the right. GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas, said Roberts\u2019s nomination was a mistake, and even former Florida governor Jeb Bush, whose brother chose Roberts as chief justice, has criticized him.\n\nThe unhappiness arises basically from two of Roberts\u2019s decisions on the same subject \u2014 finding Obama\u2019s health-care act constitutional and then last year saving it from a potentially devastating challenge based on the language of the law. Roberts did not specifically mention those rulings in his remarks but seemed to allude to the subject in his description of a justice\u2019s role.\n\nThe court issues \u201ca lot of opinions where if I were in the legislature I certainly wouldn\u2019t have voted for the program that was under review,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with the substance of the every piece of legislation simply because I determine it\u2019s within the Constitution for Congress\u201d to enact it.\n\nRoberts said he thinks the public skepticism concerning the court starts with the Senate confirmation process. Decades ago, two of the court\u2019s most controversial justices \u2014 Antonin Scalia on the right and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the left \u2014 were confirmed practically unanimously, he said.\n\nWhile the conservative Roberts\u2019s confirmation proceedings were relatively stress-free, it was not the same for the \u201cextremely well-qualified\u201d nominees who followed him \u2014 fellow George W. Bush nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Obama\u2019s choices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nThe conservative Alito and the two liberals were approved largely on party-line votes, despite few misgivings about their fitness for the job, Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThat suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees,\u201d said the 61-year-old chief justice.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a sharply political, divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so furiously about whether you\u2019re going to be confirmed, it\u2019s natural for some member of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s just not how \u2014 we don\u2019t work as Democrats or Republicans.\u201d\n\nDivide on the court\n\nRoberts did not mention another aspect of the court\u2019s composition that adds to the partisan perception. For the first time in generations, the court\u2019s five most conservative members are Republican appointees, and the four most liberal were nominated by Democrats. For decades, there had been at least one liberal Republican nominee or conservative Democratic choice.\n\nThe split on the court in its most controversial cases now follows those partisan fault lines.\n\nRoberts said there is a \u201cstrong bond\u201d that develops among the nine justices, even those who are consistently on opposite sides of the nation\u2019s controversies.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it \u2014 pick nine random people out of the room and throw them together and say, \u2018Okay, you\u2019ll work together for the next 25 years on some of the most important and divisive issues the country faces,\u2019 \u201d Roberts said. \u201cYou do come to appreciate the good faith of the people with whom you work.\u201d\n\nRoberts is a genial and self-deprecating speaker, and Wednesday night he deflected praise from O\u2019Brien about everything from how he controls the \u201creins of leadership\u201d on the court to his high school days as captain of the football team.\n\nHis Catholic prep school was the smallest high school in Indiana with a football team, Roberts said. \u201cThere were 24 boys in my graduating class, and half of them were on the soccer team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard to be captain.\u201d\n\nRoberts also disclosed that when he is writing an opinion, he has his siblings in mind.\n\n\u201cI have three sisters \u2014 none of them are lawyers, yet they are intelligent laypeople who have happy and busy lives,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI like to think they can pick up one of my opinions and be able to read it and understand what the issue is and understand how it\u2019s been resolved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He says the public believes mistakenly that the justices are political players rather than referees.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He says the public believes mistakenly that the justices are political players rather than referees.", "title": "The political wars damage public perception of Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts says", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/the-political-wars-damage-public-perception-of-supreme-court-chief-justice-roberts-says/2016/02/04/80e718b6-cb0c-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/04/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court_Justices_Investments-04272-4299.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/the-political-wars-damage-public-perception-of-supreme-court-chief-justice-roberts-says/2016/02/04/80e718b6-cb0c-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "80e718b6-cb0c-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd267b\"", "article_summary": "Chief Justice John G.
