What could they do, take me to the walls of the city and stone me?\u201d\n\nNo woman has been on the roster of a professional hockey team, yet the memoir\u2019s back cover has an author photograph of Birdwell, an attractive blonde with a come-hither expression in full New York Rangers hockey regalia. Her long hair and a slung-over-the shoulder black skate cover parts of her uniform, so that the word Rangers appears as the French word for Angel.\n\nIn over-the-top comically implausible prose, Birdwell, a twenty-three-year-old from Badger, Ohio, narrates her inaugural season with the New York Rangers. She has a Midwestern practicality and straight-forwardness, a sly humor, and an unusually subversive sexual candor and agency, chronicling\u2014sans any standard female shame or hesitancy\u2014her plentiful sexual liaisons with a gamut of neurotic men.\n\nThe dialogue is masterful and playful and the humor unremitting. Yet beneath Birdwell\u2019s narration, a foreboding lurks\u2014a tinge of sadness and an existential-like searching-ness.\n\nThat\u2019s because Cleo Birdwell is a pseudonym for Don Delillo. Amazons was Delillo\u2019s seventh novel, and it sold better than his previous books and doubled his income, all before he earned his reputation as one of America\u2019s greatest writers.\n\nWhether from embarrassment, personal reasons, a game he\u2019s playing with his readers, or other reasons I can\u2019t fathom, Delillo doesn\u2019t want his name attached to the book and has never officially acknowledged writing it. He asked Viking to expunge the book from White Noise\u2019s bibliography and won\u2019t grant permission for the novel\u2019s reprinting.\n\nI came upon Amazons because of my women-centered sports novel The Peerless Four. In all the so-called classic sports novels by men, I claimed in an interview, none have female athletes as subjects.\n\nDelillo\u2019s former editor contacted the interviewer, who informed me of my mistake.\n\nIn all the so-called classic sports novels by men, none have female athletes as subjects. Except for Delillo\u2019s fantastical Amazons, and in a strangely fitting twist, its author has divorced himself from it, and the novel remains out of print.\n\nAmazons is laugh-out-loud funny and worth reading, and not just for Delillo fans. Both David Foster Wallace and Jonathan Lethem admired it. In an interview, Lethem acknowledged Amazons\u2019 influence on Motherless Brooklyn (specifically a character inAmazons burdened with Jumping Frenchman\u2019s Disease, causing him to involuntarily perform deep knee bends and bottom of the shoe examinations).\n\nAlong with sports and sex, Amazons revels in America\u2019s phallic-centeredness. \u201cThe penis erect,\u201d Birdwell explains, \u201ccan be impressive. It has the force of legend and myth. An engorged, murky thing. It loses its playfulness, erect. There is sometimes a purpling along the seams. It is a little beastly if the truth be known.\u201d\n\nBirdwell\u2019s fellow hockey mate Eric \u201cwas a good-natured guy who stood about six-six in skates and had a penis so humongous it was given a separate identity by the other players. Eric was Torkelson; his penis was Torkle.\n\n\u201cA player would say, \u2018How\u2019s Torkle doing today?\u2019 Or, \u201cWho\u2019s playing Torkle in the movie version?\u2019 Or, \u2018Is it true Torkle\u2019s being asked to endorse Jimmy Carter?\u2019 Or, \u2018There\u2019s a story the airlines aren\u2019t counting Torkle as carry-on anymore. You\u2019ll have to buy an extra seat for him.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf Birdwell\u2019s childhood friend and sexual compatriot Georgie, she says that he was \u201c\u2018one of those boys who\u2019s totally, everlastingly in love with his own penis. He never got over his first erection. He just loved flaunting himself. He was always playing with it. When he wasn\u2019t playing with it, he was looking at it. Looking isn\u2019t the word. He would study it. We\u2019d be in the back room of his house when his parents were out and he\u2019d be sitting there with his pants open and with the most absorbed, studious, dumb-kid look on his face, examining himself\u2014wondering about it, marveling at it, softly blowing on it, dusting it. His penis was a never-ending discovery, I guess.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Amazons,\" a wacky, pseudonymous hockey novel, has fallen by the wayside -- partly by the author's design", "title": "Don DeLillo\u2019s forgotten \u201cmemoir\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Amazons,\" a wacky, pseudonymous hockey novel, has fallen by the wayside -- partly by the author's design", "title": "Don DeLillo\u2019s forgotten \u201cmemoir\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/don_delillos_esoteric_intimate_memoir_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Amazons-by-Cleo-Birdwell-500x354.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Amazons,\" a wacky, pseudonymous hockey novel, has fallen by the wayside -- partly by the author's design", "title": "Don DeLillo\u2019s forgotten \u201cmemoir\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Amazons-by-Cleo-Birdwell-500x354.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Victoria Patterson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazons, Don DeLillo, Fiction, Memoir, novel, review, The Weeklings, Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca027\"", "article_summary": "In over-the-top comically implausible prose, Birdwell, a twenty-three-year-old from Badger, Ohio, narrates her inaugural season with the New York Rangers.\nExcept for Delillo\u2019s fantastical Amazons, and in a strangely fitting twist, its author has divorced himself from it, and the novel remains out of print.\nThat\u2019s because Cleo Birdwell is a pseudonym for Don Delillo.\nTopics: amazons, Don DeLillo, Fiction, Memoir, novel, review, The Weeklings, Writing, Media News, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on The WeeklingsHolt, Reinhart, and Winston published Amazons: An Intimate Memoir by the First Woman Ever to Play in the National Hockey League in the fall of 1980.\nAmazons was Delillo\u2019s seventh novel, and it sold better than his previous books and doubled his income, all before he earned his reputation as one of America\u2019s greatest writers."}
