With the high-profile introduction and rollout of Obamacare, people have had a lot to say on the topic of health insurance -- including Wanda Sykes. On a recent episode of "Wanda Sykes Presents Herlarious," the comedian started her stand-up routine with a focus on government healthcare, beginning with why it might be a good thing for Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose.

"They say the murder rate is down in Chicago, but Derrick Rose has killed off two knees, huh?" Sykes says. "Lucky for Derrick, though, there's Obamacare."

Sykes speculates that the injured NBA player could have had a difficult time qualifying for health insurance with his latest (second) season-ending knee injury. "Insurance companies would have been denying him left and right," she says. "Like, 'Uh-uh. You've got a preexisting condition. I saw it on Sports Center.'"

As for the technical glitches and functional difficulties many experienced with the Obamacare website during its launch, Sykes believes all the trouble could have been avoided.

"Let's be honest. Y'all know they should have only had people under 17 years old working on that damn website," Sykes says. "Nobody who's ever had a typewriter should have been working on that damn website."
