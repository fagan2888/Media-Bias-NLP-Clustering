Even though she has campaigned for months, Hillary has avoided taking any positions at all until Saturday\u2019s relaunch in Roosevelt Park. Even that speech was a laundry list of slogans rather than any serious commitments or policy proposals, more like a State of the Union speech and delivered with less aplomb and personality.\n\nAfter some media criticism about the lack of substance, Team Hillary let the media know that her policies would roll out over the next few weeks. Spokesman Brian Fallon made it clear that we\u2019d get buried in Clintonian euphemisms as a cover for a tax-hiking agenda, as the Washington Examiner\u2019s Jason Russell reported:\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s press secretary promises tax hikes will be in her presidential campaign\u2019s policy proposals, to be released this summer and fall. Rather than use the toxic phrase \u201ctax hikes,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon disguised the coming proposals as \u201crevenue enhancements.\u201d The promise came in a tweet Monday evening, reading \u201c.@BuzzFeedAndrew We are rolling out major policy proposals over the summer/fall. Among those proposals will be revenue enhancements.\u201d Fallon was tweeting in response to criticism that Clinton\u2019s proposal for universal preschool did not describe how the expensive program would be paid for, as pointed out the by the Washington Examiner\u2018s Philip Klein. Of course, \u201crevenue enhancements\u201d is code for tax hikes. During the Bill Clinton administration, another code word for this was \u201cbroad-based contributions.\u201d\n\nWell, the Clinton Era had lots of euphemisms, and this was just one that impacted taxpayers directly. Besides, Hillary\u2019s agenda will need lots and lots of new \u201crevenue,\u201d especially if she follows through on her plan to save ObamaCare from itself. She told the Des Moines Register that one of her domestic-agenda priorities will be to fix shortcomings in the Affordable Care Act:\n\nAsked about the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, Clinton said that no matter which way the U.S. Supreme Court rules on federal subsidies, \u201cI will be prepared to set forth what I would do.\u201d Clinton said that if the court does what she thinks it should do based on the law and the facts, \u201cthat would mean it would not rule in favor of the very contorted argument that is being made by the opponents to blow up the Affordable Care Act\u2019s guarantee of coverage.\u201d Clinton said she will strongly defend the law. But over the course of her campaign, she\u2019ll propose some fixes. \u201cAbout how to fix the family glitch, for example,\u201d she said, which has excluded a number of low-income people with families from getting subsidies. \u201cAbout how to deal with the high cost of deductibles that put such a burden on so many working families, and how to deal with the exploding cost of drugs, particularly the so-called specialty drugs.\u201d\n\nThose weren\u2019t errors. They were deliberate choices made by Democrats to keep subsidy costs below a trillion dollars in the original CBO estimates. In my column today at The Fiscal Times, I remind readers, with the help of Chris Jacobs at America Next, of those choices \u2014 and what Hillary\u2019s pledge will mean:\n\nHowever, both the family glitch and the high deductibles were deliberate choices by Democrats in the ACA. Both were trade-offs to keep premiums low, and therefore minimize the cost of the subsidies. The former only came to light in 2013, just before the disastrous rollout of the Healthcare.gov exchange. Essentially, it boils down to the employer mandate to keep insurance plans affordable for employees, capping their contributions to 9.5 percent of income \u2013 but Congress deliberately didn\u2019t extend that to family coverage. Workers who have access to such insurance through employers can\u2019t qualify to buy subsidized insurance for their families in ACA exchanges. That was a deliberate cost-cutting measure by Democrats, Chris Jacobs of America Next reminded Wall Street Journal readers. \u201cTo keep the total cost of insurance subsidies \u2026 under $1 trillion, lawmakers made numerous tough choices,\u201d Jacobs recalls. They delayed the start of subsidized insurance for a year, and put curbs on levels of subsidies in the later years of the ACA\u2019s first decade. \u201cAnd Congress passed\u2014whether lawmakers knew it or not\u2014the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d provision.\u201d The need for higher deductibles was an even more explicit choice. Obamacare mandates higher risks for insurance pools, both in terms of eliminating barriers for pre-existing conditions and for preventive-care coverage. Insurers had to either hike premiums significantly to deal with the increased access or raise deductibles to force the costs back onto the consumer. The same tough choice that Jacobs notes in terms of holding subsidy costs below $1 trillion forced the Obama administration to pressure insurers into keeping premiums low, which meant either higher deductibles or bankruptcy. Anyone with even a passing understanding of risk pools could have easily predicted these outcomes. \u2026 In the end, it may not matter what the Supreme Court decides on King v. Burwell. Democrats created a disaster far broader than the issue of subsidies in the federal exchange. The only solution Hillary and other Democrats have on the ACA are the massive tax hikes needed to fund the monster of government-mandated health insurance. Hillary can use all of the euphemisms for this she can find, but in the end Obamacare will bleed taxpayers dry.\n\nJust as we predicted, ObamaCare turns out to be a disaster, and Democrats want to keep throwing your money away to double down on the bad bet. That\u2019s what we can expect from a Hillary Clinton presidency, which is why we need to unwind the euphemisms and spell out the costs early and often.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Doubling down \u2014 with your money.", "title": "The Hillary Clinton economic plan: \u201cRevenue enhancements\u201d and massive ObamaCare spending increases", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/06/18/the-hillary-clinton-economic-plan-revenue-enhancements-and-massive-obamacare-spending-increases/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "family glitch, health care subsidies, Hillary Clinton, ObamaCare, tax hike,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-18T21:21:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T19:01:00+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cTo keep the total cost of insurance subsidies \u2026 under $1 trillion, lawmakers made numerous tough choices,\u201d Jacobs recalls.\nThat\u2019s what we can expect from a Hillary Clinton presidency, which is why we need to unwind the euphemisms and spell out the costs early and often.\nRather than use the toxic phrase \u201ctax hikes,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon disguised the coming proposals as \u201crevenue enhancements.\u201d The promise came in a tweet Monday evening, reading \u201c.\nHillary can use all of the euphemisms for this she can find, but in the end Obamacare will bleed taxpayers dry.\nObamacare mandates higher risks for insurance pools, both in terms of eliminating barriers for pre-existing conditions and for preventive-care coverage."}
