A Texas supermarket tried pulling a bull over customers\u2019 eyes selling bull penis as human food. Although this may be part of Texans\u2019 regular diet, MT Supermarket in North Lamar, the store manager, and some employees now face a $5,000 lawsuit after a civil suit was filed by the office of the Texas Attorney General Gregg Abbott claiming they sold \"non-inspected, adulterated and misbranded beef pizzle as human food,\u201d KXAN reported.\n\n\u201cThey allegedly added wording to the re-labeled product stating the meat was inspected and from a registered source,\u201d according to the Austin Business Journal. The employees took bull penis, commonly known as \u201cpizzle\u201d from boxes labeled \u201cinedible beef, not intended for human food,\u201d and then repackaged it for consumer consumption. MT Supermarket shoppers did not hesitate to buy the inedible bull penis, since the relabeled packages showed the meat was inspected and from a registered source, leading customers to trust what they put in their mouths. The Austin Business Journal made several phone inquiries but could not reach the store manager for comment.\n\nIn the U.S., pizzle is commonly used to make specialty glues and chew toys for dogs. However, people like Chichi Wang have dabbled their taste buds with some cooked pizzle, describing its taste. \u201cWhen I tried to eat the pan-fried pizzle, the texture was so tough as to be inedible; the more I chewed, the more the pizzle resisted my molars until finally, I gave up and spit it out. A long simmering, then, seemed the only option,\u201d Wang wrote on Serious Eats. After trying endless ways to cook the bull penis, Wang cannot determine once and for all if pizzle is tasty to eat.\n\nIn foreign cultures, bull penis is consumed in its dried and ground form, used in soups and drinks. Soups such as Jamaica\u2019s cow cod \u2014 another name for penis soup \u2014 is considered to be an aphrodisiac. This delicacy is also seen in Asian culture, particularly Chinese athletes, who consumed deer pizzle during the 2008 Beijing Olympics to boost stamina and their performance, The Telegraph reported. Pizzle is low in cholesterol, high in protein, hormones, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium and magnesium.\n\nWhile pizzle may not be the meat of choice for most of us, one thing is clear: Don\u2019t mess with the bull. You\u2019ll get the horns.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bull penis, beef pizzle, reality bites, texas supermarket, mt supermarket, organ, speciality glue, chew toys for dogs, cow cod, aphrodisiac", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas supermarket caught relabeling, repackaging, and selling uninspected beef pizzle, or bull penis, to customers now faces $5,000 in fines.", "title": "Supermarket Sneakily Sells Bull Penis As Human Food [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reality-bites-inedible-bull-penis-yields-5000-lawsuit-texas-supermarket-sold-organ-customers-288636", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/mt-supermarket-sells-inedible-bull-penis-customers.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas supermarket caught relabeling, repackaging, and selling uninspected beef pizzle, or bull penis, to customers now faces $5,000 in fines.", "title": "Supermarket Sneakily Sells Bull Penis As Human Food [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reality-bites-inedible-bull-penis-yields-5000-lawsuit-texas-supermarket-sold-organ-customers-288636", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/mt-supermarket-sells-inedible-bull-penis-customers.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/mt-supermarket-sells-inedible-bull-penis-customers.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-17T14:37:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T14:37:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas supermarket caught relabeling, repackaging, and selling uninspected beef pizzle, or bull penis, to customers now faces $5,000 in fines."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3fa\"", "article_summary": "A Texas supermarket tried pulling a bull over customers\u2019 eyes selling bull penis as human food.\nAfter trying endless ways to cook the bull penis, Wang cannot determine once and for all if pizzle is tasty to eat.\nIn foreign cultures, bull penis is consumed in its dried and ground form, used in soups and drinks.\nThe employees took bull penis, commonly known as \u201cpizzle\u201d from boxes labeled \u201cinedible beef, not intended for human food,\u201d and then repackaged it for consumer consumption.\nMT Supermarket shoppers did not hesitate to buy the inedible bull penis, since the relabeled packages showed the meat was inspected and from a registered source, leading customers to trust what they put in their mouths."}
