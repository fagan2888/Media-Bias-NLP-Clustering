Jerry Brown approved legislation this week that bans the word \u201calien\u201d from California\u2019s entire labor code, a move that \u201crecognizes and respects the diversity and contributions of all Californians,\u201d according to Mr. Brown\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cAlien\u201d is derogatory, according to state Sen. Tony Mendoza, who introduced the bill, found here\n\n\u201cAlien\u201d is still used in federal immigration law. Will it be purged also? Maybe.\n\nThere is growing national sentiment that it is \u201cinappropriate,\u201d says Kevin R. Johnson, dean of public interest law and professor of Chicana/Chicano Studies at the University of California at Davis.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that the use of the word \u2018alien\u2019 would dehumanize the people affected and lead to \u201clack of protections under the law,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHere is the text of Mr. Mendoza\u2019s bill SB 432:\n\n\u201cExisting law, with certain exceptions, requires the payment of not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages, for work of a similar character in the locality in which a public works project is performed, to all workers employed on a public works project. With respect to the extension of public works, existing law extends preference for employment first to California citizens, next to citizens of other states who are in California at the time of application, and next to aliens who are in California at the time of application. Existing law defines \u2018alien\u2019 as any person who is not a born or fully naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nUnder existing law, the Department of Finance is required to ascertain and secure from state agencies tentative plans for the extension of public works that are best adapted to supply increased opportunities for advantageous public labor during periods of temporary unemployment in the state. These employment opportunities are available according to the hiring preferences described above.\n\nThis bill would repeal this definition of \u2018alien\u2019 and the provision requiring those preferences to be applied to the extension of public works employment during periods of unemployment in the state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a language change in the Golden State: California Gov.
