BJC does not bar financial aid to those who have refused to buy insurance through the health care law.\n\nWhile all uninsured patients get a 25 percent discount off list charges, BJC gives additional discounts to those earning up to three times the federal poverty level, or about $35,000 for an individual. Formerly, those additional discounts were available for those earning up to four times the poverty level, or about $46,600.\n\nThe online charity care policy at Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, for example, now states that \u201capplicants who refuse to purchase federally-mandated health insurance when they are eligible to do so will not be awarded charitable care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatients will continue to receive needed medical care regardless of their ability to make payment at the time of service,\u201d says spokeswoman Kim Kitson, adding the changes are likely to affect fewer than 3 percent of patients.\n\nTo be sure, hospitals have a strong financial interest in having more patients covered by insurance. That\u2019s particularly true for hospitals that see many uninsured patients because the health law also reduces their government payments for uncompensated care. The assumption was that most uninsured people would gain coverage and no longer run up large hospital bills that could not be paid. But since the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, 24 states decided not to participate. Hospitals that treat large numbers of low-income people in those states face real financial pressures.\n\nIn addition, the health law requires nonprofit hospitals to make their written charity policies widely available, although it does not specify what criteria hospitals use to determine who is eligible. The assistance programs aren\u2019t just for the uninsured: Most hospitals also help insured patients struggling to pay deductibles or other costs associated with their care.\n\n\u201cEven those with health insurance are \u2018uninsured\u2019 for an increasing percentage of the medical care they need\u201d because many have high annual deductibles, said Steven Lipstein, president and CEO of BJC HealthCare, in an opinion piece published in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nStill, as the health law changes the insurance marketplace, \u201cwe are seeing charity care reductions,\u201d says Michael Miller, director of strategic policy at Community Catalyst, an advocacy group in Massachusetts.\n\nWhile Miller says the health law will result in more people with insurance, the need for financial assistance programs remains. He disagrees that charity programs would dissuade uninsured consumers from enrolling in coverage since most will need other health services besides hospital care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really premature for hospitals to start presuming that level of calculation on the part of someone who shows up uninsured,\u201d Miller says.\n\nIs The Patient Unwilling, Or Unable To Pay?\n\nHospital executives say they are weighing many questions in evaluating whether to change their policies. Did people choose not to enroll \u2013 or were they unable to get through the new health insurance marketplaces during the open enrollment in the fall and spring? Did they know subsidized coverage is available? Could they afford insurance, even with a subsidy, given that many insurance plans have deductibles that can run into thousands of dollars annually?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something hospitals have struggled with for decades: Is the patient unwilling to pay or unable to pay?\u201d says Katherine Arbuckle, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Ascension Health.\n\nAt Ascension, one of the nation\u2019s largest not-for-profit hospital groups based in St. Louis, Mo., a special task force will make recommendations before the end of the year on whether changes are needed.\n\n\u201cHow do you treat those who decline [coverage]? Do they get free services when others have paid?\u201d asks Arbuckle.\n\nWhile nothing has been finalized, Arbuckle says the Catholic hospital chain has ruled out some changes, saying it will not reduce the income threshold for those who qualify for free care, currently at twice the federal poverty rate. That\u2019s about $23,340 for an individual.\n\nMany hospitals are simply checking to see if their policies comply with the health law\u2019s requirements, says Todd Nelson, a director at the Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents more than 40,000 people who work in health care finance.\n\nHe is not surprised that some require applicants to apply for insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cHospitals have always encouraged patients to apply for coverage they are entitled to receive, whether commercial insurance through employer or through programs like Medicaid,\u201d he says.\n\nTenet, HCA Make No Changes\n\nSeveral hospital chains, including two of the largest \u2014 Tenet and HCA \u2014 say they don\u2019t have plans to change their charity care policies. Both offer free care to those who meet certain requirements, including earning less than twice the federal poverty rate.\n\nWhile many charity care programs have been in place for decades, others were established following widespread complaints and lawsuits brought in the late 1990s over aggressive hospital collections tactics. Those included placing liens on patients\u2019 homes and charging the uninsured the highest list prices, which were far more than what insurance companies paid on behalf of policyholders.\n\nNow, under the health law, nonprofit hospitals must make reasonable efforts to determine if patients qualify for help before taking tough collection tactics. And the law says the amount sought from the patient cannot be the hospitals\u2019 list price, but an amount closer to what is generally billed to insured patients.\n\nThe big benefit from the health law is that it requires hospitals to make their charity policies public, says Mark Rukavina, an expert on medical debt who consults for hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe ACA\u2019s requirements will improve transparency dramatically,\u201d he says.\n\nThis story appeared in the Washington Post.
