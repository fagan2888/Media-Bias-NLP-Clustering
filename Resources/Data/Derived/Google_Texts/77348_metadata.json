For instance, some records used to vet aviation workers contained incomplete or inaccurate data\u2014including missing Social Security numbers.\n\n\"Without complete and accurate information, TSA risks credentialing and providing unescorted access to secure airport areas for workers with potential to harm the nation's air transportation system,\" the auditors said in the report.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Secret Criteria the TSA Uses to Spot Terrorists\n\nThe IG recommended that the TSA follow up on its request to get more information and access to other DHS databases to complete its vetting process. The agency concurred with the recommendation.\n\nThe latest report comes one week after a separate investigation revealed that the TSA failed to detect contraband getting through its airport screeners in an internal test. Auditors were able to sneak mock explosives through the screeners 95 percent of the time.\n\nThose alarming revelations led the TSA\u2019s acting administrator, Melvin Carraway, to resign abruptly. That investigation is still ongoing, and a full report on the TSA\u2019s screening vulnerabilities is expected in the coming months.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Transportation Security Administration failed to flag dozens of airport workers wh", "title": "Airport Workers on Terror Watch Lists Slipped Through TSA Screening", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/Airport-Workers-Terror-Watch-Lists-Slipped-Through-TSA-Screening", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/Airport-Workers-Terror-Watch-Lists-Slipped-Through-TSA-Screening", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Transportation Security Administration failed to flag dozens of airport workers wh", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4259\"", "article_summary": "The Transportation Security Administration failed to flag dozens of airport workers whose names appeared on terrorist watch lists.\nThat investigation is still ongoing, and a full report on the TSA\u2019s screening vulnerabilities is expected in the coming months.\nRelated: Report Says TSA Wasted $1 Billion on Screening ProgramThe latest IG report reveals that at least 70 airport workers on terrorist-related watch lists were able to slip through the TSA\u2019s screening process since the agency wasn\u2019t looking at all of the databases.\nAuditors said the TSA missed these people because the agency isn\u2019t authorized to receive all terrorism-related information or access to all relevant databases.\n\"Without complete and accurate information, TSA risks credentialing and providing unescorted access to secure airport areas for workers with potential to harm the nation's air transportation system,\" the auditors said in the report."}
