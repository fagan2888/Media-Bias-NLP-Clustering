NEW YORK (CBS DC) – Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston may not be president, but he plays on on Broadway.

After his critically acclaimed performance as teacher-turned-meth dealer Walter White, Cranston is starring in All The Way, a play that follows Lyndon Johnson’s efforts to pass the Civil Rights Act.

In an interview with Yahoo News’ Katie Couric, he said the Affordable Care Act is the highlight of President Obama’s legacy.

“I personally believe that his health care program is fantastic,” he said. “Yes, there are problems. Anything worth while is going to go through a growing pains period. But this is his legacy and I think it’s a great one because I don’t think that basic health care should be a privilege of the rich. It should be a right to all.”

Cranston also applauded the president for using executive orders to get around Congress on some issues, saying that LBJ turned to the unilateral measures when faced with political opposition.

In fact, he urged Obama to use more executive fiats to push for a higher minimum wage.
