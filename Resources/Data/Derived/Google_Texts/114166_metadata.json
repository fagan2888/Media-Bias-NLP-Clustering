A lot of those blows to the back of the head could have killed her.\n\nThe minute-long clip shows a 14-year-old girl in white shorts and a black top approach a silver sedan in the car park adjacent to Lake Haven skate park on the state\u2019s Central Coast on December 29.\n\nCONCERN AT TOP COP\u2019S LINDT SIEGE BRIEF\n\nCOURTS EXPOSED TO VIOLENT ATTACKS\n\nSYDNEY UNITES FOR FRENCH TERROR VICTIMS\n\nThe girl opens the door and drags the 15-year-old victim onto the ground and starts wildly punching her.\n\nIn the background another girl\u2019s voice is heard saying \u201cyou\u2019ve got this c---, you\u2019ve got this fat bitch\u201d.\n\nBut when the victim starts to fight back against the smaller girl, a 16-year-old girl steps in grabbing her by the hair and dragging her along the ground before proceeding to knee her in the head and punch her.\n\nAfter kneeing her again in the back the attacker tells her \u201cget in the car and go you fat f---\u201d.\n\nThe victim picks up what appears to be her shoes and gets back in the passenger seat when the older girl taunts her again.\n\nIn a final act of alleged intimidation the older attacker \u2014 previously unknown to the victim \u2014 tells her her name and asks \u201cyou want to go again?\u201d\n\nWhile distressing, the daylight bashing comes at a time when assault rates among young girls are actually falling.\n\nIn the 12 months to last September, juvenile girls were charged with 693 non-domestic assaults in NSW, according to Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research data.\n\nThis is down from 1144 charges in the 12 months to September 2010 \u2014 an overall decline of 11.8 per cent over the five-year period.\n\nThe figures were cold comfort to the victim\u2019s mum who said her daughter was supposed to be on a bus with a girlfriend to Lake Haven shopping centre \u201cto spend her Christmas money\u201d.\n\nInstead she was in her friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s car when she allegedly got a call from another friend inviting her to the skate park.\n\n\u201cA boy called her and said to come to the skate park,\u201d\u2019 she said.\n\n\u201cShe had no clue, at the time she was texting her Nan.\u201d\n\nShe said her daughter was fixed on her phone in the passenger seat before the door was flung open and she was \u201cgrabbed\u201d by the younger girl.\n\nWhile a year apart and at different schools, the mum said the pair had become close friends until they each broke up with their respective boyfriends.\n\nShe said the alleged rift emerged when they remained friends with the other\u2019s ex-boyfriends.\n\n\u201cThey both had boyfriends, they broke up with them and they [remained] friends with the opposite\u2019s ex\u2019s,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe older girl, she didn\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nFrom conversations with her daughter and the mother of the younger girl, who later apologised, she said the older girl \u2014 seen in the video as the more aggressive of the two \u2014 had only known the younger girl \u201cfor an hour\u201d before the attack.\n\n\u201cI took her to hospital because she had a lot of grazing around her kidney area and a very swollen neck at the back,\u201d the mum said of her daughter\u2019s injuries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point we\u2019re thinking of moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the area, it\u2019s the mentality of some of the kids in the area.\u201d\n\nTuggerah Lakes duty officer Chief Inspector Tim Winmill said the two girls, aged 14 and 16, were both charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nThey are due to appear at Wyong Children\u2019s Court tomorrow.\n\nA 19-year-old male, believed to be seen in the footage shirtless and encouraging the older girl to \u201csmash her\u201d before congratulating her \u201cthat\u2019s it babe, that\u2019s how it\u2019s done\u201d, has also been charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nChief Insp Winmill said he would face Wyong Local Court on February 11.\n\nWhile not depicted in the footage a male can be heard warning the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin not to interfere.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hit in on my missus,\u201d his voice is heard.\n\nTHE lure of YouTube is impossible for some to resist. This is often a positive thing, as many witty and poignant YouTube clips demonstrate.\n\nBut others are attracted to the site as a means of posting hateful and destructive scenes of malicious violence. The most graphic examples come from Islamic State or Daesh terrorists in Syria and Iraq, who use the site to post videos of beheadings and other atrocities.\n\nThankfully, those videos are quickly removed as administrators become aware of them. But there are other examples of YouTube misuse which are far closer to home. Two teenage girls are to face court after footage of themselves allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old girl was posted at the site.\n\nThe pair, aged 14 and 16, are shown in the minute-long clip \u2014 first posted on Facebook, then on YouTube \u2014 bashing a girl with such force that she was lucky to make it through the ordeal without being knocked unconscious, or worse.\n\n\u201cIt made me sick to see my little girl hit like that,\u201d the girl\u2019s horrified mother told The Daily Telegraph.\n\n\u201cShe could have been killed.\u201d\n\nIt is an indictment of some social media users that this shameful footage attracted more than 50,000 views before being withdrawn from Facebook.\n\nSuch viciousness must not be treated as entertainment.\n\nThe two alleged attackers should not be the only people on trial.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "TWO girls will face court tomorrow over an allegedly premeditated attack on a 15-year-old that left the victims mother physically sick after footage of the incident was posted on social media.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/girl-15-allegedly-brutally-bashed-after-being-set-upon-by-two-girls-in-car-park/news-story/4eed1f03f14bc6583cd6f28046ede7f7", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a18350ac45b2e7c93c0d8da1c319af0f", "type": "article", "description": "TWO girls will face court tomorrow over an allegedly premeditated attack on a 15-year-old that left the victim\u2019s mother \u201cphysically sick\u201d after footage of the incident was posted on social media.", "title": "Teens face court over alleged brutal assault"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a18350ac45b2e7c93c0d8da1c319af0f", "description": "TWO girls will face court tomorrow over an allegedly premeditated attack on a 15-year-old that left the victim\u2019s mother \u201cphysically sick\u201d after footage of the incident was posted on social media.", "site": "@dailytelegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Teens face court over alleged brutal assault"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/4eed1f03f14bc6583cd6f28046ede7f7?domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"}, "articleid": "4eed1f03f14bc6583cd6f28046ede7f7", "keywords": "premeditated attack, social media, passenger seat, blonde victim, young girls, victim starts, juvenile girls, girl steps, skate park, non-domestic assaults, disturbing vision, male voice, legal reasons, minute-long clip, worst nightmare, black top approach, five-year period, silver sedan, shopping centre, girl attack, assault rates, Lake Haven, New South Wales, Australia, Central Coast, Tasmania, Facebook, Inc., Daily Telegraph, Tim Winmill, Winmill", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-11T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-11T21:58:56.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1923\"", "article_summary": "Blow after blow is dealt into the back of the girl\u2019s head.\nTwo teenage girls are to face court after footage of themselves allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old girl was posted at the site.\nWhile not depicted in the footage a male can be heard warning the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin not to interfere.\nStills taken from a video showing a brutal alleged attack on a girl by two other teenagers.\nThe 14-year-old drags the older girl out of the car."}
