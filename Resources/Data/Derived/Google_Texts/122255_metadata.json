That\u2019s what many of the president\u2019s key legislative accomplishments will face when Republicans take the reins of Senate committees this week. Among the items that incoming Republican committee chairmen are likely to try to tweak, block, change, or kill entirely: the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank banking regulations, the executive order giving legal status to some undocumented immigrations, and administration plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nBut few of the Obama-approved initiatives in the GOP\u2019s sites are as personal to the White House, or as unpopular with Republicans, as portions of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, legislation championed by first lady Michelle Obama in 2010 to make school lunches in American schools healthier as a part of her efforts to battle the country\u2019s rampant rate of childhood obesity.\n\nBut where the first lady saw a chance to give kids nutritious meals they might otherwise never eat, some Republicans saw the ultimate Obama Nanny State, literally the government telling your kids to eat their vegetables.\n\nWhile both Democrats and Republicans supported the school lunch bill in 2010, critics say the problems came in 2012, when the USDA wrote the regulations to implement the law, reportedly with significant input from the White House. Changes to school breakfasts and lunches included calorie caps, a ban on trans fats, increased fruit and vegetable offerings, and sodium reductions. But some individual regulations went further: requiring that a fruit or vegetable be served on the plate as a part of every meal, whether a student wants it or not. As of 2014, every bread product served had to be 100 percent whole grain, including croutons, tortillas, bagels, and biscuits (there are whole-grain biscuits?). New sodium limits had to factor in a serving of low-fat milk, whether the students drink milk with their meal or not, making a turkey and cheese sandwich borderline verboten when all of the sodium is added up.\n\nThe menu changes won praise from nutritionists, but spawned an avalanche of complaints from parents, school districts, and, yes, a whole lot of kids on Twitter (see #ThanksMichelleObama for a dose of teen angst fueled by french fry withdrawal).\n\nAccording to the USDA, student participation began to fall, with 1.4 million students opting out of the lunch program entirely. As the numbers shrank, Mrs. Obama took a prominent role to encourage schools to keep working to make the changes, starring in a video on the USDA\u2019s website to offer free trainings on menu planning, financial management, and reducing plate waste, telling them, \u201cI know this hasn\u2019t always been easy.\u201d\n\nWhen House Republicans moved last year to roll back some of the provisions, the first lady wrote a rare New York Times op-ed, scolding the GOP for trying to undo the changes. \u201cOur children deserve so much better than this,\u201d she wrote. Despite her personal pitch, several exemptions to the rules were buried deep inside the \u201cCromnibus\u201d government funding bill that passed Congress last month.\n\nBut the highest hurdle for the revamped school meals may lie ahead, as the GOP-led Congress takes up legislation to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, which will includes the National School Lunch Program. The man in charge of that process for Republicans will likely be Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), the incoming chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n\nRoberts\u2019 spokeswoman wouldn\u2019t comment on his specific plans for the legislation, since he hasn\u2019t yet been elected to the chairmanship. But Roberts touted his efforts to end what he described as \u201cthe Obama administration\u2019s regulatory overreach,\u201d arguing some kids may need more calories than the cap allows, and saying the rules in general defied common sense.\n\nDiane Pratt-Heavner, the spokeswoman for the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is \u201chopeful\u201d that Congress will give schools more flexibility in the coming months.\n\n\u201cOur members continue to face a number of challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from them that it has been too much, too fast.\u201d\n\nAmong the complaints she\u2019s heard from schools are the new costs to school districts of providing more expensive food, which was not entirely paid for by Congress, increases in the amount of food students throw away, and students bringing less healthy lunches from home or buying fast food near their schools if they decide to opt out of the lunches the schools are serving.\n\n\u201cWe have raised this with the White House and the USDA, we\u2019re certainly appreciative of the flexibility we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nRep. John Kline (R-MN), who will lead the GOP effort in the House, has also criticized the lack of flexibility for schools and is expected to make his own push to roll back some or all of the regulations when he oversees the Child Nutrition re-authorization on the House side this year.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "1patriciamurphy"}, "keywords": "Buzzfeed, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Obamacare, Congress, Michelle Obama", "publicationDate": 201501071045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "As they take control of the House and Senate, some in the GOP are gearing up to change or even kill the school lunch bill, which they see as the government literally telling your kids to eat their vegetables.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Republican War on Kale", "tags": "syndication:syndication-buzzfeed,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:organization/congress,entity:person/michelle_obama", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Republican War on Kale\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47355855.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-07T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Patricia Murphy\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-buzzfeed\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"Industryterm\",\"congress\",\"michelle_obama\"]}", "news_keywords": "Buzzfeed, Republican Party, US Politics, Obamacare, Congress, Michelle Obama", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Patricia Murphy", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-07T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/patricia-murphyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "As they take control of the House and Senate, some in the GOP are gearing up to change or even kill the school lunch bill, which they see as the government literally telling your kids to eat their vegetables.", "title": "The Republican War on Kale", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/07/the-republican-war-on-kale/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1420675650295.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/p/patricia-murphy", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "But the highest hurdle for the revamped school meals may lie ahead, as the GOP-led Congress takes up legislation to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, which will includes the National School Lunch Program.\nThat\u2019s what many of the president\u2019s key legislative accomplishments will face when Republicans take the reins of Senate committees this week.\nAccording to the USDA, student participation began to fall, with 1.4 million students opting out of the lunch program entirely.\nChanges to school breakfasts and lunches included calorie caps, a ban on trans fats, increased fruit and vegetable offerings, and sodium reductions.\n\u201cWe have raised this with the White House and the USDA, we\u2019re certainly appreciative of the flexibility we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d she said."}
