But if there is one, it may lie in letting Republicans lay out their wildly unpopular plans for \u201cgoverning.\u201d\n\nAs if walking into a trap set by the other party \u2013 except Democrats are too broken to set traps right now \u2014 GOP congressional leaders are promising to act immediately on their budget-slashing ideas when 2015 begins. High on their list, according to the New York Times, is implementing Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to \u201coverhaul\u201d Medicare by replacing it with \u201cpremium support\u201d vouchers designed to privatize the system over the coming decades. They will also form a commission to examine \u201coptions\u201d for Social Security, which Ryan has also long favored privatizing.\n\nThe GOP won voters over 65 by 16 points last week. Culture and conservatism may keep most of those voters Republican, but if congressional conservatives go along with those plans, Democrats might have a shot at them.\n\nThat the GOP will move against Medicare still isn\u2019t a done deal. The House will do it, of course, because the House has passed the Ryan budget before. In the Senate, the plan will face a warm reception from incoming budget committee chairman Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an advocate of the Ryan budget. Still, Mitch McConnell may have problems inflicting such an unpopular plan on vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in 2016. It will make it difficult for Karl Rove to make Democrats the party that is menacing Medicare if Republicans in both houses of Congress vote to voucherize it.\n\nYet even some blue-state Republicans say they\u2019re on board with the Ryan-crafted budget blueprint. \u201cI\u2019m quite comfortable with the reforms contemplated in those budgets,\u201d Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey told the Times. \u201cThere are no political implications that I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d The Times notes that the last time the Ryan budget faced the Senate, five Republicans voted against it \u2013 including Sen. Ted Cruz, who thought it didn\u2019t go far enough. But at least four new GOP senators, including Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, are on record supporting it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans say their 2015 plans include passing Ryan\u2019s Dickensian budget.
