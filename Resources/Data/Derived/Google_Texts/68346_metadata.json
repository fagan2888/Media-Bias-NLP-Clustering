The father of one of his friends \u2014 a guy he\u2019d been playing ball with for years \u2014 just had died of a heart attack. The father of another friend, another teammate, was in the middle of a successful battle with cancer.\n\nBoth men were younger than I am.\n\nIt also was one of those transition times in the father-child relationship.\n\nWhen they were young, my children thought of their father as indestructible, someone who made them feel safe even when they confronted things new and strange. They loved to cling to my neck and rest on my shoulder blades when we were in a pool or a lake as I swam breaststroke. They called it \u201criding the bus.\u201d\n\nOne rainy day when my daughter was maybe a year old, I sat with her under the overhang of our porch as we watched a storm roll in. I held her on my lap and saw her eyes widen as the thunder cracked and the lightning blazed. She settled back against my chest and watched, fascinated, as havoc danced across the sky.\n\nAnother time, when we all had traveled to California for a wedding, I hiked with my son, who was maybe 2 at the time, to a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Part of the way I carried him on my shoulders \u2014 \u201criding up high,\u201d my children called it \u2014 and part of the way we walked hand-in-hand.\n\nAs we stood at the lip of the bluff, he watched, transfixed, as the waves rolled in. He stared out at the ocean\u2019s vast expanse and the distant spot where sky and water seem to become one.\n\n\u201cBig. Big. Big,\u201d he said.\n\nTime flows, though, just like water.\n\nChildren grow. And their parents grow older.\n\nMy son loves baseball. When he first discovered his passion for the game, I would throw pitch after pitch to him and applaud every time he hit the ball with a clean thwack.\n\nNow, though, he throws harder than I do \u2014 and I can\u2019t pitch hard enough to make the practice worthwhile for him. When we play catch, he knows my arm will tire a good two to three hours before his does.\n\nLast summer, I went with my daughter on a trip to Spain. She speaks Spanish. I don\u2019t.\n\nWhile we were there, she discovered there are things she knows that her father does not. That there were problems she could solve that I could not. That there were times when she had to lead and her father had to defer.\n\nTo her.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 about fatherhood is that Dad is always supposed to be this strong, all-knowing figure \u2014 \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d and all that.\n\nThe reality is something different. The responsibilities of being a father shift over time.\n\nWe fathers start out trying to show our children life\u2019s possibilities and make them feel secure enough to explore them. We hold them tight as the lightning dances and the waves pound the shore.\n\nAs our children grow and we grow older, we end up teaching them, often without realizing it, about life\u2019s limits. They see our limbs weaken and discover there are things we fathers just do not know.\n\nThe thread we dads hope runs through all this is an understanding that moments matter. Moments build lives of meaning, the lives we want.\n\nSpend them wisely.\n\nThat night, when my son told me that thinking about my death, however distant, troubled him, I put my hand on his shoulder.\n\nI told him that, if I do my job right as a father, there always will be two places he and his sister will be able to find me even after I\u2019ve breathed my last.\n\nMy son smiled.\n\n\u201cIn our heads and in our hearts,\u201d he said.\n\nI nodded and told him I loved him and his sister \u2014 and that I was proud of them.\n\nI love you and I\u2019m proud of you \u2014 such a simple thing for a father to say, but it\u2019s a message that matters.\n\nA message that never grows old.\n\nKrull is director of Franklin College\u2019s Pulliam School of Journalism, host of \u201cNo Limits\u201d on WFYI (90.1 FM) in Indianapolis and publisher of TheStatehouseFile.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1MVXKQW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I love you and I\u2019m proud of you \u2013 such a simple thing for a father to say, but it\u2019s a message that matters.", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "I love you and I\u2019m proud of you \u2013 such a simple thing for a father to say, but it\u2019s a message that matters.", "title": "Krull: A father\u2019s most important message to his children", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2015/06/20/krull-fathers-important-message-children/29057451/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I love you and I\u2019m proud of you \u2013 such a simple thing for a father to say, but it\u2019s a message that matters.", "title": "Krull: A father\u2019s most important message to his children", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa086568807f57eccd82287d2f4ccf3c3809ab02/c=0-584-2336-2920&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Heart attack", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Heart attack", "title": "Krull: A father\u2019s most important message to his children", "author": "John Krull", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fa3f336dbf0f3162e585c7625e3e10e69f4c60e/c=0-194-2336-3309/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24e82327676dbffbeb24371214a1f24e7fe7d102/c=0-584-2336-2920/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9bbc22cfa459bd91184c41e63cb18b2b4aee67cb/c=0-876-2336-2628/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d99ba98347a4d2077c604ba3c216cde949826245/c=0-1095-2336-2409&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-20T21:04:33-04:00", "shorthed": "Krull: A father\u2019s most important message to his children", "articleid": 29057451, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/526a267a7fbd8069528879d7de20aecafb2190a9/c=0-1095-2336-2409/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1588eaf9cddf44ed2d4a04645ec32b7f0bf02fe1/c=182-0-2153-3504/local/-/media/2015/06/20/Indianapolis/B9317767643Z.1_20150620210433_000_GBNB3VDLS.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "As our children grow and we grow older, we end up teaching them, often without realizing it, about life\u2019s limits.\nChildren grow.\nWe fathers start out trying to show our children life\u2019s possibilities and make them feel secure enough to explore them.\nThe clich\u00e9 about fatherhood is that Dad is always supposed to be this strong, all-knowing figure \u2014 \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d and all that.\nThat night, when my son told me that thinking about my death, however distant, troubled him, I put my hand on his shoulder."}
