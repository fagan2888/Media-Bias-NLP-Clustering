The former Massachusetts cop whose claim of being shot at turned out to be completely false was found dead in his home this morning.

Two months ago, Officer Bryan Johnson claimed that his police car was shot at by someone else before it crashed and caught on fire. There was an intense manhunt underway and local schools were closed.

But the next day, Millis Police Sergeant William Dwyer revealed that Johnson––a part-time officer––made up the entire thing. He shot at the police car himself. He was promptly fired.

Johnson was charged with misleading a criminal investigation and providing false information to emergency services, among other charges, and he made bail in mid-September.

According to WCVB, Johnson was found dead by his roommate earlier today. Authorities showed up at the scene, pronounced him dead, and said there’s no evidence to suspect foul play or that this was a homicide.
