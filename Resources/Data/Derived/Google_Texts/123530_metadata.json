(For details for the Jersey City sick leave law, Ordinance No. 13.097, see our article, Jersey City Ordinance to Require Sick Leave for All Private Sector Employees Working in City.) Employers should review the new law and adjust their practices and policies to account for the changes.\n\nOrdinance 15.145 will become effective 60 days following signing by Jersey City Mayor Steven M. Fulop, which is expected soon.\n\nCovered Employers\n\nTo align the Jersey City sick leave ordinance with other existing paid sick leave ordinances throughout New Jersey (the state has not enacted a statewide mandate), Jersey City will require that employers who employ fewer than 10 employees provide their workers up to 24 hours of paid sick leave time and 16 hours of unpaid sick time. Under the original Jersey City sick leave law, employers of fewer than 10 employees were only required to provide up to 40 hours of unpaid sick leave time to workers.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the amendments, employers cannot require their employees who have accrued both paid and unpaid sick leave time to exhaust unpaid sick leave time prior to being entitled to use paid sick leave time.\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreement\n\nFollowing enactment of Ordinance 15.145, the requirements of providing paid and unpaid sick leave time do not apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to the extent such requirements are expressively waived in a clear and unambiguous manner in the CBA.\n\nWith respect to existing CBAs at the time of the enactment of Ordinance 15.145, the requirements of the ordinance do not apply until the expiration of the CBA. Nevertheless, to the extent the expired CBA provided greater paid sick leave time than that provided by the ordinance, the terms of the expired CBA will govern.\n\nDamages\n\nThe final major change to Jersey City\u2019s paid sick leave law is the damages provision. Ordinance 15.145 provides that employers will be subject to a possible fine of $2,000 for each infraction, as opposed to $1,250 under the original law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Jersey City Council has approved an ordinance amending the sick leave law to make paid sick leave available to more workers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The Jersey City Council has approved and adopted an ordinance amending the Jersey City sick leave law to make paid sick leave available to more workers in the second largest city in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nRev", "title": "Jersey City, New Jersey, Extends Paid Sick Leave Requirements to More Employers", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/jersey-city-new-jersey-extends-paid-sick-leave-requirements-to-more-employers", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1154/Woman%2C%20Kleenex%2C%20Sneeze.jpg?itok=qxmpXcIz", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "New Jersey, paid sick leave, labor benefits, compensation package, time off, employee health, employer, private sector, employment compliance, regulations", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, government, business, New Jersey, paid sick leave, labor benefits, compensation package, time off, employee health, employer, private sector, employment compliance, regulations"}, "article_summary": "Saturday, November 7, 2015The Jersey City Council has approved and adopted an ordinance amending the Jersey City sick leave law to make paid sick leave available to more workers in the second largest city in New Jersey.\nFurthermore, as a result of the amendments, employers cannot require their employees who have accrued both paid and unpaid sick leave time to exhaust unpaid sick leave time prior to being entitled to use paid sick leave time.\nCovered EmployersTo align the Jersey City sick leave ordinance with other existing paid sick leave ordinances throughout New Jersey (the state has not enacted a statewide mandate), Jersey City will require that employers who employ fewer than 10 employees provide their workers up to 24 hours of paid sick leave time and 16 hours of unpaid sick time.\n13.097, see our article, Jersey City Ordinance to Require Sick Leave for All Private Sector Employees Working in City.)\nUnder the original Jersey City sick leave law, employers of fewer than 10 employees were only required to provide up to 40 hours of unpaid sick leave time to workers."}
