If not, you\u2019ll certainly take note of the front\u2019s arrival upon stepping outside this morning: It\u2019s chilly and only going to get colder as the day wears on, with our first freeze of the fall expected tonight \u2014 and right on time too.\n\n\u201cFunny how that works out sometimes,\u201d says meteorologist Ted Ryan in the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office. The NWS has issued a freeze warning for tonight, so act appropriately with this list of cold-weather refreshments, including a new-found favorite, the Earl Grey Hot Toddy.\n\nThose of us with outdoor plans today have 25-35 mph winds to look forward to, with wind chills approaching the 30s. And this is why God invented the Stanley Growler. \u201cThey\u2019ll slowly diminish during the afternoon hours,\u201d says Ryan, \u201cbut won\u2019t come down till sunset.\u201d\n\nAt one point this morning, Oncor reported around 4,000 outages in Dallas-Fort Worth. By 7:15 it had dropped to around 2,500, with repairs guesstimated to be wrapped by 9:30 (but you know how that goes \u2026)\n\nTomorrow it\u2019ll just be cool \u2014 lower 50s, followed by another round of lower 30s. Says Ryan, \u201cLooks like this is the end of the growing season,\u201d though, clearly, that depends on what you\u2019re growing and where.\n\nIt\u2019s worth nothing: Our freeze might be right on time, but the 30s are late \u2014 mighty late, looking at this chart:\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t been cold yet,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThis is out first real shot of winter.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019ll stick around till, oh, Tuesday, when we\u2019re back around 60. And on Thursday it\u2019ll be more spring than fall, with highs in the upper 60s and a pretty decent shot at daylong rain. But come Thursday night and Friday morning and all through next weekend, winter will return \u2014 like, actual winter. A former ball-playing TV weatherman even told the viewing audience last night that one model shows snow on the horizon for next weekend. But Ryan says to tap those breaks.\n\n\u201cYou get out in that extended range, and five to 10 degrees makes a huge difference in the forecast models,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this far out, and at this time of the year, don\u2019t expect the models to accurate. But it will definitely be cold Friday through Sunday of next week. It\u2019ll definitely feel like Christmas is around the corner. But anybody who wants to stand out in line for those Black Friday deals, the weather\u2019s not looking so great \u2014 cold and rain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2xhdGUtYXJyaXZpbmctd2ludGVyLWNoaWxsLXRvLWJyaW5nLW5vcnRoLXRleGFzLWZpcnN0LWZyZWV6ZS1zYXR1cmRheS1uaWdodC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Maybe you too have been up since 5:22 (or thereabouts), when the cold front blew through Dallas riding loud gusts of 45 miles per hour.
