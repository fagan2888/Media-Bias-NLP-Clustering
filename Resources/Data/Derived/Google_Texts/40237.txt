This is our latest horror story. For reasons unknown (and they're always unknown, aren't they?) Hopper has decided that it's great fun to jump up on the second-story bannister and walk around. We can't think of any way to stop her from doing this, but one of these days she's going to set a paw wrong and go flying off the wrong side. Being a cat, maybe it won't hurt her. But it's a twelve-foot drop, and some of it is onto a hardwood floor. We have visions of splat going through our heads.

What do we do? Put up a net, like those ones they have on the Golden Gate Bridge to catch jumpers? Get rid of the quilts and install razor wire? Put cat-size exercise weights on Hopper's feet so she can't jump so high? There's got to be an answer.
