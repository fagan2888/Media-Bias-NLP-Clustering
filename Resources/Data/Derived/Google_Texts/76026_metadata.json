The Republican-controlled Senate is refusing to act on Garland\u2019s nomination, saying the next president should fill the seat.\n\n\u201cWith a Supreme Court that\u2019s not fully staffed, it makes it more likely that situations can arise across the country with different rulings in different courts that aren\u2019t resolved by the Supreme Court,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nEarlier this month, the court split, 4-4, in a narrow case involving spousal liability and gender discrimination, the first such vote since Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nThe deadlock in the union case leaves in place mandatory fees allowed by law in California and 22 other mostly Democratic states. Such fees are prohibited in \u201cright to work\u201d states across the South and in much of the Midwest.\n\nOrange County teacher Rebecca Friedrichs and several others had sued to overturn the fees, saying they objected being forced to support the California Teachers Assn.\n\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected her suit, citing the 1977 Supreme Court ruling in Abood vs. Detroit Board of Education, which had authorized these fair share fees in the first place. That case held that workers could be required to share in the cost of collective bargaining, but they did not have pay for a union\u2019s political activities.\n\nBefore Scalia\u2019s death, the court\u2019s five more conservative justices had served notice that they were ready to overturn Abood and declare such forced fees as unconstitutional. The same five justices who in the Citizens United case struck down campaign spending limits on free-speech grounds seemed to view the unions fees as a 1st Amendment violation because employees were forced to pay to support a union they opposed.\n\nInstead Tuesday, the justices issued a one-line statement saying the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling is \u201caffirmed by an equally divided court.\u201d\n\nLabor law scholars said unions would have been crippled if nonmembers had no longer been required to pay anything to support the union. \u201cIt would have been like a knife in the heart of the unions,\u201d said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Massachusetts.\n\nThe National Education Assn. -- the nation's largest union with 3 million members -- hailed the outcome as a victory. Eric Heins, president of the California teachers group, said \u201cwealthy corporate special interests\u201d had brought the case to \u201cmake it harder for working families and the middle class to come together, speak up and get ahead. Now it\u2019s time for senators to do their job and appoint a successor justice to the highest court in our land.\u201d\n\nPresidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders agreed that the deadlock \u201cunderscores the need to a confirm a Supreme Court nominee who will protect the rights of American workers to collectively bargain for fair wages and safe working conditions. The extreme right wing is just one conservative Supreme Court justice away from dismantling the rights of public sector unions to organize and collectively bargain on behalf of all workers.\u201d\n\nConservatives said they saw no incentive to allow Obama to appoint another left-leaning judge, which would give the court a liberal majority for the first time in generations.\n\nCurt Levey, executive director of the FreedomWorks Foundation, said that the Supreme Court would shift \u201cdramatically to the left with the appointment of Merrick Garland or any other liberal, [and] become a rubber stamp not just for the wishes of powerful labor unions, but also for virtually the entire progressive agenda.\u201d\n\nTerry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, which helped launch Friedrichs\u2019 lawsuit, said the group would try to raise the issue again. \u201cWe believe this case is too significant to let a split decision stand, and we will file a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\n\nA labor policy expert who supported Friedrichs said challengers should now to look to state legislatures to strike down the fees.\n\n\u201cWith a divided court, thousands of public servants around the nation must still financially assist a government union that they disagree with,\u201d said Trey Kovacs, a labor expert with the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \u201cNow it is up to state legislatures to provide public employees with the freedom to choose whether or not to pay for union representation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court's deadlock on union fees could be the first of many tie votes", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "A well-planned legal assault on public unions collapsed Tuesday when the Supreme Court deadlocked over a California woman\u2019s lawsuit to strike down mandatory fees, the strongest evidence yet that Justice Antonin Scalia \u2019s death has stymied the court\u2019s conservatives.", "title": "Supreme Court's deadlock on union fees could be the first of many tie votes", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-union-fees-tie-vote-20160329-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fa8ae6/turbine/la-na-court-union-fees-tie-vote-20160329", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Supreme Court, unions, teachers, free speech", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/86128693", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-29", "Description": "A well-planned legal assault on public unions collapsed Tuesday when the Supreme Court deadlocked over a California woman\u2019s lawsuit to strike down mandatory fees, the strongest evidence yet that Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death has stymied the court\u2019s conservatives.
