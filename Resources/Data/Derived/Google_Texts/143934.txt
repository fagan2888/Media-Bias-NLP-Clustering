A North High student who had been missing for nine days has turned up safe in Dallas, Tex., his father said Sunday.

Derilyn Johnson, 14, had gone missing Jan. 30 and had not contacted his Wichita family since. Police said Friday they thought Johnson might be headed to Forney, Tex. in the Dallas area. That's where his mother lives.

Derilyn Johnson Sr. says he received a call Saturday from his son's mother. He says she told him someone had dropped Derilyn off on a side street in Dallas. Johnson Sr. says he spoke briefly with his son over the phone but didn't have the opportunity to learn the details of how Derilyn got to Texas.

Johnson Sr. says he expects family will help get Derilyn back to the Wichita area Monday.
