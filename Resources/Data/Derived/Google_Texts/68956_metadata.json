Its oil and gas\u2014the latter mostly from Qatar\u2019s bounteous fields\u2014has been shipped out to North America, Europe and Asia to satisfy the needs of consumers and industry alike.\n\nBut demand for fuel is soaring at home as populations grow, the region urbanizes (check out these then and now pictures of Dubai that show the extent of change in the past 50 years) and energy-intensive desalination is required to deliver potable water.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain now consume as much oil as Indonesia and Japan combined, and demand has been growing at an average 6% a year over the last decade, according to the Middle East Economic Survey.\n\nThis is providing a headache for the governments of those countries, whose balance sheets rely heavily on export revenues that, in turn, allow for extensive fuel subsidies. Any changes to these policies have in the past been met with fierce public disapproval, which is possibly a reason why the U.A.E. would first look at reducing subsidies for expatriates.\n\nIn the short term, it may make sense for the region to look at the potential for North American gas. Further out, the region has to get a handle on its conspicuous energy consumption.\n\nAdnan Z. Amin, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, told The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Summer Said that he is confident a regional push toward greater use of renewables will bear fruit. The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have plans to invest $1.5 billion in solar energy by the end of 2014.\n\nNuclear power is also on the agenda. The U.A.E. has signed off on a deal to build four commercial nuclear power reactors by 2020; Saudi Arabia plans 16 reactors over the next 20 years.\n\nSo while OPEC\u2019s Secretary-General Abdalla Salem el-Badri issues his regular platitudinous utterances about how the producer group can easily cope with returning Iranian barrels and the potential for far higher Iraqi output, at home policy makers are wrestling not with a surplus of resources, but with not enough.\n\nMARKETS\n\nCrude oil prices recovered Tuesday from declines in the previous session that were linked to the currency pressures being felt in emerging markets.
