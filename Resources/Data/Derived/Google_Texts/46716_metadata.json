I really don\u2019t recommend having a kidney stone.\n\nI got a little lesson about the problems of over-regulating drugs this week. One of the common pain meds prescribed by doctors is Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5/325. Now, realize that this is already set up to prevent abuse of Hydrocodone \u2014 because the Acetaminophen will kill you if you take enough to abuse the Hydrocodone. But on October 6, Hydrocodone combinations were moved by the DEA from Schedule III to Schedule II, over the objections of much of the medical community. What this means is that doctors can no longer phone a prescription to your pharmacy \u2014 you have to take a physical signed piece of paper \u2014 and there can be no refills.\n\nAs several doctors told me this week, this concerns them because patients have to come in more often, and may be stuck without pain medication when they need it. They also indicated that the practical result is that they\u2019ll end up prescribing larger amounts, just to be sure, resulting in lots more leftover drugs.\n\nMore stupidity by the feds.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.drugwarrant.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DWRlogo.png", "description": "A blog from the front lines of the drug war with news, analysis, and the occasional rant.", "title": "Drug WarRant"}, "verify-v1": "GZquj9mvg4hxhvEl/IxYFYtSeh97SAJrIzyTFal3WEc=", "alexaVerifyID": "fr6LZ3aSBsI025Yh1BX7mMFG034"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0b5\"", "article_summary": "Pain med regulationI\u2019ve been a little out of touch this past week, as I\u2019ve been dealing with a large kidney stone, which was finally removed by laser last night.\nAs several doctors told me this week, this concerns them because patients have to come in more often, and may be stuck without pain medication when they need it.\nNow, realize that this is already set up to prevent abuse of Hydrocodone \u2014 because the Acetaminophen will kill you if you take enough to abuse the Hydrocodone.\nOne of the common pain meds prescribed by doctors is Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5/325.\nBut on October 6, Hydrocodone combinations were moved by the DEA from Schedule III to Schedule II, over the objections of much of the medical community."}
