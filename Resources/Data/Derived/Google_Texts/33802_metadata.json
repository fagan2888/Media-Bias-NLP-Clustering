I wrote about how they were causing a buzz in in fashion and d\u00e9cor circles. Bird lovers cried \u201cFowl!\u201d\n\nAnd rightly so.\n\nFeathers are beautiful. When they are rendered as a motif in, say, wallpaper, fabric or tableware, they can be exquisite. But when actual feathers from endangered flocks are used in home d\u00e9cor, that is a bird of different color, I found out. That use, my fine-feathered friends, can be at the peril of already threatened birds.\n\nDon\u2019t do it.\n\nWhen I wrote that column last fall, I had not thought that through. But readers raised their concerns and, as a result, my consciousness.\n\nMy consciousness was raised even more last week when I had an eye-opening discussion with Craig Hoover, chief of wildlife trade and conservation for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency that protects nature. Hoover told me about the impact certain home d\u00e9cor choices have on our planet and its wildlife.\n\nLadies and gentlemen: After you read the rest of this column, you will not be the same. I\u2019m not.\n\nAfter talking to Hoover, I felt like a dirt clod in the spring meadow of life. I haven\u2019t been turned, overnight, into an off-the-grid, tree-hugging, PETA-activist vegan with a Greenpeace sticker on her solar-powered Smart car. But I do care about the future of this spinning sphere, upon which we all depend entirely.\n\nHoover shared his mission, which is simply to prevent consumers from unwittingly buying home furnishings that harm the planet\u2019s wild spaces and inhabitants. For this cause, he needs noisemakers like me to get the word out.\n\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t thinking about where an item comes from and what impact their purchasing decision has on animal and plant life around the world,\u201d said Hoover.\n\n\u201cI want to get them to make the connection between the beautiful product in the store and the impact that removing it from the wild has on plants or animals,\u201d he says.\n\nIvory\n\n\u201cAs in, if consumers would stop buying ivory, hunters wouldn\u2019t stop killing elephants just for their tusks,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cAnything that creates a demand for products made from endangered species is bad news for that species,\u201d he says.\n\nHoover shared some other products used in home d\u00e9cor that he wants you to think about before you buy.\n\nOften beautifully carved into ornate balls or figures, ivory comes at a steep price to wildlife, usually to elephants that are killed solely for their tusks. Some ivory also comes from walrus tusks and hippo teeth, said Hoover. Unfortunately, demand for ivory has risen sharply. Last year, 35,000 African elephants were killed for their tusks. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve lost more than 60 percent of our forest elephants. Asian elephants are now endangered and African elephants are threatened, he said.\n\nCoral\n\nIn home d\u00e9cor, showy pieces of coral are often on display, but again, at a cost to the planet. Hundreds of thousands of species of fish rely on coral reefs for food and shelter, said Hoover. But, because of the market for coral, the planet\u2019s reefs are shrinking. \u201cCoral grows very slowly,\u201d said Hoover. \u201cA 12-inch piece of branch coral, one of the fastest-growing types, grows only an inch a year, so it would take 12 years to replace itself.\u201d\n\nRhino horn\n\nPoachers are killing the equivalent of a rhino every 12 hours in South Africa alone just for the animal\u2019s horn. With the texture of toenails, rhino horn is mostly sold for unproven medicinal purposes, but some fashion the horns into drinking cups, which sell for extraordinarily high prices.\n\nMahogany\n\nSupplies of mahogany and Brazilian rosewood are not in good shape and are highly regulated, said Hoover, who wants consumers to know the status of the wood in the furnishings before they purchase. Stick with woods like oak and pine that are sustainably produced.\n\nTortoise shell\n\nSea turtles are endangered because their shells are so highly regarded. Fake tortoise-accessories looks just as fabulous. But buying items fashioned from real tortoise contributes to reptiles\u2019 demise.\n\nOrchids\n\nBuying these graceful flowering plants could threaten our already at-risk rain forests.That\u2019s where many orchids come from, said Hoover, who encourages buyers to ask where the plants came from before buying. If they were grown in a nursery, fine. But avoid imported ones.\n\nFeathers\n\nAs I learned the hard way, decades ago women\u2019s hats were adorned with exotic feathers, creating a run on rare birds and driving many toward extinction. So ask where feathers comes from: If they\u2019re from wild birds, that\u2019s not OK.\n\nMarni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins.\u201d marnijameson.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda65a\"", "article_summary": "So ask where feathers comes from: If they\u2019re from wild birds, that\u2019s not OK.Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins.\u201d marnijameson.com.\nIvory\u201cAs in, if consumers would stop buying ivory, hunters wouldn\u2019t stop killing elephants just for their tusks,\u201d I say.\nBut when actual feathers from endangered flocks are used in home d\u00e9cor, that is a bird of different color, I found out.\nOften beautifully carved into ornate balls or figures, ivory comes at a steep price to wildlife, usually to elephants that are killed solely for their tusks.\nCoralIn home d\u00e9cor, showy pieces of coral are often on display, but again, at a cost to the planet."}
