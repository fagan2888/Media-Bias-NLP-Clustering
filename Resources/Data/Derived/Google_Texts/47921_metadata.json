Paxton, who was elected as part of a conservative GOP sweep that put Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick into office, will reportedly surrender to authorities Monday in North Texas on felony charges stemming from an alleged investment scheme into the McKinney-based technology company Servergy, as well as his failure to register as an investment advisor representative with the state. Republicans' silence comes in stark contrast to the support that followed then-Gov. Rick Perry when he was indicted on felony charges last year.", "title": "State GOP leaders silent on Paxton indictment", "url": "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/State-GOP-leaders-silent-on-Paxton-indictment-6420855.php", "image": "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/03/66/8404375/5/rawImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@houstonchron", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ChronicleMike"}, "date.release": "2015/02/08", "fb": {"app_id": 653292111352579}, "time.release": "21:32", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "sections": "News,Houston & Texas,Houston", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd28b\"", "article_summary": "To continue reading this story, you will need to be a digital subscriber to HoustonChronicle.com."}
