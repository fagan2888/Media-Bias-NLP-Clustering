HHS also estimates the number of unintentional overdose deaths from prescription pain medications has nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2013, and deaths related to heroin increased 39 percent between 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe award to Hudson Headwaters was part of $94 million in Affordable Care Act funding that is going to 271 health centers across the country. In making the announcement, HSS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said \u201cThe opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States today. Expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and integrating these services in health centers bolsters nationwide efforts to curb opioid misuse and abuse, supports approximately 124,000 new patients accessing substance use treatment for recovery and helps save lives.\u201d\n\nResearch demonstrates that a whole-patient approach to treatment through a combination of medication, counseling, and behavioral therapies is most successful in treating opioid use disorders. In 2014, over 1.3 million people received behavioral health services at community health centers. This represents a 75 percent increase since 2008.\n\n\u201cHudson Headwaters recognized the importance of mental health to overall health more than 15 years ago,\u201d said David Alloy, PhD, \u201cand we have worked to develop a capacity to support Network patients with mental health care.\u201d\n\nHudson Headwaters\u2019 behavioral health staff includes licensed social workers, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners.
