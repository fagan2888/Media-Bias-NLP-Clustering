Presidential visits aren’t cheap, something that Washington state residents Jim and Jan Sinegal are going to find out.

President Barack Obama spoke at a $25,000-per-plate Democratic fundraiser at the Sinegals’ home Tuesday night, which required additional security from the Medina Police Department to back up the Secret Service, the Pudget Sound Business Journal reported. Now, the city plans to total up the police cost and bill the Sinegals for the overtime.

“Other police departments have absorbed the costs of these visits,” Medina City Manager Michael Sauerwein said. “But we don’t think that’s right.”

The Medina Police Department is under contract to patrol the Hunts Point neighborhood, where Obama spoke. Five officers, a sergeant and the police chief were backing the Secret Service to protect Obama.

The cost isn’t expected to exceed $25,000, the Business Journal reported.

“From our city council’s standpoint, we shouldn’t pass this on to our citizens,” Sauerwein said. “We absolutely do not think the cost should be passed on to taxpayers.”

Obama attended a fundraiser that same night at a private residence in Seattle, where the police department will absorb the cost, according to the Business Journal. The Washington state events were on the first leg of his three-day fundraising trip through Washington and California.
