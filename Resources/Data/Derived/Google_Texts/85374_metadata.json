In fact, three of the oldest educational institutions of any level in the entire state of Tennessee are Catholic, each started between 1856 and 1866.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just their age that makes Catholic schools important. It is their unique purpose and success.\n\nEstablished and supported by immigrant families and their churches, Catholic schools were created to provide an education and an environment, rooted in our faith but open to all, that would raise the level of opportunity for these children, and as a result better these families and their communities.\n\nThat commitment to a quality education, a welcoming environment and the tenets of the Catholic faith made these schools important at their inception, and the accomplishments of their students and alumni continue to demonstrate their value. It\u2019s on display around our city today.\n\nThe students graduating from our 20 Catholic elementary and high schools are academically strong, recognized by national organizations like the Duke TIP program and National Merit Scholarship Program at ever-increasing levels. They are valedictorians and salutatorians at Catholic and other private high schools in the area. And they are attending top colleges and universities across the country.\n\nJames A. McIntyre, President of Father Ryan High School (Photo: Steve Green)\n\nWhile Catholic schools have been lauded for decades as standards for excellence in primary and secondary education, they do more than prepare students academically. They mold their students into faithful, charitable citizens, and hone these attributes from their earliest elementary days.\n\nNurturing a student\u2019s sense of faith and social justice, educating not just the mind, but the body and soul, these principles are at the core of Catholic education, and generation after generation of Catholic school graduates have benefited from that foundation not just in their academic careers, but throughout their life.\n\nTim Forbes (Photo: Submitted)\n\nJust look at Nashville. The founder of Room in the Inn, the head of Thoracic Surgery at St. Thomas Health, the creator of the First Amendment Center, the Bishop of Nashville \u2026 all products of Nashville Catholic high school and elementary education.\n\nThe chief investment banker for Morgan Stanley, the former commander of Marine One, a lead dancer for Alvin Ailey and the first American to swim the Mississippi, doing so to honor America\u2019s veterans. Each one a product of Nashville\u2019s Catholic schools.\n\nThe Catholic schools in Nashville have also been social leaders throughout their history, whether in matters of serving the homeless or leading social justice causes as the first integrated schools in the South. It\u2019s a wonderful legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not the system that achieves and enacts change, however; it\u2019s the people. Catholic education produces all types \u2014 artists and writers, priests and athletes, social workers and business executives, but what our tradition prides itself on more than anything else is producing people who seek to do good, as our faith teaches us to do. That is what we celebrated last week, and what we celebrate each day.\n\nJim McIntyre is the president of Father Ryan High School and Tim Forbes is the principal of St. Matthew Elementary School, two of the area\u2019s leading educational institutions. Both are products of Catholic education.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1XqZfMI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Famous alumni have led newspapers and churches, and they've swum the entirety of the Mississippi River.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Famous alumni have led newspapers and churches, and they've swum the entirety of the Mississippi River.", "title": "Catholic schools continue to make Nashville great", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/02/14/catholic-schools-continue-make-nashville-great/80335076/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Famous alumni have led newspapers and churches, and they've swum the entirety of the Mississippi River.", "title": "Catholic schools continue to make Nashville great", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee9425e5087c18fb081f500f68a8fb6a155f4e82/c=359-0-2470-2111&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Catholic Schools' Week", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Catholic Schools' Week", "title": "Catholic schools continue to make Nashville great", "author": "Jim McIntyre and Tim Forbes", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/983454dd81eb4ee4f5d15c180ddb514f4460566f/c=649-0-2238-1700/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/388a7e7f7fdb219d272b576d6016ae7568ec5f8e/c=359-0-2470-2111/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fec8c3e158ef80822fcf9b8c4eeebe4f232402a/c=0-16-2639-1615/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7476109572b50e7ca0a2cc027134f882bba9bf27/c=0-16-2639-1219&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-13T23:24:04.733000-06:00", "shorthed": "Catholic schools continue to make Nashville great", "articleid": 80335076, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8f1c71dd20553be2baf5e7074aa6ad3c21fd659/c=0-16-2639-1219/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0608224ad9c8c7c15d3ba46eb79bc3d62300e381/c=892-0-2069-1700/local/-/media/Nashville/Nashville/2014/06/21/1403389706032-JohnSeigenthaler-33.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Catholic school, Father Ryan, John Seigenthaler, Pope Francis, Catholic Church, St. Matthew Elementary School"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Singer-songwriter Tom T.
