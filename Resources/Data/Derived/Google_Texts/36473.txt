The Federal Reserve on Friday said Eric Belsky will be the new director of its consumer and community affairs division.

Mr. Belsky, who is now managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, is expected to start his new job in August, the Fed said in a news release. He previously worked at Price Waterhouse LLP, Fannie Mae and the National Association of Home Builders.

He succeeds Sandra Braunstein, who retired earlier this year after a decade in the post.

The consumer and community affairs division carries out the Fed’s “consumer financial protection and community development programs,” and conducts “consumer-focused supervision, research and policy analysis to promote a fair and transparent consumer financial services marketplace,” the Fed said in its statement.
