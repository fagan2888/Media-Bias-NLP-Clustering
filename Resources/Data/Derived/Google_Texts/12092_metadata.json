The secretary encouraged the student to look at different tools on the healthcare.gov website.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important to figuring out what plan is right for you and the total affordability,\u201d said Burwell.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d said Dorema. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nLater at a press conference, Burwell said the Affordable Care Act has been about three things: \u201caffordability, access and quality.\u201d\n\nShe went on to detail indicators of progress under ACA: Medicare spending is $316 billion less than projected, young adults can stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until they\u2019re 26 years old, 17.6 million more Americans have health insurance.\n\n\u201cSo progress on all fronts, but we want to make more,\u201d she said.\n\nUnintended Consequences\n\nThis is the third year of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act and the people who remain uninsured are in many ways harder to reach than in years past.\n\nOne group of people who are not buying health insurance are those caught in the \u201cfamily glitch.\u201d These are people who cannot get tax breaks on Obamacare because one family member is offered family health insurance through an employer\u2014regardless of how expensive those benefits are or what percent of the family income it is.\n\nSen. Al Franken, D-Minn., has introduced a bill that would close this loophole, but getting it passed is a challenge. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been discussion from health policy watchers like the Urban Institute that HHS and the Treasury Department have the power to fix the family glitch through regulation.\n\nWhen asked about a possible regulatory fix for the family glitch, Burwell said, \u201cThat\u2019s an IRS issue,\u201d and then quickly went back to talking points about affordability and quality.\n\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation study estimates there are more than 400,000 uninsured Floridians who can\u2019t get tax breaks on a plan because they\u2019ve been offered employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nBurwell was similarly evasive when it came to the trouble with what\u2019s called \u201cbalanced billing\u201d\u2014also known as surprise billing.\n\nSay a patient goes for a surgery at an in-network hospital and sees an in-network surgeon. That patient can still wake up to a surprisingly large bill if he or she didn\u2019t know that the anesthesiologist, for example, was out of network.\n\nBurwell responded to a question about how HHS is addressing this balanced billing problem by pointing to a price estimate tool on healthcare.gov and suggesting it\u2019s up to patients to figure it out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added a feature that allows people to search and see what providers are in their network as part of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.\n\nExcited About Health\n\nOne person who wasn\u2019t buying insurance through the marketplace Wednesday: Guerline Dorema, the young woman from the computer lab.\n\nShe wants to be a pediatric nurse practitioner, she likes health policy and when she heard Burwell was coming to visit, Dorema just really wanted to meet her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m excited to see her,\u201d said Dorema.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell stopped at Miami Dade College on Wednesday to drum up excitement around open enrollment for health", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wlrn.org/post/obamacare-head-talks-open-enrollment-ducks-problems", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wlrn/files/styles/medium/public/201511/sylvia_mathews_burwell_0049.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell stopped at Miami Dade College on Wednesday to drum up excitement around open enrollment for health", "title": "Obamacare Head Talks Open Enrollment, Ducks Problems"}, "story_id": 456644425, "twitter": {"site": "@WLRN", "card": "summary", "creator": "@sammymack"}, "author": "Sammy Mack", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Obamacare Head Talks Open Enrollment, Ducks Problems"}, "nid": 59701, "datePublished": "2015-11-19", "keywords": "health care, Health News Florida, news", "wordCount": 734, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Listen: Obamacare Chief Talks Open Enrollment, Ducks ProblemsHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell stopped at Miami Dade College on Wednesday to drum up excitement around open enrollment for health insurance plans\u2014though during her stop she was not keen on addressing some of the problems that have come out of Obamacare.\nUnintended ConsequencesThis is the third year of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act and the people who remain uninsured are in many ways harder to reach than in years past.\nWhen asked about a possible regulatory fix for the family glitch, Burwell said, \u201cThat\u2019s an IRS issue,\u201d and then quickly went back to talking points about affordability and quality.\nExcited About HealthOne person who wasn\u2019t buying insurance through the marketplace Wednesday: Guerline Dorema, the young woman from the computer lab.\n\u201cThat\u2019s important to figuring out what plan is right for you and the total affordability,\u201d said Burwell."}
