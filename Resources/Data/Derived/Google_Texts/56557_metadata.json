Obesity levels there and elsewhere across the country have been high enough that RWJF has painted a gloomy portrait of our future.\n\n\"Just two years ago, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Trust for America\u2019s Health predicted that, if trends continued the way they seemed to be going, more than 60% of adults in 13 states would be obese by the year 2030\u2014and have the extremely high medical bills to prove it,\" the TEDMED primer noted.\n\nBut what's happening in Philadelphia has helped changed the narrative.\n\n\"But now, we\u2019re finally starting to see signs of progress against an epidemic that was once feared to be unstoppable,\" wrote TEDMED.\n\nSo what's the change? And what's behind it?\n\nThe good news is that data show obesity levels among K-12 students in Philadelphia fell by 4.7 percent from the 2006-2007 school year to the 2009-2010 school year. The caveat there\u2014and it's a big one\u2014is that the data doesn't track individual students. So there's no way of knowing whether this is due to some influx of younger students who aren't obese, older obese students graduating (or moving away, or dropping out of school), some combination, or something else entirely.\n\nThis clear uncertainty, though, hasn't stopped RWJF from suggesting that policy changes it favors are behind the change.\n\nAmong the six factors RWJF cites as part of Philadelphia's efforts \"working to address obesity\" is the fact the city \"required chain restaurants to post calorie information on menus and menu boards.\"\n\nCheering on mandatory calorie labeling is a constant RWJF refrain. In a 2013 report listing four key strategies for reducing obesity, for example, RWJF also credited four states for \"requiring chain restaurants to post nutrition information.\"\n\nBut, as I've written before, laws requiring the posting of calorie counts don't work. In fact, research has shown they can push people to ingest more calories, rather than fewer.\n\nThis is precisely the problem. RWJF touts many policies. Some might work. Some might not. That's fine. But some have been shown not to work. And RWJF appears to treat all of these very different animals\u2014the uncertain ones and the certainly-not-working ones\u2014as cogs that are part of a real reduction in obesity levels. And it does so without even knowing who, exactly, the less obese people are.\n\nThis sloppiness is a longstanding problem in RWJF's work.\n\nIn 2012, for example, I wrote about another RWJF study that looked at areas the group said were experiencing \"the most progress\" in combating childhood obesity.\n\nAs I noted after sifting through the data, what RWJF was touting was, among other things, a reported \"decrease of 1.1 percent in the obese/overweight levels of [two] completely different set[s] of students over five years.\"\n\nWorse than touting a statistically insignificant decrease in childhood obesity as an area of great \"progress,\" RWJF failed to note that the group it paid to carry out the research had also noted that \"the majority of counties in the state [of California, where the study was centered, are] still registering increases in obesity rates among school-age children.\"\n\nIf this is evidence from places with \"the most progress,\" then I suppose any old Pyrrhic victory is worth celebrating.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Obesity rates may be leveling off or even falling.", "title": "Government Menu Mandates Are Not Curing Obesity", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/26/rwjf-again-running-with-bad-data-in-hand", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1406319813790.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Earlier this week, the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation (RWJF), the multi-billion-dollar health philanthropy and\ngrant-maker, took part in an online event hosted by TEDMED, a forum that\ntracks closely with the TED Talk model (and which was also created\nby TED's founder).\nThis week's event, \nTEDMED Great Challenges: A Candid Conversation About Childhood\nObe", "creator": "@baylenlinnekin", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1406319813790.jpg", "title": "Government Menu Mandates Are Not Curing Obesity", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-07-26T12:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/baylen-linnekin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf16\"", "article_summary": "Obesity levels there and elsewhere across the country have been high enough that RWJF has painted a gloomy portrait of our future.\nAnd RWJF appears to treat all of these very different animals\u2014the uncertain ones and the certainly-not-working ones\u2014as cogs that are part of a real reduction in obesity levels.\nThe good news is that data show obesity levels among K-12 students in Philadelphia fell by 4.7 percent from the 2006-2007 school year to the 2009-2010 school year.\nIn 2012, for example, I wrote about another RWJF study that looked at areas the group said were experiencing \"the most progress\" in combating childhood obesity.\nIn a 2013 report listing four key strategies for reducing obesity, for example, RWJF also credited four states for \"requiring chain restaurants to post nutrition information.\""}
