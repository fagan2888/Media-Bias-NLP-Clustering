When I got divorced, it was hard that season, but this year especially, I\u2019m older and I\u2019m only able to go home once this year,\u201d said Vonn, 31. \u201cI\u2019m pretty lonely, to be honest, and it\u2019s been nice to have my dog. That\u2019s what I needed.\u201d\n\nShe picked up the 3-month-old cavalier king spaniel in Bologna and named her Lucy.\n\n\u201cI feel like sometimes when I have a bad day, it\u2019s hard to go home,\u201d Vonn added. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty depressing just to be alone. It\u2019s nice to have a friendly, smiling little puppy face excited for me to come home whether I win or lose.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, it was a big win.\n\nVonn beat Larisa Yurkiw of Canada by 0.28 seconds on the Olympia delle Tofane course \u2014 the same site where she eclipsed Moser-Proell\u2019s overall women\u2019s record of 62 victories a year ago \u2014 with a nearly flawless run amid windy conditions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI was really nervous today. I\u2019ve won so much here, and there was just a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\nLara Gut of Switzerland finished third, 0.67 behind, and maintained a 10-point lead on Vonn in the overall standings.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn gets her paws on record 37th win", "title": "Lindsey Vonn gets her paws on record 37th win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/lindsey-vonn-gets-her-paws-on-record-37th-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Lindsey-Vonnp1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Lindsey-Vonnp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T18:14:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:54:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be on the road.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty lonely, to be honest, and it\u2019s been nice to have my dog.\nCORTINA D\u2019AMPEZZO, Italy \u2014 For all her time basking in the leader\u2019s spotlight, Lindsey Vonn also has another, more lonely side these days.\n\u201cI feel like sometimes when I have a bad day, it\u2019s hard to go home,\u201d Vonn added.\nAfter breaking Annemarie Moser-Proell\u2019s record for most World Cup downhill victories with her 37th in skiing\u2019s marquee event Saturday, Vonn revealed that her recent purchase of a little puppy was made to combat depression."}
