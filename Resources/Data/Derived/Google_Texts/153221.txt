Sen. Tom Carper (D) campaigned for Hillary Clinton at a rally in Delaware on Monday – but she probably wished he hadn’t. In his introduction of her in front of a confused crowd, Carper praised Clinton’s eight years as governor.

“Hillary Clinton was right there in the middle of it all. I saw her. I saw her as a governor, as chairman of the National Governor’s Association, she was terrific,” Carper said.

That’s nice – except Clinton never served as a governor. She was a New York senator for eight years, before she assumed the role of President Obama’s secretary of state.

Yet, Carper was insistent.

“For eight years that we served together in the House, she did her job. She did her job. She was amazing. She was amazing,” Carper said. “She always surrounded herself by the best people you could find. God, she was a terrific colleague.”

Nope.

Carper isn’t the only Clinton surrogate who has hurt more than helped her cause. Shortly after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed her, he embarrassed her with a racially charged skit that could have jeopardized her image with the African-American community. Then, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered an indirect jab at Clinton by reminding everyone that the Democratic candidate usually has the nomination sewn up by now.

She is happy with one of her friends, however. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned Clinton’s favor by giving violent criminals the right to vote.

While she's still in Delaware, perhaps Clinton should return Carper’s compliments by congratulating him on his UN ambassadorship and Nobel Peace Prize.
