Is there something about comedians that makes them better at subversion?\n\nImmediately after 9/11, comedy ground to a halt. The Daily Show went off the air for nine days. Saturday Night Live, whose 27th season started 18 days later, featured a somber cold-open with Lorne Michaels asking New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, \"Can we be funny?\" The staffers of The Onion, the satirical paper that had just relocated to New York, weren\u2019t sure how to answer that question. Even three weeks after the attack, the comedian Gilbert Gottfried was publicly hissed at for joking that he was taking a flight that would make a stop at the Empire State Building. Screenshot: The Onion The Onion staffers agonized, but they eventually settled on publishing an entire paper devoted to 9/11 on September 26. As described by psychologist Peter McGraw and journalist Joel Warner in their upcoming book, The Humor Code, the issue was smash hit. The Onion writers aimed their bile at the hijackers, whom they depicted being tortured by \u201ctusked, asp-tongued demons\u201d in Hell. One headline read, \u201cGod Angrily Clarifies 'Don't Kill' Rule.\u201d The paper was deluged with fan mail from readers who seemed to find catharsis in the terrorists' derisive rendering.\n\nThe Onion\u2019s triumph reflects McGraw\u2019s long-held theory that comedy is equal parts darkness and light. The best jokes, he believes, take something awful and make it silly. Go purely light-hearted and you risk being toothless. Too edgy, and like Gottfried, you\u2019ll make people uncomfortable. This \u201cbenign violation\u201d theory of humor is central to The Humor Code, which Warner and McGraw, a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, researched by digging into comedy trends around the world. The book comes out on April 1 (obviously). McGraw\u2019s thinking expands on the work of Stanford psychologist Thomas Veatch, which in turn builds on past explanations about why we laugh. Great thinkers have been trying for centuries to figure out the evolutionary purpose of comedy. The theories that have emerged are all very different, but one thing they share is a tendency to hint at the art form's shadowy side. Hobbes and Plato took the playground perspective, suggesting that making fun helps us feel superior to others. Kant and later psychologists though it was about a cognitive shift that moves a serious situation into playful territory. In 1905, Freud suggested that humor was the fun-loving id making itself known despite the protestations of the conformist superego. A few years ago, psychologist Daniela S. Hugelshofer suggested that humor acts as a buffer against depression and hopelessness. And evolutionary psychologists have suggested that humor is a way to subtly outshine our competitors for mates. Nothing says \u201cpick me\u201d like having an entire office/bar/dorm double over at your imitation of Shosh from Girls. These approaches have a lot in common, though: You can\u2019t make a joke without inserting a wicked twist, and you can\u2019t be a comedian without holding a small amount of power, for even a short period of time, over the audience. And if that\u2019s the case, is there something about the psychology of comedians that makes them better able to tap into these \u201cviolations\u201d? Do they enjoy wielding that kind of power? Or do funny people just know something the rest of us don\u2019t?\n\n*** One of McGraw\u2019s favorite quotes is from Mark Twain: \u201cThe secret source of humor itself is not joy, but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.\u201d It\u2019s this juxtaposition of injury and cheer that McGraw has studied in depth, both in his book and at the University of Colorado at Boulder\u2019s Humor Research Lab (acronym: HURL). \u201cHumor is something people inherently enjoy,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut there also needs to be something wrong, unsettling, and threatening in some way. We call those violations.\u201d Our caveman ancestors lived in a world rife with physical threats. There was relief in discovering that a rustling in the darkness was a mouse rather than a saber-toothed tiger. \u201cBefore people could speak, laughter served as a signaling function,\u201d McGraw explained. \u201cAs if to say, \u2018this is a false alarm, this is a benign violation.\u2019\u201d Tickling, the basic form of humor that even non-verbal primates use, is a perfect example: \u201cThere's a threat there, but it's safe,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cIt's not too aggressive and it's done by someone you trust.\u201d Today, our threats are less likely to be four-legged, but humor still serves as a way to overcome them. Jokes ease tension; they help us deal with life\u2019s injustices, both minor and large. But like the Onion staffers after 9/11, jokes have to air these wrongs before making them right. When jokes are too gentle or anodyne, like this picture of a cat, we don\u2019t laugh; there\u2019s no violation. (\u201cYou can\u2019t tickle yourself,\u201d McGraw explains.) Meanwhile, something that\u2019s too offensive, like, say, this, is purely a violation. (\u201cLike if a creepy guy in a trench coat tried to tickle you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s terrifying!\u201d) Related Story The Evolution of Bitchiness Some cultures avoid these types of blatant transgressions by restricting the topics that can be fodder for jokes. But Warner, McGraw\u2019s co-author, noticed that while some cultures compartmentalize humor by subject matter, others do so by geography. When they were in Japan, for example, they noticed that the comedy in clubs was as raunchy as it gets, but certain settings were entirely off-limits to joking: \u201cIn the office or at school, that's not okay,\u201d Warner said. \u201cIt was not okay to laugh in the office of the humor researchers, even. But in bars and karaoke theaters, anything goes.\u201d\n\nIn the HURL lab, McGraw has been trying determine what exactly flips a joke from offensive to funny. Or in research terms, what puts the \u201cbenign\u201d in \u201cbenign violation?\u201d Through clinical studies, the lab has found that tragedies\u2014think earthquakes, deaths, and the like\u2014are funnier when they\u2019re either physically or socially distant. \u201cMishaps\u201d meanwhile, are funnier when we\u2019re closer to them, which is why Anthony Weiner\u2019s Twitter misadventures featured prominently on American late-night shows, but comparable foibles by, say, an Indonesian politician would not have. Likewise, participants found a picture of a man with a frozen beard (mishap) funnier than a man with his finger stuck through his own eye socket (tragedy.) Psychological Science The lab has also identified that jokes can, indeed, be \u201ctoo soon,\u201d as my colleague Julie Beck described: One study by McGraw and researchers at Texas A&M University found tweets about Hurricane Sandy to be least funny 15 days after it struck, most funny 36 days after the fact, and once again not funny 99 days later. The passage of about a month, they wrote, creates a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which poking fun at sadness is neither too neutered nor too sharp: \u201cA tragic event is difficult to joke about at first, but the passage of time initially increases humor as the event becomes less threatening. Eventually, however, distance decreases humor by making the event seem completely benign.\u201d It's even better if the comedy can put the audience physically on edge, which is why most comedy clubs cram people into a tiny room and force them to sit on hard stools, he said\u2014it\u2019s best if the audience doesn\u2019t get too comfortable. *** Last year, the comedian Stephen Fry publicly discussed his bipolar disorder and suicide attempt. In describing his quiz show, QI, Fry has said, \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m doing QI and I\u2019m going \u2018ha ha, yeah, yeah,\u2019 and inside I\u2019m going \u2018I want to fucking die. I ... want ... to ... fucking ... die\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of miserable guys do pretty amazing stand-up,\u201d Marc Maron once told a fellow comedian.\n\nThere\u2019s always been an anecdotal link between comedy and inner turmoil, but the empirical evidence has started to back it up. In the 1920s, the psychologist Lewis Terman found that children rated as having a good sense of humor by their parents and teachers died younger as adults. A longitudinal study of Finnish police officers found that the funniest among them were more likely to be obese and to smoke. And an analysis of New York Times obituaries found that performers died nearly eight years younger than members of the military did. Is there something unusually taxing about the process of dreaming up violations and deploying them to crack people up? Last month, a group of British scientists found that comedians are more likely than regular people to exhibit psychotic traits, or the characteristics associated with people who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Writing in the British Journal of Psychiatry, the authors describe how they administered a questionnaire to 523 comedians, 364 actors, and 831 people with non-performance jobs. The survey asked about experiences with magical thinking, antisocial behavior, distractibility, and \u201cintroverted anhedonia,\u201d or not deriving pleasure from others. Comedians and actors alike scored higher than the non-performers across almost all of the traits. The only difference was that comedians were more likely to experience a reduced ability to feel social and physical pleasure, but the same wasn\u2019t true of actors. Comedians, more so than the regular folk or even actors, were more likely to have a mild distaste for humanity. \u201cComedians had an introverted set of traits, which is rather counterintuitive,\u201d Oxford psychologist Gordon Claridge, one of the authors, told me. \u201cActors were outgoing in a consistent way.\u201d It\u2019s important to note, Claridge said, that this doesn\u2019t mean comedians are mentally ill. In fact, few of the subjects actually experienced psychotic symptoms; they just shared some traits with people who suffer from psychotic ailments.\n\nThese characteristics might help comedians \u201ctap into some sort of out-of-the-box thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, they underpin a creative cognitive style.\u201d McGraw is skeptical, though. He thinks the study supports a certain \u201ccrazy comedian\u201d stereotype but isn\u2019t definitive. NBC \u201cPeople think comedians are kind of screwed-up people, but that they have developed a sense of humor to cope with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's a compelling idea, but there's not great evidence for that.\u201d He points to the fact that the comedians scored roughly on par with the actors. Comedians, he says, are just actors starring in their own play. \u201cIt's more about the kind of person who is drawn to a world of theater more than comedy specifically,\u201d he argues. \u201cGilbert Gottfried doesn't talk like that all the time. Lewis Black doesn't walk around outraged at the bus stop.\u201d Besides, no one gets ahead in comedy by being \u201can asshole,\u201d as McGraw puts it. Such a competitive field demands attentiveness to showtimes, hours spent perfecting jokes, and being cordial to club owners. The HURL lab once studied 600 novices and experts in the Upright Citizen\u2019s Brigade, an improv comedy troupe, and found that the only difference was that the experts were more conscientious, McGraw said. \u201cThe really screwed up people aren't comedians, they're criminals. They're in jails, and they're not funny. They're sad and angry,\" he said. \u201cNo, there's something else that predicts success in comedy.\u201d *** Gil Greengross, a University of Mexico anthropologist, thinks the secret to being funny is being smart. In fact, he\u2019s written that humor itself is an \u201cintelligence indicator.\u201d For a 2011 study published in the journal Intelligence, Greengross gave 400 undergrads a series of verbal and abstract-reasoning intelligence tests, and then measured them against history\u2019s greatest yardstick of hilarity: writing captions for New Yorker cartoons. The captions were then rated by the judges, who were blind to any of the participants\u2019 identifiable information. As he expected, the students who scored higher on the intelligence measures also created the funniest captions. This makes sense. According to all of the theories of humor, wit involves putting discordant ideas together quickly, all while being perceptive enough to offend your audience a little, but not too much.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research shows that the best humor is both a little bit wrong and a little bit right.
