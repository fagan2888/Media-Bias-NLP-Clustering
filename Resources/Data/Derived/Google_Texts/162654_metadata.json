But the stretch behind the Thunderbird remains void of vegetation because of cars, music stages and even a Ferris wheel that was set up here during a dozen different annual events.\n\nYoung\u2019s trip came at the request of a group of beachfront hoteliers who have complained that the festivities are bad for their business and the environment.\n\nHe did not speak about the hotel owners\u2019 lawsuit that claims the city is violating state environmental laws by allowing vehicles and event equipment on the sand.\n\nRegardless of whether it runs afoul of state regulations, though, Young said these kinds of intense activities are bad for the beach\u2019s ecosystem and possibly the long-term economy.\n\n\u201cThe beaches are your gold,\u201d Young said. \u201cThe business engine for so much of the state is this beach and protecting this beach.\u201d\n\nThe events are permitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which has sought to dismiss the hoteliers\u2019 demand for an administrative hearing on the matter.\n\nCity Attorney Maura Kiefer says the claim that the events and parking violate state law is baseless, as are many of the lawsuit\u2019s accusations of environmental degradation.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day the evidence will show that the City\u2019s beach is flourishing, healthy, protected and preserved,\u201d Kiefer wrote in an email, noting the city\u2019s active Beach Stewardship Committee.\n\nAttorneys for the hoteliers have pointed to a state law passed in the late 1980s that prohibits driving on Florida beaches except for maintenance, unless local governments already had allowed it.\n\nPinellas County makes no such allowance, and Treasure Island amended its beach driving ordinance in 2003, which means it runs afoul of the state law, hoteliers have said.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be heard in circuit court in April.\n\nShould DEP fail to act, the hoteliers plan to sue the agency.\n\nAt first, their grievance with the city was focused more on economics than the environment.\n\nThe dispute started heating up after a beach carnival last spring to benefit the Rotary Club called \u201cThe Greatest Show on Surf,\u201d which included a music stage, Ferris wheel and cars parked on the sand after nearby lots filled up.\n\nGuests at the neighboring Thunderbird, Page Terrace and Windjammer hotels didn\u2019t appreciate the spectacle, and the owners told city commissioners events like this held at peak season cost them reservations.\n\nMany hoteliers and merchants elsewhere on the beach have said the activities are good for business.\n\nRegardless of whether DEP permits the events, Young says they\u2019re not in the community\u2019s broader interest of protecting the beach.\n\nA 1995 Google Earth image shows much of this broad beach devoid of vegetation; today, grassy dunes have reappeared in many spots except where the events are held.\n\nSand dunes offer an important natural barrier to protect coastal areas from storm surge, Young said.\n\nBeach festivals don\u2019t necessarily tell the whole story, said Ping Wang, a coastal geologist at the University of South Florida.\n\nFor one thing, though he hasn\u2019t done a formal study on it, the practice of raking this popular part of the beach may clear out both garbage and fledgling vegetation, Wang said.\n\nFor this part of the Gulf of Mexico as a whole, lower winds and a humid climate result in less sand being blown around to form tall dunes.\n\n\u201cThe main factor, the reason there are no dunes there is not because they have these events,\u201d he said.\n\nThough dunes do act as storm surge barriers, the relatively small ones that form on the Treasure Island beach don\u2019t offer much protection, he said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Feb 2014 00:01:00 -0400", "Description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 The powdery white sand is unquestionably this island community\u2019s most valuable asset.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 The powdery white sand is unquestionably this island community\u2019s most valuable asset.", "title": "Treasure Island hotels want beach events curbed", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/treasure-island-hotels-want-beach-events-curbed-20140222/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140222/ARTICLE/140229779/EP/1/3/EP-140229779.jpg", "height": 409}, "updated_time": "2014-02-22T00:03:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 The powdery white sand is unquestionably this island community\u2019s most valuable asset.", "title": "Treasure Island hotels want beach events curbed", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140222/ARTICLE/140229779/AR/0/AR-140229779.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-22T00:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-22T00:03:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Though dunes do act as storm surge barriers, the relatively small ones that form on the Treasure Island beach don\u2019t offer much protection, he said.\nTREASURE ISLAND \u2014 The powdery white sand is unquestionably this island community\u2019s most valuable asset.\nRegardless of whether DEP permits the events, Young says they\u2019re not in the community\u2019s broader interest of protecting the beach.\nJust a few yards north, he says, there are signs of health: grassy humps and sand dunes that have built up.\nPinellas County makes no such allowance, and Treasure Island amended its beach driving ordinance in 2003, which means it runs afoul of the state law, hoteliers have said."}
