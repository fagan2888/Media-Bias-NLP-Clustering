There are unlikely to be major generational gains in education level. The labor force is growing more slowly. Together, they make for a worrying combination.\n\nDispatches from the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Surveying the current landscape, he admitted things could be worse, and praised the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative-easing program. Given that GDP fell at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent in the first quarter of 2014, however, he said it\u2019s clearly not enough.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the economy is beyond salvation or stimulation. Summers laid out a four-point plan for fixing what ails the economy, focused on feeding demand for goods and services without having to court instability with low interest rates.\n\nInvest in Public Infrastructure. \u201cWho here is proud of Kennedy Airport?\u201d Summers asked the audience. Not a hand went up. \u201cWho here has a vacuum-tube television?\u201d he asked next. Again: no hands. Summers said American air-traffic controllers are still using vacuum-tube monitors to guarantee flyer safety. It\u2019s a chilling example, but the truth is he had his pick of illustrations. Summers seemed almost incredulous that the nation isn\u2019t taking a golden opportunity to fix its crumbling infrastructure: \u201cAt a time when we can borrow for way below three percent and construction unemployment is high, why aren\u2019t we building?\u201d\n\nFacilitate Private Infrastructure Investment. Now, what about once you leave the airport? You can make a clearer call on your way from Heathrow to central London or from Astana International to Astana than you can on the way from JFK to Manhattan, Summers quipped. He says that rampant NIMBYism is stifling opportunities for private infrastructure improvements, too\u2014and the economic case is just as strong in the private sector. \u201cWe have huge problems of regulating glacially and promiscuously distributing veto power that stop adequate levels of private investment from driving the economy forward,\u201d he said.\n\nDecide Once and for All on an Overseas Tax Amnesty. For years, policymakers have debated offering American companies a chance to repatriate overseas profits without taxing them. Proponents say it will encourage companies to brings that money home, where it will benefit the U.S., rather than benefiting European or Asian companies. Critics say the costs outweigh the benefits and demand better enforcement. The terms of the debate irk Summers. Either position is defensible, he said, but as long as there is uncertainty, no CEO is going to risk bringing the profits home\u2014what if the government decides later to offer an amnesty? The government needs to choose and makes its choice clear.\n\nGet Over the Debt and Deficit Obsession. \u201cThe deficit may be nil in the future, or it may be much worse. But it\u2019s much easier to roll over debt now, with interest rates low,\u201d he said. Summers castigated politicians for fostering misconceptions about spending. \u201cThey say, it\u2019s really important at a time when households are tightening their belt that government do the same as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong, and the reason it\u2019s just wrong is what economics call the fallacy of composition. What\u2019s true for one isn\u2019t always true for many.\u201d\n\nTo Summers, who\u2019s long been near the center of the Democratic Party, this looks like a plan that should appeal to both parties.\n\n\u201cThe logic here to my mind is pretty compelling. This is not a far left thing; this is not a far right thing,\" he said. \"The notion that it\u2019s better to have highways without potholes versus highways with potholes is not a particularly Democratic or Republican idea. The notion that it\u2019s good to have more oil come from the Dakotas and less from the Middle East is not a particularly partisan-freighted idea.\u201d\n\nSo can it happen? Who knows? But Summers takes heart from the Clinton years, noting that in 1994 and 1995 the president was reduced to insisting he was relevant; within a couple years he had balanced the budget. \u201cI don\u2019t preclude the possibility of positive surprise,\u201d Summers said wryly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don&#39;t get distracted by the deficit: It&#39;s time to start fixing America&#39;s crumbling infrastructure.", "author": "David A.
