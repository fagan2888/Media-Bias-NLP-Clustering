He\u2019s discovering things are a little more complicated than that.\n\nMatt Bevin campaigned on a health-care pledge that would undo the work of his predecessor: to dismantle Kentucky\u2019s popular insurance exchange and change up the even more popular Medicaid expansion. But as the Republican governor\u2019s campaigning morphs into actual governing, he could find that pledge hard to stick to: not only because hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians now have insurance but also because his plans could be costly\u2014and no one seems to know who would pay for all of it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this would save us money,\u201d said the health-care advocate Emily Beauregard, pushing back on Bevin\u2019s claim that his plans would help taxpayers. \u201cI think all evidence points to it costing Kentucky more money.\u201d Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number Throughout his self-funded, outsider campaign, Bevin\u2014who just began his second week in office\u2014had pledged to kill the state exchange, Kynect, and to alter Medicaid expansion. But he has already walked back some of his earlier, hard-line rhetoric: Where he once promised on the trail to entirely roll back the expansion, more recently he has said he would modify it. This leaves health officials and other stakeholders in Kentucky still unsure of what happens next, or whether Bevin will further shift his stance as he plots his agenda for the state. \u201cI\u2019m waiting with bated breath,\u201d said Audrey Tayse Haynes, the former cabinet secretary who spearheaded Kentucky\u2019s health-care changes under the previous governor, \u201clike others are as well.\u201d\n\nKynect and the Medicaid expansion are linked: Kynect provides the infrastructure and outreach through which Kentuckians can sign up for qualified health plans or Medicaid. Bevin\u2019s beef with both programs certainly isn\u2019t founded in their unpopularity. To the contrary, the state\u2019s drop in the number of uninsured residents from 2013 to 2014 was the biggest in the country\u2014a credit, health-care researchers say, to the grassroots, in-person network established through Kynect that helped Kentuckians learn about their health-care options. Bevin\u2019s concerns, rather, focus on what he sees as the two programs\u2019 cost. When asked for specifics about the governor\u2019s plans, his spokeswoman said in a statement that he\u2019s aiming to \u201cimprove health outcomes\u201d and \u201ctake deliberate and prudent steps to develop a health-care plan that Kentucky can afford.\u201d But if Bevin\u2019s aim is to save taxpayers money, health-care advocates in Kentucky say he\u2019s going about it all wrong. In terms of its setup, Kynect is already paid for, and dismantling it comes with its own costs. According to a presentation Kynect\u2019s executive director gave in August, the IT work alone to get rid of its website would take nine months and cost roughly $23 million. The state\u2019s coffers could be on the hook for that cost. Beauregard, executive director of the consumer-advocacy group Kentucky Voices for Health, said even if Kynect is dismantled, the state would still be responsible for managing more than 1 million people on Medicaid, and it would still need the infrastructure in place\u2014including an online enrollment system and employees to help sign up Kentuckians\u2014to do so. And then there\u2019s the Obama administration variable. In her first interview since leaving her post as secretary of Kentucky\u2019s Cabinet for Health and Family Services, Haynes said she\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d what the Bevin administration would replace the current system with. She doesn\u2019t anticipate the federal government agreeing to foot the bill after it has already shelled out roughly $280 million to build Kynect.\n\nKentucky\u2019s rollout of the Affordable Care Act was seen as a victory for President Obama\u2019s signature law. Both were implemented by executive order by the Democratic Governor Steve Beshear. As Jason Bailey, the executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, noted in an interview, Kentucky\u2019s reforms were a national model. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not often that Kentucky is seen as a national leader,\u201d Bailey said. Kentucky\u2019s model status is rooted in Kentuckians\u2019 swift, close-to-seamless enrollment in Medicaid. After the expansion\u2014which allowed Kentuckians making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line to enroll\u2014about 400,000 people signed up. That\u2019s twice as many as state officials had estimated, and it brought the total number of Kentuckians on Medicaid to a quarter of the state\u2019s population. Though the federal government is paying for the expansion through 2016, Kentucky does have to kick in funds after that. But according to a Deloitte study commissioned by Beshear\u2019s administration earlier this year, the expansion will pay off. The New York Times has the details: Kentucky\u2019s cost of covering the new Medicaid enrollees will start at $74 million in 2017 and grow to $363 million by 2021. Like most states, Kentucky already spends more of its budget on Medicaid\u2014about $1.9 billion in the 2014 fiscal year\u2014than almost anything else. But the report found that the expense of covering the new enrollees would be more than offset by the positive economic effects of expanding the program. They include new Medicaid revenue to health care providers\u2014totaling more than $1 billion in 2014 alone, according to the report\u2014and the resulting creation of jobs in health care and other professions. It\u2019s worth noting that Bevin disputes the findings of that study. But to the former Beshear administration, the financials look even more promising when one considers the total amount the state has made from the expansion: According to a report in The Courier-Journal, that\u2019s roughly $3 billion since 2014.\n\nBevin\u2019s stance on Medicaid has shifted considerably since the early campaign. Where he initially said he would totally roll it back, he later said he would simply freeze enrollment. And in recent months, he has suggested he\u2019d like to follow Indiana\u2019s model: asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for waivers to charge enrollees premiums and modify eligibility. He has even anticipated more Kentuckians signing up for Medicaid if cost-sharing is implemented. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a dollar or two dollars,\u201d Bevin said at the last debate before the election. \u201cIf I\u2019m governor, people should have skin in the game.\u201d Bevin has been clearer on his plans for Kynect: He wants it dismantled by the end of next year. And he could do so by executive order, though it\u2019ll take some time: The federal government requires states to give them one year\u2019s notice before dismantling an exchange, so Bevin would have to tell them by January 1, 2016\u2014less than three weeks from now.* Kynect would be the first functioning state exchange to be dismantled. In Bevin\u2019s view, Kynect doesn\u2019t offer anything extra to Kentuckians that they can\u2019t get from the federal government\u2014an unusual stance from a conservative politician, who would typically favor the state\u2019s jurisdiction. It\u2019s also unusual because Bevin campaigned explicitly on the idea that Obamacare doesn\u2019t work in his state, yet he now wants to shift Kentuckians to Healthcare.gov. Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard University health economist who studies the Affordable Care Act, sees the proposed changes to Medicaid, which includes moving non-Medicaid Kynect enrollees to the federal exchange, as the more consequential of the two shifts Bevin has discussed. Sommers thinks that although the more than 100,000 people who\u2019d transition to the federal exchange could experience some very real problems\u2014their coverage could be disrupted, for example, or they could lose the kind of in-person assistance they\u2019re used to\u2014Healthcare.gov has been \u201cpretty effective\u201d at signing people up. Rolling back Medicaid, however, would be much more damaging, Sommers said\u2014a notion Bevin himself may have already grasped, given the recent adjustments to his position. Doing so, said Sommers, would \u201cdepriv[e] \u2026 hundreds of thousands\u201d from coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Matt Bevin campaigned on reversing the work of his Democratic predecessor.
