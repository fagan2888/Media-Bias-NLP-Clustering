This week\u2019s historic hearing on same-sex marriage is both the logical extension and ultimate showdown in a decades-long argument that so far Kennedy has always won.\n\nEach of Kennedy\u2019s bold and lyrical rulings on behalf of gays \u2014 \u201ctimes can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,\u201d he wrote in Lawrence v. Texas \u2014 has been just as reliably followed by a meticulous and fiery denunciation from Scalia.\n\n\u201cThe court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed,\u201d Scalia answered in the Lawrence case.\n\nKennedy has written all of the Supreme Court\u2019s most important decisions on gay rights: protecting the civil rights of homosexuals in Romer v. Evans (1996), abolishing anti-gay sodomy laws in Lawrence (2003) and ruling in United States v. Windsor two years ago that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nEach was a steppingstone to the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration on Tuesday of whether the Constitution forbids states from prohibiting gay couples to marry.\n\nIf the pattern continues and the court renders a landmark ruling favoring gay marriage, it will likely once again be Kennedy whose words memorialize that decision and Scalia who will articulate the dissent.\n\nIt is not a conflict everyone would have predicted for two of Ronald Reagan\u2019s choices for the court. Scalia ascended to the bench in 1986, and Kennedy followed 17 months later. The two, born on opposite coasts in 1936, are consistent comrades on issues important to corporate America and in dismantling campaign finance laws they see restricting political speech.\n\nAfter Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. sided with liberals to declare the Affordable Care Act constitutional, Scalia and Kennedy united with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr. in a jointly written, 65-page dissent mocking the majority opinion and saying the entire act should be found invalid.\n\nKennedy is often the deciding vote when the ideologically divided court splits 5 to 4, but in two-thirds of those cases he sides with the conservatives.\n\nBut if they often arrive at the same conclusion \u2014 one obstacle for same-sex marriage proponents in the current case is Kennedy\u2019s allegiance to states\u2019 rights \u2014 Kennedy and Scalia could not be more different in how they view a judge\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cTheir different approach to gay rights reflects their more fundamental disagreement about how to think about the liberties protected by the Constitution,\u201d said Paul Smith, a Washington lawyer who was on the winning side in the Lawrence case.\n\nScalia believes the only freedoms that should be viewed as protected by the Constitution \u201care those that have been protected under American law throughout our history, defined at the most specific level,\u201d Smith said. Otherwise, the people decide.\n\nKennedy, Smith said, \u201cbelieves that each generation has the right to conceive of newer and broader forms of liberty that merit constitutional protection. He sees history as a guide but not a straitjacket.\u201d\n\nTheir battle is compelling, said Allison Orr Larsen, a William and Mary law professor, because it \u201cbrings to the forefront the theoretical question in constitutional law: How should courts respond to change when interpreting the Constitution?\u201d\n\nMichael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School and a former Kennedy clerk, said his former boss\u2019s decisions on gay rights were not constructed to lead ultimately to a decision on same-sex marriage. But they provided a foundation for how to view new constitutional rights \u201cif that\u2019s where the country moves.\u201d\n\nScalia, on the other hand, champions the cause of originalism, and Edward Whelan, a former Scalia clerk and president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said his former boss learned quickly that \u201cKennedy\u2019s judicial approach was not anything close to what Scalia\u2019s is.\u201d\n\n\u201cA basic tenet of originalism is that it\u2019s not the role of judges to impose their own moral philosophies,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cScalia understands the Constitution to leave the vast bulk of policy issues to the democratic processes and rejects the notion that it\u2019s his role to read his own views into the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering the differences among President Reagan\u2019s choices for the Supreme Court.\n\nHe fulfilled his campaign pledge to name a woman to the bench with Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the pragmatic Arizona politician and judge who quickly became the court\u2019s center.\n\nScalia\u2019s selection was celebrated by conservatives eager to see a new method of constitutional interpretation forcefully advocated on the court.\n\nKennedy was a compromise, Reagan\u2019s third choice for the seat he once hoped would be filled by conservative Robert Bork, whose nomination was defeated in the Senate. \u201cThis was the Bork seat,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThings could have been much different.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s views, Dorf said, were those of a \u201cmoderate California Republican.\u201d\n\nAlthough he never ruled for gay rights as a lower court judge, Kennedy expressed concern about the policy even as he upheld the military\u2019s right to dismiss gay servicemen. And Frank Colucci, a political science professor at Purdue University who has written a book about Kennedy\u2019s jurisprudence, recalled that Kennedy in a speech criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick that upheld a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy.\n\n\u201cHe came about as close as you can as a lower court judge to saying it was wrongly decided,\u201d Colucci said.\n\nOnce on the court, Kennedy was able to say just that.\n\nIn the first gay rights case, Romer, Kennedy wrote for the majority in striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment. After some cities in the state began passing laws protecting gays from discrimination in housing, employment and other areas, voters through a referendum approved the amendment precluding such government protections.\n\nColorado\u2019s amendment, Kennedy wrote, \u201cclassifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.\u201d\n\nThat began something of a call-and-response on the issue: Kennedy delivering the majority\u2019s opinion, Scalia replying with a scalding dissent, read from the bench for emphasis.\n\n\u201cThis court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members of this institution are selected, pronouncing that \u2018animosity\u2019 toward homosexuality is evil,\u201d Scalia wrote in Romer. \u201cI vigorously dissent.\u201d\n\nIn Lawrence, Kennedy got the chance to reverse the court\u2019s decision on sodomy, and did: \u201cBowers was not correct when it was decided and it is not correct today.\u201d Private, homosexual conduct between consenting adults, he wrote, \u201cinvolves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor wrote a concurring opinion to say the ruling did not touch on the matter of whether gays would be able to marry.\n\nScalia\u2019s response: \u201cDo not believe it.\u201d\n\nScalia wrote that homosexuals should be free to promote their cause through democratic means, but \u201cmany Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children\u2019s schools, or as boarders in their home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court views it as \u2018discrimination.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTwo years ago, in Windsor, Kennedy wrote that the federal government\u2019s refusal to offer the same government benefits available to heterosexual couples to legally married gay couples tells \u201call the world that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy\u201d and \u201chumiliates\u201d their children.\n\nAgain, Scalia blasted the decision, saying the majority was merely being coy in saying the decision did not address whether states are required to give licenses to same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cBy formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMost federal courts have taken Scalia literally.\n\n\u201cThe court agrees with Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of Windsor,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby of Salt Lake City.\n\nShelby\u2019s decision to strike a marriage ban in Utah was the first such decision following Windsor and began the path that continues to Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, and will end with the court\u2019s decision in June.\n\n\u00a9 2015, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's historic hearing on same-sex marriage is both the logical extension and ultimate showdown in a
