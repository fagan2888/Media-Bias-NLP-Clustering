Nevertheless, we have been forced into the spotlight over our position regarding a regulation issued under the Affordable Care Act, namely that we provide health insurance coverage for birth control,\u201d wrote Sister Constance.\n\n\u201cOur goal with this case is to have the freedom to follow our conscience in what we do and offer.\u201d\n\nThe Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) has also filed a legal challenge to the HHS mandate. The Register is a service of EWTN.\n\nFew legal experts are ready to predict the outcome of the high-stakes case, especially now that Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s unexpected death in February has shifted the balance of power on an ideologically divided court.\n\nBack at St. Anne\u2019s Home, however, the Little Sisters keep their worries and questions to themselves, as the daily routine continues undisturbed.\n\nStations of the Cross\n\nIt is Lent, and a group of residents and sisters gather in the gleaming chapel for Stations of the Cross. The time set aside for hushed community prayer highlights the distinctive spirit of this religious order, which has incorporated modern nursing techniques while staying true to St. Jeanne Jugan\u2019s original vision for end-of-life care for human beings who can be cast aside by relatives and society.\n\n\u201cWe want to live our life in a way that, should Jeanne Jugan come through the door today, she would recognize this facility, and say, \u2018This is my home,\u2019\u201d Little Sister Theresa Robertson, the mother superior, told the Register last week, during a visit to St. Anne\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWould she see that the sisters and the staff love the residents? Would she see that everything she cared about \u2014 treating residents with dignity and respect \u2014 is here?\n\n\u201cI ask God to give us the grace so we always follow the footsteps of Jeanne Jugan.\u201d\n\nLike many Little Sisters, Mother Theresa is also a trained nurse, who has worked in several of the order\u2019s 27 homes in the United States. And just as St. Jeanne invited the elderly poor into her own home, so the sisters continue to provide a homelike environment, aided by multidisciplinary teams that help residents and their families navigate the medical, emotional and spiritual issues that arise during the end of each person\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cOne of the Little Sisters\u2019 greatest joys and privileges is to accompany the dying,\u201d Mother Theresa said.\n\nJoy-Filled Moments\n\nThe Little Sisters treasure the joy-filled moments that come when a resident returns to his or her cradle Catholic faith or a troubled family experiences healing at the bedside of a dying parent.\n\n\u201cWhen families have severed relationships, a great consolation for parents is to see how God has offered time to reunify,\u201d said Mother Theresa.\n\nThe sisters actively work to provide a place of peace and trust where healing and forgiveness can take root.\n\nThe children of residents are assured that their parents will always be accompanied by a Little Sister, whether they make a late-night visit to a hospital emergency room or face imminent death.\n\nIn the state of California, where physician-assisted suicide is now legal, the Little Sisters offer added assurance that the poorest and most vulnerable men and women in their charge will be protected until natural death. And those who are Catholic know they can take part in daily Mass and receive the anointing of the sick.\n\n\u201cWe protect and enhance the dignity of life to its natural end,\u201d Little Sister Dara Vishnefske told the Register. \u201cIt goes on to that last breath, and we let God do the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never leave them alone, and take three-hour shifts to accompany them,\u201d explained Sister Dara.\n\n\u201cFor the residents, it is the climax of their life, and they know they don\u2019t have to go there alone. \u201c\n\nWhile she was still a postulant, Sister Dara was asked to stay with a resident who was in a coma.\n\n\u201cHe was a fervent Catholic, with seven or eight children, who had mostly left the faith,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cSome had been estranged for years, yet they all came from across the country to be there. We found hymns that we could all sing together because he loved music.\u201d\n\nYears later, she is still deeply stirred by the time she shared with that wounded family.\n\n\u201cTo see the healing of an estrangement was a powerful grace. I witnessed God\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\nSt. Anne\u2019s Home\n\nEstablished before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, St. Anne\u2019s Home remains a special place, and in local Catholic circles, it is reported to have a long waiting list.\n\nSt. Anne\u2019s is also the only Catholic nursing facility in the city \u2014 a troubling fact that underscores the potential consequences for its residents and others who hope to enter, should the Little Sisters fail to prevail at the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring a telephone interview with the Register, Sister Constance acknowledged that if the order loses its case, it faces the \u201cprospect of paying fines that would total $70 million a year across our U.S. homes. It is an impossible sum of money: We depend on donations from the community to cover 50% of our operating costs.\u201d\n\nCourt Date\n\nSister Constance will be in court when the order\u2019s advocate, Paul Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general for the George W. Bush administration, makes the case for an exemption for the order and other religious nonprofits that object to the contraceptive mandate.\n\nOutside the court house, she said, members of the order will join other women religious and lay Catholic women at a rally organized by Women Speak for Themselves. Led by the pro-life law professor Helen Alvare, Women Speak for Themselves will also sponsor on March National Day of Service on March 23 that will encourage supporters to take part in service opportunities at the Little Sisters' homes across the country.\n\nAt St. Anne\u2019s, the sisters continueto ponder the unfolding events in the nation\u2019s capital and the deeper cultural forces that have pushed their order into the spotlight.\n\nAmericans \u201cpride ourselves on being the\u2019 land of the free\u2019 and the \u2018home of the brave,\u2019\u201d said Sister Dara.\n\n\u201cHowever, most of us don\u2019t seem to realize what freedom is. Are we all talking about the same thing? For some of the young, freedom means \u2018to do what I want,\u2019\u201d she added, a hint of worry in her voice. The Little Sisters have no contingency plan, should they fail to receive a reprieve from the court.\n\nYet, just as the Little Sisters routinely visit food markets for donations, trusting that they will receive what is needed to feed their charges, so Sister Dara approaches the unpredictable outcome of their legal case with equal confidence that God will provide.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing God\u2019s providence every day,\u201d said Sister Dara, \u201cso why would we doubt it now?\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the high court gets set to hear oral arguments in the religious congregation\u2019s\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "While the high court gets set to hear oral arguments in the religious congregation\u2019s religious-freedom case, a visit to the order's San...", "title": "Little Sisters to Big Brother: \u2018We Must Obey God, Not Man\u2019", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/little-sisters-to-big-brother-we-must-obey-god-not-man/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/rsz_lsp-sanfran_22_of_35.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/little-sisters-to-big-brother-we-must-obey-god-not-man/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/rsz_lsp-sanfran_22_of_35.jpg", "description": "While the high court gets set to hear oral arguments in the religious congregation\u2019s religious-freedom case, a visit to the order's San...", "card": "summary", "title": "Little Sisters to Big Brother: \u2018We Must Obey God, Not Man\u2019"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, contraceptive mandate, hhs mandate, little sisters of the poor, religious freedom", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "\u201cOver our 175-year history, my charity, the Little Sisters of the Poor, has been focused on service, not advocacy or policy.\nThe Little Sisters have no contingency plan, should they fail to receive a reprieve from the court.\n\u201cOne of the Little Sisters\u2019 greatest joys and privileges is to accompany the dying,\u201d Mother Theresa said.\n\u201cWe protect and enhance the dignity of life to its natural end,\u201d Little Sister Dara Vishnefske told the Register.\nBack at St. Anne\u2019s Home, however, the Little Sisters keep their worries and questions to themselves, as the daily routine continues undisturbed."}
