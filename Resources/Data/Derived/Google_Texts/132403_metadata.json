Pelosi, an early and enthusiastic champion of the agreement, spent much of the August recess shoring up that support to ensure the Democrats could sustain a presidential veto of the Republicans' resolution to sink the deal \u2014 an effort Hammill helped to orchestrate.\n\nIt's not the only shake-up in Pelosi's office this month. Jerry Hartz, Pelosi's director of floor operations, left Capitol Hill on Friday to take a position with the National Democratic Institute. Hartz had been a House staffer for 28 years, almost 14 of which were on Pelosi's floor team.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Drew Hammill served as her chief spokesman.", "description": "Drew Hammill served as her chief spokesman.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mike Lillis", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Drew Hammill served as her chief spokesman.", "title": "Pelosi names new deputy chief of staff", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/253663-pelosi-names-new-deputy-chief-of-staff", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nancypelosi_071615fr.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/253663-pelosi-names-new-deputy-chief-of-staff", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-15T10:54-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T10:54:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/253663-pelosi-names-new-deputy-chief-of-staff", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Drew Hammill served as her chief spokesman.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pelosi names new deputy chief of staff"}, "dcterms.title": "Pelosi names new deputy chief of staff"}, "article_summary": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday tapped her chief spokesman to be her new deputy chief of staff.\nDrew Hammill, communications director and veteran spokesman for the Democratic leader, assumes the new role with a focus on the Democrats' messaging strategy, Pelosi announced.\n\u201cDrew Hammill has played an integral role in honing and executing House Democrats\u2019 message for nearly a decade,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\nHammill, who has been with Pelosi since 2006, will also continue his position atop the communications team.\nHartz had been a House staffer for 28 years, almost 14 of which were on Pelosi's floor team."}
