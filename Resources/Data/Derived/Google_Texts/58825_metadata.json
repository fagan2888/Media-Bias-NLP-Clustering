The social service agency, which touted its Navigator status Monday in a press conference at the Arab American National Museum, received a grant of nearly $277,000. The other three groups are Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, Community Bridges Management Inc. and American Indian Health and Family Services of SE Michigan Inc.Though ACCESS is formerly known as the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, it works with people from all walks of life.

The enrollment period runs through March 31, 2014.Those who don\u2019t already have health insurance, are eligible for the Affordable Care Act and don\u2019t sign up are subject to varying fines. Those who enroll must be U.S. citizens or be in the U.S. lawfully, and not be incarcerated.Trained staff members can enroll people in the Marketplace free at ACCESS\u2019 facilities in Dearborn, Ferndale and Sterling Heights. The agency also might have sign-up sessions at hotels, depending on demand.Those enrolling can begin the process by filling out a form at www.accesshealthcaremichigan.org or calling 1-888-670-6798 for an appointment.ACCESS can\u2019t solicit enrollees, which is why it\u2019s working with the group Enroll America, which can. The group, which launched June 22, is going door to door, running telephone banks and visiting community centers and community events to get the word out, said Shawn Dhanak, Enroll America\u2019s communications lead in Michigan.As of Monday, ACCESS already had appointments set for first-thing Tuesday.
