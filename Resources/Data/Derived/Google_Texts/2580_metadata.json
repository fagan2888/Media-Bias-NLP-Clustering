This task force is not going to meet for six years. \u2026 So this is a matter of utmost urgency.\u201d\n\nHeroin has overtaken cocaine as the deadliest street drug in Orange County. This past weekend alone, the Orange County deputies responded to 11 calls for suspected heroin overdoses. In the last week, there have been three deaths.\n\nIn fact, during Monday's news conference, Orange County law enforcement officers were responding to a suspected overdose near Orange Blossom Trail.\n\n\u201cI would be kidding myself if I thought that we could totally solve this simply by an enforcement strategy,\u201d said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. \u201cIt has to have the awareness and prevention and intervention and treatment modes as well.\u201d\n\nOrlando timeshare magnate David Siegel is turning his considerable influence and fortune toward drug overdoses.
