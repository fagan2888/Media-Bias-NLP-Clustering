CMS and state Medicaid agencies may block payments to large swaths of providers in one fell swoop, which happened in the nation\u2019s capital this spring, and impose suspensions on a variety of services and care providers.\n\n\u201cIf someone learns they are under investigation, they need to be prepared for the possibility \u2014 moving up to the probability \u2014 for payment suspension, especially on the Medicaid side,\u201d says San Francisco attorney Judy Waltz, with Foley & Lardner LLP.\n\nSec. 6402(h) of the Affordable Care Act requires the suspension of Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to a provider when there is a credible allegation of fraud unless there is \u201cgood cause not to suspend payments.\u201d Suspension of payments means shutting down some or all of a provider\u2019s Medicare cash flow while the allegation is investigated. The money is put in a suspense account \u2014 akin to escrow \u2014 and released to the provider only if a case is not pursued and there\u2019s no determination of an overpayment, Waltz says. Although Medicare payment suspensions max out at 18 months and can\u2019t last longer than six unless there are special circumstances (i.e., OIG or DOJ requests it), states decide for themselves how long Medicaid payment suspensions will last, Waltz says.\n\nAs defined in 2011 CMS interim final regulations, a \u201ccredible allegation of fraud\u201d includes an allegation from patterns identified by audits, civil false claims cases, law enforcement investigations, hotlines and claims data mining, Waltz says. \u201cAllegations are considered to be credible when they have indicia of reliability,\u201d the regulations state (42 CFR Sec. 405.370 for Medicare and 42 CFR Sec. 455.2 for Medicaid). CMS and states can skip payment suspensions for credible allegations of fraud if there is good cause (e.g., it would hinder beneficiary access or alert the target of an investigation). \u201cA credible allegation is a much lower standard than what used to be required for payment suspensions,\u201d she notes.\n\nThere\u2019s more discretion on the Medicare side in terms of whether to suspend a provider\u2019s payments, Waltz says. But states must wield this axe unless they can meet a good-cause exception. If CMS thinks the state had grounds to suspend a provider\u2019s payments but failed to act, the state loses the federal share of Medicaid for the services that are in the vortex of a credible allegation of fraud, Waltz says.\n\nAtlanta attorney Sara Kay Wheeler also sees more payment suspensions based on credible allegations of fraud, which can stem from a Medicare administrative contractor, zone program integrity contractor or other audit or investigation. \u201cWe have seen an increase in cases where payment suspensions are at issue,\u201d says Wheeler, who is with King & Spalding.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing stopping Medicare or Medicaid from suspending payments for a type of service \u2014 joint replacements or cardiac surgery, for example \u2014 rather than all payments to a provider based on a credible allegation of fraud, Waltz says, although she doesn\u2019t know of any cases like this yet.\n\nMass Payment Suspensions Are a New Tactic\n\nBut she noted that one new enforcement technique is mass payment suspensions of unrelated providers based on credible allegations of fraud. In Washington, D.C., for example, the Medicaid agency recently suspended payments to 52% of the city\u2019s home health agencies (HHAs) for personal care aid services. Although Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on April 9 granted a temporary restraining order to stop the payment suspension, she later refused to grant permanent injunctive relief after considering the case in more depth. That left the payment suspensions in place, although two HHAs got their payment suspensions lifted and are back in Medicaid while six HHAs face Medicaid termination.\n\nA sweeping payment suspension is eye-opening. \u201cThis is such a huge number of providers,\u201d Waltz says. \u201cIt is not clear how much differentiation the government can make between providers when these credible fraud allegations are evaluated. Some may be decent providers, some may not.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Medicaid agency, the Department of Health Care Finance, suspended payments without notice to Premier Health Services, ABA Inc., Health Management Inc., Immaculate Health Care Services and other agencies based on credible allegations of fraud. The Medicaid agency alleges the HHAs \u201crepeatedly billed and [were] reimbursed for PCA services that were not supported by the documentation,\u201d the court decision states. While plans were made to transfer patients to other providers, the HHAs were required to continue providing services to Medicaid enrollees. After four weeks, the HHAs sued to force the city to pay them before they went broke, and for breach of contract, violation of their due process rights and other alleged wrongdoing. At an April 9 hearing, the HHAs persuaded the judge there was a good chance they would win their case, so she ordered the Medicaid agency to pay them retroactively and keep the money flowing. For their part, the HHAs had to keep providing personal care aide services because \u201cthere was an insufficient number of home health care providers in the District of Columbia to which to transfer Plaintiffs\u2019 patients.\u201d\n\nBut after the judge reviewed more court filings, she concluded the HHAs probably wouldn\u2019t prevail. For one thing, the judge wrote that \u201cin contrast to a provider\u2019s right to participate in the Medicaid program, there is no constitutional right to receive Medicaid payments.\u201d Also, the Medicaid agency apparently acquired enough capacity to transfer the plaintiffs\u2019 patients to other providers so the HHAs don\u2019t have to keep treating them for free. And the judge wasn\u2019t persuaded the payment suspension would force the HHAs out of business because Medicaid pays them for other services, the May 9 decision states.\n\nFinally, the HHAs should exhaust administrative remedies before seeking relief from the federal courts, the judge said. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust administrative remedies is yet another reason why they have not shown a likelihood of success here.\u201d\n\nA Mixed Outcome for HHAs\n\nUltimately, the outcome for the HHAs was mixed. Washington, D.C., attorney Brad Johnson, who represents Premier, said for his client, \u201cthe District of Columbia has not disclosed any evidence of fraud and the suspension has been withdrawn.\u201d After failing to get injunctive relief, Premier appealed the payment suspension to the Medicaid Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). But the two sides worked it out, and everything is back to normal for Premier, which withdrew its appeal, Johnson says. Meanwhile, the Medicaid agency is terminating some of the HHAs, including ABA and Nursing Unlimited Services, from Medicaid. Their attorney, Reggie Richter, says he is appealing the terminations to OAH and once he files the paperwork, the terminations will be stayed pending a hearing. Richter is concerned that providers face payment suspension based on credible allegations of fraud they are not privy to. \u201cI have reviewed what has happened in other states, and I think a problematic aspect of the law is you don\u2019t have the opportunity to basic due process,\u201d Richter says. \u201cThe government should not be able to make these claims without putting up the evidence against them.\u201d Meanwhile, he notes that KBC also got its payment suspension reversed and Immaculate and Health Management are allowed to provide Medicaid personal care aide services but their payment suspensions stand.\n\nCMS has also suspended payments en masse. In cooperation with an HHS-DOJ Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), CMS suspended the payments of 78 Dallas area HHAs, Waltz says. Last year\u2019s Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control program report says 297 providers are under \u201cactive suspension\u201d from Medicare in fiscal year 2013 and 105 more suspensions were approved that year.\n\n\u201cPayment suspension is a powerful weapon,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cBy the time the time period runs out, you could be out of money,\u201d especially if Medicare or Medicaid is one of your main payers.\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
