Lawmakers that want to repeal the Affordable Care Act were in for a tongue lashing by Bernie Sanders who called the proposed bill a "waste of time" while saying that the repeal package was an example of "how far removed the Republicans here in Congress are from the realities of American life and the needs of American people," reports UPI.

"What this legislation does is move us in exactly the wrong direction. The bill we are debating today is a complete waste of time. ... We have a health care crisis and this bill makes the crisis much worse," Sanders said of the reconciliation bill which is unlikely to become law as President Barack Obama is guaranteed to veto the measure, according to The Hill.

"When you throw 17 million people off health insurance, people will die because they don't go to a doctor when they should, they don't get into the hospital when they should," Sanders said, according to Steelers Lounge.

"It is also my sincere hope that people throughout this country, including my colleagues here in the Senate and across the Capitol in the House, understand that bitter vitriolic rhetoric can have serious, unintended consequences," Sanders said when asking Republicans to end the "witch hunt" against Planned Parenthood, reports The Hill.
