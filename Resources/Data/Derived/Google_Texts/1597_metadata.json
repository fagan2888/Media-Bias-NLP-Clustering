The Dow fell more than 100 points, and the S&P 500 lost 11 points. Those aren\u2019t harrowing losses by any stretch of the imagination, but they do illustrate that the markets, after rocketing higher for the better part of two months, are finding it hard to keep the rally going.\n\nThe Dow was down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite was virtually flat, down just 0.05%, but the Dow Transports lost 1.2% on the session.\n\nThis morning\u2019s data was mixed. Weekly jobless claims came in at a 43-year low, auguring well for the monthly payrolls report. But two reports on the economy from regional Fed banks highlighted just how recalcitrant the economy remains. The Philadelphia Fed\u2019s business index fell back into negative territory \u2013 the seven time in the last six months it\u2019s been there \u2013 and the Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity Index edged a bit deeper into negative territory.\n\nFirst-quarter GDP gets released in one week. Another weak quarter is expected. The WSJ survey of economists projects a 1.3% growth rate. The New York Fed sees it at 0.7%, and the Atlanta Fed has it at 0.3%.\n\nAfter the bell, both Alphabet and Microsoft reported earnings. Both missed consensus estimates, and both were down in late trading.\n\nCOMING UP\n\nData Front: PMI manufacturing index flash (9:45 a.m. ET), Baker-Hughes rig count (1:00 p.m.)\n\nEarnings: Caterpillar, General Electric, Honeywell, Interpublic, Kimberly-Clark, McDonalds, SunTrust.\n\nInternational: Japan, tertiary index (1:30 a.m. ET); France, PMI composite index flash (3:00); Germany, PMI composite flash (3:30); EMU, PMI composite flash (4:00); Italy, retail sales (5:00); Canada, consumer prices and retail sales (8:30).\n\nMONEYBEAT PODCAST\n\nTribune Media CEO Peter Liguori sits down with Paul Vigna and Stephen Grocer to discuss the changing business of television media, transforming WGN America into a viable broadcasting network, its new show \u201cUnderground,\u201d and the importance of banking on quality.\n\nMUST READS\n\nECB Leaves Door Open for Further Interest-Rate Cuts The European Central Bank stands ready to use \u201call instruments available,\u201d including further cuts in all its interest rates, to ensure the inflation rate returns to its target, ECB President Mario Draghi said Thursday.\n\nSunEdison Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection Solar-energy company SunEdison Inc. on Thursday said it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a dramatic move for a company whose market value stood at nearly $10 billion in July.\n\nRegulators Propose New Rules on Wall Street Pay U.S. regulators proposed requiring the nation\u2019s largest banks and financial firms to hold back executives\u2019 bonus pay for four years, extending by a year the common industry practice on Wall Street incentive payouts.\n\nVolkswagen Reaches Deal Over Emissions Scandal U.S. owners of nearly 500,000 Volkswagen AG 2-liter diesel vehicles equipped with devices meant to trick emissions tests could see \u201csubstantial\u201d payments and a buyback under a coming court settlement.\n\nMusician Prince Dead at 57 Prince, the singer, songwriter and master performer who blazed an innovative and fiercely independent path through the music world, establishing himself as both a global star and a defiant outsider in his own industry, died Thursday.\n\nAckman\u2019s Fund Jumps in April After a terrible start to the year, Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square is up big in April.
