School employees who wanted such products would have to pay for them themselves.\n\nHHS, which is enforcing the rule as part of the Affordable Care Act, argues that all the contraception products are federally approved, and women employees should be permitted to determine what is right for them.\n\nAlso, churches, religious orders and companies with fewer than 50 employees are already exempted from the mandate, HHS says. In addition, it has encouraged nonprofits to use a third party to handle payments for contraceptives if they object to covering it directly.\n\nThe two universities and seminary do not accept the HHS alternative plan, and say they should receive relief under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which tells government not to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d the exercise of religion in their activities.\n\nIn December 2013, a federal court in Texas sided with the schools, but in June, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them.\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and former Solicitor General Paul Clement promptly asked the high court to review their case, East Texas Baptist University v. HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nKelly Shackelford, president and chief executive of Liberty Institute said Monday that six ministries that are part of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Foundation filed briefs in support of the East Texas Baptist University petitioners.\n\n\u201cThe government is giving these ministries two options: violate their faith or pay a hefty fine,\u201d said Mr. Shackelford.\n\nBut the government \u201chas no right to tell a ministry that they must participate in what they see as the ending of a human life, in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Liberty Institute, the six organizations include four retirement homes; Simpson University in Redding, Calif.; and Crown College in Saint Bonifacius, Minn.\n\nAccording to the Becket Fund, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, and 181-member Council of Christian College and Universities filed amici briefs in support of their side.\n\nThe 16 states filing in support of the schools are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, a Becket Fund official told Fox News.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Numerous religious institutions and 16 states filed briefs with the Supreme Court on Monday, urging it to take up the case of a seminary and two religious universities that do not want to cover abortion-causing products in their employee health insurance.", "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Numerous religious institutions and 16 states filed briefs with the Supreme Court on Monday, urging it to take up the case of a seminary and two religious universities that do not want to cover abortion-causing products in their employee health insurance.", "title": "States, religious groups, colleges, retirement homes file Supreme Court briefs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/10/states-religious-groups-colleges-retirement-homes-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/898d164b6a7684237e0f6a706700b3d0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/898d164b6a7684237e0f6a706700b3d0.jpg", "title": "States, religious groups, colleges, retirement homes file Supreme Cour", "description": "Numerous religious institutions and 16 states filed briefs with the Supreme Court on Monday, urging it to take up the case of a seminary and two religious universities that do not want to cover aborti", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Education, Department Of Health And Human Services, East Texas Baptist University"}, "article_summary": "In December 2013, a federal court in Texas sided with the schools, but in June, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them.\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and former Solicitor General Paul Clement promptly asked the high court to review their case, East Texas Baptist University v.
