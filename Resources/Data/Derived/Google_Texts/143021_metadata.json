Did they not learn anything from Todd Akin?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for Republican men to stop talking about women\u2019s bodies and choices. It just doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nLast week, the Republican former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee said this at the annual meeting of the Republican National Committee:\n\nDemocrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing or them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.\n\nNever mind the fact that the birth control mandate under Obamacare doesn\u2019t involve government giving women anything but simply requiring that private insurance companies include access to birth control as part of their coverage. That women pay for. Privately. Never mind the obviously offensive dog-whistle-esque racialized characterization of our federal government, currently headed by a black President, as \u201cUncle Sugar.\u201d And for the sake of argument, never mind the oversimplification of the \u201cWar on Women,\u201d which in reality is as much about Republicans attacking reproductive justice as attacking paid family leave and refusing to raise the minimum wage and downplaying rape and plenty more.\n\nFrom a very simple, Politics-101 kinda level, here\u2019s a pro-tip: If you\u2019re talking about birth control as the thing women need if they can\u2019t control their own libido, you\u2019re losing. In fact, if you\u2019re using the words \u201clibido\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d in the same sentence in 2014, you\u2019re losing.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Alexandra Petri had the best line on this:\n\nThe GOP will have a much easier time talking to women once they realize that women can HEAR them.\n\nUh, yeah. This was so bad that even prominent conservative women took to Twitter to denounce what Gov. Huckabee said. For instance, Michelle Fields tweeted:\n\n\u201cRead the full Huckabee quote. Not as bad as originally reported, but some GOP men should really just stop talking about women\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\nAnd I know, RTs are not endorsements and all, but conservative blogger and activist Melissa Clouthier shared this gem from fellow conservative Dan Riehl:\n\nHuckabee is entitled to have what he said reported accurately. But he\u2019s still a tone deaf asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good sign when you\u2019re even turning off the fervent conservative women in your own party. Not to mention the 80 percent of women in America who have had sex and used the birth control pill.\n\nDid y\u2019all learn anything from Todd Akin?\n\n\n\nRand Paul certainly didn\u2019t. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union this past Sunday, the Republican Senator from Kentucky characterized \u201cthe whole thing of the \u2018war on women\u2019\u201d as basically a joke. He went on to say that \u201csome of the victimology and all of this other stuff is trumped up.\u201d By which he meant the \u201cvictimology\u201d of women saying their rights are under attack by the Republican Party\u2014but again, accusing women of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d ain\u2019t a savvy move.\n\nAlso, Sen. Paul insisted that if there is a war on women, \u201cwomen are winning it.\u201d Women have made great strides, he argued, for instance now comprising more than half of the students at medical and law schools. Yeah, Senator, and yet according to a study from Duke University (your alma matter) women doctors still earn on average $12,194 per year less than their male counterparts, even when all other factors are the same. And according to a report by the American Bar Association, at the nation\u2019s 200 top law firms, women partners earned just 89 percent of what their male counterparts earned. One might think that a man potentially aspiring to be president and clearly aspiring to court women voters would be aware of and highlighting these alarming inequities, not dismissing them.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

The party has actually launched training institutes to teach its (male) candidates how to talk to women voters and how to run against women candidates. I mean, asking for help is the first step but \u2026 when you have to get help to learn how to non-offensively talk to 53 percent of the electorate, that\u2019s a bad sign. Part of the problem of course, is the men Republicans are running for office, from Todd \u201clegitimate rape\u201d Akin to Ken \u201ctrans-vaginal ultrasound\u201d Cuccinnelli and more. Part of the problem is how those men and conservatives in general heap sexism-laden attacks on women Democrats running for office. Last week, after Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis posted a strong fundraising report , Republicans suddenly accused Davis of not \u201cputting herself through law school\u201d (as she has said in the past) because she had help from her supportive then-husband. Dissecting the unbelievable double-standards being hurled Davis\u2019 way by conservatives, The Daily Beast\u2019s Kirsten Powers rightly notes that no man would ever face the same scrutiny. When\u2019s the last time a male politician was attacked for having the support of a stay-at-home wife? Women of all political strips are rightfully repulsed by the rank sexism with which conservatives are attacking Wendy Davis.\n\nWhich goes to the larger issue of tone. It\u2019s one (incredibly preposterous and antiquated) thing when Republicans attack contraception and other basic gender-equity provisions in Obamacare. It\u2019s another when they implicitly and explicitly condemn women who use contraception as out-of-control sluts . It\u2019s one thing when Republicans try to ban abortion no matter what, and entirely something else when they tell women that having their rapist\u2019s baby is a \u201credemptive part of this suffering\u201d as anti-abortion activist Lila Rose recently argued with me on CNN\u2019s Crossfire . It\u2019s one thing when Republicans try oppose establishing universal pre-K and preserving income supports for poor families and guaranteeing all workers paid family leave and raising the minimum wage\u2014all of which would disproportionately help women workers. It\u2019s another thing when Republicans blindly insist that women, who are disproportionately more likely to be poor than men in America, are somehow magically winning the economic war.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "sallykohn"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201401271800, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul think women have out-of-control \u201clibidos\u201d and like playing the victim.
