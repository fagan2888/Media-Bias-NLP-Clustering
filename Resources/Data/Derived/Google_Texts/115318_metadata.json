The problem is often referred to as \"entrepreneur lock.\"\n\n\"Entrepreneur lock has proven to be a significant barrier to potential entrepreneurs,\" Dane Stangler, vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, told NPR.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, it is much easier for these potential entrepreneurs to get coverage after leaving their jobs, NPR reports. \"To the extent that the Affordable Care Act unlocks that job lock--that entrepreneur lock--one effect is to provide a boost to entrepreneurship overall,\" Stangler said.\n\nIn fact, Craig Garthwaite, professor of management and strategy at the Kellogg School of Management, estimated that implementation of the act could lead 500,000 to 900,000 people to leave the labor market. Additionally, Stangler estimated that the Affordable Care Act could create roughly 25,000 new businesses per year.
