Boys and girls benefited from a Sunday of bowling in Wichita.

The annual 'Bowl for Kid's Sake' event raises thousands of dollars for the 'Big Brothers Big Sisters' program.

The non-profit agency provides mentors for young people across our area.

Bowl For Kids’ Sake is Big Brothers Big Sisters’ signature fundraiser. Each year half a million people across America come together to have fun and raise money to support Big Brothers Big Sisters.

But you don't have to bowl to support the program.
