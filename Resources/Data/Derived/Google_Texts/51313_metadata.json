They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n\nTrump has since clarified numerous times his comments were in reference to illegal aliens crossing into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\n\u201cI accept the 80 percent number, but I\u2019ve heard testimony that goes higher than that,\u201d Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, told WND. \u201cIt might be that gangs are now starting to recruit children that are born to illegals.\n\nAnn Coulter takes apart the arguments from advocates for amnesty and illegal aliens, in \u201cAdios, America,\u201d and in the course of her work reveals that Democrats always have thought of immigration reform as a way to stuff the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThat might account for some of the remaining 20 percent,\u201d he said, noting it could get worse.\n\n\u201cYou turn over another generation of this and you won\u2019t be able to characterize them as illegals anymore. They will be anchor babies.\u201d\n\nMichele Bachmann, a former member of Congress, added, \u201cWith every news cycle, Donald Trump is being proven right about problems associated with illegal aliens. The Dem/GOP ruling class in D.C. is petrified their false claim that massive Third-World immigration is good for America is unraveling.\n\n\u201cThe ruling class should be worried, and their handmaidens in the media, because the American people are sick of watching our glorious nation be destroyed and they are longing for a true champion to fight for American greatness and sovereignty.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cTrump just might pull this off!\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s latest National Gang Report extensively documents criminal gangs, some comprised in large part of illegal aliens, are indeed importing drugs and committing a high percentage of violent crimes throughout the U.S.\n\nOne section of the 79-page report details \u201cGangs and the U.S. Border.\u201d It documents gangs, \u201cespecially national-level Hispanic gangs, such as MS-13, the Eme, Sure\u00f1os, and TB, continue to pose a significant threat to the Southwest border region.\u201d\n\nThe report reveals that \u201cin many cases, gang members who commit criminal activity in the region are not U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents.\u201d\n\nThe FBI documented that surveys conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection indicate in some southwest border sectors \u201cthe percentage of non-U.S. citizen gang members was as high as 80 percent.\u201d\n\nThe report states that once deported, gang members have been documented as repeatedly attempting to re-enter U.S. illegally \u201cin order to re-join the gang and engage in criminal activity.\u201d\n\nThe FBI statistics show gangs \u201cexploit opportunities along the nearly 2,000 miles of contiguous U.S.-Mexico territory\u201d to engage in a multitude of crimes, \u201cincluding drug-related crimes, weapons trafficking, alien smuggling, human trafficking, prostitution, extortion, robbery, auto theft, assault, homicide, racketeering, and money laundering.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf these offenses, drug-related crimes \u2013 such as production, smuggling, trafficking, and distribution \u2013 are the most widely reported criminal acts committed by gangs of all types,\u201d according to the 2013 report.\n\nThe report relates gangs are establishing and maintaining \u201cmutually beneficial relationships\u201d with international crime syndicates, including Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations.\n\nThese cross-border relationships, the FBI warned, \u201cincrease profits for gangs through drug distribution, drug transportation, and the commission of violent crimes to enforce drug payment and protect drug transportation corridors from rival usage.\u201d\n\nFirearms proliferation; military weaponry\n\nPerhaps just as alarming is the section on \u201cweapons and explosives\u201d which notes the massive proliferation of firearms among illegal gangs, revealing gangs are in possession of vast quantities of \u201chandguns, rifles, both semi and fully automatic, shotguns, and in some instances, machine guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cGang members use these weapons in violent encounters with rival gang members, law enforcement officers, and innocent victims,\u201d the report relates.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in multiple U.S. jurisdictions reported gang members in their regions also have been caught in possession of \u201claw enforcement only and military weaponry such as assault rifles, grenades, and body armor.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officials surveyed nationwide reported a full 30 percent of gang-related crime in their jurisdiction was committed with firearms while 65 jurisdictions nationwide reported gang-related offenses carried out using firearms accounted for at least 95 percent of crime in their areas.\n\nJust how many gang members are inside the U.S.? The 2013 report refused to provide numbers citing \u201cinconclusive reporting and lack of confidence in estimates.\u201d\n\nHowever, the FBI\u2019s previous report, released in 2011 and reviewed by WND, estimated there was about 1.4 million active street, prison and outlaw motorcycle gang members in more than 33,000 gangs operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nWith additional reporting by Garth Kant in Washington, D.C.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nTrump earns Michael Savage\u2019s acclaim\n\nDonald Trump steamrolls NBC reporter\n\nCrimes by illegals spark new Trump nickname\n\nRepublicans try to disarm \u2018suicide bomber\u2019 Trump\n\nTrump can take solace in immigration survey\n\nTrump loses lucrative Celebrity Golf Classic\n\nNASCAR cuts ties with Trump over border wall\n\nSheriff Joe\u2019s got Trump\u2019s back\n\nMacy\u2019s severs ties with Trump\n\nTrump slams NBC as \u2018weak and foolish\u2019\n\nTrump to sue Univision for pageant flap\n\nProfessional leftists jump on \u2018dump Trump\u2019 bandwagon\n\nTrump dumped over \u2018insulting\u2019 illegal-alien remarks\n\nTrump: I\u2019ll \u2018make country great again\u2019\n\nDonald Trump jumps in race\n\nDonald Trump launching exploratory committee\n\nRelated columns:\n\nWill Donald trump the rest? by Joseph Farah\n\nTruth Trumps politics \u2013 or at least it should by Laura Hollis\n\nGOP: You must dump Trump by Bill Press\n\nTrump strikes a nerve by Larry Elder\n\nGive Trump the Medal of Freedom by Ted Nugent\n\nTrump cured a cancer \u2013 \u2018political correctness\u2019 by Barry Farber\n\nTrump and the GOP border wall by Pat Buchanan\n\nIs Donald Trump the next Ross Perot by Morgan Brittany", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Largely unreported data published by the FBI appears to back up Donald Trump\u2019s contentions regarding illegal aliens from Mexico committing drug and violent crime offenses in the U.S. According to the FBI, criminal gangs \u2013 in some regions comprised significantly of illegal aliens \u2013 are wreaking havoc in the U.S., with 65 jurisdictions nationwide reporting [\u2026]", "title": "FBI data backs up Trump claims on illegals and crime", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/fbi-data-backs-up-trump-claims-on-illegals-and-crime/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/02/trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd778\"", "article_summary": "Largely unreported data published by the FBI appears to back up Donald Trump\u2019s contentions regarding illegal aliens from Mexico committing drug and violent crime offenses in the U.S.\nAnd some, I assume, are good people.\u201dTrump has since clarified numerous times his comments were in reference to illegal aliens crossing into the U.S. from Mexico.\nThe report relates gangs are establishing and maintaining \u201cmutually beneficial relationships\u201d with international crime syndicates, including Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations.\nJust how many gang members are inside the U.S.?\n\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d Trump said when he announced his run for president."}
