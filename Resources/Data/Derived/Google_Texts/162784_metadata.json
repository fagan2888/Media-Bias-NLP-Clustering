In callow youth, we felt a calling to bring a more enlightened consciousness to America.\n\nThat epic self-confidence has faded for many of us. And yet, the longing to do something large lingers somewhere in nearly every boomer heart.\n\nFact is, as the Woodstock generation enters elderhood, the spirit of the Sixties is hard to miss in, among other things, fast-changing attitudes toward gay rights, marijuana and America\u2019s oversized role in the world.\n\nFor better or worse (or both), the boomers\u2019 hour of maximum influence has come. And dead ahead lies a worthy challenge to our generational self-image as agents of unselfish change.\n\nAs the enormous weight of our generation\u2019s retirement takes hold throughout America\u2019s economy and public finances, it will fall uniquely to the boomer generation to transform the paralyzing politics of entitlement reform in America \u2014 if it is ever to be done.\n\nThis one really is about us, and an awakening to the need for a new generational contract could be a chance for true generational greatness. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s a long shot.\n\nChange, make no mistake, will come to the federal government\u2019s gigantic programs devoted to supporting the aged \u2014 chiefly Social Security and Medicare. Arithmetic demands change, and its demands eventually get met.\n\nBut only a new attitude among the elderly would allow America\u2019s political leaders to make the inevitable adjustments soon enough, and thoughtfully enough, to minimize the worst pain for those who can least afford it, and to head off bitter generational conflict.\n\nWe\u2019ve already waited too long, and there\u2019s no sign of imminent progress. In the budget proposal he released several weeks ago, President Obama abandoned a modest idea for reducing future cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits, one he had offered in years past. Meanwhile, Republicans continue to denounce as \u201cgutting Medicare\u201d provisions within Obamacare to rein in some of that program\u2019s ever-accelerating costs, while Democrats greet every GOP Medicare reform idea the same way.\n\nIn recent years, almost every discussion of entitlement reform has been accompanied by assurances that no changes will affect retired Americans or those \u201cnear retirement\u201d \u2014 a guarantee that virtually rules out adequate adjustments.\n\nSettling on the best combination of benefit reductions and tax increases will be traumatically difficult. But there is no doubt that some such combination will be necessary. Both Social Security and Medicare are on unsustainable financial paths. Medicare is ultimately the much bigger problem because containing its future costs means controlling health care costs generally, a riddle far from being solved. But for that very reason reform is essential across the whole system that supports the aged.\n\nAt least, it\u2019s essential if boom generation Americans feel any duty to reduce the burdens bearing down on their children and grandchildren.\n\nOnly last Sunday, a front-page Star Tribune story described the damaged prospects economists see for young workers entering the labor market in the wake of the Great Recession. It\u2019s only the latest signal that an era of slower economic growth, sluggish wages, soaring college costs, and the whole, well-documented squeeze on the middle class has left younger generations ill-equipped to keep every last promise their elders have made to themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s not that boomers approaching retirement lack for problems of their own. Earlier this month these pages republished online a Bloomberg News editorial rightly warning that America\u2019s \u201clong expected retirement crisis\u201d is \u201cbecoming a brutal reality\u201d as inadequate savings, shrunken pensions, and disappointing investment returns and home values combine to confront many with pinched and postponed retirements.\n\nThis is all the more reason that the unavoidable changes ahead in entitlement programs ought to be undertaken gradually and carefully, not abruptly and in a crisis atmosphere that will only deepen if action is much further delayed.\n\nIt might even help to acknowledge something often overlooked: that the boomer generation has already sacrificed, where entitlement programs are concerned, for the well-being of another generation. Reports from both the Urban Institute and the Congressional Budget Office confirm that at least in the case of Social Security, World War II generation retirees have been receiving far more handsome returns on their lifetime tax contributions than their boomer offspring will, even without further changes.\n\nBut easing hardships for earlier generations of elderly was a key purpose of these programs when they were created. It is something the Sixties generation can be proud of. It is not a reason to delay lightening the load for those younger than we \u2014 who played little role in whatever errors may have been made over the years.\n\nCould boomers really detoxify the politics of entitlement reform, giving politicians more freedom to calmly explore and debate solutions without facing a reflexive backlash from older voters? It\u2019s hard to be optimistic, of course.\n\nBut few issues are more squarely in our hands. And as perhaps we\u2019ve learned with other debates, transformations happen one change of heart at a time.\n\nD.J.
