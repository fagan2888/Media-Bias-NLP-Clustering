Jim Wayne and Rep. Joni Jenkins\n\nSpecial to KyForward\n\nThe superbly accurate reporting of the Louisville Courier Journal\u2019s Deborah Yetter, which outlines in detail the outrageous lies and subterfuge perpetrated upon Kentuckians by Gov. Matt Bevin regarding kynect, Benefind and expanded Medicaid, has pushed our outrage to the limit.\n\nGone are our assumptions that the Bevin Administration is just incompetent and ignorant of Kentucky\u2019s complicated healthcare systems.\n\nInstead we are now unequivocally convinced that Gov. Bevin\u2019s goal is to deprive hundreds of thousands of families, children and seniors of the excellent healthcare kynect and expanded Medicaid is providing.\n\nDespite incontrovertible evidence that Kentucky\u2019s expanded Medicaid and kynect programs have created historic increases in Kentuckians\u2019 access to healthcare and produced unprecedented economic development in the healthcare industry, Gov. Bevin refuses to believe the proof of these programs\u2019 successes.\n\nHe turns a blind eye to the evidence and continues to repeat his dark promise to get rid of these programs.\n\nLook at the evolution of chicanery, deception and fabrication the Bevin Administration has employed to date.\n\n\u2022 Matt Bevin sailed into the governor\u2019s office with the promise to get rid of \u201cObamacare\u201d, the Republicans\u2019 deliberately misleading moniker for Kentucky\u2019s home grown, nationally recognized and highly successful healthcare programs.\n\n\u2022 Gov. Bevin, in his first weeks in office, cancelled the contract for all advertising for kynect and eliminated the vitally important kynectors. This dramatically complicated and reduced access for hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians.\n\n\u2022 Next, we Democrats on the House Budget Review Subcommittee on Human Resources fumed as Cabinet Sec. Vicky Glisson spent weeks dodging our requests for information and fiscal evidence these programs weren\u2019t sustainable as was being constantly brayed by Gov. Bevin.\n\n\u2022 When we reached the point where we considered using subpoena power to extract the requested information, Sec. Glisson provided a PowerPoint which used questionable accounting methods to justify Gov. Bevin\u2019s promise to dismantle kynect.\n\n\u2022 To make matters worse, the new administration has even managed to bungle the roll out of another program, Benefind, which was engineered by former Gov Beshear solely for the purpose of complementing kynect to help consumers find supplemental assistance such as food stamps.\n\n\u2022 Inexplicably, the Bevin administration has attempted to convert many people off of kynect and onto Benefind for healthcare purposes.\n\n\u2022 Since the rollout of Benefind two weeks ago, massive, potentially catastrophic results have occurred.\n\n\u2022 Thousands of Kentuckians have received letters requesting information already provided, been denied services by their doctors because their policies are unknowingly cancelled, and refused life saving medications at pharmacies because their medical cards are invalid.\n\nWhy? Because the Bevin administration has gerrymandered the Benefind program to be something it is not, the online portal and rules engine for Medicaid in Kentucky.\n\nGov. Bevin, obviously realizing the disastrous consequences of his administration\u2019s deceit as his very voters are being terminated from their policies, has now ramped up his mendacity and harmful intent to mislead.\n\nHe has laid the blame of the dreadful Benefind rollout on Gov. Beshear and his IT team stating in a video message this week to his own employees (experiencing colossal call volume and frustration with the new program) that \u201cwe were told this was ready to go, it\u2019s a program that\u2019s been developed for years.\u201d\n\nThis message flies in the face of Republican Minority Leader Jeff Hoover\u2019s comments on the House floor last week as we passed House Bills 5 and 6 to preserve kynect and expanded Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Hoover said \u201cThe shift to healthcare.gov will not cause a single person or policy to be cancelled or a single person to lose coverage.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate, outrageous irony of Gov. Bevin\u2019s and the Republicans scheme is that they want to take a state program and convert it to a federal government program. This is in direct conflict of their own party\u2019s often touted doctrine of Americans needing smaller government and less federal intrusion.\n\nWe now stand at a terrifying crossroads in Kentucky history.\n\nAre we going to allow this governor to rip away a healthcare system that has provided coverage for 1.4 million people, created 14,500 healthcare jobs, decreased emergency room visits, made hospitals profitable, poured billions into local economies and fostered a healthier population?\n\nOr will Kentuckians mobilize in solidarity against Gov. Bevin\u2019s deplorable mission to destroy kynect and expanded Medicaid, a mission that is already causing much pain, anguish and suffering for so many?\n\nIn the days remaining in the General Assembly, the Senate can still act on House Bills 5 and 6 passed overwhelmingly by the Democratically controlled House, to preserve the successful kynect program that is saving human lives and investing in our state\u2019s economy.\n\nWe implore Kentuckians to immediately contact Gov. Bevin and their state senators to let them know how important the continued healthcare of our citizens is and demand they pass House Bills 5 and 6.\n\nThis column was co-authored by Reps.
