The cards also will require an individual PIN number to better protect privacy and ward off identity theft and fraud.\n\n\u201cIdentity theft is now America\u2019s fastest growing crime. These crimes don\u2019t just cost companies and consumers billions of dollars every year; they also threaten the economic security of middle-class Americans who worked really hard for a lifetime to build some sort of security,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that somebody halfway around the world could run up thousands of dollars in charges in your name just because they stole your number or just because you swiped your card at the wrong place at the wrong time \u2014 that\u2019s infuriating. For victims, it\u2019s heartbreaking. As a country, we\u2019ve got to do more to stop it.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama also announced private-sector commitments to battle identity. Companies such as Target, Home Depot and others have agreed to use microchips and PIN numbers on cards they issue, the president said. Credit-card firms such as American Express have pledged millions of dollars to replace outdated card readers at businesses across the country.\n\nIndustry groups lauded the move.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the administration for taking proactive and positive steps by adopting PIN and chip technology for government-issued debit and credit cards, among other things,\u201d said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation. \u201cFrom insisting on PIN and chip cards to facilitating greater information sharing among retailers and others sectors, we are committed to finding the right answers with the latest technologies to stop these cyber thieves.\u201d\n\nWhile the president focused on his new program, critics took at the CFPB itself, and the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that created. They allege both have hurt the economy and held back the middle class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now harder for low and moderate-income Americans to buy a home, services like free checking are being eliminated, credit card fees are going up and fewer low-income Americans can afford to access traditional banking services,\u201d a spokesperson for the House Financial Services Committee said in a statement. \u201cThe intended beneficiaries of Dodd-Frank and the CFPB are worse off. Dodd-Frank has proved to be the financial equivalent of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, Mr. Obama said he\u2019ll call a summit on consumer protection and cybersecurity later this year to help develop new ways to fight identity theft. He also directed federal law enforcement agencies to share information with the private sector when they uncover identity-theft rings sophisticated fraud schemes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calling identity theft a \"heartbreaking\" crime that robs Americans of their financial security, President Obama on Friday signed an executive order to put in place new protections for consumers who receive government benefits.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Calling identity theft a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d crime that robs Americans of their financial security, President Obama on Friday signed an executive order to put in place new protections for consumers who receive government benefits.", "title": "Obama launches initiative to cut identity theft", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/17/obama-launches-initiative-cut-identity-theft/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/10/d5a43995dec52727620f6a7067003ac1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/10/d5a43995dec52727620f6a7067003ac1.jpg", "description": "Calling identity theft a \"heartbreaking\" crime that robs Americans of their financial security, President Obama on Friday signed an executive order to put in place new protections for consumers who re", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama launches initiative to cut identity theft"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3467\"", "article_summary": "The cards also will require an individual PIN number to better protect privacy and ward off identity theft and fraud.\n\u201cIdentity theft is now America\u2019s fastest growing crime.\nCalling identity theft a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d crime that robs Americans of their financial security, President Obama on Friday signed an executive order to put in place new protections for consumers who receive government benefits.\nAs a country, we\u2019ve got to do more to stop it.\u201dMr. Obama also announced private-sector commitments to battle identity.\nDodd-Frank has proved to be the financial equivalent of Obamacare.\u201dAlso on Friday, Mr. Obama said he\u2019ll call a summit on consumer protection and cybersecurity later this year to help develop new ways to fight identity theft."}
