But, in addition to not having resulted in any deaths, the health-care botch differs from Katrina in that it is an event that can be fixed over time.\n\nIt may seem at the moment as if Obamacare itself is collapsing. Conservatives have considered the law\u2019s collapse self-evident for three years now, and some of them have already moved on to predicting the collapse of American liberalism itself.\n\nThough it\u2019s possible Obamacare will collapse, it is not collapsing right now. For all the optics of panic and discombobulation, there is no plausible legislative coalition to repeal or even substantively cripple the law. Some vulnerable Democrats are voting for the Upton Bill, a House Republican proposal that would seriously undermine the Affordable Care Act, but the vote probably won\u2019t survive the Senate, and even if it did, it lacks a veto-proof majority. What we\u2019re seeing in Congress is not a serious effort to unravel the law, but an effort to seed attack ads for the midterm races.\n\nThe keep-your-plan waiver President Obama announced yesterday was, likewise, an exercise in optics. Numerous news reports have pointed out that his proposal is unworkable and substantively meaningless. This, paradoxically, is good news for Obamacare. Obama\u2019s waiver to keep unregulated, cherry-picked insurance plans going can\u2019t work because insurers have already adjusted their plans to accommodate the new Obamacare regulations. It is too late to go back to a pre-Obamacare world.\n\nIn one of the many essays over the last few days predicting that Obama\u2019s current woes foretell the demise of his presidency and of government itself, headlined \u201cObamacare\u2019s Problems Could Haunt Democrats for Years,\u201d this bit seems especially telling:\n\nKettl says no major federal initiative has failed so thoroughly upon its unveiling since the ballistic-missile program\u2019s first years in the 1950s produced a succession of explosions and failures to launch.\n\nMy first thought, upon reading that sentence was, This is crazy \u2014 what about the Iraq invasion? Wasn\u2019t that a more thoroughly failed federal initiative? But then, reading it again, I noticed the caveat upon its unveiling. And it may be true. The Iraq war was a success upon its unveiling. Our troops captured Baghdad with ease. War supporters were taunting the skeptics. Even nine months after the start of the war, Democrat Joe Lieberman thought he could better position himself for the nomination by jeering that Howard Dean was \u201cin a spider hole of denial\u201d for continuing his opposition to the war.\n\nEisenhower's Katrina, as it was known at the time.

Likewise, the ballistic-missile failures of the fifties did not actually turn America into a nation of pacifists. The success of a policy initiative upon its unveiling may matter a little, but ultimately not very much.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Obama is having a bad political moment. The sluggish economy, the shutdown mess, and now a spate of terrible Obamacare press has weighed down his approval rating by several points. If the administration can make the website functional in time for people to enroll before the March cutoff, the law will start to build a positive constituency that will offset, and eventually outnumber, currently aggrieved individual-market policy holders. If the recovery picks up speed, which recent data hint may happen, his popularity will rise, too. Even if that doesn't happen, Obamacare will have three years to build up momentum before the Obama presidency ends.\n\nIf the law continues to flounder, and the economy falls back into recession, Republicans could win the full control of government in 2016 they need to repeal the law. Unless and until that happens, Obamacare is not going away.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Obama faces greatest crisis in the history of America.
