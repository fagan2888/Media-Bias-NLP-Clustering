For example, you no longer need to slide a button to unlock Galaxy phones \u2014 you can just swipe your finger anywhere on the screen. Samsung\u2019s keyboard has also been updated several times since the ruling.\n\nSamsung said in a statement that its Galaxy smartphones will continue to be sold and supported by the company. It also said it is looking for further review of Thursday\u2019s decision.\n\nThe court said it had granted Apple a \u201cnarrow\u201d ruling, saying it did not want to take Samsung\u2019s devices off the shelves. Rather, it instructed Samsung to remove the infringing features \u2014 if there are any remaining on customers\u2019 devices \u2014 without recalling its smartphones.\n\nApple first filed its lawsuit in February 2012 \u2014 ages ago in technology terms. (The Galaxy S II was the newest Samsung smartphone to be listed in the lawsuit when the case was filed \u2014 Samsung released the Galaxy S6 earlier this year).\n\nSo Apple won \u2014 but not much more than a Pyrrhic victory.\n\nIn the initial district court decision, Samsung was ordered to pay Apple $120 million for violating its patents \u2014 less than a tenth of what Apple had initially asked for.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of several patent cases currently being fought in courts between the two smartphone giants. In a separate case, Apple was granted $980 million in damages after a court ruled that Samsung copied the iPhone. But an appeals court ruled that Apple could not patent the basic design of the iPhone, putting some of that award in jeopardy.\n\nThe companies said last year that they will call off their patent disputes going forward \u2014 outside the United States.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.712784;-74.005941", "description": "A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Samsung smartphones can no longer copy certain iPhone features.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Samsung smartphones can no longer copy certain iPhone features.", "title": "Samsung told to stop copying iPhone", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/09/17/samsung-told-to-stop-copying-iphone/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/apple-vs-samsung.jpg?w=1200", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/apple-vs-samsung.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "ICBM": "40.712784, -74.005941", "keywords": "news, apple, science space and technology", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-09-17T23:12:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T23:12:54+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Samsung told to stop copying iPhoneNEW YORK \u2014 After a years-long court battle, Apple finally got what it wanted: A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Samsung smartphones can no longer copy certain iPhone features.\nIn a separate case, Apple was granted $980 million in damages after a court ruled that Samsung copied the iPhone.\nSamsung said in a statement that its Galaxy smartphones will continue to be sold and supported by the company.\nBut an appeals court ruled that Apple could not patent the basic design of the iPhone, putting some of that award in jeopardy.\nBut the ruling comes long after Samsung has changed the way those features work on its smartphones."}
