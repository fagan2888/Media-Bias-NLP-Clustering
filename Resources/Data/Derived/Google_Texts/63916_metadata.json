But now another website is generating privacy worries: Healthcare.gov.\n\nRicardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Jack Gillum of The Associated Press report that the health insurance site has been sharing user data \u2014 possibly including characteristics like users\u2019 age and income, as well as whether they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 with companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook. They write that \u201cthere is no evidence that personal information has been misused,\u201d and that the administration says it has prohibited companies \u201cfrom using the data to further their own business interests.\u201d Still, they note, many find the practice troubling.\n\n\u201cSending such personal information raises significant privacy concerns,\u201d writes Cooper Quintin at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A company that receives the information, he adds, \u201ccould match up the personal data provided by Healthcare.gov with an already extensive trove of information about what you read online and what your buying preferences are to create an extremely detailed profile of exactly who you are and what your interests are\u201d \u2014 it could then \u201cstart showing you smoking ads or infer your risk of cancer based on where you live, how old you are and your status as a smoker.\u201d Moreover, he writes, a company could connect Healthcare.gov data with users\u2019 real identities: \u201cGoogle, thanks to real name policies, certainly has information uniquely identifying someone using Google services. If a real identity is linked to the information received from Healthcare.gov it would be a massive violation of privacy for users of the site.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people should be concerned, because there\u2019s a lot of sensitive data flowing back and forth\u201d on Healthcare.gov, said Frank Pasquale, a law professor and the author of \u201cThe Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information.\u201d Even if the data provided to private companies is anonymized, he added, we shouldn\u2019t necessarily be reassured: \u201cThere\u2019s a big literature out there on broken promises of anonymization, of efforts where users were assured that the information was anonymized, but it wasn\u2019t really anonymized well.\u201d\n\nOne area of privacy concern right now is \u201cthe spillage of data from one context into others,\u201d and he fears that once in the hands of private companies, the data might be used in ways consumers aren\u2019t aware of. \u201cThere\u2019s high demand for health data out there,\u201d he said. Life insurance companies, for instance, \u201cwant to use everything on you to calculate what your life insurance premium should be.\u201d\n\nWoodrow N. Hartzog, a law professor who studies privacy, said that without knowing more about how private companies use the Healthcare.gov data, it\u2019s hard to tell how worried users of the site should be. \u201cAre third-party recipients of this information allowed to share with other people?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre they under an obligation to keep from trying to re-identify that information\u201d (that is, from trying to link data to people\u2019s real identities)? \u201cWithout transparency,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s really difficult to know actually how concerned we should be about this.\u201d\n\nNot all data collection raises privacy issues, he added: If we know that, for instance, 30 percent of residents of your city have a certain health condition, while it\u2019s true that \u201cthat pool contains information about you, we don\u2019t have a lot of privacy concerns.\u201d And such information can be useful: \u201cWe might trust research institutions to take that data and glean insights from it,\u201d perhaps about factors that might put people at risk of health problems. But as the likelihood of users actually being identified based on their data rises, he said, \u201cthe question then becomes, at what point do you ask for consent.\u201d\n\nAaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in an email that \u201cunlike many retail sites similar to HealthCare.gov, we do not and will not sell a visitor\u2019s information. We will remain vigilant and will continue to focus on what more we can do to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivate sector tools,\u201d he added, \u201cplay a critical role in the operation of a consumer focused website. Without these tools, HealthCare.gov would be unable to effectively respond to system errors, issues that result in a poor or slow web experience, or provide metrics to the public on site visits and/or mobile usage. In addition, consumers would have to continuously resubmit information throughout the process making signing up for insurance more difficult.\u201d\n\nAnd, he noted, \u201cthe use of these private sector tools is extremely common.\u201d\n\nDr. Hartzog, too, noted that \u201cwhat the government is engaging in here, if indeed they\u2019re sharing anonymized data according to certain kinds of industry standards,\u201d is in fact \u201ccommon practice for lots of different websites, if not most websites.\u201d But consumers may see government websites differently from others: \u201cAnytime you\u2019ve got the government involved, you have higher expectations of transparency simply because of the people\u2019s right to demand transparency and accountability from their government.\u201d\n\nAlessandro Acquisti, a professor of information systems and public policy who studies privacy, made a similar distinction in an email: \u201cConsumers have come to expect and anticipate that privately owned entities will collect, share and trade their data. They may not have similar expectations with regard to a government site dealing with such sensitive data.\u201d And, he said, \u201cif my expectations about what a website does with my data differ from the actual data policies of that site, that\u2019s a privacy problem \u2014 because I may be making decisions based on incomplete or incorrect knowledge of what will happen to my data.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr. Pasquale argued that the revelations about Healthcare.gov were especially disturbing because of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most Americans carry health insurance. \u201cWhat we now have is government effectively rolling into its mandate that you buy insurance that you also have this pervasive data tracking by what I consider to be very unreliable entities, pursuant to terms that we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nData-sharing by Healthcare.gov may present unique issues, but for Dr. Hartzog, it\u2019s also part of a broader problem: \u201cConsumers should be concerned not just because it\u2019s happening at Healthcare.gov but because it\u2019s happening everywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd to protect ordinary users, simply asking for our consent may not be enough. \u201cConsumers have very limited ability to protect themselves, and they also have very limited ability to even understand the risk of personal disclosure online, and all the different ways that one individual disclosure can be used against you or come back to haunt you when it\u2019s collected, aggregated, shared with others,\u201d said Dr. Hartzog. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon policy makers to establish good privacy policy to protect consumers so that we don\u2019t overburden them.\u201d\n\nSuch a policy would \u201cmake sure that companies protected the personal info they were entrusted with,\u201d and \u201cthat they respect the trust that they were given by limiting who they share the information with and how long they keep information.\u201d It would also require that they \u201ctry to protect information as it moves downstream,\u201d by holding anyone they share it with to the same restrictions they abide by. Ultimately, he said, we need a system under which \u201cconsumers can be confident that the trust they place in companies and governments when they disclose information will be respected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150123103525, "twitter": {"description": "The revelation that the health insurance website shares user data with for-profit companies has some concerned about what will happen to consumers\u2019 private health information.", "title": "Is Your Data Safe at Healthcare.gov?", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/is-your-data-safe-at-healthcare-gov/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/22/opinion/nyto-health/nyto-health-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "channels": "NytNow", "blogpostid": 100000003467747, "DISPLAYDATE": "January 23, 2015", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Deeper Dive", "published_time": 1422027325, "modified_time": "2015-02-11T19:02:17-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Computers and the Internet,Consumer Protection,Data-Mining and Database Marketing,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Privacy,Social Media,Facebook Inc,Google Inc,Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Is Your Data Safe at Healthcare.gov?
