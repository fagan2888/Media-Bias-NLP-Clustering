Many came out Saturday to the Holiday Golf Club in Panama City Beach for the first annual 'Seal Strong' Charity Golf Tournament.

Friends and supporters of Chip Seal hosted the event to help support his cancer treatments.

In April, Chip was diagnosed with cancer in both his head and neck.

Then the cancer spread to his liver.

Seal and his family have been long time members of the Panama City community and are thankful for the support.

"It's just inspiring to see our community come together and they do it time and time again," said Seal. "It's just really good to be a part of this community, and I am very blessed to be in Panama City Beach, Florida."

During the tournament, $14,000 was raised and all proceeds go towards Seal's treatment.
