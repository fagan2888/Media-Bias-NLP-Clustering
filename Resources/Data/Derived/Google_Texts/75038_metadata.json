Associated Press\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.\n\n\u201cJokowi Outshines Prabowo\u201d read the headline in Koran Tempo, a tabloid that put Mr. Widodo, whose nickname is Jokowi, ahead of his rival, Prabowo Subianto. The newspaper invited three experts with backgrounds in law and public policy to judge each candidate\u2019s performance.\n\nAccording to their collective assessment, Mr. Subianto got a total score of 64 (out of a possible 90 points), while Mr. Widodo achieved 66.5.\n\nMr. Subianto, a former army special forces general, did better on communication style according to the three pundits, while Mr. Widodo put forth better ideas for future work programs.\n\nKompas, Indonesia\u2019s biggest national newspaper, highlighted several key questions in the debate, including the candidates\u2019 views on regional governance and human rights violations. The conservative broadsheet\u2019s headline said \u201cDebate Shows the Difference Between [the Two] Candidates.\u201d But its reporting indicated that Jokowi had done a better job explaining his potential future programs.\n\nIn other papers, the debate came off more as a battle than display of ideas.\n\nWords such as \u201cstinging\u201d and \u201cweaving,\u201d \u201cjabs\u201d and \u201cvictory\u201d filled the English-language Jakarta Globe, a tabloid whose provocative cover stated that vice presidential candidate Jusuf Kalla drew \u201cfirst blood.\u201d\n\nThe Jakarta Post also fell back on the fighting analogy declaring the final score in the showdown between Mr. Widodo and Mr. Subianto, at 1-0 for Jokowi.\n\nEven this paper called the debate a squaring off, though it pointed to no conclusive winner.\n\nOn Twitter, meanwhile, the candidates battled for mentions, with Mr. Widodo trumping Mr. Subianto by 28%, according to Provetic, a data analysis company.\n\nThat may be a better indicator of the demographic lining up behind Mr. Widodo than any real support for the candidate, with many analysts saying he did better than expected but didn\u2019t score any knock-out punches. Iwan Setyawan, Provetic\u2019s chief executive officer, even noted in a tweet that more than a quarter of the mentions were potentially rebroadcast tweets, or tweet bots.\n\nMeanwhile, Meidyatama Suryodiningrat, the editor in chief of the Jakarta Post, wrote an editorial calling Mr. Widodo\u2019s performance \u201ca masterful display of strategy.\u201d But he chose to leave a decision on a winner to the people, saying \u201cthey can now begin to judge for themselves the true nature of the stark choice before them.\u201d\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nAlso popular on Southeast Asia Real Time:\n\nSaid on the Street: How Indonesians View Their Digital Obsession\n\nWhat\u2019s Needed As Indonesia Braces for a Rough Dry Season", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, with supporters praising their individual candidates for a solid performance, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.", "title": "In Election Debate Showdown, a Knock-Out for Jokowi?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/06/10/in-election-debate-showdown-a-knock-out-for-jokowi/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DE045_INjoko_G_20140610060410.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "In Election Debate Showdown, a Knock-Out for Jokowi?", "description": "While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, with supporters praising their individual candidates for a solid performance, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Sara Schonhardt and Anita Rachman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Indonesia Real Time Blog", "page.subsection": "Indonesia Real Time", "article.summary": "While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, with supporters praising their individual candidates for a solid performance, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-10T10:11:48-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/06/10/in-election-debate-showdown-a-knock-out-for-jokowi/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEAB-4464", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, with supporters praising their individual candidates for a solid performance, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.", "title": "In Election Debate Showdown, a Knock-Out for Jokowi?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/06/10/in-election-debate-showdown-a-knock-out-for-jokowi/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DE045_INjoko_G_20140610060410.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Indonesia Real Time", "article.id": "BL-SEAB-4464", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-10T10:11:48-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf48\"", "article_summary": "\u201cJokowi Outshines Prabowo\u201d read the headline in Koran Tempo, a tabloid that put Mr. Widodo, whose nickname is Jokowi, ahead of his rival, Prabowo Subianto.\nOn Twitter, meanwhile, the candidates battled for mentions, with Mr. Widodo trumping Mr. Subianto by 28%, according to Provetic, a data analysis company.\nAccording to their collective assessment, Mr. Subianto got a total score of 64 (out of a possible 90 points), while Mr. Widodo achieved 66.5.\nAssociated PressJAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014While public views about who won Indonesia\u2019s presidential election debate looked split, the country\u2019s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.\nMr. Subianto, a former army special forces general, did better on communication style according to the three pundits, while Mr. Widodo put forth better ideas for future work programs."}
