It found that as of June 2015, \u201cthe Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax credits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible because they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or legal presence.\u201d\n\nThe review found the credits went to more than 500,000 people \u2013 who are illegal immigrants or whose legal status was unclear due to insufficient records.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed to FoxNews.com on Monday that 471,000 customers with 2015 coverage failed to produce proper documentation on their citizenship or immigration status on time \u2013 but stressed that this does not necessarily mean they\u2019re ineligible.\n\n\u201cLack of verification does not mean an individual is ineligible for financial assistance, but only that a Marketplace did not receive sufficient information to verify eligibility in the time period outlined in the law,\u201d CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said.\n\nThe Senate report also accused the administration of lacking a solid plan to get that money back \u2013 and predicted that in the end, the IRS will be \u201cunable to fully recoup the funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe information provided to the Committee by the IRS and HHS reveals a troubling lack of coordination between the two agencies ... and demonstrates that the IRS and HHS neglected to consider how they would recover these wasteful payments,\u201d the report says.\n\nUnder the law, the feds can dole out these payments on a temporary basis if a recipient\u2019s legal status is unclear, but are supposed to cut off funding and coverage if the recipient does not later come up with the paperwork. Up to a half-million \u201cineligible\u201d people, according to the report, applied in this way -- with their credits paid in advance to the insurers. The IRS, though, is supposed to get overpayments back from the individuals themselves.\n\nThe Senate report, based on a review launched by committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., derisively describes this approach as \u201cpay and chase.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays credits and subsidies to the insurance companies on behalf of the applicants \u2013 and the feds then \u201cchase\u201d after any overpayments to ineligible people once they are discovered.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018pay and chase\u2019 model has potentially cost taxpayers approximately $750 million,\u201d the report says. The 500,000 individuals in question have been removed from coverage, according to the findings, as the government seeks to get the money back.\n\nThe Senate report says the IRS and HHS initially failed to coordinate on a plan for recouping funds, and claimed that a subsequent plan from the IRS to recoup the money is still \u201cineffective and insufficient.\u201d\n\nIn a July letter to Johnson, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen assured that the agency is \u201ccommitted to identifying and efficiently addressing\u201d improper payments. He reiterated that anyone \u201cnot lawfully present\u201d who enrolls for ObamaCare coverage \u201cmust repay\u201d the advance premium credit payments, and would be breaking the law if they don\u2019t.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and FoxNews.com\u2019s Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX
