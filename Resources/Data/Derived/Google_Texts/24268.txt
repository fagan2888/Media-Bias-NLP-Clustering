We are 5 days away from the 10th National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day #NWGHAAD. This annual March 10th observance aims to reduce stigma, share resources, and empower women and girls to learn the importance of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment.

Digital storytelling is an effective way to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. Watch our Facing AIDS video for #NWGHAAD and submit your own Facing AIDS image here.

Visit the Office of Women’s Health (OWH) for resources for women and girls affected by, or at-risk for, HIV/AIDS. Learn about the risk for HIV, find a convenient testing location, and get information about treatment options. You can also read the stories of women from across the country. In leading the annual observance, OWH has noted the power of storytelling with these brief words: Our stories. Our cause.

CDC’s Act Against AIDS initiative uses digital storytelling/tools to deliver important HIV prevention messages, including stories from Let’s Stop HIV Together and Take Charge.Take the Test. campaigns. We encourage you to check out those stories.

What resources will you share to promote National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day?
