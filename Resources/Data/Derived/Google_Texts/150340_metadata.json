Therefore, is a full-blown endorsement from House Speaker Paul Ryan even required?\n\nWould it matter if Ryan, R-Wis., kept Trump at arm's-length? And if Trump\u2019s political dexterity is so dominant, maybe congressional Republicans who politically need to keep their distance can stay out of it.\n\nLittle is settled politically a week after Ryan and Trump held their summit on Capitol Hill. Some congressional Republicans are still scratching their heads as to how the party wound up here. Others understand the seismic political shock which is rattling GOPers in the halls of Congress and latched onto the Trump bandwagon. There\u2019s worry some could soon find themselves scratching for relevance if they don\u2019t sign on. The Trump procession might just bowl them over.\n\nThe Trump cavalcade razed the Republican Party. And while Republicans in Congress nibbled for years around the edges of repealing ObamaCare and free trade and, in some cases, immigration reform \u2026 well, that really isn\u2019t where the GOP wound up once Trump arrived on the scene.\n\nDoes Trump even need congressional Republicans?\n\nConsider the fact that Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., and other early congressional Trump backers called for a meeting the same day he jawboned with Ryan. After all, dance with the girl who brung \u2018ya, right?\n\nNope.\n\n\u201cThey said they didn\u2019t have time,\u201d snorted Hunter about the snub as he attempted to duck into the men\u2019s room just off the House floor.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump\u2019s dis tempered his support for Trump, Hunter paused and proudly unfurled a white \u201cTrump 2016\u201d T-shirt he clutched in his left hand.\n\n\u201c[Not meeting with us] put our guys in a tough spot,\u201d said one GOP source close to the pro-Trump caucus. \u201cThey should have met with us first.\u201d\n\nThat said, such a meeting between Trump and his most-ardent congressional supporters is expected soon. Trump intends to meet with all House Republicans as well.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s only natural for the head of the party to meet with the field lieutenants.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Ryan thinks of Trump as the top GOP dog.\n\n\u201cGood Lord, I hope [he] is, because the person who is getting the nomination is the person to lead our party,\u201d said Ryan of Trump when asked.\n\nAfter their conclave last week, Trump and Ryan published a joint statement. The only concrete item immediately binding Trump and Ryan is their mutual goal of defeating Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s why Ryan\u2019s consumed with trying to forge \u201cparty unification\u201d lest the GOP \u201cgo into the fall at half strength.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t want anything to be \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nSo ensconced behind the scenes are rolling, nebulous discussions between Trump\u2019s aides, party officials and congressional Republican aides about \u201cpolicy.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s supposed to be the Capitol Hill \u201cpolicy guy.\u201d He\u2019s argued for a Congress of \u201cideas.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear if everyone can get on the same page.\n\nSaid one senior House GOPer to Fox News: \u201cEven Trump\u2019s people are still trying to figure out where Trump stands on things.\u201d\n\nRyan advocates slicing taxes. Curbing the national debt through restructuring entitlement programs. Free trade. He views the importance of immigration reform through a critical economic framework.\n\nWhere does Trump stand on these issues? Some of Trump\u2019s most-vocal congressional advocates concede there are differences between the presumptive nominee and Ryan \u2013 let alone many Republicans. They point to possible danger for Ryan and rank-and-file Republicans. They may have to forgo time-honed principles just to get behind Trump.\n\nAnd if Ryan and other Republicans don\u2019t? Danger lurks. That\u2019s because old-style GOP positions no longer align with the guy who now struts around as the most popular man in the room.\n\n\u201cVoters are fed up. They are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the system,\u201d said Trump backer Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa. \u201cWashington ought to be bulldozed.\u201d\n\nMarino argues that \u201cin the not too distant future, Paul is going to endorse.\u201d\n\nOf course, Ryan probably has to eventually back Trump. Otherwise, the story becomes the speaker of the House and chair of the convention refusing to back the nominee. That\u2019s a scenario the speaker wants to avoid.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is singing from the same policy hymnal.\n\nAnd what if everything suddenly goes south for Trump? Ryan and GOPers could be happy they aren\u2019t latched too closely to Trump. That\u2019s to say nothing of lawmakers who have reservations about Trump.\n\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s] remarks add to the uneasiness that women leaders are feeling,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. \u201cTrump really needs to address those concerns.\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., announced she voted by mail for Trump in her home state\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cDid I cast my ballot with enthusiasm? Not exactly,\u201d wrote McMorris Rodgers on Facebook.\n\nThe congresswoman said she \u201cvehemently\u201d disagrees with some of Trump\u2019s remarks about women and persons with disabilities. She herself has a son with a disability\n\n\u201cHe will have to earn the Presidency by demonstrating that he has the temperament for the job,\u201d added McMorris Rodgers.\n\nLawmakers are usually deft when it comes to finding the right political pathway. But this time around, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess which is the right way to go.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.
