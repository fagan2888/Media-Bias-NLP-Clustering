Arkansas has just now begun issuing marriage licenses for same sex couples, and Idaho has been informed their constitutional amendment is unenforceable.\n\nAs marriage equality is spreading rapidly across the nation, some \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d advocates are getting a little worked up. Here are five over the top reactions to equal marriage rights for all sexual orientations.\n\n1) Wisconsin parents force school to apologize for showing positive gay marriage video. Is it indoctrination? That\u2019s the claim of three parents at a local high school in Wisconsin who complained about the bias of a video called \u201cKids React to Gay Marriage,\u201d which was shown as part of the school\u2019s day to support LGBT students as part of an anti-bullying campaign. Apparently you are supposed to support the students without showing a video that depicts a whole bunch of little kids saying they don\u2019t understand why two people of the same gender getting married to each other is a big deal.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be an anti-bullying message but didn\u2019t do anything but promote gay marriage,\u201d board member Bill Sodemann said in an apology for the egregious mistake. \u201cWhen dealing with these issues, you need to have balance and can\u2019t promote political issues.\u201d\n\n2) Kentucky says gay couples can\u2018t make babies so they can\u2019t get married. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a fantastic reason to block marriage,\u201d said no infertile couple, couple past the age of childbearing, or couple who just don\u2019t want to have children ever. Still that\u2019s the talking point being given in the state\u2019s appeal to overturn the ruling striking down the state\u2019s same sex marriage ban. \u201cKentucky\u2019s marriage laws are rationally related to the state\u2019s interest of preserving the traditional man-woman marriage model,\u201d it reads, according to Mother Jones, \u201cbecause \u2018man-man and woman-woman couples cannot procreate\u2019 and Kentucky has an interest in encouraging procreation in the name of promoting \u2018long-term economic stability through stable birth rates.\u2019\u201d\n\n3) Virginia debates whether people are \u201cbaby makers for the state?\u201c So, Kentucky seems to believe that residents should be coerced to give birth to support the state. The question is, does Virginia agree? That was a question brought up in Virginia\u2019s marriage equality hearing this week. According to MSNBC, \u201cDavid Oakley, an attorney defending the bans, argued that the restrictions were justified by a state interest in wanting to \u2018steer the procreative potential of same-sex couples,\u2019\u201d which led one judge to retort that argument \u201csounds like a totalitarian system where people are baby-makers for the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cProcreative potential\u201d is of course just a polite way of saying \u201cguide gay people into having sex with people of the opposite gender by providing financial incentives,\u201d since not every marriage has children, but all get tax breaks and other financial supports. But once you add \u201cfor the children\u201d to the mix, suddenly it seems a lot more noble.\n\n4) Arkansas clerk won\u2018t cave to \u201ctyranny of majority.\u201c Arkansas is still getting used to the idea that the state can now issue marriage licenses to same sex couples, and not all of the counties are even doing so yet. One county that is issuing licenses has been urged to stop and wait for a ruling from the Supreme Court, even though there is no injunction in place to justify that.\n\nThe clerk, however, is refusing to bow down to the massive pressure to stop and wait. \u201cI believe that a majority can\u2019t exercise tyranny against the minority of a fundamental right,\u201dsaid Pulaski County Clerk Larry Crane. And everyone can keep getting married.\n\n5) Idaho says it\u2019s just \u201censhrining\u201d gender roles. What good is your government unless it passes bills telling you how exactly you need to act in order to be a member of that sex? Well, that\u2019s the logic behind Idaho\u2019s now defunct same sex marriage ban, which was in place to ensure people understood traditional \u201cdaddy\u201d and \u201cmommy\u201d terminology. \u201cThe citizens of Idaho made a choice to enshrine the roles of mother and father into the lives of children,\u201d Thomas Perry, the governor\u2019s attorney, had said, according to the L.A. Times. \u201cWe believe that there are significant risks imposed in redefining marriage in genderless terms.\u201d\n\nNow, American Family Association\u2019s Bryan Fischer, who claims he wrote the state\u2019s constitutional amendment, is frothing at the mouth over its judicial strike down. \u201cWill Governor Butch Otter fulfill his oath of office or will he meekly succumb to federal tyranny?\u201d questions Fischer, who demands Otter tell his clerks to refuse to issue marriage licenses.\n\nYou can keep fighting, Fischer, but that\u2019s not going to stop marriage equality from spreading.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marriage bans are being struck down all over the country, and some far right folk are starting to freak out.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3090/3089729.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "gay marriage,religious right,same sex marriage,bryan fischer", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Arkansas has just now begun issuing marriage licenses for same sex couples, and Idaho has been informed their constitutional amendment is unenforceable.\nStill that\u2019s the talking point being given in the state\u2019s appeal to overturn the ruling striking down the state\u2019s same sex marriage ban.\n1) Wisconsin parents force school to apologize for showing positive gay marriage video.\nEvery day it seems as if another state is either approving same sex marriage or seeing their own ban against the practice ruled unconstitutional in the courts.\nWell, that\u2019s the logic behind Idaho\u2019s now defunct same sex marriage ban, which was in place to ensure people understood traditional \u201cdaddy\u201d and \u201cmommy\u201d terminology."}
