He doesn\u2019t formally endorse in primaries (well, usually), but if Scott Walker has masterminded a way to beat the left and Scott Walker is, per Rush, a Reaganite conservative who\u2019s achieved wonderful things in a blue state and Scott Walker is running for president, then naturally the guy we should be nominating is Scott Walker. Rush won\u2019t go that far, I assume, especially this early in the process with tea-party heroes like Ted Cruz in the mix, but I don\u2019t see the logic by which we follow Walker\u2019s blueprint and not Walker himself. Which is a big deal: One of Walker\u2019s selling points is his potential to attract support from both wings of the party. That potential will be tested when he ends up taking flak, chiefly from Cruz, for his apparent squishiness on amnesty. Having Rush Limbaugh talk him up now to grassroots righties as a proven winner will help deflect those attacks. Unless, of course, Rush decides that Cruz is right, that Walker\u2019s unacceptably RINO-ish on immigration, and therefore we should follow the Scott Walker blueprint to the White House so long as it\u2019s, er, Ted Cruz who\u2019s implementing it.\n\nSpeaking of getting the attention of grassroots righties, Bobby Jindal seems to have settled on a strategy.\n\nFrom worship to prayer, thousands joined together on the campus of Louisiana State University for a weekend faith gathering called, The Response: Louisiana. The event, led by Gov. Bobby Jindal, was designed as a way for Christians to come together and seek spiritual revival for America\u2026 Jindal asked all of his fellow U.S. governors to join him in Baton Rouge. \u201cOur God is an awesome God, amen!\u201d Jindal declared before the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re going to plea for Him to send his spirit, His healing spirit, a spirit of revival in this place, all across this state, all across this blessed land.\u201d\n\nJindal\u2019s always been religious and socially conservative but he was first introduced to conservatives not for his bona fides on \u201cvalues\u201d issues but for his wonkery, particularly on health care. His main problem next year will be standing out somehow in a ridiculously crowded field; believe it or not, even though he\u2019s now in his eighth year as governor of Louisiana, his name recognition among Republican voters is a bit less than \u2026 Ben Carson\u2019s. Is wonking out over ObamaCare during the debates going to change that? Probably not. But if he builds a strong brand as an unapologetic social conservative, the sort of guy willing to decry Islamic \u201cno-go zones\u201d in Europe while the media\u2019s insisting that they don\u2019t exist, committed social cons may decide that they\u2019re better off throwing their support to him than to Huckabee. Jindal has a southern pedigree just like Huck does, he has lots of executive experience just like Huck does, but he\u2019s younger, would bring racial diversity to the ticket, and is more trusted by fiscal conservatives than Huck. It\u2019s hard to imagine him breaking out and winning the nomination but it\u2019s easy to imagine him producing some buzz, finishing surprisingly strong in the early states, and ending up as VP to someone like Jeb Bush. Or, of course, Scott Walker.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cScott Walker has the blueprint for winning and winning consistently\u2026\u201d", "title": "Rush Limbaugh: If you want to beat the left in 2016, follow Scott Walker\u2019s blueprint", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/01/27/rush-limbaugh-if-you-want-to-beat-the-left-in-2016-follow-scott-walkers-blueprint/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-27T16:21:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-29T14:28:42+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, GOP, path, republican, Rush Limbaugh, Scott Walker,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e93\"", "article_summary": "Rush Limbaugh: If you want to beat the left in 2016, follow Scott Walker\u2019s blueprintposted at 11:21 am on January 27, 2015 by AllahpunditVia the Daily Caller, is this not effectively an endorsement?\nHe doesn\u2019t formally endorse in primaries (well, usually), but if Scott Walker has masterminded a way to beat the left and Scott Walker is, per Rush, a Reaganite conservative who\u2019s achieved wonderful things in a blue state and Scott Walker is running for president, then naturally the guy we should be nominating is Scott Walker.\nFrom worship to prayer, thousands joined together on the campus of Louisiana State University for a weekend faith gathering called, The Response: Louisiana.\nOr, of course, Scott Walker.\nWhich is a big deal: One of Walker\u2019s selling points is his potential to attract support from both wings of the party."}
