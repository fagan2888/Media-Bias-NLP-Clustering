It chose 20:\n\nAtlanta*\n\nMilwaukee*\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina*\n\nNashville, Tennessee*\n\nChicago\n\nNew Orleans*\n\nDallas*\n\nOakland, California\n\nDenver\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nDetroit\n\nPhoenix\n\nGreat Falls, Montana\n\nRichmond, Virginia*\n\nKansas City, Missouri*\n\nSalt Lake City*\n\nLas Vegas\n\nSeattle\n\nLong Beach, California\n\nTampa, Florida*\n\nCities marked with an asterisk are in states that chose not to expand Medicaid, according to the Advisory Board Co., leaving millions without access to insurance subsidies.

The administration estimated that 10.5 million uninsured people are eligible for coverage sold on ACA exchanges.\n\nThe community that makes the most progress by the end of the current enrollment period in reducing the uninsured rate will win the presidential visit. But would Obama be welcomed favorably in places like Dallas, Atlanta or Salt Lake City? This could be fun.\n\nPhoto: Twitter user @POTUS", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president promises to visit the community that makes the most progress toward reducing the uninsured rate during this ACA enrollment period.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The president promises to visit the community that makes the most progress toward reducing the uninsured rate during this ACA enrollment period.", "title": "White House pushing ACA enrollment with \u2018Healthy Communities\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-02-at-9.50.21-AM.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-06T17:12:40-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/white-house-aca-enrollment-healthy-communities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-02-at-9.50.21-AM.png", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "The president promises to visit the community that makes the most progress toward reducing the uninsured rate during this ACA enrollment period.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama pushing ACA enrollment with 'Healthy Communities'"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,affordable care act, barack obama, health insurance exchanges, Healthy Communities Challenge, Obamacare, obamacare coverage, uninsured, Washington D.C., , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Washington D.C.", "published_time": "2015-11-06T12:48:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T17:12:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Note that Tennessee is considering expansion, while Michigan and Pennsylvania have equivalent, alternative plans to widen insurance coverage among low-income residents.\nWith the third annual open-enrollment period underway for Affordable Care Act insurance coverage, the administration on Friday unveiled the Healthy Communities Challenge, aimed at lowering the uninsured rate in major cities.\nThe community that makes the most progress by the end of the current enrollment period in reducing the uninsured rate will win the presidential visit.\n\u201cThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage,\u201d the White House announcement said.\nThe administration estimated that 10.5 million uninsured people are eligible for coverage sold on ACA exchanges."}
