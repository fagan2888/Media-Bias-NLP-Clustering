Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.\n\n\u201cThe slow, uneven and painful recovery left Americans deeply pessimistic about the economy, their personal finances and prospects for the next generation,\u201d Carl Van Horn, the center\u2019s director and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe Heldrich Center is a leading research think tank that has tracked the economy and the American job force since 1997 and researched the effects of the recession. The center\u2019s goals include strengthening workforce education, placement and training programs. It\u2019s also done cutting-edge research on the declining morale and mental health of those who have lost jobs or are just hanging on.\n\nRelated: Fed Study: One-Fourth of Americans \u2018Just Getting By\u2019 Financially\n\nThe new findings are similar to those of other recent polls and studies attempting to plumb the public\u2019s psyche over a long and uneven economic recovery. A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found 71 percent of Americans believe the country is on the \u201cwrong track,\u201d while 7 in 10 blame the malaise on President Obama and Congress more than on structural problems with the recovery.\n\nJust months before a critical mid-term election, respondents to the Heldrich survey again expressed little or no confidence that President Obama or Congress can or will do anything to help improve the economy.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s key findings:\n\nSeventy percent of Americans are convinced the economy has undergone permanent changes for the worse since the recession, while just 1 in 6 believes job opportunities for the next generation will be better than for theirs. Five years ago, 4 in 10 respondents held that more positive view. Many people today \u201chave little or no confidence that the federal government will make progress on the nation\u2019s most important problems over the next year,\u201d the study found.\n\nRelated: More Dismal Poll Numbers for Obama and Congress\n\nAbout one-quarter of those interviewed reported a major decline in their quality of life because of the recession, while 42 percent say they have less money in the bank than when the recession began. Some 16 percent of the public said they were \u201cdevastated\u201d because they experienced \u201ca major, permanent change in the quality of their life.\u201d\n\nA mere 1 in 3 believes the economy has gotten better in the last year and only a quarter of Americans think it will improve next year. \u201cJust 1 in 6 Americans believe job opportunities will be better for the next generation of workers, down from 4 in 10 five years ago,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe authors of the report found that the public \u201cpaints an extremely negative picture of American work\u201d when asked to choose from a list of a dozen words or phrases. Only 14 percent checked off \u201chappy at work\u201d and just 18 percent believe they are being well paid.\n\nTwo-thirds say American workers are \u201cnot secure in their jobs\u201d and \u201chighly stressed.\u201d Just 1 in 5 believes the average American worker is well educated or innovative; and just 1 in 3 checked off \u201cambitious\u201d or \u201chighly skilled.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Mental Anguish of the Long-term Unemployed\n\nThe authors said they were most surprised by how many respondents denigrated the average American worker. Just 1 in 3 checked off that the average American worker is \u201cbetter than workers in other countries,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe widespread economic despair is born of fundamental inconsistencies in the long economic recovery, according to the study. Over the past 4 years, for example, nearly 10 million private sector jobs were added and the U.S. has enjoyed 53 consecutive months of economic growth \u2013 the longest period of consistent job growth on record. The unemployment rate fell from 8.2 percent in March 2013 to just 6.2 percent in July.\n\nBut that growth \u201chas been insufficient to produce enough full-time jobs for everyone who wants one,\u201d the study notes. As of last month, nearly 9.7 million work\u00aders were unemployed, and many jobs that vanished during the recession paid good wages, while most growth during the recovery has been in low-wage jobs.\n\n\u201cWages have increased modestly for many, but have not increased suf\u00adficiently to keep up with inflation,\u201d the report stated. \u201cLabor force participation rates are at the lowest levels in three decades. Long-term unemployment rates remain at unprecedented high levels, above pre-recession levels in over 40 states.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly five years after the recovery began, Americans in alarming numbers believe the Great Recession permanently damaged the economy and that many aspects of a lifestyle they once enjoyed \u2013 including a good job and income security \u2013 may never return in their lifetime, according to a new survey.", "title": "Why We\u2019re So Down in the Dumps About the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/28/Why-We-re-So-Down-Dumps-About-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09162011_Economy_Uphill_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/28/Why-We-re-So-Down-Dumps-About-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09162011_Economy_Uphill_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Nearly five years after the recovery began, Americans in alarming numbers believe the Great Recession permanently damaged the economy and that many aspects of a lifestyle they once enjoyed \u2013 including a good job and income security \u2013 may never return in their lifetime, according to a new survey.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabf7\"", "article_summary": "The Heldrich Center is a leading research think tank that has tracked the economy and the American job force since 1997 and researched the effects of the recession.\n\u201cJust 1 in 6 Americans believe job opportunities will be better for the next generation of workers, down from 4 in 10 five years ago,\u201d according to the report.\nEven more troubling, most Americans don\u2019t believe the economy has actually improved \u2013 or will improve \u2013 despite nearly half a decade of job growth and declining unemployment rates since the recession officially ended in June 2009.\n\u201cThe slow, uneven and painful recovery left Americans deeply pessimistic about the economy, their personal finances and prospects for the next generation,\u201d Carl Van Horn, the center\u2019s director and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\nJust months before a critical mid-term election, respondents to the Heldrich survey again expressed little or no confidence that President Obama or Congress can or will do anything to help improve the economy."}
