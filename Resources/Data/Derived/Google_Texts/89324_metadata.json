Both are noble missions.\n\nLast Friday Jeff rolled into town with his barbecue trailer and promptly hoisted Old Glory. Not too long after, one of the organizers of the event told Jeff to take down the flag.\n\n\u201cThere were six or eight of us that had flags flying,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe went to each camp and told them to take the flag down and everybody did.\u201d\n\nThe first rule of barbecue is low and slow \u2013 but the temperature started rising after Jeff complied with the directive.\n\n\u201cThe whole time I\u2019m thinking \u2013the reason I fly the flag is because I love America,\u201d he said. \u201cI love what it stands for. It\u2019s a way to say to our current and former troops \u2013 thank you.\u201d\n\nSo Jeff had a change of heart and decided to raise Old Glory \u2013 as an act of defiance.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of saying there are things more important (than a barbecue competition),\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to kick me out \u2013 I\u2019ll leave.\u201d\n\nJeff was not kicked out and he was not asked to take down the flag. As a matter of fact \u2013 after he re-raised the flag another competitor followed suit.\n\nSo why were the patriotic pitmasters told to take down the flags?\n\nJeff said they were told by event organizers that the flags violated a city ordinance in Daphne. But that allegation turned out to be false.\n\n\u201cNo one from the city advised or asked anyone to take down flags of any type,\u201d Mayor Dane Haygood told me. \u201c\u201dWe proudly and boldly display American flags and we encourage everyone in the community to do the same.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the order to remove the flags came from the tour director of the Kansas City Barbecue Society.\n\n\u201cAs a measure of precaution, we asked everyone to take down any kind of signs or any kind of flags that were being displayed,\u201d spokesman Mike McCloud told me. \u201cIt turned out that some of those happened to be American flags.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago McCloud said there had been a similar issue in Daphne when \u201cthere was some official request made to take things down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be careful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like doing barbecue events in the South and we wanted to make sure we follow any local ordinances and procedures.\u201d\n\nMcCloud said after they further investigated the local ordinance - they eventually told the pitmasters they could fly their flags. So they investigated a local ordinance even though the city maintains there is no local ordinance banning the flying of American flags?\n\nAnd why would the Kansas City Barbecue Society blame the city of Daphne \u2013 when in fact the city of Daphne did nothing wrong? It seems to me like they owe the mayor and the pitmasters an apology.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know an apology is in order,\u201d McCloud told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve explained to the barbecue teams what happened. The city did not approach our event and ask us to do anything. We were cautious in our suggestion to people to be aware of issues and once we told people that we understood it better \u2013 that it was okay to post their American flags.\u201d\n\nThe star-spangled banner has survived bombs bursting in air and the rocket\u2019s red glare \u2013 only to be done-in by an ordinance that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nAs politically correct as our nation has become, I never thought I would see the day when American flags would be banned from a barbecue competition. That\u2019s something you would expect to happen at a vegetarian cook-off.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nothing says America quite like smoking a pork butt and flying Old Glory..05/25/2016 20:06:42PM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Nothing says America quite like smoking a pork butt and flying Old Glory.", "title": "- Stop the Insanity: BBQ Pitmasters Told to Take Down American Flags", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/03/03/stop-the-insanity-bbq-pitmasters-told-to-take-down-american-flags-n1965215", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/3/46.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Nothing says America quite like smoking a pork butt and flying Old Glory.", "title": "- Stop the Insanity: BBQ Pitmasters Told to Take Down American Flags", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/03/03/stop-the-insanity-bbq-pitmasters-told-to-take-down-american-flags-n1965215", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/3/46.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Stop the Insanity: BBQ Pitmasters Told to Take Down American Flags, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf14e\"", "article_summary": "So they investigated a local ordinance even though the city maintains there is no local ordinance banning the flying of American flags?\nNot too long after, one of the organizers of the event told Jeff to take down the flag.\nAs politically correct as our nation has become, I never thought I would see the day when American flags would be banned from a barbecue competition.\nIt happened Feb. 27th at the Sam\u2019s Club National BBQ Competition in Daphne, Ala., sponsored by the Kansas City Barbecue Society.\nAnd why would the Kansas City Barbecue Society blame the city of Daphne \u2013 when in fact the city of Daphne did nothing wrong?"}
