Dell SecureWorks partnered with the FBI in Pittsburgh to neutralize a software attack by Russian hackers, who later were indicted by a federal grand jury. But Houle said online threats are constant. Every day, Dell SecureWorks: \u2022 Processes 73 billion cyber events. \u2022 Uses counter-threat software to narrow those events down to 5.3 billion security events of interest. Most of those are determined to be benign events that are logged and stored, but security analysts further review 12,580 events. Of those, analysts identify 3,639 security threats of concern and notify the customer. Related .pdfs\n\nCan't view the attachment?

That free email service is provided by the Chinese partner of Cayman Islands-based NetEase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the trading symbol NTES and has outstanding shares valued at nearly $10 billion.\n\n\u201cObviously when it's (an) overseas system, particularly in a country like China or Russia that's unlikely to be cooperative, U.S. law enforcement would be very limited in accessing those communications,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer at CrowdStrike in Irvine, Calif.\n\nHis hacker defense company issued a report this month accusing Chinese military hackers of using free email services from 163.com and two other providers with Cayman Islands partners that trade in the United States. The companies provide email services that can be used by anyone, similar to Yahoo and Google's Gmail in the United States.\n\nWhen messages pass through computer servers in the United States, American authorities can obtain court approval to read the communications secretly, former CIA Director Michael Hayden told the Trib. He and others blame former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden for showing criminals the details of America's online surveillance, including the feds' ability to track email accounts.\n\n\u201cThe bad guys have known for many, many years that if they have infrastructure here, we can get criminal process on it if they're doing criminal activity,\u201d said J. Keith Mularski, the FBI's supervisory special agent in charge of cyber crime, who is based in Pittsburgh.\n\nBecause of Chinese laws against foreign ownership of Internet companies, the connections between American investors and mainland email providers are not direct. Investors in NetEase do not actually own the Chinese company, Guangzhou NetEase, which operates email services. Instead, NetEase and Guangzhou NetEase have contractual relationships. That allows the Chinese mainland company to sidestep the law and receive foreign investment.\n\nSpokesmen for NetEase did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLegal \u2018uncertainties'\n\nThese types of relationships between American investors and Chinese companies, called \u201cvariable interest entities,\u201d are common but untested in legal systems, said Paul Gillis, an international business expert at Peking University in Beijing.\n\nSo far, Chinese courts have never enforced them when challenged, he said. In a few cases, the Chinese partner has run away with the investment money. In others, foreign investors lack reliable ways of researching the mainland partner.\n\nAlibaba, a Chinese competitor to online shopping sites such as eBay, expects to have the largest initial public offering this summer. It is structured so investors will own shares in an offshore company that has contracts with the online operator.\n\nAn Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe company warns investors in its prospectus that its corporate structure has risks: \u201cThese contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership.\u201d\n\nIf a contract dispute comes up, the company says, the offshore partner can pursue the case in court \u201csubject to uncertainties in the (Chinese) legal system.\u201d\n\nAlibaba's offshore company has minimized the investment risk by limiting the assets controlled by the mainland partner, Gillis said.\n\n\u201cBut shareholders will not own critical assets,\u201d he said, \u201cand are investing following the \u2018greater fool' theory \u2014 that they will eventually find another investor willing to pay more for the same flawed structure before anything goes wrong.\u201d\n\nAlibaba is so big and so essential to China's online economy that investors should not worry about the country intervening, said Matthew Turlip, an analyst at PrivCo in New York.\n\n\u201cThe overall size and scale of it will carry it past some of the other issues that might concern investors,\u201d Turlip said.\n\nAmerican law enforcement authorities contend it should be in China's self-interest to police its own online operators for criminal activity.\n\nCoalition building\n\nWhen it built a case against Russian criminal hackers, the FBI formed a coalition among 12 countries and the European Union. That kind of international cooperation is happening more often as foreign governments realize the danger of online attacks, the FBI's Mularski said.\n\n\u201cAs their laws are evolving, the other countries are understanding that cyber has affected them, too,\u201d he said.\n\nMovement toward international cooperation has been a \u201cslow march,\u201d but countries that have not participated before can gain from the experience of those that have, said Kevin Houle, director of Counter Threat Unit Intelligence at Dell SecureWorks in Atlanta. His company worked with the FBI to neutralize the Russian malware called \u201cGameover Zeus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt helps to have a teacher-learner situation where agencies or researchers in one country figure out how something works ... and share that experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of these take-downs progresses the collective capability.\u201d\n\nAs countries expand online for commerce and infrastructure, they have to realize that hacking ignores international borders, said U.S. Attorney David Hickton, who oversees Western Pennsylvania and brought indictments against five Chinese hackers and one Russian.\n\nWith other offenses such as offshore money laundering, he said, the federal government has charged people and companies that made the crimes possible. With Internet thefts, other countries \u2013 even China \u2013 need to realize the risks to their own people, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat takes a person a lifetime to accumulate or a company maybe generations to develop as an asset base can be stolen in an instant,\u201d Hickton said. \u201cEverybody has to be concerned about that.\u201d\n\nAndrew Conte is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
