BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker is urging the owners of the Pilgrim nuclear plant to take “corrective actions” in response to concerns raised by federal regulators.

In a letter Thursday to Entergy Nuclear Operations, Baker called on the company to analyze the root causes of previous shutdowns at the Plymouth plant and make all necessary repairs.

The letter was sent to New Orleans-based Entergy a day after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was ramping up inspections at the facility. The plant shut down automatically during a January blizzard when an electric connection to the grid was interrupted.

The Republican governor told reporters Wednesday that he had confidence in the safety of the plant and noted in his letter that the NRC has determined that Pilgrim continues to operate safely.
