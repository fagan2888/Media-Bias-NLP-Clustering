It\u2019s the law, and barring a significant legislative move, it\u2019s here to stay. But there are some deadlines you should be aware of when shopping for health insurance, considering an insurance change or simply as a consumer of the health care system.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to purchasing health insurance.\n\nACA Timeline\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, was signed into law more than four years ago. Since then, several important dates have served as benchmarks in the evolution of ACA health care reform.\n\n2010: The ACA was signed into law; a Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights went into effect and no-cost preventive care began for Americans under some health care plans.\n\n2011: Free preventive care was extended to Medicare recipients, and some also received a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions.\n\n2012: The Supreme Court determined that the upcoming Medicaid expansion \u2014 designed to give more low-income Americans access to the state-sponsored health coverage \u2014 would be optional for states.\n\n2013: The first open enrollment began in October 2013, allowing Americans to enroll in ACA-compliant health insurance plans and have access to primary tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies to make such plans more affordable.\n\nNeed more information on Obamacare tax credits?

The first open enrollment period concluded on March 31.\n\nACA Deadlines and Important Dates\n\nWith 2014 drawing to a close, it\u2019s once again time to consider your health insurance coverage, and there are several important dates to be aware of:\n\nNov. 15, 2014: Open enrollment begins for the 2015 calendar year\n\nDec. 15, 2014: The last date you can enroll for coverage effective Jan. 1, 2015\n\nDec. 31, 2014: Coverage ends for all 2014 Marketplace plans\n\nJan. 1, 2015: Coverage can begin for 2015 plans\n\nFeb. 15, 2015: ACA open enrollment for 2015 ends\n\nIf you\u2019re enrolling in a new plan, you\u2019ll also want to pay attention to the date you sign up, as it will affect the date your coverage begins.\n\nCoverage start dates:\n\nJan. 1, 2015 for plans purchased during open enrollment before Dec. 15, 2014.\n\nFeb. 1, 2015 for plans purchased between Dec. 16, 2014, and Jan. 15, 2015.\n\nMarch 1, 2015 for plans purchased between Jan. 16 and Feb. 15, the date open enrollment ends.\n\nWhat is open enrollment?\n\nOpen enrollment is the period when you can sign up for new health insurance or make changes to your existing plan. For plans purchased on the federal Obamacare marketplace and state exchanges, it runs through Feb. 15, 2015.\n\nOpen enrollment is also available for people who receive health insurance through their employers, though the dates vary from company to company. If you\u2019re unsure of when open enrollment is available at your job, talk to your human resources department or direct supervisor.\n\nRead here for NerdWallet\u2019s guide to navigating open enrollment.\n\nObamacare and the implementation of the ACA have been filled with important dates and deadlines, and with open enrollment coming around annually, that isn\u2019t going to change anytime soon. Your best bet as a health care consumer is to stay informed and ask questions when you\u2019re unsure of a date, definition or how something affects you.\n\n[4 in 5 medical bills contain errors.
