The 46-year-old mother of three, who lives in Clarkston, Michigan, struggles every day with numbness, pain and extreme fatigue.\n\nKAREN WINKLER: It\u2019s so overwhelming. You wake up tired. And as the day progresses, it just gets worse and worse. And it\u2019s where you could fall asleep standing up.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In 2005, Winkler\u2019s doctor prescribed a brand-name medication called Provigil. It was one of the only drugs for fatigue on the market that had minimal side effects. It was made by a company called Cephalon, which earned $475 million dollars on Provigil that year. Winkler\u2019s doctor put her on a half pill, every day.\n\nKAREN WINKLER: It was perfect, you know. I had three young kids and I could still do- pretty much do everything that I did. And, you know, if I had 10 things on the to-do list, you know, I could either get the 10 things done or at least eight or nine of them.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Better yet, Winkler says her doctor told her Provigil was expected to go generic soon \u2013 possibly within a year. And that could have saved Winkler more than a thousand dollars a year. The potential savings were especially important because her disease made it impossible to go back to work as she\u2019d planned. And around that same time, her husband\u2019s pay was cut and the family had to dip into savings and a 401(k).\n\nKAREN WINKLER: Then it didn\u2019t go generic. And it was a whole different story.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Not only did it not go generic \u2026 the price inexplicably started to rise.\n\nKAREN WINKLER: It was six-something a pill. And then it was seven-something a pill. In 2010, it had gone up to, like, 16-something a pill. It was astronomical at the time.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Winkler\u2019s out-of-pocket cost for a six-month supply went from around $300 in 2008 to more than $700 in 2010.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: So, could you afford that?\n\nKAREN WINKLER: No. That was a car payment and plus. And with three young kids and, you know, feeding them, and I felt guilty that I was taking away from the family budget.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Her condition was getting worse and she couldn\u2019t afford to take a higher dose of Provigil. So she decided to try a less expensive generic version of a different drug. It turned out not to be as effective, and made her shaky and jittery. Her reaction to not getting the drugs she said she needed?\n\nKAREN WINKNLER: I thought, how can this be legal, how can this be \u2013 It\u2019s definitely not moral. It\u2019s not humane. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Why hadn\u2019t Provigil gone generic? And why was the price of it rising so sharply? As Winkler discovered through online research, the company manufacturing the drug, Cephalon, was using two common but little known business strategies that critics say end up costing consumers. First, there\u2019s something that opponents call, \u201cpay for delay.\u201d\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Here\u2019s how \u201cpay for delay\u201d works. According to the Federal Trade Commission, when generic manufacturers challenge a patent, the brand-name manufacturer sometimes pays to keep the generic version off the market.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In the case of Karen\u2019s drug, the company that makes Provigil paid a total of $200 million to four generic companies. That deal guaranteed no generic would come to market for another six years.\n\nMARKUS MEIER: At its simplest level, we\u2019re talking about an agreement between a brand company and a generic company, in which the brand company pays the generic company not to launch a generic in competition with the brand.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Markus Meier is an assistant director in the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Competition. He says fighting these so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d deals is one of the FTC\u2019s top priorities.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: It brought a lawsuit in 2008, alleging \u201canticompetitive conduct by Cephalon to prevent lower-cost generic competition.\u201d The case has yet to go to trial. A separate class action lawsuit has been filed by health plans and drug wholesalers against Cephalon and the four generic manufacturers alleging \u201cunlawful exclusion of generic competition from the market.\u201d\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: And just last summer, the Supreme Court issued a major ruling in another FTC case that could open the door for more lawsuits against drug manufacturers involved in similar practices.\n\nMARKUS MEIER: If you can keep the generic out, the brand can continue to make all the sales at the monopoly price and still pay the generic to make it worthwhile for them to stay out of the market.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: What does the FTC say is at stake for consumers?\n\nMARKUS MEIER: Billions of dollars. We\u2019ve done a study of this back in 2010 where we really studied this very carefully and we estimated that it cost American consumers about $3.5 billion a year.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Deals like this have affected the rollout of generic versions of popular drugs such as Tamoxifen for cancer, Lipitor for high cholesterol, and Nexium for heartburn.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: It might not surprise you that what opponents call \u201cpay for delay\u201d deals, the drug companies describe completely differently. The generic manufacturers say the negotiated settlements they reach with brand -name drug manufacturers actually serve consumers well. How? Because, they say, under those deals, generic drugs hit the market before the brand drug\u2019s patent expires \u2014 and only because generic companies challenged those patents in the first place.\n\nRALPH NEAS: Do we work out compromise? Proudly, I say yes.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Ralph Neas is president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. Neas says the settlements help avoid costly and time-consuming court trials over the drug patent challenges. And, he points to one study showing generic manufacturers succeed less than half the time when they do end up in court.\n\nRALPH G. NEAS: We may have no better than a 50/50 chance of winning, maybe less. Maybe we can put something on the table that would be a bridge to a compromise. This has been part of the successful equation that have gotten affordable medicines to consumers sooner.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Your opponents would say that if it weren\u2019t for these payments that were being made, these drugs may have come to market even sooner.\n\nRALPH G. NEAS: On average, a patent settlement will get the medicine to the market 60 months in advance of the patent expiration. Sometimes you go all the way and you might get ten years or eight years sooner. But if you are pretty sure you can get five or six or seven years, it\u2019s better taking that five or six or seven years rather than rolling the dice and getting nothing for the consumers you\u2019re trying to serve.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In each of these cases, the generic does end up coming to market months, sometimes even years before that patent in question expires. So, isn\u2019t that good for consumers?\n\nMARKUS MEIER: Well, the fact that the generic comes in earlier could, in theory, be better, but you have to compare it to the likelihood that the generic would have come even earlier. So, take, for example, Provigil. It\u2019s true that there is a generic in the market today. But we contend that but for this agreement, consumers would have had access to a generic all the way back in 2006. And there would have been years and years of savings that consumers would have enjoyed had they launched in 2006.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: But because of what critics describe as those \u201cpay for delay\u201d deals, Provigil didn\u2019t go generic. So Karen Winkler and other consumers paid the price. And it turns out she paid even more because of that second controversial business strategy that Cephalon used then and other drug manufacturers continue to use today \u2014 something opponents call \u201cevergreening.\u201d The idea is to get consumers off the drug they\u2019re taking and on to another brand drug the same company is making.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In Winkler\u2019s case \u2014 off Provigil whose patent was about to expire. \u2014 and onto Nuvigil, whose patent had several years to run. Companies sometimes do this by jacking up prices on the first drug. That\u2019s what happened to Winkler when, seeking relief from the rising price of Provigil, her doctor offered her Nuvigil.\n\nKAREN WINKLER: So, I thought, \u201cGreat. You know, here\u2019s a solution.\u201d Came home and I started taking the pills for two or three days and got a pounding, pounding headache from it. And- To the point that it was almost like having a migraine.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: That\u2019s when Winkler went online and figured out what was going on.\n\nKAREN WINKLER: And what they were trying to do was to get patients off of Provigil, because they knew it was going to be going generic shortly, to start taking this Nuvigil that had this new, extended patent period. And then obviously once Provigil went generic, everybody on Nuvigil would not be going to a generic drug. They would be still on the Nuvigil.\n\nMARKUS MEIER: It\u2019s very rare for patients to switch back once the generic comes into the marketplace. So, it\u2019s a strategy for the brand to be able to hold on to the market longer- even after there\u2019s a generic in the marketplace.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: This is one area where the Generic Pharmaceutical Association and the FTC find common ground.\n\nRALPH G. NEAS: That\u2019s keeping affordable medicine from people who desperately need it. And we\u2019re very much against it and it\u2019s a big issue.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: What does Provigil\u2019s manufacturer, Cephalon, have to say about the two business strategies? The company was acquired by another drugmaker, Teva, in 2011. In a statement to NewsHour about the first, so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d strategy,\u201d that company said:\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: \u201cTeva believes that the PROVIGIL\u00ae settlement agreements are lawful and served to increase competition, and the Company intends to defend them vigorously.\u201d\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In response to the second strategy of \u201cevergreening,\u201d Teva had no comment.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: When Provigil finally went generic in 2012, the price for Karen Winkler fell from more than $700 to around $16 for a three-month supply. Winkler was able to go back on the drug \u2026 and take the full dose. She says it\u2019s made all the difference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are generic drugs being delayed to market by so-called \"pay for delay\" deals between drug companies?
