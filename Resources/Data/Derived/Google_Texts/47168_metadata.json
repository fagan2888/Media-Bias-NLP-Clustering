The left is the party of the future; the right, the party of the past. Liberals believe in progress and the new; conservatives, in tradition and the old. Hope versus history, morrow versus memory, utopia versus reality: these are the stuff of our great debates.\n\nIn \u201cThe Reactionary Mind,\u201d I argued that this view of the political divide is incorrect, at least as it pertains to the right. Beginning with Burke, conservatives have been less committed to tradition or the past than to a hierarchical vision of society. In Burke\u2019s case, it was aristocrats over commoners; in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it would be masters over slaves, employers over employees, husbands and men over women and wives. And so it remains: the most consistent feature of contemporary American conservatism is the GOP\u2019s war on reproductive freedom and worker rights.\n\nWhen it comes to history, conservatives have demonstrated a flexibility about time best captured by an aristocratic character in \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d Giuseppe Di Lampedusa\u2019s novel about nineteenth-century Sicily: \u201cIf we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.\u201d In defense of an established order of power, any innovation can be countenanced, any past disposed of. Time, in other words, is not the key.\n\nBut if the right\u2019s window does not open onto the past, must the left\u2019s open onto the future? Not necessarily, claim two fascinating new books: Steve Fraser\u2019s \u201cThe Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power\u201d and Kristin Ross\u2019s \u201cCommunal Luxury: The Political Imaginary of the Paris Commune.\u201d When it comes to past and future, they show, the left can be as ambidextrous as the right. What\u2019s more, it may be the left\u2019s ability to look backward while marching forward that explains its most potent moments of power and possibility.\n\nFraser is our preeminent historian of America as a capitalist civilization. No one is more attuned to the inner vibrations of our monied culture: the brazen fantasies of its wildest speculators, the embittered rage of its most abject victims, how the market both awakens desire and stokes dreams of revenge. Writing a prose of sinuous beauty, Fraser has brought a sense of high literature to everything from labor leader Sidney Hillman to Wall Street, reminding one of those poets the critic Floyd Dell once described as \u201cseismographs of social disturbance.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cAge of Acquiescence,\u201d Fraser pursues a comparison often noted between our time and what Mark Twain called \u201cThe Gilded Age,\u201d those decades of the last turn of the century when wealth and power were gathered at the top and powerlessness and poverty collected at the bottom. Why, Fraser asks, do workers and citizens today accede to the inequalities and injustices of capitalism that they refused to accept 100 to 150 years ago? After the Civil War, farmers and workers responded to the explosion of corporate power and financial wealth with desperate acts of violence and audacious feats of political creativity. The reason they could see a utopia beyond industrial capitalism, says Fraser, is that they remembered a reality before industrial capitalism. Their vision of the future was fueled by a memory of the past.\n\nIn 1820, 80% of Americans were self-employed; by 1940, 80% worked for someone\u2014or something\u2014else. \u201cThe individual has gone,\u201d declared John D. Rockefeller, \u201cnever to return.\u201d Driven into the mills and the mines or onto the rails, these refugees from the shop and the farm were injured, maimed, or killed (35,000 per year) by industrial capitalism. They were the lucky ones. Many Americans couldn\u2019t get work at all. In the 1870s, unemployment became a census category for the first time. So desperate were jobless New Yorkers that they got themselves arrested just to enjoy a night off the streets, in jail. They also struck, marched, organized, bombed and killed, launching decades of class warfare, literal and metaphoric, that would haunt the country\u2019s elites for years to come.\n\nThe fact of unemployment, Fraser writes, struck these men and women \u201cas shocking, unnatural, and traumatic,\u201d as did the astronomic new wealth of the nation\u2019s plutocrats. That\u2019s because they remembered a life before wage labor and their pervasive dependence on\u2014and the compulsion of\u2014the market. So powerful was this memory of a pre-capitalist past that it framed the way they understood their enemies: well into the twentieth century, Fraser reminds us, FDR was railing against \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d and \u201cTories of industry.\u201d Not merely as propaganda but as a residue of the world not long ago left behind.\n\nBut it was precisely that memory, Fraser argues, that shock of the new, that made these rebels so ready to demand something even newer: a cooperative commonwealth, in which production would be collectively managed and profit democratically shared. Scandalized by the novelty of capital, they did not opt for an escapist nostalgia. They instead turned to the state, traditionally an object of opprobrium, and demanded that it assume new responsibilities: take over industry, tax wealth, supply credit, store surpluses\u2014all for the sake of a vision drawn from a pre-capitalist past:\n\nIt is undeniable that the movement owed its fervor and sense of political and moral peril to the republican, smallholder mentality of the Revolution. Passionate attachments to immemorial traditions and ancient creeds\u2014one might say to a useable or empowering past\u2014were conjoined to creative methods of reconfiguring the future, all as a way of escaping the torments of an intolerable or even fatal present.\n\nWhat Fraser shows, with vivid set pieces drawn from the nation\u2019s most violent battlefields, is that far from presenting itself as the enemy, the past was viewed by workers and farmers as a resource and an ally. In part because the capitalist right so heartily embraced the rhetoric of progress and the future (no one, it seems, was content with the present). But more than that, historical memory enabled workers and farmers to see beyond the horizon of the capitalist present, to know, in their bones, what Marx was constantly struggling to imprint upon the mind of the left: that capitalism was but one mode of economic life, that its existence was contingent and historical rather than natural and eternal, and that because there was a past in which it did not exist there might be a future when it would cease to exist. Like the nation, capitalism rests upon repeated acts of forgetting; a robust anti-capitalism asks us to remember.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right is less committed to tradition than hierarchy.
