Entitlements are a completely different matter and being called a \u2018Veteran\u2019 does not immediately transfer entitlements to the individual. The RSL has not wanted to discriminate between service members because it is important to us that we engage with everyone who has served regardless of where, when and for how long.\u201d\n\nRSL National President Ken Doolan told News Corp that the term \u201cveteran\u201d had meaning under the Act, but many younger veterans don\u2019t like it because it makes them sound old.\n\nUnder the Act there is no specific definition, but only those who have \u201cwarlike\u201d service can apply for certain entitlements.\n\nFor example those who have had operational \u201cwarlike\u201d service can apply for a Veterans Gold Card at age 70 when those who hadn\u2019t deployed could not.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get hung up on words and we want to be as inclusive as possible,\u201d Admiral Doolan said.\n\n\u201cNo one size fits all and really people can call themselves what they want.\u201d\n\nIraq War Veteran Aaron Gray, who served seven months as a gunner on a light armoured vehicle in 2006-07 said he has always believed the \u201cveteran\u201d term applied only to those who had deployed on operations.\n\n\u201cI have always felt a bit odd when people who have not deployed overseas have referred to themselves as a veteran,\u201d Mr Gray said.\n\n\u201cFor me it a term reserved for someone who has served their country in conflict.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Queensland Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Federation Malcolm Wheat supported the RSL position.\n\n\u201cDuring the 1970s and 1980s there was a long period when there were no overseas deployments. Should those people have their service to the country reduced? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnybody who serves deserves recognition.\u201d\n\nMr Wheat said it was time to breakdown the \u201cthem and us\u201d attitudes in the veteran community.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "WHEN is a veteran not a war veteran?", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "WHEN is a veteran not a war veteran?", "title": "Veteran debate heats up", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/national/rsl-defines-veteran-as-anyone-who-has-served-in-a-uniform/news-story/4db28d71fbf1f065b4487ea5f8c508b7", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/239f2f736e9ebb3bdcbe71ab82220f63", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newscomauHQ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Veteran debate heats up"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": "4db28d71fbf1f065b4487ea5f8c508b7", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "war veteran,heated arguments,Albany commemorative service,national defence writer,centenary event,benign deployments,service categories,military uniform,entitlements assistance,service members,Veteran debate,South Australia,Australia,Bomaderry,New South Wales,News Corporation,Queensland Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Federation Malcolm Wheat,Iraq War Veteran Aaron Gray,Eric Maxton,Ken Doolan,Daniel Wilkins", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "published_time": "2015-08-08T12:00:00.000Z", "publicationdate": "08/08/2015", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T04:44:38.000Z", "author": "Ian McPhedran"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Ian McPhedran The Daily TelegraphWHEN is a veteran not a war veteran?\nFor decades that question has generated heated arguments in RSL clubs, pubs and lounge rooms across the nation.\n\u201cFor me it a term reserved for someone who has served their country in conflict.\u201dPresident of the Queensland Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Federation Malcolm Wheat supported the RSL position.\nFor example those who have had operational \u201cwarlike\u201d service can apply for a Veterans Gold Card at age 70 when those who hadn\u2019t deployed could not.\nEntitlements are a completely different matter and being called a \u2018Veteran\u2019 does not immediately transfer entitlements to the individual."}
