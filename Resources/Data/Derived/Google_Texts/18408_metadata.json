Less than 48 hours after The Atlantic published Hillary Clinton\u2019s critical comments about Obama\u2019s foreign policy, she walked them back. Spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement that Clinton called the president to \u201cmake sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership,\u201d adding that the two will \u201chug it out\u201d in Martha\u2019s Vineyard tonight. As we\u2019ve noted, Clinton\u2019s always been more hawkish than the president, but the handling of the interview and this apology just seem like more politically head-scratching decisions as she continues her book tour. The bottom line: This is not the first time Clinton and Obama are going to have a public split as Democrats transition from one standard-bearer to another. But is every one of those moments going to be as tortured as this one?\n\nNew fodder for the old narrative of the opportunistic Clintons\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the Clintons over the years has been the perception that they\u2019re political opportunists. Amid headlines about Obama\u2019s foreign policy numbers at all-time lows, Clinton slams him on just that issue? It\u2019s an easy peg. Regardless of whether Clinton was being willfully calculating or not, this episode will play into the same old narrative. Consider Maureen Dowd (true, no friend to the Clintons) just skewering her on this point in the NYT: \u201cWith the diplomatic finesse of a wrecking ball, the former diplomat gave an interview to The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a hawk, in a calculated attempt to be tough and show that, as a Democratic woman, she\u2019s not afraid to use power.\u201d\n\nFamily feud\n\nClinton\u2019s comments got a TON of play Monday and Tuesday (with the slow August news cycle partly to blame, by the way) and this conflict was also just starting to look like very bad electoral politics for Democrats. It gave Republicans the opportunity for a one-two punch: highlight factions within the president\u2019s party while also gleefully lashing Clinton to Obama\u2019s unpopularity. Former Obama right hand man David Axelrod prodded Clinton on Twitter with a not-so-subtle reminder to Dems of Clinton\u2019s Iraq authorization vote. And progressives got fired up too; just look at the wording of a MoveOn.org statement warning that Clinton and other Democrats should \u201cthink long and hard\u201d about backing policies \u201cadvocated by right-wing war hawks.\u201d If every split between Obama and Clinton is like this, it ain\u2019t going to be healthy for the party.\n\nAnd the coverage won\u2019t stop\n\nMerrill\u2019s suggestion that Clinton and Obama will \u201chug it out\u201d is hardly going to make coverage of potential splits between the two pols dissipate. The two are both slated to attend a \u201csocial gathering\u201d tonight at the home of Vernon Jordan in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The focus on their personal relationship helps detract from their policy differences, sure, but it\u2019s also a reminder that Obama has done plenty to boost her personally and politically \u2013 even at the expense of his vice president, by the way.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Hillary Clinton wants to \u2018hug it out\u2019 with Obama 2:22 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nAbout last night\n\nIn Connecticut, Tom Foley easily won the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial nod, setting up a rematch of that 2010 brawl against Dan Malloy. And in Minnesota, state party officials notched a victory with their favored candidate, Jeff Johnson, beating back three GOP challengers for the chance to run against incumbent Democrat Gov. Mark Dayton. First-time candidate Mike McFadden strolled to victory in the GOP primary to face Sen. Al Franken. And in Wisconsin, the November ballot is set with Mary Burke and incumbent Gov. Scott Walker ready to go into full general election mode \u2013 while the Sixth District race to replace Tom Petri is still up in the air.\n\nAnd lastly, many Americans could get an alarming surprise in their mailboxes this week\n\nAs Republicans try to get health care back into the midterm conversation, here\u2019s a headline that could help them out. The Washington Post reports that over 300,000 people in three dozen states will receive letters from federal health officials warning them that their coverage will be cut off if they don\u2019t provide proof of their citizenship or immigration status. Recipients will only have until September 5 to send documents to show they\u2019re eligible for their health coverage. BUT this may not be a total slam-dunk for the GOP; after all, making sure undocumented immigrants don\u2019t have access to Obamacare was a big Republican talking point during the health care debate.\n\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.
