That\u2019s about 87,798 annual deaths associated with heavy drinking. Excessive alcohol consumption is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths, along with the likes of smoking cigarettes, malnutrition, sexually-transmitted diseases, obesity, hypertension, and indoor air pollution.\n\nThe CDC and other alcohol experts see this study as a sign for doctors to take more initiative in testing their patients for excessive alcohol consumption. \u201cIn the pediatric and adult setting, it\u2019s critical that physicians regularly screen their patients for alcohol use,\u201d David H. Jernigan, director of the Johns Hopkins Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, told MedPage Today. \u201cHeavy drinking starts in adolescence.\u201d\n\nBinge drinking is defined as being five or more drinks on one occasion, and this accounted for 44 percent of the deaths in the study. Most of them were because of motor-vehicle accidents. But binge drinking was also responsible for other chronic diseases, like alcoholic liver disease, which was the second most common next to car accidents, as well as cancer and heart disease.\n\n\u201cPeople mostly think that there are two problems with alcohol \u2014 alcohol addiction and motor vehicle crashes,\u201d Jernigan told MedPage Today. \u201cThis study shows what other studies have shown \u2014 but in the general population \u2014 that there are so many other causes of death from alcohol, cancer [and] heart disease, as well as the other acute causes like drowning, falls, and so on.\u201d What\u2019s worse is that it\u2019s likely that the survey only captured about 30 percent of total alcohol intake. \u201cWe know how much is sold, and people are definitely under-reporting,\u201d Jernigan noted.\n\nThe CDC report is yet another reminder of how dangerous excessive alcohol consumption can be. \u201cThe substantial contribution of excessive alcohol consumption to total deaths and premature mortality among working-age adults (20\u201364 y) in the United States, as well as the large proportion of these deaths (69%) and YPLL (82%) that involved working-age adults, is consistent with studies assessing the contribution of harmful alcohol consumption to the global burden of disease and also reflects the substantial effect that excessive alcohol consumption has across the lifespan,\u201d the authors state.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcoholism, alcohol abuse, excessive drinking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new report out of the CDC pinpoints the startling amount of preventable deaths caused by excessive drinking in the U.S.", "title": "Binge Drinking Lies Behind 1 In 10 Deaths In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/binge-drinking-killing-you-excessive-alcohol-consumption-responsible-1-10-deaths-america-290196", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/binge-drinking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report out of the CDC pinpoints the startling amount of preventable deaths caused by excessive drinking in the U.S.", "title": "Binge Drinking Lies Behind 1 In 10 Deaths In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/binge-drinking-killing-you-excessive-alcohol-consumption-responsible-1-10-deaths-america-290196", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/binge-drinking.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/binge-drinking.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-26T17:17:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T17:17:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new report out of the CDC pinpoints the startling amount of preventable deaths caused by excessive drinking in the U.S."}, "article_summary": "The CDC report is yet another reminder of how dangerous excessive alcohol consumption can be.\n\u201cPeople mostly think that there are two problems with alcohol \u2014 alcohol addiction and motor vehicle crashes,\u201d Jernigan told MedPage Today.\nThe CDC and other alcohol experts see this study as a sign for doctors to take more initiative in testing their patients for excessive alcohol consumption.\n\u201cThe substantial contribution of excessive alcohol consumption to total deaths and premature mortality among working-age adults (20\u201364 y) in the United States, as well as the large proportion of these deaths (69%) and YPLL (82%) that involved working-age adults, is consistent with studies assessing the contribution of harmful alcohol consumption to the global burden of disease and also reflects the substantial effect that excessive alcohol consumption has across the lifespan,\u201d the authors state.\nExcessive alcohol consumption is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths, along with the likes of smoking cigarettes, malnutrition, sexually-transmitted diseases, obesity, hypertension, and indoor air pollution."}
