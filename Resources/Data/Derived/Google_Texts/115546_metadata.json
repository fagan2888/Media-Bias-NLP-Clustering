It\u2019s probably no coincidence that conventional political wisdom says any serious Republican contender for the 2016 presidential nomination needs a good ObamaCare repeal-and-replace package. Rest assured that Governor Jindal\u2019s knowledge of this proposal is encyclopedic. He not only knows what\u2019s in there, he knows exactly why, and he\u2019s prepared for the inevitable objections from ObamaCare defenders.\n\nFor example, he knows the Left will insist ObamaCare is impossible to repeal, universal coverage through the individual mandate is indispensable, and no alternative proposal will take care of patients with pre-existing conditions the way ObamaCare does. Jindal finds the \u201cimpossible to repeal\u201d argument \u201cridiculous\u201d for a nation that won two world wars and put men on the moon. He anticipates pressure for repeal growing as more of ObamaCare\u2019s deficiencies become apparent to the public. I asked him how he would respond to last-ditch arguments that we can\u2019t throw ObamaCare away because so much time and money has already been plowed into the effort. He said the costs of continuing the program will be so great that writing off the tortured billion-dollar websites will be a modest price to pay for escape, especially since his Freedom and Empowerment Plan includes features that will make a solid financial difference to people currently undergoing treatment for ObamaCare rate shock.\n\nNoting that ObamaCare is very, very far from guaranteeing universal coverage \u2013 he found bitter irony in the White House celebrating the achievement of covering less than a million new customers as of April 1 \u2013 Jindal said the individual mandate was the Left\u2019s way of doing things. His preferred approach involves competition, to develop the most efficient solutions and attract customers, rather than forcing them to buy insurance under threat of legal penalty. \u201cWhat we do is, we drive down costs, and give help to those who truly need it most,\u201d he said of his plan.\n\nAs for covering pre-existing conditions, Jindal touted the Freedom and Empowerment plan as superior to ObamaCare in that regard, especially concerning Americans with disabilities. The America Next brochure faults ObamaCare for putting too much effort into expanding Medicaid dependency among able-bodied, rather than helping the fairly small group of people who were actually having trouble buying insurance due to pre-existing conditions.\n\nMuch of Jindal\u2019s critique of ObamaCare focuses on its inefficiency and skewed priorities, particularly the overriding priority to expand federal control over individual American lives. The Freedom and Empowerment Plan takes the opposite approach, using ideas found in a number of ObamaCare alternative proposals \u2013 ideas that in many cases pre-date the Affordable Care Act by years \u2013 to decentralize power to the states and individuals, creating an atmosphere of competitive energy. The idea is to separate the most vulnerable from the general population and take care of them with premium supports and a reformed, decentralized Medicaid system, then bring the bulk of the population together in a nationwide marketplace of broad choices and portable coverage. Free to shop across state lines, empowered as the full owners of their own health insurance, Americans would enjoy the full benefits of market competition and reasonable regulatory protection\u2026 without expensive nanny-state fetishes that raise the cost of insurance, or offend individual moral conscience.\n\nJindal believes the key reforms in his plan would put average families a good $5,000 per year ahead of where ObamaCare has left them, a substantial increase in disposable income without any job-killing minimum wage hikes. He called for further savings through lawsuit reform, which he noted was exceptionally important when deep-pocketed Uncle Sam is paying the bills. As with virtually every politician who discusses health care, Jindal vowed to reform Medicaid, which is rampant with fraud and waste (and likely to get a lot worse as it gets bigger, under the Affordable Care Act.) Citing the successful efforts of several states to manage Medicaid costs, he described it as a job the federal government is not as well suited for, because state governments are more flexible, and more accountable to their residents.\n\nA great national marketplace would inspire competition between the states, as well as interstate insurance corporations. Often overlooked in the drive to put everything under Washington\u2019s central control is the value of competition for political entities, as well as private-sector business operations. With all those companies and state regulations to choose from, Jindal is confident that consumers could find affordable insurance that meets their needs. There would also be less of what he described as \u201cpolitical distortion and favoritism\u201d if the system was removed from Washington\u2019s control, not to mention a great reduction in the arbitrary executive power that ObamaCare has vested in the Administration. It\u2019s easy to see why central planning enthusiasts and high-rolling aristo-bureaucrats would hate to lose all that lovely micromanaging power\u2026 but why should the rest of us hesitate to take it away from them?\n\nPrivate-sector \u201coligopolies,\u201d as Jindal repeatedly described them, would take it on the chin from a more competitive environment as well. One probably with chopping the U.S. into fifty separate insurance markets is that it\u2019s easier for a couple of big players to dominate them, especially in states that have laws making it tough for smaller competitors to enter the marketplace. A great national arena of competition is the best cure for a bad case of oligopoly.\n\nJindal gave an interesting discussion of using tax deductions for insurance purchases, instead of refundable tax credits, which are prone to abuse. The chief argument against using deductions is that it leaves low-income people who have no net tax liability out in the cold. Jindal proposes handling their needs with a straightforward and transparent grant of $100 billion to state governments, asserting that it\u2019s better to handle their needs above the table, rather than distorting the tax system and employment for everyone else with credits. Once again, this is the opposite of ObamaCare\u2019s vision of socializing health insurance by lumping everyone into the same system \u2013 a vision that gives us the absurdity of healthy young people paying sky-high premiums to subsidize older, less healthy, but often wealthier insurance buyers.\n\nJindal wants it known that he\u2019s enthusiastic about the Freedom and Empowerment Plan on its merits, not just because Republicans are required to have some sort of ObamaCare replacement plan tucked into their back pockets, or because he\u2019s mightily sick and tired of President Obama claiming none of his critics have any alternative suggestions (although the Governor is indeed sick and tired of that.) \u201cThis is something I care about, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a liberal issue or a Democratic issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an American issue. I think conservative principles work better on health care, just like they work in education policy and other areas. We should be bold in going out there and saying the Left\u2019s ideas don\u2019t work, and our ideas are better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Competition is the key to efficiency in this alternative to ObamaCare.", "title": "Bobby Jindal's Freedom and Empowerment Plan | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jindal_freedomplan-480x292.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/04/02/bobby-jindals-freedom-and-empowerment-plan/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Competition is the key to efficiency in this alternative to ObamaCare.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jindal_freedomplan-480x292.jpg", "description": "Competition is the key to efficiency in this alternative to ObamaCare.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3cd\"", "article_summary": "Daily Events TopAs honorary chairman of America Next, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal hosted a conference call to introduce the group\u2019s proposal for replacing ObamaCare, The Freedom and Empowerment Plan.\nAs for covering pre-existing conditions, Jindal touted the Freedom and Empowerment plan as superior to ObamaCare in that regard, especially concerning Americans with disabilities.\n\u201cWhat we do is, we drive down costs, and give help to those who truly need it most,\u201d he said of his plan.\nHe not only knows what\u2019s in there, he knows exactly why, and he\u2019s prepared for the inevitable objections from ObamaCare defenders.\nJindal gave an interesting discussion of using tax deductions for insurance purchases, instead of refundable tax credits, which are prone to abuse."}
