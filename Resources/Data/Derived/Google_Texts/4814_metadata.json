Instead, she focused on selling her book, Hard Choices, which focuses on her foreign policy opinions and diplomatic chops.\n\nBut this week, during a videotaped speech to a conference on women's issues in Japan, Clinton staked out a strong view on paid family leave, a topic that could play a role in her 2016 campaign. \"The United States, unfortunately, is one of a handful of developed countries without paid family leave,\" she said, according to the Wall Street Journal. \"If we give parents the flexibility on the job and paid family leave it actually helps productivity, which in turn helps all of us.\"\n\nClinton was asked about family leave during a CNN-hosted town hall in June, and said it was a good idea but one that won't come to America anytime soon. \"I don\u2019t think, politically, we could get it now,\" she said.\n\nThe United States is one of just four countries where employers are not required to grant new mothers any paid time off after giving birth. Japan, on the other hand, offers 14 weeks.\n\nPaid family leave has been an increasingly important cause for progressives. Three states now buck the national trend and force employers to offer their employees time off. \"Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth\u2014now that's a pretty low bar,\" President Obama said in June. \"That, we should be able to take care of.\"\n\nRepublicans have resisted calls for offering maternity leave, as it would force company's to spend more on employee benefits. But polls consistently show that the public is overwhelmingly supportive of such measures. \"For her 2016 campaign, Clinton should make paid family leave a\u2014no; the!\u2014central plank,\" the Daily Beast's Michael Tomasky wrote in July. Clinton's past profile on domestic politics largely centered on her experience and wisdom on finding ways to offer universal health insurance\u2014a topic that is mostly off the national radar thanks to Obamacare. If she wants to run for president again, anchoring her campaign on getting the US in line with the international consensus of letting workers take a bit of paid time off to take care of newborns or a sick loved one seems like a no-brainer.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "\"I don\u2019t think, politically, we could get it now.\"", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Strong parental leave laws are great.
