Photo: Getty Images\n\nFrom the shopping list of players who could have replaced Mitchell Marsh for the Boxing Day Test, none screamed, \"Pick me!\", but Joe Burns now has a chance to fill the void in Australian batting towards next year's Ashes and beyond.\n\nJostling to replace the injured Marsh were a handful of veterans (Ed Cowan, Adam Voges and Callum Ferguson), some all-rounders (James Faulkner, Moises Henriques and Dan Christian) and a young, dependable batsman who has been on the verge of something for a few seasons (Burns).\n\nThe decision to go with the 25-year-old Queenslander says the selectors are thinking about the future, that Cowan's window for a Test recall has probably closed, and that they believe they can get by with Shane Watson's bowling to support the frontline quicks.\n\nAll about Joe Burns.\n\nTwo things, beyond his 439 runs at 54 in the Sheffield Shield so far this season, set Burns apart from the rest. He can slot into the Test team anywhere in the top six, and he's young.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, combined with a solid first-class average of 42 from 45 matches, make him a rare commodity in an Australian batting landscape that is much poorer for the loss of Phillip Hughes, not to mention the season-ending knee injury to Usman Khawaja.\n\nWhile Cowan and Voges are the form batsmen in the country and would have been perfectly sound choices for one or two Tests, Cowan is a born and bred opener and Voges a middle-order specialist.\n\nWith the Test team likely to require further regeneration in the next 18 months, Marsh's injury presented the selectors with an ideal chance to find out about a possible future star.\n\n\"You're always trying to look ahead when you can, but you're still living in the moment,\" coach Darren Lehmann said. \"He gives us a little bit more flexibility compared to the other two [Cowan and Voges], they're more middle-order or opening basically. Very unlucky for those two, they've had great years. It does give us a bit of flexibility and a chance to play a guy who is young.\"\n\nChairman of selectors Rod Marsh and his predecessor have both lamented the slow emergence of young batting talent in recent years, so the panel had to be proactive.\n\n\"There's some really good players out there,\" Lehmann said. \"Obviously Phillip leaves a big hole in that line-up, as does Usman Khawaja, who's out for 12 months. So we've lost a couple of players there that we rate really highly. But the other players we've selected and are on the fringe are very good players. It's just they've got to get international cricket experience and play well. We hope Joe does that for us.\"\n\nSelectors Trevor Hohns and Mark Waugh watched Burns make a career-high 183 against a NSW attack spearheaded by Doug Bollinger at the Gabba last month, and believe he has the technique to succeed against quality fast bowling. He also showed in that innings he is capable of brutal hitting, attacking Test spinner Nathan Lyon. Now the selectors have to pick and stick with Burns, and give him a chance to establish himself before the Ashes.\n\nHis elevation, along with Chris Rogers' timely half-centuries in Brisbane where Lehmann quipped that he batted like Brian Lara, could spell the end of Cowan's quest to break back into the Test team despite his 590 runs at 65 so far this season.\n\nThe selection of a specialist batsman also has implications for Watson. Burns could bat as high as three, which could see Watson slide to six to resume his traditional all-rounder's role. He sent down 27.4 overs at the Gabba, building pressure and gaining edges, but hasn't shouldered that kind of load since the 2012 Hobart Test against Sri Lanka. He broke down with a calf strain in the next match, the Boxing Day Test, and will be hoping history doesn't repeat.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cricket", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "From the list of players who could have replaced Mitchell Marsh for the Boxing Day Test, none screamed, &quot;Pick me!&quot;, but Joe Burns has a chance to fill the void in Australian batting towards next year's Ashes and beyond.", "title": "Back Joe Burns in for the Ashes", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/joe-burns-the-proactive-choice-now-back-him-in-for-the-ashes-20141221-12bozg.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/2/b/s/4/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.12bozg.png/1419158796694.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/2/b/s/4/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.12bozg.png/1419158796694.jpg"}, "description": "From the list of players who could have replaced Mitchell Marsh for the Boxing Day Test, none screamed, \"Pick me!\", but Joe Burns has a chance to fill the void in Australian batting towards next year's Ashes and beyond.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Back Joe Burns in for the Ashes"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "From the list of players who could have replaced Mitchell Marsh for the Boxing Day Test, none screamed, \"Pick me!\", but Joe Burns has a chance to ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd236b\"", "article_summary": "\", but Joe Burns now has a chance to fill the void in Australian batting towards next year's Ashes and beyond.\nAll about Joe Burns.\nJoe Burns will be thrust into the spotlight at the MCG.\nHe can slot into the Test team anywhere in the top six, and he's young.\nNow the selectors have to pick and stick with Burns, and give him a chance to establish himself before the Ashes."}
