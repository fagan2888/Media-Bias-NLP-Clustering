Premier Inc. (NSDQ:PINC) says business is booming thanks to the Affordable Care Act and newly passed legislation reforming the Medicare provider payment process.

The North Carolina-based group purchasing organization said that both pieces of legislation are pushing providers away from fee-for-service payment models and toward value-based healthcare. Those systems, which rely on bundled payments based on performance, are pushing healthcare providers to sign on to the health management strategies Premier offers, the company said.

Premier said it inked 5 deals this year with providers in New York, Maryland and Arizona to develop clinically integrated care networks, and also put into place Medicare shared savings and state-based Medicaid payment models.

Separately, Premier is working with a number of New York hospitals to help them develop and launch alternative payment models through the state’s Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program, a Medicaid program designed to focus on health management and performance based payments.

Wes Champion, senior vice president of Premier Performance Partners, said providers realize that now is the time to change their systems.

"Premier members understand the need to build better partnerships with physicians to succeed under the new physician payment system," Champion said in prepared remarks. "Alternative payment models take time to structure and implement. For those that have not started, it’s clear that now is the time to build these capabilities."
