Paul LePage and Attorney General Janet Mills will reach the state\u2019s highest court in February, thanks to the governor\u2019s \u201crequest for opinion\u201d about Mills\u2019 refusal to represent him in court on two separate occasions.\n\nThe Republican governor wants the state\u2019s Supreme Judicial Court justices to weigh the \u201cproper constitutional responsibility and relationship between the chief executive and attorney general,\u201d according to a Jan. 23 letter he sent to Chief Justice Leigh Saufley.\n\nMills, a Democrat, has at least twice refused to represent LePage\u2019s administration in court.\n\nThe first instance involved a case between the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the federal government about whether the state could drop some 19- and 20-year-olds from its Medicaid rolls. Mills in 2012 argued that a \u201cmaintenance of effort\u201d provision of the federal Affordable Care Act prevented the state from cutting the young adults from the welfare rolls, so she refused to represent DHHS in the case.\n\nLast year, Mills again refused to represent LePage\u2019s administration in a lawsuit filed against it by the cities of Portland and Westbrook and the Maine Municipal Association. The cities and MMA argue that LePage did not follow the legally required procedure for amending General Assistance eligibility rules to exclude some immigrants, including asylum seekers. LePage instituted the rule change unilaterally \u2014 despite Mills\u2019 guidance that the rule change violated the U.S. and Maine constitutions \u2014 and has said he will withhold state funding from municipalities that don\u2019t follow his edict.\n\nIf the attorney general refuses to represent the state in court, the state must obtain her permission to hire an outside attorney. In both the cases above, Mills allowed LePage to hire his own lawyer. Both cases are ongoing.\n\nIn his letter to Saufley, LePage asked the law court to decide whether the attorney general should have what he described as \u201cde facto veto power,\u201d or if the executive branch should have the right to retain outside counsel without approval from the attorney general.\n\n\u201cA requirement to request permission from the attorney general implies that permission may be denied, which would leave the executive branch without legal representation and would deprive me, and the executive branch officers working in my direction, of the inherent and constitutional authority to carry out the policy priorities I set,\u201d LePage wrote.\n\nLePage also asked for the court\u2019s opinion on whether the attorney general should still be allowed to direct a piece of litigation on behalf of the state, even if she has filed a brief opposing the state\u2019s position. The question arises because Mills won intervenor status in the DHHS lawsuit in order to oppose DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew in court, yet still retains authority over the state\u2019s ability to obtain outside counsel \u2014 and thus its ability to continue appealing the case.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday afternoon, Mills said that her office had never denied LePage legal counsel \u2014 he had simply chosen not to heed that counsel.\n\n\u201cI wrote a legal memo explaining why, in the case of the ACA matter, the case lacked legal merit,\u201d Mills said. \u201cIn the General Assistance matter, my office had already rendered an opinion explaining why the rule couldn\u2019t go forward \u2014 because it was an unfunded mandate, because it lacked statutory authority and because of equal protection concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe give the administration our best legal advice,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact they chose to ignore us and forge ahead in some matter does not mean I have to represent them after having told them they were on shaky legal ground.\u201d\n\nLePage and Mills are regular foes, with each accusing the other of letting partisanship and petty politics poison the relationship between their respective offices. At one point last year, after Mills issued a statement urging the governor to comply with public access laws, LePage responded that a reporter could \u201ctell her to sue me.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, LePage has let slip that he wants to amend the state\u2019s constitution to remove the authority of the Legislature to elect the attorney general, instead putting the position to a popular election. LePage said that would make the AG more accountable to the people, and make it less likely for an attorney general and governor to be from different parties.\n\nMills has stressed that there are thousands of cases per year in which her office and LePage\u2019s administration work in tandem, compared with just a few where they butt heads. But she has not been afraid to offer her own harsh words to the governor. Last year, when LePage refused to sign financial orders to authorize the filling of vacant positions under Mills\u2019 purview, she accused the governor of \u201cmean-spirited\u201d political manipulation.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court has requested briefs from LePage, Mills and any other interested party be submitted by Friday, Feb. 6. Oral arguments on whether the court should offer an opinion, and on the questions of law he asked, will be heard by the court on Thursday, Feb. 26.\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The ongoing dispute between Gov.
