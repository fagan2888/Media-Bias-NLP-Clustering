Joe created 40 albums and toured extensively around the globe.\"\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer's most recent album, Fire It Up, was released two years ago.\n\nThe musician also went through personal struggles with drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn 2012, he discussed those struggles with NPR's Rachel Martin:\n\n\"I was about 26 years old, and I kind of felt indestructible,\" Cocker says, recalling the 1970 tour that spawned his famous live album Mad Dogs & Englishmen. \"By the early '70s, the drugs and the booze took their toll. ... It was a long road back. A lot of times when you're young and carefree, you don't realize, when you tip over the edge, how difficult it is to climb back in.\"\n\nThe story of the Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour was recounted for NPR back in 2005, by music critic Christian Bordal.\n\nThe tour, Bordal said, \"was a raucous, glorious mayhem of almost two dozen of the greatest players and singers of the time, presided over by the top-hatted and bell-bottomed band leader and arranger Leon Russell \u2014 and fronted by the volcanic, raw, soul-torn voice of Joe Cocker.\"\n\nCocker and the band performed a wide range of music, from recent hits to jazz standards. But the songs were transformed both by the band and by Cocker's powerful voice, which could slide from wistfulness to joy in just a few bars.\n\nCocker described the tour to Bordal as \"a pretty spacey kind of dream. It would probably fit in very good today, with reality TV.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2014 NPR.
