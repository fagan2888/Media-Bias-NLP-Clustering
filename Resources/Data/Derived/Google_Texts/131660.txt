Dear Abby: I’m comfortable with my faith and pray before a meal at home and at friends’ houses. We have become friendly with individuals from our church, and on many occasions have gone out to eat together at restaurants. When the meal is brought out, it has become a custom to pray. I feel uncomfortable praying aloud in public, and have seen others at our table already eating when someone says, “Let’s pray.”
