We've had reports of youth who have been exploited ... violated. It does happen,\" he said.Children who do test positive will receive an education that \"is actually much better than what is offered to youth at schools. Our state does not offer any education that is not abstinence only,\" said Lopez.Meanwhile, some children are not being tested and are being sent back to their countries of origin, and many have acquired HIV on their way to the United States, said Lopez.\"Some of them, unfortunately, will be sent home in worse shape from when they got here,\" Lopez said.HIV/AIDs is a serious issue along the border, reports The Valley Morning Star in Harlingen, Texas. An estimated one of every six people in the United States already do not know they are infected, and only one in four have the virus under control.Border populations are especially affected, the paper reports, because of complications ranging from fear of deportation to homophobia, poverty, and limited access to quality health care.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "illegal, immigrant, children, hiv, test", "pubdate": "2014-06-28T11:26:08", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Some of the children coming across the Mexican border are testing positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and a Texas health official says that some may have contracted the disease during their long journey north from Central America.", "title": "Illegal Immigrant Children Contracting HIV on Trip to US", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/illegal-immigrant-children-hiv/2014/06/28/id/579798/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/illegal-immigrant-children-hiv/2014/06/28/id/579798/", "title": "Illegal Immigrant Children Contracting HIV on Trip to US", "description": "Some of the children coming across the Mexican border are testing positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and a Texas health official says that some may have contracted the disease during their long journey north from Central America.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1403954768, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "illegal, immigrant, children, hiv, test", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-06-28T11:26:08"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/illegal-immigrant-children-hiv/2014/06/28/id/579798/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Some of the children coming across the Mexican border are testing positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and a Texas health official says that some may have contracted the disease during their long journey north from Central America."}, "article_summary": "\"(They) don't realize the exploitation that happens to children on a 2,000-mile trek.\nIt does happen,\" he said.Children who do test positive will receive an education that \"is actually much better than what is offered to youth at schools.\nOur state does not offer any education that is not abstinence only,\" said Lopez.Meanwhile, some children are not being tested and are being sent back to their countries of origin, and many have acquired HIV on their way to the United States, said Lopez.\nWe've had reports of youth who have been exploited ... violated.\n\"Some of them, unfortunately, will be sent home in worse shape from when they got here,\" Lopez said.HIV/AIDs is a serious issue along the border, reports The Valley Morning Star in Harlingen, Texas."}
