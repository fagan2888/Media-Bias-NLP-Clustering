Brian Sandoval and state officials on the board awarded the tech company after the Silver State Exchange terminated the company\u2019s $75 million contract for work related to the Affordable Care Act in May.\n\nThe state approved two Xerox contracts worth up to $7.8 million for auditing unclaimed property on behalf of the state treasurer in August.\n\nThe board\u2019s latest decision bumps Xerox\u2019s existing contract for DMV work to a value of $1.5 million and will last a year.\n\nXerox has had at least 11 contracts with the state since 1998.\n\nState documents show the original contract with the DMV was not competitively bid. Amendments to the original deal show the state has offered Xerox at least $8.3 million for work with the DMV in the last 17 years.\n\nThe tech company, known for its copy machines and office equipment, lost its health care contract after more than 1,500 glitches in its payment and billing software for health insurance plans subsidized by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state is in settlement negotiations with Xerox over the termination.\n\nXerox\u2019s health care unit was a different subsidiary than its entity working for the DMV.\n\nA LONG HISTORY\n\nXerox\u2019s work with the DMV and treasurer go back decades.\n\nXerox purchased auditing firm ACS in 2009. ACS had worked with the treasurer since 1986 and the DMV since 1991.\n\nXerox inherited those contracts when it bought ACS.\n\nFor the DMV, Xerox operates tax and licensing computer systems.\n\nAfter the board approved the contract, Sandoval told the Sun that Xerox was doing a \u201cfine job\u201d for the DMV, but the DMV system was \u201coutdated.\u201d\n\nIn his budget, he\u2019s proposed around $50 million in technology upgrades for state agencies.\n\nIf his proposals pass the Legislature, some of that money would be used to upgrade Xerox\u2019s system. The upgrades would be subject to competitive bidding, potentially ousting Xerox as Nevada\u2019s provider for that service, Sandoval said.\n\nAt the Treasurer\u2019s Office, Xerox audits have earned Nevada $71 million. The company finds financial assets abandoned by their owners and turn them over to the Treasurer\u2019s Office.\n\nXerox earns a 12 percent fee on the money it recovers and does not get any additional money from the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state Board of Examiners approved a $222,408 contract extension between Xerox State and Local Solutions and the Department of Motor Vehicles, highlighting another link between Nevada and the company that built flawed software for ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "The state Board of Examiners approved a $222,408 contract extension between Xerox State and Local Solutions and the Department of Motor Vehicles, highlighting another link between Nevada and the company that built flawed software for ...", "title": "State extends Xerox contract for DMV services", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2015/apr/14/state-extends-xerox-contract-dmv-services/", "image": "http://asset.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LasVegasSun", "image": "//media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/staff/2014/2014_Kyle_Roerink_322_t120.jpg?74788340517f3aca400342a7031f857fc2b12fbe", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "creator": "@KyleRoerink1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-14T14:08", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/kyle-roerink/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "article_summary": "State extends Xerox contract for DMV servicesThe state Board of Examiners approved a $222,408 contract extension between Xerox State and Local Solutions and the Department of Motor Vehicles, highlighting another link between Nevada and the company that built flawed software for the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nThe state approved two Xerox contracts worth up to $7.8 million for auditing unclaimed property on behalf of the state treasurer in August.\nThe board\u2019s latest decision bumps Xerox\u2019s existing contract for DMV work to a value of $1.5 million and will last a year.\nFor the DMV, Xerox operates tax and licensing computer systems.\nAmendments to the original deal show the state has offered Xerox at least $8.3 million for work with the DMV in the last 17 years."}
