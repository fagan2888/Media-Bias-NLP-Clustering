4. Incorporate a private health exchange solution: Private exchanges are gaining in popularity, and businesses of all sizes are curious about how they can benefit from them. Fact: You don’t have to be Mercer or Cigna to set up an exchange. Numerous entities ranging from start-ups to new divisions of leading insurance companies have been created to offer new private health exchanges. Brokers can do the same by 1) creating a private exchange, 2) connecting the employer and employee to your private exchange services, and 3) allowing employees to use your private health exchange to purchase a policy. 5. Think voluntary: Voluntary products are all the rage. Gain revenue from employers and individuals by providing employers an opportunity to broaden their health benefits with voluntary products. Help assist employees with filling in any financial or coverage gaps in their health insurance policy.
