Even a one-year delay of the mandate is expected to reduce the number of Americans signing up for ACA plans and raise Obamacare premiums by more than 10 percent next year.\n\nIn 1997, Congress passed a law establishing the so-called \u201cSustainable Growth Rate\u201d (SGR) formula to determine federal reimbursement rates for Medicare doctors. The adopted formula proved to be far too draconian, as it would institute steep cuts to doctors\u2019 payment rates, raising concerns that fewer physicians would accept Medicare patients. Congress has consequently voted to delay the cuts every year since they were adopted \u2014 but has yet to establish a permanent \u201cdoc fix\u201d for the underlying formula.\n\nFailing to pass a doc fix at all \u2014 temporary or otherwise \u2014 could be disastrous for seniors on Medicare, who could face a landscape where fewer numbers of doctors are willing to treat them.That\u2019s why Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) have stated that \u201c[We must] fix the Medicare physician payment formula for the next ten years so that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to health care.\u201d\n\nInitial reports suggested that a bipartisan group of lawmakers were on the cusp of actually agreeing on a permanent, $138 billion fix this year. But Congress remained stalled on a how to pay for the legislation.\n\nThat\u2019s where the GOP\u2019s newest proposal comes into play. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that a one-year delay in the individual mandate would yield about $9 billion in savings for the federal government, and that delaying it for longer would save even more money.\n\nHowever, the move would also increase Obamacare premiums and discourage people from buying insurance. That could lead to less efficient and diversified risk pools in the Obamacare marketplaces and stymie reform during the health law\u2019s nascent years \u2014 and physicians\u2019 groups agree that it\u2019s the wrong approach to paying for the doc fix, especially considering this is the first time in years that Congress has agreed on the broad strokes for permanent reform.\n\n\u201cThe only way this is going to get done if it\u2019s done in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d said Christian Shalgian, director of advocacy and health policy for the American College of Surgeons, in an interview with The Hill. \u201cI don\u2019t think this pay-for was developed in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot support linking SGR repeal to changes in current law that will result in fewer people getting health insurance coverage,\u201d added Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians, in a statement last week. \u201cWe call on House and Senate leadership to immediately engage in a bipartisan process to reach bipartisan agreement on a budgetary solution that can pass both the House and the Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The move may actually raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The move may actually raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans.", "title": "GOP Threatens Pay Cut For Medicare Doctors Unless Democrats Delay Key Obamacare Provision", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/10/3384431/gop-doc-fix-individual-mandate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_doctor-doc-worried-e1394474487431.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The move may actually raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_doctor-doc-worried-321x214.jpg", "title": "GOP Threatens Pay Cut For Medicare Doctors Unless Democrats Delay Key Obamacare Provision", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_doctor-doc-worried-e1394474487431.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_doctor-doc-worried-e1394474487431.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-10T15:51:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea8f\"", "article_summary": "Health GOP Threatens Pay Cut For Medicare Doctors Unless Democrats Delay Key Obamacare Provision CREDIT: ShutterstockThe GOP-controlled House of Representatives will vote this week to tie bipartisan legislation that would prevent an average 24 percent pay cut for doctors who treat Medicare patients to a multi-year delay of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate.\nIn 1997, Congress passed a law establishing the so-called \u201cSustainable Growth Rate\u201d (SGR) formula to determine federal reimbursement rates for Medicare doctors.\nThe adopted formula proved to be far too draconian, as it would institute steep cuts to doctors\u2019 payment rates, raising concerns that fewer physicians would accept Medicare patients.\nCongress has consequently voted to delay the cuts every year since they were adopted \u2014 but has yet to establish a permanent \u201cdoc fix\u201d for the underlying formula.\nEven a one-year delay of the mandate is expected to reduce the number of Americans signing up for ACA plans and raise Obamacare premiums by more than 10 percent next year."}
