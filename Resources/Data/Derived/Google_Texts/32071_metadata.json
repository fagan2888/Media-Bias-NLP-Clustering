He is still adhering to his promise to evangelicals earlier in the campaign season not to endorse any candidate seeking to occupy the Oval office in January 2017.\n\n\"I don't care who wins and who's out there \u2014 you have to vote,\" Graham told CBN News in an interview in Denver, Colorado, earlier this week.\n\nIn the midst of his Decision America Tour across the country, Graham took some time to make sure that Christian voters from coast to coast do not neglect their biblical responsibility to take part in the democratic process so they can do all they can to protect the current and future generations from the effects of ungodly leadership in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association insisted that Christians in America have a crucial duty to be involved in the electoral process in order to do their best to ensure that a leader who most closely follows and upholds biblical principles is leading the nation.\n\nHowever, Graham made it clear that he is not telling anyone how to vote \u2014 just to use godly discernment and hold candidates up to God\u2019s standards, and not simply their own.\n\n\"And I'm not going to tell people who to vote for \u2014 I'm not going to do that,\u201d the 63-year-old evangelist expressed. \u201cLet God tell you who to vote for.\u201d\n\nHe does not want Christians to get caught up on personalities or stray away from focusing on the issues that should weigh the strongest on their \u2014 and God\u2019s \u2014 hearts.\n\nThe lesser of two evils?\n\nImplying that godly values might not be well-represented on the ballots come November, Graham argues that Christians must still vote so that laws, policies and programs going against biblical teachings will not run rampant over the next four years in the United States.\n\nImportant social issues often stressed by Graham when discussing politics include abortion, same-sex \u201cmarriage,\u201d religious freedom, national security against Islamic terrorism and standing behind Israel as America\u2019s key ally.\n\nGraham, who also serves as president of Samaritan\u2019s Purse, revealed that Leftists have infiltrated the Church in order to covertly forward the progressive agenda of the Democratic Party. He says that these promoters of the liberal agenda are aiming to take out the Christian vote so that the Leftist\u2019s candidate will not be challenged in the election this fall.\n\n\"There is a Left movement within the evangelical community that are telling people, 'If so-and-so wins or this person wins, don't vote,\u2019\u201d the North Carolina native pointed out.\n\nBut Graham remained adamant that no matter how disillusioned Christians are when it comes to who\u2019s in the running for the White House in November, they must not throw in the towel and concede the election \u2014just because the candidate with the strongest biblical platform was knocked out of the competition.\n\n\u201cI'm just saying \u2014 I don't care who wins and who's out there \u2026 you have to vote,\" the vocal Christian leader concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reverend Franklin Graham is now urging Christians to vote for the \u201cleast heathen\u201d candidate in the 2016 presidential election this fall and avoid the Left\u2019s push for believers to avoid the ballot box when their favorites are eliminated.", "og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2016/03/19/franklin-graham-pick-least-heathen-candidate", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5825460/franklin-graham_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "Reverend Franklin Graham is now urging Christians to vote for the \u201cleast heathen\u201d candidate in the 2016 presidential election this fall and avoid the Left\u2019s push for believers to avoid the ballot box when their favorites are eliminated.", "title": "Franklin Graham: Pick 'least heathen' candidate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5825460/franklin-graham_800x500.jpg", "description": "Reverend Franklin Graham is now urging Christians to vote for the \u201cleast heathen\u201d candidate in the 2016 presidential election this fall and avoid the Left\u2019s push for believers to avoid the ballot box when their favorites are eliminated.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Franklin Graham: Pick 'least heathen' candidate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "Franklin Graham,Billy Graham,Donald Trump,Hillary Clinton,2016 election,politics,pro-life,abortion,same-sex marriage,Israel,national security,Palestians,terrorism,jihad,Islam,Islamic terrorism,least heathen,presidential candidates,Michael F.
