Most people were just getting over the tragic burning of Shireen Baratheon from last week, but there was little time to reminisce.\n\nOn the season finale, fans said goodbye to several people including Selyse Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Myranda, and Meryn Trant, who was stabbed in the eyes by Arya Stark. While it may have been easy to make peace with these losses, most viewers were left with their jaws on the floor when the show ended.\n\nJon Snow was stabbed numerous times by his fellow Night\u2019s Watch brothers. And no, he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nGame Of Thrones is almost always shocking, and a season finale isn\u2019t complete without some level of depression, though this one has most of the previous ones beat, save for Season 3\u2019s Red Wedding. According to Entertainment Weekly, Jon Snow will not be returning to the show in any capacity \u2014 which means that theories of him coming back as a White Walker are out the window. Kit Harrington, who played (that past tense actually hurts) Snow, recently opened up about a potential return, and said that it\u2019s not happening.\n\n\u201cI had a sit-down with Dan and David, we did the Tony Soprano walk [letting an actor know they\u2019re being whacked]. They said, \u2018Look, you\u2019re gone, it\u2019s done,\u2019 \u201d Harrington said. In regard to him getting a raise next season, Kit says that he\u2019s been told there is no \u201cnext season\u201d for him.\n\n\u201cAs far as the salary thing goes, that angered me when that story came out. I don\u2019t know where it came from, but it was inaccurate in many ways. It\u2019s going to put questions into your head and into fans\u2019 heads that things are not what they are. Quite honestly, I have never been told the future of things in this show, but this is the one time I have. They sat me down and said, \u2018This is how it is.\u2019 If anything in the future is not like that, then I don\u2019t know about it \u2014 it\u2019s only in David and Dan and George\u2019s heads. But I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m not coming back next season. So that\u2019s all I can tell you, really.\u201d\n\nThe Game Of Thrones actor also said that he really liked the way his character went out \u2014 that he knew it was coming, and that the way it was written was really well done. This was a great way for Jon Snow to go out, and Kit was happy with how things played out.\n\n\u201cI kind of knew it was coming. I didn\u2019t read [George R.R. Martin\u2019s novel] A Dance with Dragons. But I read the other books and I had heard this is what happens. So I had an inkling it should be this season. I didn\u2019t realize it would be the final shot of the season and that made it extra special. It\u2019s always kind of nice really when you\u2019re the last thing that happens in that episode. I loved how they brought Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up. I think it was really well crafted. It felt like the right way for it to happen.\u201d\n\nOf course, Kit isn\u2019t too thrilled to be out of a job, and to be leaving the cast that he\u2019s grown so attached to over the years. Saying goodbye was quite emotional for him.\n\n\u201cI got a big wrap and, like any of the actors who die on Thrones, I just wanted to f**k off out of there. I got a tear in my eye. I was more moved and emotional than I thought I\u2019d be,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while many people thought that Jon Snow was actually going to conquer the kingdoms, marry Khaleesi (a stretch), and live happily ever after, Game Of Thrones fans should know better. According to the Daily Beast, Snow got a bit of power this season, but it didn\u2019t work out for him. The politics ended up eating him alive, and his major battle loss meant he had to go.\n\nIf you simply can\u2019t get enough Game Of Thrones, and you want more Jon Snow without being reminded of his death, check out this video. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, the show was made into a fun musical for Red Nose Day, and it\u2019s totally worth the watch.\n\n[Photo by Rob Kim / Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Game Of Thrones finale was simply shocking, which was to be expected given the nature of the popular HBO show, but no one actually thought that Jon Snow", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Game Of Thrones finale was simply shocking, which was to be expected given the nature of the popular HBO show, but no one actually thought that Jon Snow", "title": "\u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Finale: Kit Harrington Talks About Show\u2019s Shocking Finale [Spoilers]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2173468/game-of-thrones-finale/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-475662728_opt.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-15T10:19:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T10:47:14+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-475662728_opt.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-06-15T10:19:01+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "game of thrones,game of thrones finale,jon snow,jon snow dead,kit harrington,tv", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-475662728_opt.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Game Of Thrones finale was simply shocking, which was to be expected given the nature of the popular HBO show, but no one actually thought that Jon Snow"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c12\"", "article_summary": "In regard to him getting a raise next season, Kit says that he\u2019s been told there is no \u201cnext season\u201d for him.\nThis was a great way for Jon Snow to go out, and Kit was happy with how things played out.\nJon Snow was stabbed numerous times by his fellow Night\u2019s Watch brothers.\nKit Harrington, who played (that past tense actually hurts) Snow, recently opened up about a potential return, and said that it\u2019s not happening.\nIf you simply can\u2019t get enough Game Of Thrones, and you want more Jon Snow without being reminded of his death, check out this video."}
