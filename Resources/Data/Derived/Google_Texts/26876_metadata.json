More than half (52.6 percent) of all reported shortages were of lifesaving drugs, and 10 percent of shortages affected drugs with no substitute. The most common drugs on shortage are used to treat infectious diseases, relieve pain, and treat patients who have been poisoned. Though the number of shortages fell between 2002 and 2007, they\u2019ve risen by 435 percent between 2008 and 2014.\n\nShortages \u201care real, they\u2019re happening, and they\u2019re getting worse,\u201d senior author Jesse Pines, director of the office for clinical practice innovation at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, told the Post.\n\nVarious reasons were given for the shortages, including manufacturing delays (25.6 percent), supply and demand (14.9 percent), availability of raw materials (4.4 percent), and business decisions (2.1 percent). Over 46 percent of shortages, however, had no stated reason.\n\nWhat could this unstated reason be, and could it also be playing into some of the other reasons?\n\nEmergency physician Doug McGuff, in his 2015 book The Primal Prescription (co-authored with economist Robert Murphy), suggested one possible cause:\n\nIn the last few years of my practice of emergency medicine, I have noted a disturbing trend: the medicines that I have found most useful, as well as the medicines that are needed for life-saving resuscitation, have been disappearing. From 1989 to about 2006 I always had at my disposal cheap medicines that were incredibly effective, as well as any medication needed to run a major resuscitation. This was particularly true for sterile injectable medications. However, beginning around 2006 I started to notice that I would order one of these medications, only to find them unavailable and \u201con national backorder.\u201d\n\nInitially, the shortages were infrequent and a minor nuisance. As time went by, the shortages became more and more common\u2026. As it currently stands [in 2015], generic injectable sedatives, antipsychotics, and anti-nausea medications are completely unavailable\u2026. What would be the cause of all of this? My scouring of online discussions by other experts eventually led me to the government\u2019s price controls embedded in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act.\n\nThat law, noted the Heritage Foundation, \u201cwas enacted in response to the consequences of price controls that preceded it\u201d \u2014 a common pattern when it comes to government intervention. Prior to 2005, when the act took effect, Medicare paid for drugs based on the average wholesale price of each drug. Since that price was set by the manufacturers on an arbitrary basis, not based on the actual prices they charged, they naturally tended to inflate it, leading to runaway Medicare costs.\n\nThe 2003 law changed the payment formula to one based on the average selling price of drugs over the last six months; most private insurers followed suit. This \u201ceffectively limited the amount by which the price of the drug could rise in response to market conditions over a given period,\u201d explained Devon Herrick, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis. A manufacturer raising his price while others did not would tend to lose market share because Medicare would not reimburse healthcare providers at the higher price for some time to come, and perhaps not at all if other manufacturers continued to keep their prices down.\n\nIn short, the 2003 Medicare act slapped price controls on drugs; and as always, price controls lead to shortages. Pharmaceutical companies simply stopped producing drugs on which they could not profit. Sterile injectable drugs \u2014 \u201cthe majority of drugs on shortage in emergency rooms,\u201d according to the Post \u2014 are expensive to produce and store and thus are among the scarcest under the price-control regime.\n\nMoreover, as then-Representative (now Senator) Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Patrick Cobb, both medical doctors, wrote in a 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed: \u201cDue to the highly complex and expensive infrastructure required to manufacture and store sterile injectables, there is no incentive for new manufacturers to enter the market in response to a sudden shortage. Thus a single manufacturing glitch can result in an almost immediate shortage with no backup.\u201d\n\nOther federal price controls also contribute to the shortages. One program forces drug makers to give deep discounts to facilities treating a high number of indigent or Medicaid patients. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d penned Herrick, \u201cmanufacturers that increase brand-name drug prices faster than the Consumer Price Index are required to rebate the excess amount. This means they have little incentive to purchase new equipment to maintain or improve their manufacturing processes. As a result, some drugs become less and less profitable over time.\u201d\n\nObamaCare, naturally, exacerbates these problems. First, it vastly increases the number of Americans eligible for Medicaid. Second, it expands the number of facilities that qualify for the discounts. Third, it creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, whose task is to keep Medicare spending down by recommending reimbursement cuts. As Cassidy and Cobb observed, \u201cOne of the few areas the board can cut is drug costs. This will move the market for pharmaceuticals further away from market forces \u2014 and until market forces are acknowledged, drug shortages will persist.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u201chas issued a long-term strategic plan to prevent drug shortages,\u201d noted the Post. But yet another central plan isn\u2019t going to solve issues created by previous central plans, particularly when the FDA is itself part of the problem.\n\nThe agency has been cracking down on drug manufacturing facilities that don\u2019t meet its standards. Meanwhile, Herrick wrote, \u201cthe FDA approves how much a drug manufacturer can produce. If a shortage develops because the FDA shuts down a competitor\u2019s plant, a manufacturer must seek FDA approval to increase output and alter its production timetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronically,\u201d reported the Post, \u201cincreased FDA oversight might even create more shortages \u2014 researchers note that rather than invest in infrastructure or submit to enhanced inspections, businesses may decide simply to stop producing drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the byproducts of a focus on cost in health care,\u201d Pines told the newspaper. \u201cThere may be a demand for medication, but it may not be in a company\u2019s best interest to produce it because the amount they can charge is often lower than the amount it costs to manufacture it.\u201d\n\nThe problem of drug shortages, he said, \u201ccould and potentially will get worse.\u201d\n\nGovernment may not be the sole cause of the drug shortage, but it is certainly a major one. The best solution, therefore, is to roll back all the unconstitutional interventions that have led to the current crisis, including ObamaCare, Medicare, Medicaid, and the FDA. Americans\u2019 lives literally depend on it.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "emergency rooms, drugs, shortage, government, Medicaid, Medicare, ObamaCare, 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, price controls, FDA", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/22398-emergency-rooms-short-on-lifesaving-drugs", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/62d661e8dcbe9a34c2724a6c76303c6f_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Emergency rooms across the country are facing a severe shortage of drugs, many of which are necessary to save lives \u2014 and, as usual, government is largely to blame. by Michael Tennant", "title": "Emergency Rooms Short on Lifesaving Drugs"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/62d661e8dcbe9a34c2724a6c76303c6f_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In short, the 2003 Medicare act slapped price controls on drugs; and as always, price controls lead to shortages.\nMore than half (52.6 percent) of all reported shortages were of lifesaving drugs, and 10 percent of shortages affected drugs with no substitute.\nWrote the paper:Of the nearly 1,800 drug shortages reported between 2001 and 2014, nearly 34 percent were used in emergency rooms.\nSterile injectable drugs \u2014 \u201cthe majority of drugs on shortage in emergency rooms,\u201d according to the Post \u2014 are expensive to produce and store and thus are among the scarcest under the price-control regime.\nEmergency rooms across the country are facing a severe shortage of drugs, many of which are necessary to save lives \u2014 and, as usual, government is largely to blame."}
