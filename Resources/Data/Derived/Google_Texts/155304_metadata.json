But in health care, there is \u201climited evidence that higher prices are associated with higher quality or better health outcomes,\u201d according to the study. The goal of many efforts to get price and quality information to consumers is to nudge people toward choosing \u201chigh-value\u201d care that gives them the most effective care for the money.\n\nThe data provides useful information for health care organizations that are trying to understand how people make choices and developing consumer tools, said the study\u2019s lead author, Kathryn Phillips, a professor of health economics and health services research at the University of California, San Francisco. For instance, it suggests that offering prices to consumers does not necessarily encourage them to use the most expensive doctors or hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn order for these tools to work \u2026 we have to understand how people use this information,\u201d said Phillips. She added, \u201cYou can\u2019t just put price information out there and expect people to use it.\u201d\n\nThe study authors, who included researchers at the firm Public Agenda, also noted that the concerns of the 21 to 24 percent of consumers who do associate price and quality must be addressed. The analysis found that people who had comparison shopped for care in the past were more likely to link higher prices with higher quality care.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cost and Quality,Insurance,Insuring Your Health,Syndicate,Cost Transparency,Study", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "A study in the journal Health Affairs found a majority of people don't associate price and quality in health care services.", "title": "Cost And Health Care Quality: Many Don\u2019t See Link", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20160408/prices-and-health-care-quality-many-consumers-dont-see-a-link", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "A study in the journal Health Affairs found a majority of people don't associate price and quality in health care services.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "The analysis found that people who had comparison shopped for care in the past were more likely to link higher prices with higher quality care.\nBut in health care, there is \u201climited evidence that higher prices are associated with higher quality or better health outcomes,\u201d according to the study.\nMost consumers don\u2019t believe the adage that \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d in health care, according to a new study.\nThe goal of many efforts to get price and quality information to consumers is to nudge people toward choosing \u201chigh-value\u201d care that gives them the most effective care for the money.\nThe data provides useful information for health care organizations that are trying to understand how people make choices and developing consumer tools, said the study\u2019s lead author, Kathryn Phillips, a professor of health economics and health services research at the University of California, San Francisco."}
