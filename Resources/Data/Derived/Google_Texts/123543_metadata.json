(AP Photo/George Clark)\n\nMississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R) on Tuesday narrowly lost a runoff against Sen. Thad Cochran (R). So who is this little-known state senator who took on a 36-year incumbent and nearly won? Here\u2019s some background:\n\nHe\u2019s a local. McDaniel was born in Laurel and raised in nearby Ellisville, two small towns south of Meridian and southeast of Jackson. He attended Jones County Junior College, where both his father and mother worked, then got a bachelor\u2019s degree from William Carey University, a small Christian school in Hattiesburg. He got his law degree from Ole Miss.\n\nHis family still lives in Ellisville. McDaniel and his wife Jill, the 1995 winner of the Miss Mississippi USA pageant, have two sons, Cambridge and Chamberlain.\n\nMcDaniel clerked for a Cochran rival. Just out of law school, McDaniel began clerking with U.S. District Court Judge Charles Pickering Sr., a Laurel native and former state senator himself. In 1978, Pickering ran for an open U.S. Senate seat, but he lost the Republican nomination to Cochran, then a sitting U.S. congressman. The bad blood between the two men festered for years; when George W. Bush nominated Pickering for a seat on the Fifth Circuit, Cochran and his colleague Trent Lott, who was defending himself for comments made during Strom Thurmond\u2019s 100th birthday party at the time, left the behind-the-scenes arm-twisting to Rep. Chip Pickering, Charles\u2019s son and then a junior member of Congress. The elder Pickering withdrew his name from consideration after he failed to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\nHe\u2019s a partner in his law firm, where he challenged the Affordable Care Act. McDaniel was the lead counsel in Mississippi\u2019s lawsuit against Obamacare. He\u2019s a partner at Hortman, Harlow, Bassi, Robinson & McDaniel.\n\nMcDaniel remembers the Alamo. In 2012, McDaniel led a Mississippi delegation to San Antonio, where he helped dedicate a monument to the Mississippians killed during the Texas revolution in 1836. At least six of the 115 men defending the fort hailed from or lived in Mississippi.\n\nThere\u2019s audio. Lots of it. McDaniel hosted a nationally syndicated Christian talk radio program from 2004 to 2007, giving his opponents plenty of tape to comb through. Mother Jones pulled snippets in which McDaniel blames gun violence on \u201chip-hop\u201d culture. The New York Times highlighted a riff in which McDaniel wonders aloud how someone who doesn\u2019t speak much Spanish could pick up a woman in Mexico, during which he refers to \u201cmamacitas.\u201d He has also suggested he would rather move to Mexico than pay reparations for slavery.\n\nAnd photos. Last year, McDaniel addressed the Jones County Rosin Heels, a chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans. He was scheduled to address the group again in August, but he missed that meeting after flight trouble in Chicago. McDaniel addressed the group at least once, on June 22, 2013; a photo of his appearance is on the group\u2019s Web site.\n\nMcDaniel is a big sports fan. He plays basketball, and he\u2019s a Chicago Cubs fan. Not a lot of professional baseball teams to choose from in Mississippi; he must have watched the Cubbies on WGN as a kid.\n\nHe\u2019s social. McDaniel\u2019s campaign tweets all the time, but the candidate himself does too. McDaniel opened his Twitter account in February 2009. First tweet, at 11:49 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2009: \u201clearning how to use twitter.\u201d\n\nHis favorite snack: Peanut M&Ms. Enough said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His wife is a former Miss Mississippi, and he loves the Cubs.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His wife is a former Miss Mississippi, and he loves the Cubs.", "title": "10 things to know about Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat a 36-year incumbent", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/24/10-things-to-know-about-chris-mcdaniel-who-nearly-beat-a-36-year-incumbent/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/10/National-Politics/Images/Senate_Mississippi-0158f-4176.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/24/10-things-to-know-about-chris-mcdaniel-who-nearly-beat-a-36-year-incumbent/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Mississippi, McDaniel, Senate, states,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Mississippi, McDaniel, Senate, states,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f91\"", "article_summary": "So who is this little-known state senator who took on a 36-year incumbent and nearly won?\n(AP Photo/George Clark)Mississippi state Sen.
