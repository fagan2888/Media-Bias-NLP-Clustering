Gov. Steve Beshear says the first week of kynect’s latest open enrollment period is “going strong.”

The governor’s office reports that the health exchange’s website received 72,000 visits in the last week with more than 6,400 new applications submitted and 4,100 Kentuckians newly enrolled.

“Kentucky is the hands-down national leader in helping people access affordable health care," said Beshear. "Our exchange, kynect, is the gold standard for ease of use and convenience. Today Kentuckians began to review their options and apply for health coverage in 2015. We encourage everyone—those who bought health plans on the exchange last year and those who may not have—to go shop again to ensure you find the best plan for your family.”

Statistics from Governor's office, as of 11 a.m. today:

72,335 unique visitors to the kynect website viewing 2.1 million pages;

45,412 individuals have conducted preliminary screenings;

26,967 calls have been handled by the kynect contact center;

4,180 new accounts have been created;

6,471 new applications have been submitted;

8,727 have made changes to existing applications;

1,985 people have downloaded the new kynect app;

4,107 individuals have newly enrolled or renewed their enrollment in a qualified health plan;

815 individuals have enrolled in dental plans;

More than 1800 individuals have visited the new kynectstore at Fayette Mall in Lexington; 522 have completed applications for new coverage.

More than 521,000 Kentuckians enrolled in health care coverage through kynect during the first enrollment period that ran October 1, 2013 to March 15, 2014.

“We made tremendous headway last year, but we still have thousands of Kentuckians who need insurance for themselves and for their families,” said Carrie Banahan, executive director of kynect. “Not only do we encourage first-time insurance buyers to check out kynectonline, by phone or in-person with an insurance agent or kynector, we are also strongly encouraging those who enrolled last year to check out the plans available for 2015. You could get a bigger subsidy, a lower monthly cost, or more network options if you shop again.”

A recent Gallup poll also showed that the number of uninsured people in Kentucky fell from 20 percent in 2013 to 12 percent this year, the second highest reduction in the country.

Open enrollment began last weekend and runs until February 15th, 2015.
