The Nose panelists explore the hidden mysteries of the Coen Brothers' new film, Inside Llewyn Davis, based on the early folk movement of 1960's Greenwich Village and one of its early pioneers, Dave Van Ronk.

They look at the movie, the era, the implications for folk and roots music, including breakout acts from the film like Lake Street Dive, The Milk Carton Kids, and Rhiannon Glennon.

And, what about that cat?

We also throw in a few minutes on the retirement of Justin Beiber and Time Magazine's runner-up to Man of the Year, Edward Snowdon--to Pardon or not?
