Fresh off the AP wire Wednesday is news that the Obama administration has set a new record for denying and censoring government files. This begs the question — what are some other areas in which the administration has failed, in terms of our basic freedoms?

Without further ado, here they are, in no particular order:

The Top 5 Freedom Blunders by the United States Government

1. IRS as Political Big Brother

In 2010, the IRS cobbled together a “Be On The Lookout” list to help identify politically active groups as targets for scrutiny. Keywords included “Patriots,” “Tea Party,” “Government Spending,” and “Israel,” and covered subjects such as Constitutional Education and inquiries into the Affordable Care Act.

Some claimed it also targeted conservative-leaning groups almost exclusively. For example, although the Occupy Movement was targeted, according to the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, it and the small number of other liberal groups listed didn’t receive nearly the scrutiny of conservative groups.

2. The Invisible Rulebook for Identifying Terrorists

In March 2013, the National Counterterrorism Center released a 166-page document called the March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance, detailing the U.S. government’s rules for placing people on its terrorist watch list.

It was officially declassified. But the White House refused to release it, then it wound up being published in full by The Intercept. If it was declassified, why refuse to let the public see it openly?

3. Free Speech on Campus

In response to the University of Montana’s dealings with sexual assault, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice teamed together and issued a letter to the school, intended as a national blueprint for handling sexual harassment.

Among other things, the letter urged a lockdown on “unwelcome speech” on campus. It also insisted that matters be processed through extra-judicial procedures that support punishment before trial, lack of legal representation for “defendants,” and convictions based on a “guilty before proven innocent” standard more reminiscent of Judge Dredd than of a modern democracy.

4: N-S-Ayy, May I Listen in on Your Conversation?

Despite Obama’s talks of reform in 2014, the NSA still wields the power to conduct surveillance on cell phone data. In addition, the FBI may still seize records without a court order. Tough call, but unconstitutional government spying and a carte blanche for a federal agency to collect private papers without due process don’t seem like hallmarks of a free society.

Oh, and there was the Senate’s Cybersecurity Bill, which would increase information sharing among the ‘intelligence community’ and expand NSA surveillance powers.

5: Freedom of Information Acting Rather Strange Lately

The Bush administration’s policy of refusing requests for records to the Office Of Administration became policy under the Obama administration this week, in case you missed it. The irony: it was announced on National Freedom of Information Day.

While it’s fair to say that Obama didn’t start this one and that several other departments, disturbingly, also make it policy to refuse such requests, taking such action on the day meant to celebrate….freedom of information sure takes some sand.
