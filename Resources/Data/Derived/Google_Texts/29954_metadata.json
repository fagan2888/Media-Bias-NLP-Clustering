(AP) \u2014 Calling California\u2019s traffic court system a \u201chellhole of desperation\u201d for the poor, Gov. Jerry Brown is proposing an amnesty program for residents who can\u2019t afford to pay off spiraling fines and penalties that have resulted in 4.8 million driver\u2019s license suspensions since 2006.\n\nThe push by the Democratic governor spotlights concern among lawmakers and court administrators that California\u2019s justice system is profiting off minorities and low-income residents. It\u2019s a civil rights issue that has prompted discussions between the Brown administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the governor\u2019s spokesman, Evan Westrup.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the Justice Department has launched an inquiry into California\u2019s court system. The department did not return requests for comment. Westrup declined to provide details on the meetings with federal officials.\n\nUnder Brown\u2019s plan, drivers with lesser infractions would pay half of what they owe, and administrative fees would be slashed from $300 to $50.\n\nAdvocates for the poor have likened California\u2019s problem to the police and municipal court structure in Ferguson, Missouri, which was criticized by the Justice Department as a revenue-generating machine following last year\u2019s fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has sadly become a pay-to-play court system,\u201d said Michael Herald, a legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and Poverty who helped write a scathing report released last month by civil rights groups on how Californians are getting caught in a cycle of debt and having their driver\u2019s licenses suspended as a result of costly traffic tickets and court penalties.\n\nTraffic fines have been skyrocketing in California and courts have grown reliant on fees as a result of budget cuts during the recession.\n\nTwenty years ago, the fine for running a red light was $103. Today, it costs as much as $490 as the state has established add-on fees to support everything from court construction to emergency medical air transportation. The cost can jump to over $800 once a person fails to pay or misses a traffic court appearance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "title": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "title": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/california_governor_pitches_amnesty_on_traffic_debt_for_poor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/traffic-fine-amnesty.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "title": "California governor pitches amnesty on traffic debt for poor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/traffic-fine-amnesty.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Judy Lin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7cc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsSACRAMENTO, Calif.
