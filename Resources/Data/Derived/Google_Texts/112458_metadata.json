First thing we have to do is stop the bleeding and clear the air way,\u201d he said.\n\nDefense firms have clamored for relief from the sequester, though they\u2019ve been reluctant to stick their necks too far out publicly.\n\n\u201cThe industry is not being passive but it's afraid to get involved in political matters,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a consultant who works with multiple contractors. \"Industry hates sequestration but no one wants to be seen as being too partisan, one way or the other.\"\n\nThe political problems facing a new Congress are familiar.\n\nThe 2011 Budget Control Act that introduced the sequester imposed equal cuts on domestic and defense spending. President Obama has been unwilling to replace cuts to the Pentagon without a commitment from congressional Republicans to ease cuts on the domestic side.\n\nBut budget analysts see the 2013 two-year budget deal by House Budget Committee Chairmen Paul Ryan Paul RyanHouse passes resurrected LGBT measure Ryan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray Patty MurrayLawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Wash.) as something that could be repeated next year.\n\n\u201cThe only really feasible solution is a small deal that raises the defense budget caps by $5 to $10 billion and also raises the non-defense budget caps by the same amount,\u201d said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cpretty good chance, greater than 50 percent\u201d that Congress could strike another small deal like Ryan-Murray, he said.\n\nThe Ryan-Murray budget deal set ceilings on defense spending in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 at $520 billion and $521 billion, respectively. The deal also set non-defense caps at $492 billion in those two years.\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, under the sequester caps, defense spending would be limited to $523 billion \u2014 an increase of just 0.06 percent. In fiscal year 2017, it would be limited to $536 billion.\n\nDefense firms describe those numbers as crippling.\n\n\u201cAcross the board, the defense industry is concerned about the impacts of sequestration,\u201d said John Keast of Cornerstone Government Affairs, who says it \u201chits everywhere.\u201d\n\nNon-defense spending would be limited under the sequester in 2016 to $493 billion, and to $504 billion in 2017.\n\nWith President Obama entering his final two years in office and Republicans wanting to show they can govern \u2014 particularly if they control both chambers of Congress \u2014 there is at least some hope for cooperation, experts say.\n\nAnd calls by some lawmakers to increase funding for the Pentagon, but also to increase health spending because of Ebola, points to a deal where some limited relief could be offered for both defense and non-defense spending.\n\nSequester was a way to enact historic budget cuts but was never seen as a \u201clong-term solution\u201d for excess spending, noted Davis.\n\nBut many Republican lawmakers in the House are likely to buck at any steps to increase spending.\n\n\u201cIf Congress becomes more Republican, there are a good many members who think sequestration is not a bad thing in terms of keeping spending in check,\u201d said David Urban of American Continental Group.\n\nSome are skeptical about the sequester's impact on the Pentagon and argue the Defense Department can afford to take the cuts.\n\nLindsay Koshgarian, research director for the National Priorities Project, which studies the federal budget, points out the Defense Department was previously able to withstand sequestration by shifting money to the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund. That account is not affected by the defense budget cap because it's used for emergencies like the war on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\n\u201cSome have estimated that by shifting money there, it has almost completely offset the sequestration cuts that were themselves diminished after the budget deal in 2013,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about these potential cuts that are in the range of $20 to $50 billion, we would still be far and away the number one [military] spender in the world. The Pentagon and its defenders have a lot of justification they need to make for why that [higher] level of funding is necessary.\u201d\n\nMegan Wilson contributed", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sequester opponents believe they have several new reasons for optimism.", "description": "Sequester opponents believe they have several new reasons for optimism.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak and Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Sequester opponents believe they have several new reasons for optimism.", "title": "Defense hopes for sequester relief", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/221784-defense-hopes-for-sequester-relief", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-26T06:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-26T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/221784-defense-hopes-for-sequester-relief", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-26T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "sequester, sequestration,Paul Ryan, Patty Murray,Pentagon, Department of Defense", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-26T06:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-26T06:00:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/221784-defense-hopes-for-sequester-relief", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Sequester opponents believe they have several new reasons for optimism.", "card": "summary", "title": "Defense hopes for sequester relief"}, "dcterms.title": "Defense hopes for sequester relief"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1625\"", "article_summary": "Defense firms have clamored for relief from the sequester, though they\u2019ve been reluctant to stick their necks too far out publicly.\nFor fiscal year 2016, under the sequester caps, defense spending would be limited to $523 billion \u2014 an increase of just 0.06 percent.\nThe 2011 Budget Control Act that introduced the sequester imposed equal cuts on domestic and defense spending.\nThat account is not affected by the defense budget cap because it's used for emergencies like the war on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\nThe Ryan-Murray budget deal set ceilings on defense spending in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 at $520 billion and $521 billion, respectively."}
