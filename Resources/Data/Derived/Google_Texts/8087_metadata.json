Of the wave of formidable writers on popular music who hit in the \u201860s \u2014 which also includes Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus and Christgau\u2019s girlfriend Ellen Willis \u2014 he\u2019s always been the most succinct, the most pragmatic and the most rigorous. Best known for his Village Voice Consumer Guide feature \u2014 short, chiseled little prose poems impersonating record reviews \u2014 Christgau now offers a memoir, \u201cGoing Into the City: Portrait of a Critic as a Young Man.\u201d\n\nThe book travels through his Queens upbringing, the intellectual jolt the preteen goy received from a batch of Jewish classmates, his youthful fascination with poetry and Dostoevsky, his time at \u201cAnimal House\u201d-era Dartmouth, cross-country drives and conversations about sex, politics and Warhol, and his dedication to journalism in general and rock criticism in particular. The book gets near its halfway point before the author has enlisted at the Voice, which will be his home for decades until he is dumped by a new regime of corporate cowboys.\n\nChristgau names names, writes so passionately about both the U.S. and U.K. edition of the Stones\u2019 \u201cAftermath\u201d it will make you want to find both and listen to them back to back, and gives one of the finest and most complex portraits ever of a female intellectual in his scenes with Ellen Willis, whose vision of pop \u2014 and Pop \u2014 profoundly influenced his. There\u2019s something both boastful and oddly humble throughout: He talks repeatedly about the results of his childhood IQ tests even while later calling himself \u201ca German hyperintellectual who\u2019d learned manners from a fireman who ate dinner in his sleeveless undershirt.\u201d\n\nThe result is a sometimes frustrating book that is also a consistently brilliant and fascinating one.\n\nChristgau \u2014 who under the influence of a glass of iced coffee was sometimes so intense that he would not let his interlocutor finish a sentence \u2014 spoke from his home in New York.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, sort of. Unlike a lot of your peers in rock criticism, you\u2019re not from the West Coast \u2014 you\u2019re not a Berkeley free speecher like \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think that most of my peers in rock criticism are from the West Coast. I think most of them are from the East Coast.\n\nLet me try to frame it. Some of the famous and storied rock critics \u2014 Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs\u2013 are from the West Coast. Others are Jewish bohemians like Ellen Willis. You come from a straighter world, don\u2019t you?\n\nEllen Willis and I came from exactly the same background, Scott. That\u2019s the reason we hooked up for three years. She was a policeman\u2019s daughter from Queens. I was a fireman\u2019s son from Queens. You can\u2019t be much closer than that. We weren\u2019t brought up as bohemians. We both became bohemians, as did many people in the early \u201960s.\n\nOK, fair enough. You don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re in some ways different from that first generation of rock critics in your background? I\u2019m just wondering if that shaped your tastes, et cetera.\n\nThe end of the \u201960s chapter has a three- or four-page section in which I break down the differences between myself and what I regard as the first generation of rock critics, which does not include either Marcus or Bangs because they all come in a little later. They came in in \u201869. This is through \u201868 and at that time the vast majority of rock critics were, in fact, New York Jews with a few Boston people. That\u2019s the people I\u2019m talking about. Even Jon Landau \u2014 I can\u2019t remember where he grew up at the moment \u2014 but I know that he spent his childhood in Brooklyn and Queens then moved somewhere else. I don\u2019t remember where.\n\nAnd in that respect, yes. I certainly felt it was worth pointing out that unlike that early generation, I very unusually for an intellectual in Manhattan in 1965 grew up a born-again white Christian \u2014 plenty of born-again black Christians \u2014 but a born-again white Christian, and while I know former born-againers who are my equivalents, they come from other parts of the country. John Morthland came from a different kind of a background. Lester was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, which isn\u2019t the same thing but is kind of like it. Very much not the same thing actually but so, yeah. A very important part of my story far as I\u2019m concerned is that I was this born-again Christian whose first salvation came through a class full of wise-ass Jewish kids in junior high school. That was the first chapter I wrote. I wrote it as the chapter I sent around because I felt if I couldn\u2019t make that chapter work that I wasn\u2019t going to to do the book right.\n\nThere are a lot of chapters that take place before rock \u2018n\u2019 roll hit or before rock \u2018n\u2019 roll hit you in a hard way. Why did it seem important to get back story about your family and your upbringing and childhood in here?\n\nBecause it\u2019s a memoir. Because you are the product of your background, even if it\u2019s by reaction. I had conflicts with my family but basically I remained in a loving relationship with them, even at the worst of it. Unless you are just pure rebel, it\u2019s a combination of two things.\n\nThough I don\u2019t talk about it in the book explicitly, it\u2019s clear to me that aspects of my upbringing remain with me and that\u2019s the reason that when my wife and I got married, we put our parents in the traditional service where God usually goes. We were the products of loving marriages \u2014 not perfect marriages but loving marriages \u2014 and we had loving relationships with our parents and that made marriage seem like a plausible outcome to our lives and something worth pursuing. That\u2019s a very, very important thing that happens in this book, in part because at the very core of my conflict with Ellen Willis, who I love deeply, and who loved me too, was that she didn\u2019t believe in marriage. Her ideas evolved in other ways. She remained adamant about that to the rest of her life even after she was married. She claimed, and I see no reason to disbelieve, that the marriage she did eventually make with Stanley Aronowitz was strictly for tax and legal purposes, medical insurance in there, and that might be plausible to me. I don\u2019t think she would deny and I don\u2019t think Stanley would deny either, although I don\u2019t know anything really about the details of the relationship except that I could see that they loved each other. Nobody wants to tell me about that. Why me?\n\nBut I was just saying to my wife the other day that as painful as the breakup was and as well-suited as Ellen and I were to each other in certain ways \u2014 people said this for years after we split up. Why in the world did you guys break up? At least they said it to me. We both found far more suitable mates in the wake of that. She had a very, very serious \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a marriage. Fine. I don\u2019t understand what her real vision of it was. Even though I read her writing about it, I don\u2019t quite get it. I\u2019m not going to start asking her daughter and widowed husband, but the idea was don\u2019t get married. If you\u2019re a feminist, you don\u2019t get married. After we broke up, that was a really important difference between us, where she had persuaded me and then I spent three years figuring out that I really didn\u2019t agree with her. Believe me. If you\u2019re intimate with a mind as powerful as that of Ellen Willis, it takes you a long time to separate yourself from her ideas. She had an extremely powerful mind.\n\nI can tell from the writing. I was going to take you there, in fact. For someone associated with bohemia, punk rock and other things, you have an oddly earnest and conventional view of what we would call bourgeois marriage. What led you to that?\n\nI suppose it\u2019s earnest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all conventional. Insofar as it\u2019s earnest, I\u2019m proud to be earnest. I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s corny. Those corny adjectives? They all have their place in life. Is there some kind of a contradiction or disconnect between how much satisfaction I get from unconventional and apparently antisocial artists? Yes, there is. In some cases, they do a kind of vicarious kind of living for me. On the other hand, you might think I have a conventional view of marriage but put me in a town in a medium-size city in Kansas and I don\u2019t have a conventional view of marriage at all. On the contrary.\n\nMy personal experience has been that in my free bohemian subculture, I\u2019m not unique. My experience of what a loving relationship is like rings true with a lot of people I meet. I have a theory that the people you meet, one way you choose them, is their suitability for you in that particular matter. Attitudes toward friendship and marriage are in many cases closely aligned. So I can\u2019t say that my sample is a fair sample, but all I knew was that I kept reading people being blas\u00e9 about infidelity. Not necessarily saying this is great but it happens, from sophisticated people. In my world, infidelity is a disaster. Always. I was not about to pretend that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a story early in the book about my friend and mentor Bob Stanley who imbued a sort of \u2014 he was very interested in sex. Painted erotic paintings. He gave me the idea that, yes, people fuck around \u2014 and then Ellen and I both found ourselves being unfaithful to each other about 10 months into our relationship. I could not believe how much it hurt. I couldn\u2019t believe the pain I was in, so I went to Bob and he said, of course it hurts. It always hurts. And as I say, this was real, Now he tells me stuff. Suddenly I realize this guy who I admired enormously and admire him even more enormously now and miss him terribly \u2014 he\u2019s been dead for almost 20 years \u2014 I loved still. I still love him. Nevertheless, he was trying to act cool for me in some kind of way. I said to myself I\u2019m not doing that. He misled me here so he could look cool. I\u2019m never going to do that.\n\nI\u2019m a member of a generation \u2014 I was born in 1969 \u2014 whose childhoods were dominated by infidelity and divorce by the parents. I\u2019m an example of that and so is my wife. I applaud you doubling down on marriage, however conventional it may seem. I wish more bohos and lefties would do that.\n\nI went into this book knowing I was going to do this. I think I didn\u2019t know quite how much I was going to do it. It is in terms of memoir unconventional. But what could I do? I told the story I had to tell. You know that thing that novelists say about how the character takes over the story? The story took over at a certain point. That was the story and I tried to make it as credible and coherent as I could.\n\nThere\u2019s also in addition to music and bohemia \u2014 and there\u2019s a wonderful passage about jazz and foreign film \u2014 there\u2019s also a lot of sex in the book.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a lot of sex in the book. I don\u2019t believe you will ever find a single passage where there are two consecutive sentences about it. Why? Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, once again in my experience, I can\u2019t say that this is true of all my friends because people are remarkably reticent on this topic. But as far as my wife and I, our relationship is a sexual relationship. As far as we\u2019re concerned, marriage is a sexual relationship. I don\u2019t believe that you write about sex by generalizing it. I believe you write about sex the way you write about everything else. I tell my students that they should be concrete when they write and that\u2019s why so many are saying \u2014 in what seems to be a rather prurient and squeamish way \u2014 that there\u2019s a lot of sex in the book.\n\nI may have forgotten something. The scene in Jamaica. There\u2019s a thing about Jamaica. That wonderful week we had of fucking in Jamaica. That\u2019s more than one sentence there and I bet I could find something else, but in general, these are details meant to evoke, just as it\u2019s meant to evoke when I say, as Mark Athitakis has the discernment to quote today, our house wasn\u2019t the nicest on the block, but it was the second nicest on our side. It wasn\u2019t just a detail. It\u2019s meant to situate me in a certain way. We use details in a narrative and I don\u2019t believe there are wasted details in this narrative.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to music for a minute. It\u2019s probably easy for somebody younger, who grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s, to look back at the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s and think that for a little while at least, the good stuff and the popular stuff overlapped. I\u2019m talking about pop music. I\u2019m also thinking about the first two \u201cGodfather\u201d movies and a handful of other things. Is it fair to say that that really happened or is that just a nostalgic fantasy? In other words, did the good stuff and the popular stuff start to diverge at some point? They broke apart, where we got great work and popular work that were not often the same thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The great rock critic unloads on haters, praises Kanye, whacks critics who complain about the sex in his new memoir", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The great rock critic unloads on haters, praises Kanye, whacks critics who complain about the sex in his new memoir", "title": "\u201cThe notion that no current popular music is of quality is philistine\u201d: Robert Christgau on Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye, the Ramones, online journalism and bohemian sex lives", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/the_notion_that_no_current_popular_music_is_of_quality_is_philistine_robert_christgau_on_beyonce_kanye_the_ramones_online_journalism_and_bohemian_sex_lives/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/robert_christgau.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The great rock critic unloads on haters, praises Kanye, whacks critics who complain about the sex in his new memoir", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/robert_christgau.jpg", "title": "\u201cThe notion that no current popular music is of quality is philistine\u201d: Robert Christgau on Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye, the Ramones, online journalism and bohemian sex lives", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThe notion that no current popular music is of quality is philistine\u201d: Robert Christgau on Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye, the Ramones, online journalism and bohemian sex lives", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Beyonce, Books, Bruce Springsteen, Ellen Willis, Foo Fighters, iggy azalea, Jon Landau, Kanye West, Lester Bangs, Media Criticism, ramones, Robert Christgau, Talking Heads, Television, U2, village voice", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t think she would deny and I don\u2019t think Stanley would deny either, although I don\u2019t know anything really about the details of the relationship except that I could see that they loved each other.\nWe use details in a narrative and I don\u2019t believe there are wasted details in this narrative.\nI don\u2019t believe you will ever find a single passage where there are two consecutive sentences about it.\nEllen Willis and I came from exactly the same background, Scott.\nIf you\u2019re intimate with a mind as powerful as that of Ellen Willis, it takes you a long time to separate yourself from her ideas."}
