WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Hood River) applauded a federal judge for ruling in favor of the U.S. House of Representatives in a lawsuit against the Obama Administration’s improper use of taxpayer dollars under Obamacare.

“This Administration has repeatedly expanded executive power and flouted basic Constitutional principles. Today’s decision sends a clear message to the Administration: they must follow the Constitution and respect the role of Congress. This is a big step forward towards reining in the Administration and protecting Congress’ power to decide how federal tax dollars should be spent. I am pleased that the court followed the plain meaning of the Constitution and upheld the rule of law,” Walden said.
