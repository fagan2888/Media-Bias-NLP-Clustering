Alas, America forgot this important lesson in the mindset of the doctrinaire socialist\u2026 so here we are, stuck with ObamaCare and watching its tentacles crush the life out of jobs and businesses across the land.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe latest victims include a 30-year old church-run day care center in Texas, leaving the parents of some 145 children to make new accommodations:\n\nBuck up, little campers! No doubt a massive federally-funded program will spring up to cover your needs. Why, a cynic might even say that\u2019s one of the objectives of ObamaCare, not an unfortunate side effect. Why let some local church group handle child care, when Washington can do it half as well for fifty times the expense?\n\nPerhaps more ominously, ObamaCare has started killing off health insurance providers, such as CoOpportunity Health of Iowa. Its obituary was written by the New York Times on Monday:\n\nA few days after Christmas, Lisa Lovig\u2019s doctor called with jarring news. The health insurer covering her cancer treatments had run out of money, and its future was at best uncertain. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d said Ms. Lovig, 59, who has pancreatic cancer and relies on her insurance to cover frequent doctor appointments, tests and a litany of expensive drugs. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to me.\u201d Her insurer, CoOportunity Health, was one of 23 nonprofit cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act to generate more competition and choice in insurance markets dominated by huge for-profit companies. Many of these newcomers to the industry, seeded with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loans, struggled to attract customers after the law\u2019s online insurance exchanges opened in 2013. But CoOportunity had seemed to flourish, with over 120,000 customers in Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 far more than the 15,000 it had anticipated \u2014 by the end of last year. Its success apparently helped doom it. CoOportunity\u2019s many customers needed more medical care than expected, according to Nick Gerhart, Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, and it had priced its plans too low. After taking control of the co-op in late December, Mr. Gerhart decided last month that it could not be saved and asked a court to liquidate it. The co-op, he said at the time, faced more than $150 million in liabilities. That left its customers scrambling for new coverage, and providers wondering if millions of dollars in outstanding claims would ever get paid. More broadly, it raised the question of whether one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s biggest experiments in holding down insurance costs was in trouble beyond Iowa and Nebraska. The co-ops, which the law says must be \u201cconsumer governed\u201d by boards elected by their customers, have received nearly $2 billion in federal loans, including $145 million that went to CoOportunity. They were initially supposed to receive $6 billion over time, but Congress later slashed the amount and virtually no funds remain. \u201cCertainly I\u2019m very disheartened right now,\u201d said Dr. David Carlyle, a family physician in Ames, Iowa, who served on a board that advised the Obama administration on how to set up the cooperatives. \u201cIf you can\u2019t have competition, you\u2019re going to go back to a world where a large percent of the population is unable to get health insurance.\u201d\n\nIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Nobody is going to\u2026 oh, what\u2019s the point of repeating the old lies any more? Not even the most deluded dead-end Obama supporters are still trying to argue that he was telling the truth as he understood it at the time. These days, they spend most of their time arguing that you can pretend ObamaCare was kinda sorta successful if you just ignore everybody who was hurt by it \u2013 screaming \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d into their faces if necessary \u2013 and avoid dwelling on how much it\u2019s all going to cost us.\n\nJust about anything can be made to appear successful if cost and overall effectiveness are ignored, just as Americans were hornswaggled into throwing away their health care system by touting phony statistics about the number of people who supposedly didn\u2019t benefit from it\u2026 and ignoring polls showing that most people were happy with it.\n\nAllow me to translate this grim news about health-care co-ops for you: like everything else about ObamaCare, the relatively modest premiums paid by some customers in the first year or two of the program were a lie. The payments were made artificially low to fool a critical mass of people into thinking ObamaCare was a good deal, deferring the mounting suspicious of the American people for a crucial period until the dependency cement could harden. Once enough people are dependent upon a program, leftist theory holds, the complaints of those required to pay for it cease to matter.\n\nContrary to Dr. Carlyle\u2019s assertion, we\u2019re still living in a world where \u201ca large percent of the population is unable to get health insurance,\u201d and a lot of the people who have gotten it \u2013 at fantastic public expense \u2013 are not happy with the product. The failure of key components of ObamaCare won\u2019t be taken as a sign that the program has failed and needs to be replaced, however. No, the failure of this scheme was always built right into its basic code, and the \u201csolution\u201d rammed down our throats will be single-payer health care, in which everyone gets \u201ccoverage,\u201d but only the well-connected get decent medicine.\n\nThe cash pipeline flowing from the U.S. Treasury, through ObamaCare customers, and into the pockets of the biggest insurance companies will run for a while longer, and then the whole corporatist partnership will be declared untenable, to be replaced with pure government control. The Times relays an analysis from insurance ratings agency A.M. Best that found \u201call but one of the co-ops reported financial losses through third quarter of last year.\u201d It won\u2019t be long now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare's Latest Victims Include a Day-Care Center, And An Insurance Company", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "ObamaCare's Latest Victims Include a Day-Care Center, And An Insurance Company", "title": "ObamaCare's Latest Victims Include a Day-Care Center, And An Insurance Company - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/17/obamacares-latest-victims-include-a-day-care-center-and-an-insurance-company/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare's Latest Victims Include a Day-Care Center, And An Insurance Company", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "title": "ObamaCare's Latest Victims Include a Day-Care Center, And An Insurance Company - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "co-op, health insurance, obamacare,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-17T13:49:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06ff\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps more ominously, ObamaCare has started killing off health insurance providers, such as CoOpportunity Health of Iowa.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe latest victims include a 30-year old church-run day care center in Texas, leaving the parents of some 145 children to make new accommodations:Buck up, little campers!\nWhy let some local church group handle child care, when Washington can do it half as well for fifty times the expense?\nCoOportunity\u2019s many customers needed more medical care than expected, according to Nick Gerhart, Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, and it had priced its plans too low.\nWhy, a cynic might even say that\u2019s one of the objectives of ObamaCare, not an unfortunate side effect."}
