(http://apps.who.int/prequal/info_applicants/NOC/2015/NOC_Svizera02September2015.pdf)\n\nSvizera Managing Director Vinay Sapte said he disagreed strongly with the content of the report, adding that independent consultants who had visited the factory since the WHO inspection in June had found it to be up to standard.\n\n\"We are convinced that ... we can resolve this issue in short time,\" Sapte said in an emailed statement.\n\nSERIOUS CONCERNS\n\nThe lengthy list of deficiencies identified by the WHO team included rusty and unclean surfaces on drug packaging lines, defective seals and black mould in a cleaning area, generally low hygiene standards, and inadequate factory record-keeping.\n\nThe inspectors also criticized the quality of drug testing and said some of the results may have been manipulated.\n\n\"The above examples raise serious concerns regarding the integrity, reliability and accuracy of the data generated and available at your manufacturing site and on your ability to prevent contamination and cross-contamination of your products,\" the letter stated.\n\nSvizera will not be allowed to submit new products under the WHO pre-qualification approval process until the notice of concern is lifted.\n\nIts existing medicines will not be affected for now but the WHO said approvals would be suspended and it would recommend that agencies stop buying from Svizera if the problems are not rectified within a reasonable time.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously imposed sanctions on a number of Indian drugmakers, causing severe problems for companies such as Ranbaxy, now part of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nMore recently, the WHO has also become more assertive on quality issues. Its inspectors issued another hard-hitting notice of concern in June to Indian clinical research organization Quest Life Sciences.\n\n(Editing by David Clarke)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "who, sounds, alarm, over, big, indian, supplier, tuberculosis, drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization will suspend a major Indian supplier of tuberculosis drugs to developing countries if it doesn't correct its inadequate manufacturing standards and poor testing procedures.", "title": "WHO Sounds Alarm Over Big Indian Supplier Of Tuberculosis Drugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-sounds-alarm-over-big-indian-supplier-tuberculosis-drugs-351370", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/06/tuberculosis.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization will suspend a major Indian supplier of tuberculosis drugs to developing countries if it doesn't correct its inadequate manufacturing standards and poor testing procedures.", "title": "WHO Sounds Alarm Over Big Indian Supplier Of Tuberculosis Drugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-sounds-alarm-over-big-indian-supplier-tuberculosis-drugs-351370", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/06/tuberculosis.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/06/tuberculosis.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-06T10:56:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-06T11:02:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization will suspend a major Indian supplier of tuberculosis drugs to developing countries if it doesn't correct its inadequate manufacturing standards and poor testing procedures."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0772\"", "article_summary": "LONDON/MUMBAI (Reuters) - A major Indian supplier of tuberculosis drugs to developing countries has been severely criticized by the World Health Organization for inadequate manufacturing standards and poor testing procedures.\nIts inspectors issued another hard-hitting notice of concern in June to Indian clinical research organization Quest Life Sciences.\nThe inspectors also criticized the quality of drug testing and said some of the results may have been manipulated.\nThe WHO, which checks on medicines used by U.N. agencies, issued the \"notice of concern\" letter to Svizera on Sept. 2 setting out 10 shortcomings.\nSvizera will not be allowed to submit new products under the WHO pre-qualification approval process until the notice of concern is lifted."}
