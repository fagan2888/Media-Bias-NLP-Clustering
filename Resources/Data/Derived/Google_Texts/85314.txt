The shooting victim has been identified as 36-year-old Darius Hudnall. Hudnall was also known as "Wild Bill".

The Meridian Police Dept. received a 911 call about a man being shot at a downtown nightclub. Once they arrived on scene, they found one man unconscious with a bullet wound.

"It occurred in the 100 block of 8th avenue. Once officers got on scene, they discovered a male subject that suffered a gunshot wound. He was transported,” Det. Dareall Thompson says.

Once the man was transported to a hospital he was pronounced dead. The shooting happened around 3 a.m. Police questioned several witnesses who saw the shooting happen.

"Patrol officers responded first. They were able to gather some information and pass it along to investigators that responded to the scene,” Thompson says.

Just a few hours after the shooting death, there was reports of a fire at the “Suga Shak”. The only damage done was to a fence right where the victim was shot. The “Suga Shak” is a bar known for having many run-ins with law enforcement.

"We have received some calls in reference to incidents there," Thompson says.

Lauderdale county coroner Clayton Cobler says the victim’s body is already in Jackson awaiting an autopsy.

"We’re asking if anyone that was at the club when this incident occurred, contact the Meridian Police Dept.,” Thompson says.
