The Teamsters Union has withdrawn another organizing election petition for drivers at one of FedEx Freight’s terminals.

The move at the Nashville, Tennessee, facility is the fourth such decision in the past five weeks.

According to a statement from FedEx Freight, the union would only take this action if it recognized that it would lose.

The union has not publicly said why it withdrew the vote.

“Our drivers continue to send a clear message that the union is not needed and not wanted,” said Pat Reed, chief operating officer and executive vice president at FedEx Freight. “We remain confident that the vast majority of our team members want to continue their direct relationship with management without third party interference.”

Since winning its first organizing election at FedEx Freight in October, the union has won a total of three at separate terminals while drivers have voted against the union at three other locations.
