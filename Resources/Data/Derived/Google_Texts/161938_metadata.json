Tony's gear manufacturers Ibanez, Hughes & Kettner, EMG, Ernie Ball, Source Audio and Voodoo Lab have also generously donated equipment to be raffled.\n\n\n\nTony's cancer diagnosis comes on the heels of his wife's diagnosis with breast cancer in June, making the situation even more trying for Tony and his family.\n\n\n\n\"Tony is a dear friend, an absolutely sweet human being and one of the most talented musicians I've ever worked with,\" says Mike Portnoy. \"We are coming together to help raise money and awareness to help him fight his battle and come out on top!\" Adds Steve Vai: \"It's a great privilege to take to the stage with my friends Zakk, John, Mike and Billy in support of our dear friend Tony. Tony has always been blessed with an exceptional talent and more so, he's an exceptionally cool guy. It's a great cause and will be a magical evening of guitar extravaganza.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tony has been such an inspiration to me,\" says John 5. \"He is an incredible musician and an unbelievable talent.
