It\u2019s also become increasingly clear that her story, of growing up in a big family and wanting to replicate that for herself at an early age, is no longer the norm for a majority of young American men and women.\n\nWe see this play out on television and in the movies (think \u201cGirls\u201d or \u201cWedding Crashers\u201d). We hear it in graduation speeches lauding endless opportunities and paths. And then there\u2019s the data, painting a picture of career-driven millennials who are the slowest to have kids of any generation in U.S. history.\n\nBut what, if anything, do these changing norms mean for those couples that still choose to start families young? For society at large?\n\nA New Normal\n\nThere are many factors potentially at work today discouraging young people from having children that it\u2019s hard to know for sure what\u2019s really behind the dip in America\u2019s birth rate\u2014or to blame for holding off.\n\nBetween the Great Recession, the necessity of a college education (and therefore, the magnitude of student loan debt in the U.S.), the price of homeownership, and delayed marriage due to social or financial reasons, it seems more a storm of inhibiting issues than an identifiable trend.\n\nSome younger moms also theorize about the both assumed and realistic social implications of motherhood, and its ability to deter young women from having kids.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends are getting engaged, but they have no plans of having babies until much later on,\u201d says Suzanne Kioko, a 26-year-old registered nurse and mother currently expecting her second child. \u201cThey have this notion of life is kind of going to suck as soon as you have kids. And they want to get in all their good times before they [have children].\u201d\n\nRegardless of its cause, we do know that the birth rate drop is meaningful. Just last month, the Urban Institute published a widely circulated paper outlining a 15 percent decrease of American women in their twenties having children. Previously, the birth rate was largely stable for this demographic from the 1980s until around 2007.\n\nResearchers Nan Marie Astone, Steven Martin, and H. Elizabeth Peters authored the study and found that birth rates to women aged 20 to 29 fell, dropping from 1,118 in 1,000 women to 948 in 1,000 women in 2012. Simultaneously, strong immigration rates which would have helped to supplant such a decline dipped, likely because of the struggling economy.\n\nWorth noting, all races experienced a decline in giving birth, with the largest drop being seen among Hispanic women. For white women in particular, the birth rate decline was linked directly to a marital decline.\n\n\u201cMarriage has come a capstone to adulthood, rather than an entryway into adulthood as it has traditionally been,\u201d says Rachel Sheffield, a policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity. \u201cToday, individuals often wait to marry until they have achieved a level of independence marked by completing college, establishing a career, and perhaps even having already purchased a home.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell whether these young women will \u201cmatch\u201d previous generations by having babies in their 30s or later. Historically speaking, the birth rate also fell in the early 1930s and late 1970s, aligning with other periods of economic struggle, before bouncing back and evening out.\n\n\u201cIf these low birth rates to women in their twenties continue without a commensurate increase in birth rates to older women,\u201d the Urban Institute researchers wrote, \u201cthe United States might eventually face the type of generational imbalance that currently characterizes Japan and some European countries.\u201d\n\nMuch Ado About \u2026 Something?\n\nSo what do these \u201cwarnings\u201d really amount to? According to Jonathan V. Last, a senior writer at The Weekly Standard and author of \u201cWhat to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting,\u201d America is facing a \u201cdemographic cliff,\u201d or a population replacement rate that simply isn\u2019t sustainable, as he wrote in \u201cThe Wall Street Journal.\u201d In his opinion, population-dependent programs like Social Security\u2014along with tax-dependent organizations like the military\u2014could suffer.\n\n\u201cDecline isn\u2019t about whether Democrats or Republicans hold power,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about political ideology at all. At its most basic, it\u2019s about the sustainability of human capital.\u201d\n\nLast goes on to cite social and economic problems in countries like China, Japan, and Mexico, tracing their origins to things like China\u2019s infamous one-child policy or the overall decline in the marriage rate in Japan.\n\nAnthropologists have also written about the economics of European nations like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, blaming declining demographics and an inability to develop strong economies. In Russia, the government has offered monetary incentives for having kids, and in Denmark, independent organizations like travel-company Spies Rejser have launched campaigns asking citizens to \u201cDo It for Denmark!\u201d\n\nRecently, 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, proposed a tax reform plan that included a child tax credit.\n\nIn practice, lower birth rates probably don\u2019t make a huge difference in the lives of young American mothers yet, outside of occasionally awkward conversations at work and a more difficult time making friends who are \u201cin the same boat,\u201d as Suzanne says.\n\n\u201cNowadays, you don\u2019t have a lot of younger moms having babies, so you kind of feel like you\u2019re on your own,\u201d she adds. \u201cMost of your friends are still working and doing their thing, so socially, I think it\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nMaria agrees: \u201cI remember I was working at a law firm downtown [in Washington, D.C.], and I was still working when I got pregnant. It was definitely weird. It was like a glance, or a look, or a comment, and you could tell that it\u2019s, \u2018Oh wow, you just got married and really, you want to start a family already?\u2019\u201d\n\nKassie Novak, a 26-year-old mother who lives in Chicago with her husband and 18-month-old son, has found that making friends with other mothers takes a significant amount of work because of the age difference.\n\n\u201cI do try to put an effort into meeting other moms. It\u2019s much harder than I would have imagined,\u201d she says. \u201cJust about every mom I have met here is about five to 15 years older than me \u2026 I used to joke with my husband that I think the moms at the park or at baby classes think I\u2019m the nanny. But now that my son is older, I am much more comfortable approaching and chatting with other moms.\u201d\n\nDollars and Sense\n\nAside from shifting social realities, young families are also making fiscal sacrifices in order to afford a family, reflecting the estimated $250,000 it currently takes to raise a child in America.\n\nAnd while the share of moms who did not work hit an all-time low in 1999 at 23 percent, it rose to 29 percent by 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. This group includes those who are unable to find work or disabled.\n\nSuzanne, Maria, and Kassie, employed full-time before having their children, are all working in some capacity outside of the home, whether it\u2019s picking up spare shifts at the hospital or selling skin care products in their free time, as is the case with Kassie.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re renting an apartment,\u201d Maria says of her Reston, Va., home. \u201cAll of our couple friends have been talking, and it looks like we\u2019ll all be renting \u2026 for a while. Houses just cost a lot. Unless you have a really great paying job, it\u2019s a little bit harder.\u201d\n\nMaria and her husband are also sharing one car. \u201cTwo would be awesome, but it\u2019s not realistic right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019d much rather have another kid as opposed to another car. Kids are around a long time, but cars come and go.\u201d\n\nThere are possible benefits for these families, though, including things like more open slots at schools and readily available vaccines. The Urban Institute study, using census data, also suggests a lower birth rate could potentially mean greater social mobility in the future for babies born to millennials.\n\nIn contrast, researchers found that among baby boomers and Gen Xers, \u201csingle parenthood increased among already disadvantaged groups,\u201d and furthered income inequality between high- and low-income families.\n\nIn certain circumstances, a decrease in the birth rate could also mean more stable environments for children.\n\n\u201cAs of 2010, the average age at first birth for a college educated woman was about 30, whereas in 1970 it was around 26,\u201d Sheffield says. \u201cAmong those with less than a high school education, the average age of motherhood was about 18 in 1970, whereas today it\u2019s around 20.\u201d\n\nFor their part, the millennial mothers The Daily Signal spoke with seem content with their decision to start a family young.\n\n\u201cBeing a young mom was what I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Kassie says. \u201cI believe motherhood to be my calling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Millennials, birth rate, Urban Institute, fertility, recession, society", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "When Maria Harrill was growing up in suburban Maryland in the early 1990s, she kept a journal outlining all the things she\u2019d do when she...
