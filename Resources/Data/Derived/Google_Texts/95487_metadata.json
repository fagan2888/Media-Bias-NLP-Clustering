Valentina pleaded with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet to allow her to die on her own terms via a video message that went viral. Although her request did elicit a response from Bachelet, it was not the response she was hoping for.\n\n\"I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,\" Valentina explains in the video. \"I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.\"\n\nThe government of Chile, a Catholic country where euthanasia is illegal, denied the young girl\u2019s appeal Thursday, but President Bachelet paid Valentina and her father a special visit at Catholic University hospital in Santiago. Bachelet explained that while the country could not allow Valentina to end her own life, it would be able to pay for any psychiatric treatment she may need. Valentina\u2019s family was appreciative of the president\u2019s kind gesture but simply wants their daughter to retain her dignity.\n\n\u201cI already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs,\u201d Valentina\u2019s father, Fredy Maureira, told The Associated Press. \u201cNow my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way. She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second. My message to all the parents in the world who have healthy kids is: Please take care of them. Love them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, around 70,000 people around the world are affected by this life-threatening genetic disease that attacks the lungs and digestive system. Thick mucus buildup in the lungs makes breathing very difficult and traps bacteria in the airways, often leading to infections, inflammation, and severe lung damage. Patients eventually suffer potentially fatal respiratory failure. The average age of survival for cystic fibrosis patients is early 40s.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "euthanasia, debate, valentina, maureira, teen, cystic, fibrosis, pleads, chiles, president, let", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fourteen-year-old Valentina Maureira has pleaded with President Michelle Bachelet and the rest of the Chilean government to let her die in peace.", "title": "Chilean Girl With Cystic Fibrosis Pleads With President To Let Her Die [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/euthanasia-debate-valentina-maureira-teen-cystic-fibrosis-pleads-chiles-president-let-324002", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/02/euthanasia-debate-valentina-maureira-teen-cystic-fibrosis-pleads-chiles-president-let.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fourteen-year-old Valentina Maureira has pleaded with President Michelle Bachelet and the rest of the Chilean government to let her die in peace.", "title": "Chilean Girl With Cystic Fibrosis Pleads With President To Let Her Die [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/euthanasia-debate-valentina-maureira-teen-cystic-fibrosis-pleads-chiles-president-let-324002", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/02/euthanasia-debate-valentina-maureira-teen-cystic-fibrosis-pleads-chiles-president-let.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/02/euthanasia-debate-valentina-maureira-teen-cystic-fibrosis-pleads-chiles-president-let.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-02T10:49:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T10:49:32-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fourteen-year-old Valentina Maureira has pleaded with President Michelle Bachelet and the rest of the Chilean government to let her die in peace."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fd0\"", "article_summary": "The average age of survival for cystic fibrosis patients is early 40s.\nValentina pleaded with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet to allow her to die on her own terms via a video message that went viral.\nLove them.\u201dAccording to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, around 70,000 people around the world are affected by this life-threatening genetic disease that attacks the lungs and digestive system.\n\"I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,\" Valentina explains in the video.\nAlthough her request did elicit a response from Bachelet, it was not the response she was hoping for."}
