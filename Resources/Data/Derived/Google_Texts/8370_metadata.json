Marco Rubio, who penned an email to Coffman supporters urging them to support the congressman because he\u2019s voted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIn the fight against ObamaCare, Colorado Congressman Mike Coffman has joined me in standing up for taxpayers by trying to block a potential bailout hidden deep in ObamaCare,\u201d Rubio writes.\n\n\u201cTucked inside the 2,000-page monstrosity that is ObamaCare is a commitment for taxpayers to bail out insurance companies when ObamaCare fails.\n\n\u201cIf you believe that ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced, sign this petition and stand with Mike Coffman and me.\u201d\n\nFollowing Rubio\u2019s email, Coffman\u2019s campaign sent out a press release urging Romanoff, a former statehouse Speaker, to renounce his support for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis law, and the broken promises made while selling it, represent a gross overreach of government and a violation of trust between the people and the politicians who supported it,\u201d the Coffman campaign states.\n\n\u201cWe need a representative who recognizes that. Unfortunately, Speaker Andrew Romanoff has supported Obamacare at every turn.\u201d\n\nThat line and Coffman\u2019s Obamacare offensive on the whole are a rejoinder to Romanoff\u2019s push on Tuesday to get Coffman to move away from personhood, which would outlaw abortion in all circumstances as well as some forms of birth control by defining a fertilized egg as a person.\n\nThat nudge did prompt Coffman to state that he now opposes personhood, something he\u2019s never before done; and despite his campaign\u2019s insistence that his refusal to take a public stance on the issue in 2012 marked a shift on the issue, Romanoff has attacked Coffman for supporting personhood \u201cat every turn.\u201d\n\nIn his press release, Coffman urges Romanoff to follow the lead of Congressman Mike McIntyre, D-North Carolina, who voted with Republicans to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Romanoff should follow Democratic Congressman Mike McIntyre\u2019s lead and disavow Obamacare,\u201d said Tyler Sandberg, Coffman\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s bad policy, it\u2019s hurting families and Speaker Romanoff should do the right thing and reverse his position on Obamacare.\n\n\u201cObamacare has caused women across Colorado to lose their OB/GYN, to lose access to their family\u2019s pediatrician, and put serious strain on family budgets by forcing families to pay higher premiums and higher deductibles.\u201d\n\nWhile Romanoff is unlikely to suddenly disavow Obamacare, the back and forth between him and Coffman marks the first time the campaigns have engaged each other \u2014 and the contrast on the issues each campaign is focusing on is no surprise.\n\nDemocrats are sticking to the \u201cBennet playbook\u201d, attempting to make Republican candidates unacceptable to swing voters by focusing on social issues; Republicans, meanwhile, are focused almost exclusively on Obamacare, which they believe may do in Democratic candidates this November given all the problems implementing the new law.\n\nRomanoff\u2019s campaign responded to Coffman\u2019s Obamacare offensive by framing the issue around women\u2019s health issues.\n\n\u201cAndrew has not changed his position on reproductive rights or access to health care. Neither has Congressman Coffman,\u201d said Romanoff\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Denise Baron.\n\n\u201cCongressman Coffman has supported personhood every time it\u2019s been on the ballot. He still believes politicians like him should control women\u2019s reproductive rights and access to basic health care. He has always voted against improved access to birth control, and he still believes in criminalizing abortion.\n\n\u201cLook, he even voted to redefine \u201crape\u201d as \u201cforcible rape.\u201d And that\u2019s why the one person you haven\u2019t heard from about \u201cMike Coffman on personhood\u201d is Mike Coffman. Because when you get right down to it, his position on that hasn\u2019t really changed either.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also responded to Coffman by focusing on personhood \u2014 and Rubio.\n\n\u201cFor Congressman Coffman to partner with fellow personhood supporter Marco Rubio is just more proof that Coffman can\u2019t run away from his record of supporting the anti-birth control measure every time it was on the ballot in Colorado,\u201d said the DCCC\u2019s Emily Bittner.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s his vote to defund Planned Parenthood or his support for Todd Akin\u2019s bill to redefine rape, Congressman Coffman has made it crystal clear he doesn\u2019t believe that Colorado women have the right to make their own personal decisions about their health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- One of the country's most competitive congressional races is shifting into a higher gear.
