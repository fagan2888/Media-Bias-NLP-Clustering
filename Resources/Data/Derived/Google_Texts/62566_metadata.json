Karen Branham, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said changing the number of report cards could align them better with the benchmark assessments.\n\nIn addition, Branham said that parents now have access all the time to their children's grades through the online Parent Portal. \"This allows parents to keep a pulse on how their child is doing in class,\" Branham said. \"Some say it places a little less emphasis on the report card.\"\n\nChanging the report cards to four times a year would mean parents would get updates about every nine weeks. The district said that would give parents and schools more time to respond to student needs in between each reporting period.\n\nThe potential change is only being looked at on the elementary and middle school level, in part because different high schools operate on different schedules, Branham said. For instance, four grading periods wouldn't work very well for a school on a trimester schedule.\n\nWhat do you think? Did you take the survey? Should JCPS make this change?\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Bu9OpW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "JCPS survey asks parents whether it would make more sense to go from 6 to 4 grading cycles", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "JCPS survey asks parents whether it would make more sense to go from 6 to 4 grading cycles", "title": "Should JCPS change to 4 report cards a year?", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/education-blog/2015/03/01/should-jcps-change-to-4-report-cards-a-year/24222633/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "JCPS survey asks parents whether it would make more sense to go from 6 to 4 grading cycles", "title": "JCPS survey asks parents whether it would make more sense to go from 6 to 4 grading cycles", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/173613d66eb659252eeb2da9fddf8cd0bc6da3b3/c=0-34-629-663&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/education/education-blog", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/888a7c74c4059ac6ca9f6bb9e036362452912ee6/c=54-0-576-696/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3c390ac00413fad3de7140d86293a49d6b2191c8/c=0-34-629-663/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91594323974b533f7bcd0d3623b9d6c6f629f2aa/c=0-112-629-585/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9f00ab24cd43161a0d405d87dcd5ddc1dc58f73/c=0-170-629-525&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-01T15:03:31.070000-05:00", "shorthed": "Should JCPS change to 4 report cards a year?", "articleid": 24222633, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3db524e8c1225e6a4479bc3373c8539316f0333/c=0-170-629-525/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df7c8ba681afbb74c02ea0217d393a7e50f20a20/c=120-0-510-696/local/-/media/2015/03/01/Louisville/Louisville/635608188669724096-reportcard.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "author": "Allison Ross", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Should JCPS change to 4 report cards a year?"}, "news_keywords": "JCPS, report card, grading periods, Allison Ross, Karen Branham, grades"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bf2\"", "article_summary": "Changing the report cards to four times a year would mean parents would get updates about every nine weeks.\nIn addition to that discussion, JCPS is also looking at whether elementary and middle schools should go from sending out six report cards a year to only four.\nKaren Branham, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said changing the number of report cards could align them better with the benchmark assessments.\nThe district said that would give parents and schools more time to respond to student needs in between each reporting period.\nThe district is surveying parents, teachers and others about this idea, noting a few reasons why such a change may be beneficial."}
