Laws seen by some as discriminatory to the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transsexual (LGBT) community continue to see rising levels of backlash, including in Kansas.

Protesters lined up Friday in front of the Statehouse in Topeka to pressure Kansas legislators not to pass a law similar to those recently passed in Mississippi and North Carolina.

Kansas is considering it's own so-called bathroom law, designed to force transgender people to use restrooms aligning with their birth gender at public schools and universities. The bill includes provisions for a $2,500 bounty awarded to people who would report others for using the incorrect bathroom facility.

The bills are not scheduled for further debate this legislative session, but could be revisited next year.

Similar bills passed in North Carolina and Mississippi have created a whirlwind of negative sentiment, including sports and entertainment entities threatening to or cancelling events in the states and politicians from other states refusing government funded travel to states adopting the laws.
