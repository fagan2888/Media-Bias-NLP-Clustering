She was a woman and she was black, so you know they went to town on her. So I think the person who\u2019s running is how you have to look at them.\u201d\n\nCo-host Michelle Collins, who has dealt with headaches this week related to an entirely separate incident on The View in which she mocked the nursing profession, added of Carson: \u201cFor an educated guy who is a minority to come out and say that, it\u2019s so shocking to me.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cYour World\u201d in August, Carson suggested that Planned Parenthood clinics operate in predominantly black neighborhoods as a way to \u201ccontrol\u201d the African-American population.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m not objective when it comes to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Carson said. \u201cBut you know, I know who [Planned Parenthood founder] Margaret Sanger is, and I know that she believed in eugenics, and that she was not particularly enamored with black people. And one of the reasons that you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find a way to control that population.\u201d\n\nThe View lost five major sponsors this week after Joy Behar and Collins took turns mocking a nurse who participated in the Miss America contest. Johnson & Johnson, Eggland\u2019s Best, Party City, Snuggle, and McCormick all cut ties with the ABC talk show over the incident.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whoopi Goldberg slammed critics of Planned Parenthood Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Whoopi Goldberg slammed critics of Planned Parenthood Monday.", "title": "Whoopi Goldberg to Planned Parenthood Critics: 'Get Out of My Vagina!' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Whoopi-Goldberd-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-21T20:05:19-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/09/21/whoopi-goldberg-planned-parenthood-critics-get-vagina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whoopi Goldberg slammed critics of Planned Parenthood Monday.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Whoopi-Goldberd-Getty.jpg", "title": "Whoopi Goldberg to Planned Parenthood Critics: 'Get Out of My Vagina!' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ABC, Ben Carson, Michelle Collins, Planned Parenthood, The View, Whoopi Goldberg,Big Hollywood,Goldberg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-21T20:04:49-07:00", "section": "Big Hollywood", "modified_time": "2015-09-21T20:05:19-07:00", "tag": "Whoopi Goldberg", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m not objective when it comes to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Carson said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhoopi Goldberg slammed critics of Planned Parenthood Monday, telling her fellow co-hosts on The View that defunding the controversial abortion provider would do little to stop women from obtaining abortions.\n\u201cBut you know, I know who [Planned Parenthood founder] Margaret Sanger is, and I know that she believed in eugenics, and that she was not particularly enamored with black people.\n\u201cKeep in mind Ben Carson, that\u2019s what they used to say about black candidates,\u201d Goldberg chided.\n\u201cIf you think this is going to stop women from doing it, it\u2019s not,\u201d Goldberg said during Monday\u2019s episode, according to the Wrap."}
