Many like Nezamuddin say they fled Pakistan over increased harassment by police who told them to return to Afghanistan, a country many have never even seen, putting new pressure on both countries to find solutions to the decades-old flow of refugees.\n\nThere are some 1.6 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan \u2014 and up to an estimated 1.5 million unregistered Afghans live there, said Abdul Quadir Baloch, the Pakistani minister responsible for refugee issues. Exact figures remain elusive as tens of thousands cross the border daily.\n\nPakistan initially welcomed waves of Afghan refugees after the 1979 invasion by the Soviet Union. But as years progressed, attitudes hardened. Many now see Afghan refugees as criminals or militants \u2014 or taking jobs from Pakistanis.\n\nThen came the Dec. 16 Taliban attack on an army-run school in Peshawar, in which 150 people, most of them children, were killed. Suddenly, Afghan refugees reported increased harassment by authorities checking their documents, demanding bribes and telling them they had to return to Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nAt Torkham, Afghan refugees now pour over the border with little more than the clothes on their backs. Some arrive on foot, others in rented trucks with family members huddled between bags, boxes, mattresses and suitcases.\n\nAwal Khan, a father of seven, spent 35 years in Pakistan, arriving as a baby when his parents fled after the 1979 invasion. Khan said he worked as a daily laborer, earning just enough to feed his family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "title": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "title": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/thousands_of_afghan_refugees_facing_harassment_flee_pakistan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/afghanistan-pakistan-refugees.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "title": "Thousands of Afghan refugees facing harassment flee Pakistan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/afghanistan-pakistan-refugees.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rahim Faiez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3537\"", "article_summary": "At Torkham, Afghan refugees now pour over the border with little more than the clothes on their backs.\nPakistan initially welcomed waves of Afghan refugees after the 1979 invasion by the Soviet Union.\nMany now see Afghan refugees as criminals or militants \u2014 or taking jobs from Pakistanis.\nSuddenly, Afghan refugees reported increased harassment by authorities checking their documents, demanding bribes and telling them they had to return to Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said.\nThere are some 1.6 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan \u2014 and up to an estimated 1.5 million unregistered Afghans live there, said Abdul Quadir Baloch, the Pakistani minister responsible for refugee issues."}
