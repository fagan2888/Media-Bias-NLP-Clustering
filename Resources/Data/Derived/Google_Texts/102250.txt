Careful readers of Peter King's Monday Morning Quarterback blog might have noticed an unusual trick of writing in the post that went up on September 5: King wrote 2,400 words of text about the Washington Redskins without actually using the word "Redskins." He simply replaced the team name with "Washington."

King is a longtime Sports Illustrator contributor, was named National Sportswriter of the Year in 2010, and is undoubtedly one of the most influential sportswriters covering the NFL. He explained his choice the following day:

I’ve decided to stop using the Washington team nickname. It’s a name you won’t see me use anymore. The simple reason is that for the last two or three years, I’ve been uneasy when I sat down to write about the team and had to use the nickname. In some stories I’ve tried to use it sparingly. But this year, I decided to stop entirely because it offends too many people, and I don’t want to add to the offensiveness. Some people, and some Native American organizations—such as the highly respected American Indian Movement—think the nickname is a slur. Obviously, the team feels it isn’t a slur, and there are several prominent Native American leaders who agree. But I can do my job without using it, and I will.
