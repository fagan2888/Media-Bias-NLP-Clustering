He was celibate from his 40th birthday (marked by a robust, if entirely transitory fling) until his late 70s, when \u2014 plagued by a melanoma in his right eye that left him partially blind, knee surgery and sciatica so bad it made him contemplate suicide \u2014 he fell, greatly to his surprise, in love. Sacks has been with his partner, the writer Bill Hayes, for the past eight years. In February, via an op-ed in the New York Times, he announced that the melanoma has spread to his liver and that he has only months to live.\n\nWe will lose a lot when we lose him. \u201cOn the Move\u201d illustrates what an exceptional human being he is, from a childhood illuminated by his passions for chemistry and music (related in greater detail in his earlier memoir, \u201cUncle Tungsten\u201d) to a youth spent roaming his native U.K. and the U.S. by motorcycle to an adult work life devoted to explaining the mysteries of the human brain and to helping those who live with any of its myriad irregularities to be better understood. He took LSD and befriended the poets Thom Gunn and W.H. Auden, as well as less-celebrated characters, such as the homeless friend he celebrates as \u201can utterly independent human being, a sort of modern, urban Thoreau.\u201d He loves ferns and cephalopods and swimming and mountains and his patients. He is fascinated by seemingly everything, and, damn, the man can write.\n\nBut Sacks has also been the great chronicler of a fundamental change in the way we view the brain and its workings, a change that has unfolded over the course of his career. He might have been purpose-built for the task. That\u2019s one reason why the penultimate chapter of \u201cOn the Move\u201d is taken up with explaining the pioneering work of the Nobelist Gerald Edelman, whose theory of \u201cneural Darwinism\u201d Sacks considers \u201cthe first truly global theory of mind and consciousness, the first biological theory of individuality and autonomy.\u201d\n\nEdelman, who pretty much embodies the stereotype of the brilliant but inaccessible scientist, once turned to Sacks at a conference and said \u201cYou\u2019re no theoretician.\u201d Sacks also wasn\u2019t much of a researcher, as he confesses himself, describing his bumbling exploits in various laboratories at the onset of his career. He always seems to be losing stuff, from precious tissue samples to his own manuscripts \u2014 although for anyone who writes as much as Sacks does (he claims to have filled nearly 1,000 journals), maybe the misplaced texts seem more expendable.\n\nSacks\u2019 reply to Edelman was, \u201cI know, but I am a field worker, and you need the sort of field work I do for the sort of theory-making you do.\u201d True, but the idea that Sacks was primarily a collector of data really doesn\u2019t do him justice. On the very last page of \u201cOn the Move,\u201d he writes, \u201cI am a storyteller, for better or for worse,\u201d and as simple as that statement is, it hits the mark. He is a storyteller who was born into a moment when neuroscience needed just that, a time when biologists have come to realize that every individual organism \u2014 from a flatworm to such splendid specimens of humanity as Oliver Sacks himself \u2014 is the culmination of a story.\n\nAccording to \u201cOn the Move,\u201d the young Sacks\u2019 superiors occasionally expressed frustration with his long, detailed, idiosyncratic accounts of individual patients and their problems, a propensity that naturally resulted in small, rather than \u201cbig\u201d data. Nevertheless, Sacks\u2019 early years at a headache clinic (resulting in his 1970 book \u201cMigraine\u201d) and his work with administering the drug L-dopa to the aging survivors of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (the subject of \u201cAwakenings\u201d) confirmed that \u201cone cannot abstract an ailment or its treatment from the whole pattern, the context, the economy of someone\u2019s life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The author-neurologist's new book shows how he became the perfect voice for a revolution in neuroscience", "title": "The beautiful mind of Oliver Sacks: How his knack for storytelling helped unlock the mysteries of the brain", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The author-neurologist's new book shows how he became the perfect voice for a revolution in neuroscience", "title": "The beautiful mind of Oliver Sacks: How his knack for storytelling helped unlock the mysteries of the brain", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/the_beautiful_mind_of_oliver_sacks_how_his_knack_for_storytelling_helped_unlock_the_mysteries_of_the_brain/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/oliver_sacks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The author-neurologist's new book shows how he became the perfect voice for a revolution in neuroscience", "title": "The beautiful mind of Oliver Sacks: How his knack for storytelling helped unlock the mysteries of the brain", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/oliver_sacks.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Memoir, Neuroscience, Oliver Sacks, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sacks has been with his partner, the writer Bill Hayes, for the past eight years.\nWhat Sacks is referring to, however, is his love life.\nIn February, via an op-ed in the New York Times, he announced that the melanoma has spread to his liver and that he has only months to live.\nBut Sacks has also been the great chronicler of a fundamental change in the way we view the brain and its workings, a change that has unfolded over the course of his career.\nHe is fascinated by seemingly everything, and, damn, the man can write."}
