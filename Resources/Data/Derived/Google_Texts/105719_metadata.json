It owns Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, Bayshore Community Hospital in Holmdel, Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank, Ocean Medical Center in Brick and Southern Ocean Medical Center in Stafford. It also has 1,300 doctors who are admitted to practice at some of its hospitals.\n\nYOUR TURN: Would you be willing to give up your doctor if you could save money?

New Jersey insurers are partnering with hospitals and doctors, creating so-called tiered networks. Their customers who use Tier 1 health care providers have lower out-of-pocket costs. Consumers can visit Tier 2 providers, but they would pay more.\n\nThey have touted it as a way to stem the tide of rising health care costs and improve the health of their customers. But it hasn't been universally embraced, particularly among Tier 2 hospitals that fear customers will gravitate to the lowest prices.\n\nMost notably: Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state's biggest health insurer, introduced a tiered-network plan called Omnia for 2016, which created upheaval. Lawmakers in Trenton called hearings, and CentraState Healthcare System and other hospitals that were left out of the top tier filed lawsuits.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nAs the model takes hold, it could leave winners and losers. Providers in Tier 2 would be on the outside looking in and could be forced to join a bigger health care system, said Linda Schwimmer, president and chief executive officer of New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, a research group.\n\nBut it also could produce what Obamacare intended, she said. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is trying to put the brakes on costs that in the 2000s rose by double-digits each year.\n\n\"I think this is the way things are going,\" Schwimmer said. \"We're seeing more and more a willingness in the marketplace to trade away broader choice for a lower price.\"\n\nThe plans are finding support among consumers who are searching for ways to save money. Businesses have said rising health insurance costs are their biggest concern and they can't sustain huge increases each year, said Michele Siekerka, president and chief executive officer of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a business lobby group.\n\nThe idea of tiered networks \"is a really healthy discussion everyone is having,\" she said.\n\nGetting attention\n\n\"They definitely are getting the attention of consumers,\" Toby Stark, a Tinton Falls health insurance broker and president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters trade group. \"There have been a lot of people attracted to the tiered plans.\"\n\nThe equation for health care providers is simple: They would be reimbursed less by insurers, but would get more business\n\nMore and more, Meridian is finding itself in the top tier of hospitals at the Shore. Meridian \u2013 along with Barnabas Health's hospitals \u2013 is in Horizon's Omnia network. And it is the Tier 1 provider for AmeriHealth New Jersey's Advantage plans that the insurer began selling to businesses and individuals last year.\n\nThe plan with Aetna is called Aetna Whole Health - Meridian Health. A customer, for example, would have a $10 co-payment to see a primary care doctor in Tier 1, compared with a $25 co-payment to see a primary care doctor in Tier 2.\n\nYoung said the companies expect about 4,000 members in Monmouth and Ocean counties will sign up in 2016. Raritan Bay Medical Center's hospitals in Middlesex County, which recently finalized a merger with Meridian, aren't included.\n\nMichael L.
