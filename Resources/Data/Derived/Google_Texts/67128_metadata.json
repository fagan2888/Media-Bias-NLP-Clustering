It also remains unclear if the rally even has a permit, typically required for demonstrations on Capitol grounds.\n\nSeim, when told by state officials that a permit wasn\u2019t available because another group had already been given a permit for that date, responded defiantly: \u201cFirst let\u2019s be clear. We are not asking for your \u2018authorization\u2019 and we\u2019re not \u2018applying\u2019 to the State. We are allowing them the opportunity to work with us. I did in fact clearly inform you we would be gathering on the main lawn right from the start and there was no doubt about where I meant. What I have outlined is what we ARE doing. \u2026 We informed you of the plan out of courtesy. You can work with us, or you can play games.\u201d\n\nIt is uncler clear if the activities that occur Saturday will actually break any laws, and Washington State Police officials say they do not expect to make any arrests at the rally.\n\nThe rally\u2019s scheduled speakers include Mack, a longtime militia darling who recently made headlines with his involvement in the standoff with federal agents at Bundy\u2019s Nevada ranch, where Ammon Bundy also became well-known as a media spokesman for his family. At one point in the standoff, Ammon Bundy was tasered after law enforcement officials say he tried to kick a police dog.\n\nVanderboegh, a cofounder of the so-called \u201cIII Percent\u201d Movement, was also at the Bundy ranch but is perhaps best known for having urged conservatives to throw bricks through the windows of Democrats\u2019 offices in March 2010 to protest the passage of the Affordable Care Act. In recent weeks he has toured states where gun control laws have been passed to promote the \u201cI Will Not Comply\u201d concept.\n\n\u201cI have gone around the country breaking (and encouraging others to break) unconstitutional state laws such as those recently passed in CT, NY, MD, CO and now, Washington State,\u201d he boasted on his blog. \u201cI have smuggled, and facilitated the smuggling of, standard capacity magazines in violation of those laws and dared the authorities of those states to do anything about it.\u201d\n\nWashington state Rep. Elizabeth Scott, R-Monroe, an arch-conservative who has aligned herself closely with antigovernment activists, is also among the scheduled speakers. Scott gained a reputation for arch-conservative positions during her first two years in the House, including second-guessing federal cleanup efforts at the Oso landslide disaster that occurred in Snohomish County in March.\n\nThe Oath Keepers, a group of retired military and police personnel fearful of the New World Order, posted a bulletin urging members to attend. However, a number of the state\u2019s leading anti-gun control organizations, including the National Rifle Association and Alan Gottlieb\u2019s Bellevue-based Second Amendment Foundation, have declined either to endorse or participate in the rally.\n\nSeim recently issued a final appeal on Facebook to the reluctant gun owners: \u201cI'm sad to report that nearly ALL gun rights and show groups and even some patriot groups have NOT supported America's courageous stand for liberty on the 13th,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe the people in mass are standing tall, but those that should be standing with us are silent. I ask patriots to contact groups tomorrow and invite them to stand with us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/12/10/antigovernment-figures-lead-%E2%80%98we-will-not-comply%E2%80%99-rally-washington-state-over-gun-rights", "site_name": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "image": "https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/10426930_10152512727559700_2647771730634151427_n.png", "type": "article", "title": "'Antigovernment' Figures to Lead \u2018We Will Not Comply\u2019 Rally in Washington State Over Gun Rights"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/12/10/antigovernment-figures-lead-%E2%80%98we-will-not-comply%E2%80%99-rally-washington-state-over-gun-rights", "creator": {"identifier": "@splcenter", "id": 65698096}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Antigovernment' Figures to Lead \u2018We Will Not Comply\u2019 Rally in Washington State Over Gun Rights"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8dd\"", "article_summary": "In recent weeks he has toured states where gun control laws have been passed to promote the \u201cI Will Not Comply\u201d concept.\n\u201cI have gone around the country breaking (and encouraging others to break) unconstitutional state laws such as those recently passed in CT, NY, MD, CO and now, Washington State,\u201d he boasted on his blog.\nIt also remains unclear if the rally even has a permit, typically required for demonstrations on Capitol grounds.\n\u201cWe will rally at the capitol, openly exchange guns, unveil and plan to break apart the entire legislation and violate I-594 in every possible way.\n[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppsFlTg2MDk[/youtube]The organizers claim that 5,000 gun owners will attend, but the source of that figure is unclear and historically such rallies have drawn considerably smaller crowds."}
