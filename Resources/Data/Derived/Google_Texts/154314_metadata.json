Unrest in the Middle East will help investment in U.S. energy, said Mr. Timken, who is chairman and chief executive of TimkenSteel.\n\nU.S. energy companies are investing $200 billion in drilling and production equipment, compared to $150 billion for the rest of the world, says CFO Shawn Seanor.\n\nA second is the auto industry. TimkenSteel makes parts like crank shafts that can\u2019t be replicated by aluminum, says Mr. Timken. A recent report by Ducker Worldwide forecast that 18% of car bodies will be all-aluminum by 2025, compared to 1% today.\n\nAnalysts say Timken\u2019s automotive bet is a sound one. \u201cThey make mechanical stuff that aluminum can\u2019t replicate,\u201d says Charles Bradford, an analyst with Bradford Research Inc. \u201cThey\u2019re not in the sheet parts or casting part of a car, they\u2019re in bearings, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll have aluminum bearings.\u201d\n\nThis week, Timken Co., the bearings company, where Mr. Timken is still a board member, raised its full-year earnings estimate to $2.40-$2.60 per share from $2.20-$2.50 per share.\n\nMr. Timken said he didn\u2019t believe TimkenSteel was for sale. \u201cIt\u2019s a consolidating industry with hungry players and a lot of cash,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our intent is to run the business.\u201d\n\nSee also:\n\nDetroit\u2019s Appetite for Aluminum Keeps Growing \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As TimkenSteel prepares for life as an independent company, some investors are buying into the idea of a niche American steel maker serving the auto and energy industries.", "title": "Welcome, TimkenSteel \u2013 But is There Still Money in American Steel Making?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/20/theres-a-new-american-steel-maker-but-can-it-make-money/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-BT987_STEELG_G_20120430181309.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Welcome, TimkenSteel \u2013 But is There Still Money in American Steel Making?", "description": "As TimkenSteel prepares for life as an independent company, some investors are buying into the idea of a niche American steel maker serving the auto and energy industries.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "John W.
