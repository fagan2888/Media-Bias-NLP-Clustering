It\u2019s just a matter of digging up the information and devising a way to make it accessible online.\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done \u2014 just ask anyone working on the government health-care exchanges \u2014 but Mr. Wu, who has a background in hedge funds and a degree in computer science from Columbia University, said he\u2019s surprised more people aren\u2019t doing it.\n\nWhen the Obamacare websites launched last year, \u201ctons of people were covering it going into open enrollment and they want to talk about prices, but it was interesting to us that no one actually pulled up the rate filing or no one talked to these regulators when all this information existed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Hey, this is where the actual plans are and they can get an accurate indication of how things are going to look.\u2019 We thought it was a good tool for people to get an idea of what these exchanges look like \u2014 to let them shop around and do a little research before they go through the process of enrolling,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\n\nFounded in June 2013, ValuePenguin provides research and tools for evaluating health care policies and credit cards. Mr. Wu started the company with two friends, Ting Pen and Brian Quinn. The company\u2019s name comes from their last names, which together sound like \u201cpenguin.\u201d\n\nThe New York-based company began examining and posting information on Obamacare policies prior to last year\u2019s inaugural rollout in October.\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be a fascinating thing because a lot of people were talking about prices, but they had no idea how these plans were coming in,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cSo we were actively looking for states where the information was available.\u201d\n\nNow that U.S. consumers have experienced one Obamacare rollout, Mr. Wu\u2019s goal for 2015 is to give them a sense of how the policies are changing.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, it was to give people an idea of where the prices were set,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cIn 2015, it gives people an idea of what\u2019s going to be changing, which insurers are going to be lowering their rates, as well as any changes that they should be aware of.\u201d\n\nIn terms of trends, Mr. Wu said insurance companies appear to be seeking equilibrium this year, lowering the prices on last year\u2019s more expensive policies while raising prices on the cheaper ones.\n\n\u201cThe filings kind of give you a breakdown of which insurers got the most policy enrollment. So what we\u2019re seeing is that people are obviously very price conscious,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cA lot of the insurers that were kind of on the lower range, they tended to get a larger share of the market. In some of those states, they\u2019re raising their rates a little bit. What we were also seeing is that a lot of the [companies] that were priced very highly in year one, they\u2019re lowering their rates.\u201d\n\nSome state insurance boards have released figures that sound daunting \u2014 in Alaska, for example, two insurers are raising rates by more than 30 percent \u2014 but Mr. Wu warned against reading too much into one insurer\u2019s drastic premium increases or decreases.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I caution about is that if no one\u2019s enrolled in the plan, then it doesn\u2019t really matter if prices are coming down,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a price that anyone was willing to pay in the first place.\u201d\n\nOnce enrollment begins Nov. 15, Mr. Wu says it\u2019s still worth checking out the ValuePenguin website because it includes some information not found on Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cEven after open enrollment, if you go to Healthcare.gov, some of the anonymous shopping functionality doesn\u2019t necessarily have all the plan benefits included, so you have to walk into the pdf,\u201d said Mr. Wu, citing mental-health coverage as an example.\n\n\u201cWe try to include that all on our site. We\u2019ll also give you multiple resources about how to think about this stuff and so even after open enrollment, we try to supplement our resources to help people compare,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make this a tool for people who are really looking at this stuff and help them make a better decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration isn't revealing how much prices will increase on Obamacare insurance policies until after the election, but Jonathan Wu can tell you right now.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration isn\u2019t revealing how much prices will increase on Obamacare insurance policies until after the election, but Jonathan Wu can tell you right now.", "title": "Obamacare 2015 prices revealed before election by ValuePenguin", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/valuepenguin-shows-obamacare-2015-prices-policies/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/27/wu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/27/wu.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration isn't revealing how much prices will increase on Obamacare insurance policies until after the election, but Jonathan Wu can tell you right now.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare 2015 prices revealed before election by ValuePenguin"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Jonathan Wu"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb14c\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration isn\u2019t revealing how much prices will increase on Obamacare insurance policies until after the election, but Jonathan Wu can tell you right now.\n\u201cIn 2014, it was to give people an idea of where the prices were set,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\nSo what we\u2019re seeing is that people are obviously very price conscious,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely free,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\nMr. Wu started the company with two friends, Ting Pen and Brian Quinn."}
