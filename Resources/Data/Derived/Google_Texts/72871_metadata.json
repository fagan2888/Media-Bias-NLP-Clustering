Rightbloggers love the guy, and Carson seems to have moved right into their sweet spot \u2014 which, if history is any guide, means he's nearly finished.\n\nFor perspective, let's hop in the wayback machine to 2011, to the start of silly season for Republicans, when another black conservative with no electoral experience jumped into the race and ran the table awhile.\n\nIn May of that year, as we recorded in this column, Mike Huckabee \u2014 currently still slugging away as the Candidate of the Rapture \u2014 ducked out of the GOP Presidential race. That created an opening for Herman Cain, a former regional Federal Reserve chief and pizza chain operator. Cain was a belligerent clown, snarling that he couldn\u2019t be bothered to learn about foreign countries, and touting (but not comprehensibly explaining) a \u201c999\u201d regressive tax plan. This excited conservatives, as did the fact that Cain was black, making liberals the Real Racists\u2122 and therefore allegedly frightened of Cain because he would steal the black and the liberal white black-lover vote. (\u201cI daresay that a black man, courageously standing publicly for American free enterprise and individual meritocracy, is even scarier to the left than a rising Mama Grizzly,\" said Pajamas Media, e.g.)\n\nWhen another GOP fave, Mitch Daniels, bailed from the race, Cain\u2019s stock rose among the brethren. \"Of all the announced and potential Republican candidates Gallup tracks that have name recognition below 50%, only Cain creates strong enthusiasm among those who recognize him,\" said RedState. Fans began calling him \u201cThe Herminator.\u201d\n\nThis enthusiasm persisted into the fall, despite Cain\u2019s weak performance in debates and anywhere else he had to explain why he should be president. \"OK, so [Cain's] not an expert at foreign policy and prefers catchy slogans to wonkish details,\" said veteran rightblogger Robert Stacy McCain. \"...despite all his flaws and failures he is, after all, winning. As I said the other day, victory tends to become its own argument.\"\n\nEventually, for Cain, victory was no longer its own argument because, well, he stopped winning. As a real election drew closer, the brethren got cold feet and clamored instead for candidates who were less entertainingly clownish but had real political experience \u2014 Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, and even Rick Perry \u2014 before giving up and going with upright Mitt Romney. When Romney lost to Obama, conservatives seethed and dreamed of new ultraconservatives they could nominate, or at least have a little pre-nomination fun with, in 2016.\n\nThe following year Ben Carson, heretofore best known as a neurosurgeon, became a rightblogger flavor-of-the-moment by insulting President Obama at a prayer breakfast (\u201cFLASHBACK: Ben Carson Criticized Obama TO HIS FACE\u201d \u2014 Media Research Center). In that speech, Carson suggested America get rid of progressive taxation and just have \u201ca tithe,\u201d and that we also get rid of Obamacare and just have health savings accounts, which would be passed down through hereditary succession \u201cso that when you're 85 years old and you got six diseases, you're not trying to spend up everything.\u201d\n\nIt was pretty clear even then that Carson was several shingles short of a sound roof. But his status as an accomplished African-American who hated Obama as much as any other wingnut got him promoted through the system, and he appeared at conventions and on Fox News shows, where he said embarrassing things \u2014 or things that would embarrass normal people \u2014 comparing Obamacare to slavery, gay marriage to bestiality, America under Obama to Nazi Germany, etc. This won him a featured speaker slot at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). In that address Carson mostly complained that media outlets had misquoted him \u2014 that is, quoted him accurately enough to make him look bad. If there\u2019s anything rightbloggers hate more than Obama, it\u2019s the media, so this went over big, and Carson, who had not announced for any office, came in third in the CPAC Presidential straw poll behind Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.\n\nIn this summer\u2019s GOP debates, Carson\u2019s somnambulant performances made even some rightbloggers nervous. Paul Mirengoff of Power Line, for example, called his second debate \u201cSHOCKINGLY WEAK,\u201d mainly because he took some positions that Republican insiders like Mirengoff can\u2019t abide (\u201cCarson opposed going to war in Afghanistan after 9/11\u2026 Carson has also been squishy on the subject of amnesty\u201d).\n\nBut Mirengoff apparently missed the message of the Trump boom \u2014 namely, that your positions don\u2019t matter so long as you stoke the resentments of the base. How else to explain an MD like Carson pandering to the anti-vaccine crowd, except as a way of showing that he wasn\u2019t buying the liberal establishment\u2019s shibboleths about science or anything else? Carson was even the first debater this year to invoke, as Newt Gingrich had done in 2012, the name of Saul Alinsky, which is a sort of a secret handshake among the doctrinaire (\u201cThe award so far in this Republican debate for dog-whistle rhetoric goes to Ben Carson,\u201d gushed John Fund at National Review). And though he may not support the wars Paul Mirengoff likes, Carson thinks that when we capture enemy soldiers, or even just guys off the street, we should be able to torture them without people getting all \u201cpolitically correct\u201d about it \u2014 and isn\u2019t that the important thing?\n\nNow we have Carson running neck in neck with Donald Trump. The surge seems to have gone to Carson\u2019s head, because last week he said a bunch of odd things.\n\nFor one, Carson went on the Marketplace radio show and basically acted as if he\u2019d never heard of the U.S. debt ceiling (Host: \u201cI'm really trying not to be circular here, Dr. Carson, but if you're not going to raise the debt limit and you're not going to give specifics on what you're gonna cut\u2026\u201d). Some of the brethren suggested that Carson perhaps lacked a certain attentiveness to reality or, in the measured words of Leon H. Wolff of RedState, \u201cpersonal diligence.\u201d While \u201cBen Carson is clearly smart enough to understand the distinction between the budget and the debt limit,\u201d said Wolff, he \u201chasn\u2019t seen fit to do even this minimal amount of research.\u201d Wolff then broke his uncomfortably long streak of common sense by praising Carly Fiorina.\n\nAt PJ Media, J. Christian Adams complained \u201cno constitutional conservative should support him for president\u201d because of another Carson position: the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. \u201cTo recap, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced 16 states to obtain federal approval for every election law change no matter how big or how small,\u201d fumed Adams \u2014 and all because of some \u201csegregation\u201d thing. To make sure readers got the point, Adams included a photo of Carson shaking hands with Al Sharpton.\n\nThe brethren came together for Carson, though, on guns.\n\nCarson was especially weird on the subject of the recent Umpqua massacre. He suggested that if he\u2019d been at the shooting, he\u2019d have rushed the gunman, unlike those pussies who got shot. He later said that someone pulled a gun on him at Popeye\u2019s once and he obligingly directed the gunman to the guy behind the counter, which seemed strange coming from someone who was just telling the world he would have rushed the gunman at a massacre.\n\nBut Carson could have said anything, including \u201ccabbages knickers it\u2019s not got a beak,\u201d and so long as it involved unlimited gun suffrage the brethren would support him. The gun is for them a sacred object, like a totem pole, a ceremonial sword, or a train going into a tunnel. So they attacked the people who dared to suggest Carson was nuts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty revealing \u2013 not only do these sanctimonious \u2026 things not want their countrymen to have the capability of armed defense, they ridicule the concept and the faith of anyone who would presume simply to fight back with whatever means are at hand,\u201d frothed Ammoland. Reason\u2019s Jacob Sullum slammed the New York Times for suggesting, in their criticism of Carson, \u201cthat people who defend the Second Amendment have an irrational, quasi-mystical faith in it that blinds them to the real-world consequences of allowing widespread gun ownership.\u201d Where would they get an idea like that?\n\nWhen Carson kicked it up a notch, telling Wolf Blitzer that if the Jews in Germany were packing heat they'd have had a great shot at beating Hitler and his army, National Review\u2019s Charles C.W. Cooke said the candidate was \u201chalf-right,\" but didn't say which half: After a full paragraph of wondering aloud \u201cwhy the mere mention of this [Nazi] era offends people as keenly as it does,\u201d Cooke appeared to admit that Carson was not-even-half-right (\u201cit seems unlikely to me that any organized resistance could have prevailed\u201d), then switched gears, saying the issue was \u201centirely irrelevant to the more important question here, which is not \u2018can armed people always overthrow a tyrannical government\u2019 but \u2018does the government get to deny them the chance to try?\u2019\u201d Cooke then worked himself into a fine lather about his own right to bear arms, ending with \u201cI will assert my unalienable right to try against any man at any time in any place, and those who hope to strip me of that chance can man up, head to my front door, and come and damn well take it\" before leading the rest of Delta House out of the student court hearing, humming the Battle Hymn of the Republic.\n\nIt quickly became time to haul out the big guns. When a writer at GQ magazine said \u201cFuck you, Ben Carson,\u201d Weasel Zippers snarled, \u201cRacist GQ Writes Piece, \u2018F**ck Ben Carson.'\". If you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s racist about \u201cFuck you,\u201d you\u2019re missing the point \u2014 rightbloggers believe that liberals are always calling them racist for no reason, so now that they\u2019ve got a black guy they can do the same thing.\n\nWhen a black professor called Carson a \u201ccoon\u201d on Twitter \u2014 or just suggested NASCAR would bestow such a title on him, depending on how you interpret her tweet \u2014 it triggered a new round of how come they can say [racial slur] and we can\u2019t. (\u201cMost media is ignoring the racist taunt\u201d \u2014 Legal Insurrection; \u201cIvy League Prof Calls Ben Carson A \u2018Coon\u2019\u201d \u2014 Daily Caller, etc.)\n\nAt Breitbart.com, Jerome Hudson threw a full-body fit called \u201cTHE LIBERAL MEDIA LYNCHING OF DR. BEN CARSON,\u201d in the course of which he portrayed Carson as \u201cjust the latest \u2018uppity negro\u2019 (Justice Clarence Thomas, Herman Cain) to defy the expectations of his white liberal mainstream media masters,\u201d and cried, \u201c[Carson] has chosen not to be a mindless minstrel puppet, tap dancing, performing, like a good boy, for his white liberal media gatekeepers,\u201d etc. (Enraged as he was, he managed to work in the traditional rightblogger thing about a \u201cplantation\u201d where liberals allegedly keep black people.)\n\nCarson got in on this, telling a radio audience that racism was \u201cmostly with the progressive movement,\u201d whom he claimed considered him \u201can Uncle Tom\u201d for his beliefs. Finally Carson employed, as he had back when he was the belle of CPAC, that rightblogger equivalent of running out of bullets and throwing the gun, blaming the media. \u201cI will continue to expose them every time they do something,\u201d he vowed at a press conference, and creepily demanded reporters undergo a \u201ctransformation\u201d to become \u201callies of the people.\u201d\n\nThis may be good for a boost among the base in coming weeks, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Carson can do for an encore, besides admit he has a problem, seek help, do a quick rehab, and reenter the race reading non-crazy comments off index cards. But there's not enough time for that so, with many months of pre-election fun to go, it may be time to focus on some other lunatic who has no business running for president. Say, what\u2019s Jim Webb up to these days?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "If polls may be believed,\u00a0Ben Carson, M.D.\u00a0shares the support of nearly half of registered Republicans with Donald Trump.
