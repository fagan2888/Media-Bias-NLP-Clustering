Italy's Francesca Tibaldi out front in women's race

Clay Emge of Texas moved into the lead Sunday after the first two legs of the Ironman Boulder.

Emge was the first to finish the bike portion of the race, the second leg, coming across in 5:32 after recording a 4:30.17 bike split.

In the swim competition that kicked off the triathlon Sunday morning, Rafael Goncalves (Brazil) was first out of the water in 49:23. Goncalves was passed by Emge on the bike, but Colin Laughery (Boulder) was hot on Emge's heals coming down the stretch of the 112-mile ride.

Kathryn Taylor (Hawaii) was the first female racer out of the water, completing the first stage in 57:09, while Wendy Mader (Fort Collins) trailed her by 11 minutes. Despite being the 10th female racer to exit the first transition area, Francesca Tibaldi (Italy) stormed into first place on the bike portion and held a 6-minute, 51-second lead over Diana Hassel (Fort Collins) coming out of the second transition area.

A total of 50 qualifying berths to the Ironman World Championships in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, on Oct. 10 are up for grabs at Ironman Boulder.

Beginning at 6:30 a.m. on Sunday, the 140.6-mile triathlon kicked off at Boulder Reservoir, sending nearly 3,000 competitors on a quest for distance-racing glory.

The 2015 Ironman Boulder is the second of its kind. Sunday's race, said to be one of the largest in the world, has an all-amateur field and is estimated to contribute nearly $5 million to the city's economy.

This year's race includes a 2.4-mile swim at the Boulder Reservoir, a 112-mile bike course that is entirely within Boulder County and a 26.2-mile run.

The first wave of athletes hit the water at 6:30 a.m. The bike ride and run were to follow.
