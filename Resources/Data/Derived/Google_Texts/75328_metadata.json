The property owners rented the space at at 117 W. Windhorst Road to pastor Francisco Rios and his church, Casa de Amor.\n\nThe lawsuit says the property owners failed to \u201cprovide a safe environment,\u201d failed to \u201cmaintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition,\u201d failed to warn the plaintiffs and allowed \u201cRios and Casa de Amor (Church) to remain on its premises.\u201d\n\nThey screened their tenant poorly and didn\u2019t follow up properly when the molestation allegations arose, Pendas said.\n\nNeither organization named in the lawsuit could be reached for comment.\n\nRios is not named in the lawsuit but faces Hillsborough County criminal charges in the case. He could not be reached for comment; a woman who answered the phone at the church Friday said he remains the pastor of the church.\n\nRios was arrested in April on charges that he molested three females, who at the time were 12, 17 and 43. The three contacted the sheriff\u2019s office the previous August after talking to each other and learning each had been touched by Rios at the church, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Since then, the sheriff\u2019s office is investigating another complaint from a minor girl that she was molested by Rios; Pendas said another potential victim has emerged, as well.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said the 17-year-old told investigators she was touched inappropriately on about 15 occasions beginning in 2011. Rios had told her he was touching her because \u201che loved her as a pastor and she was not to tell anyone because he could get in trouble,\u201d according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThe 12-year-old girl told the sheriff\u2019s office she was molested by Rios about twice a week over a year\u2019s time beginning in 2013.\n\nThe 43-year-old woman told investigators Rios had touched her inappropriately in April 2013 after he \u201cconvinced her it was a way to cure (her from) a medical condition,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nCristal Bermudez Nu\u00f1ez, a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman, said charges related to the 43-year-old woman\u2019s accusations have been dropped but didn\u2019t know the specifics of why. She said Rios still faces lewd and lascivious charges related to the accusations of the three girls.\n\nRios has been released from a Hillsborough County jail after posting bail, according to sheriff\u2019s office records.\n\nPendas said his law office will pursue the civil case against the property owners regardless of the status of the criminal charges against Rios.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any impact on civil cases,\u201d Pendas said. \u201cThey are different burden of proofs.\u201d\n\njpatino@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7659\n\nTwitter: @jpatinoTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:38:03 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 An attorney for a woman and four minors who have accused a Brandon pastor of molestation has filed civil lawsuits against the property owners who rented the worship space to the pastor", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 An attorney for a woman and four minors who have accused a Brandon pastor of molestation has filed civil lawsuits against the property owners who rented the worship space to the pastor", "title": "Lawsuit filed in sex crime case involving Brandon pastor", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/lawsuit-filed-in-sex-crime-case-involving-brandon-pastor-20140927/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-09-27T20:38:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lawsuit filed in sex crime case involving Brandon pastor"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-27T20:38:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T20:38:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfa1\"", "article_summary": "The property owners rented the space at at 117 W.
