(Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n4468449\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s request to Congress for the use of force against the Islamic State singles out several ethnic groups threatened by ISIS, but oddly does not mention Jews \u2014 despite overt references to \u201cZionists\u201d and \u201cJews\u201d in ISIS literature and among ISIS leadership.\n\nThough the document goes to great pains to single out the threat posed by ISIS to Iraqi Christians, Yezidis and Turkmens, it then leaves Jews conspicuously absent.\n\nFreshman Rep. Lee Zeldin, the only Jewish Republican member of Congress, said the omission leapt off the page. \u201cI see an understanding, a recognition in the resolution with regards to ISIS attacks on Muslims, on Christians and others, and I didn\u2019t see a reference to Jews,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u201cI think that when the White House is drafting a resolution for the authorization of force, that every single word, every phrase in there is done deliberately \u2014 it has to be.\u201d\n\nMonday, the president referred to a recent terror attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris as a \u201crandom\u201d shooting of \u201ca bunch of folks in a deli.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you\u2019ve got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris,\u201d he told Vox.\n\nGiven the chance to clarify Obama\u2019s remarks, White House press secretary Josh Earnest doubled down. \u201cThey were random people that happened to randomly be in the deli and were shot.\u201d\n\nOnly later did Earnest admit \u2014 on Twitter \u2014 that the attack was anti-semitic in nature: \u201cOur view has not changed. Terror attack at Paris Kosher market was motivated by anti-Semitism. POTUS didn\u2019t intend to suggest otherwise.\u201d (RELATED: Obama Admin Scrambles To Correct Obama Kosher Deli Gaffe)\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest non-partisan Orthodox Jewish organization said in a statement Thursday the Paris attack was the culminations of months of rising anti-Semitism inspired by radical Islam.\n\n\u201cThe AUMF will not only define what the President is authorized to do in combating ISIS, but why,\u201d Nathan Diament, the group\u2019s executive director, said in the statement. \u201cAnd once the attacks of Islamic terrorists on innocents of other faiths are in the rationale, we would expect Congress to ensure that the final legislation include the terrorists\u2019 targeting of Jews in that rationale.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
