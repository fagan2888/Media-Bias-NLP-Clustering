Kantor\u2019s net worth is about $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nIn a joint article published June 4 in The Times of London, Blair and Kantor said ECTR wants to reach thousands of students across Europe over the next two years, working for racial and religious tolerance.\n\nThey said: \u201cIt is our firm belief that it is not religion or faith that causes or foments conflict. It is the abuse of religion, which then becomes a mask behind which those bent on death and destruction all too often hide.\u201d\n\nKantor is also president of the European Jewish Congress.\n\nLM/MG END GRUNDY", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Institutions, Politics, anti-Semitism, European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, Holocaust denial, Interfaith, Judaism, Moshe Kantor, Tony Blair", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS)  As chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, Blair hopes in particular to spread its message to students across the continent during the next two years.", "title": "Tony Blair\u2019s new job: fighting religious and political extremism in\u00a0Europe", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/tony-blairs-new-job-fighting-religious-political-extremism-europe/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thumbRNS-BLAIR-TOLERANCE060415.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/tony-blairs-new-job-fighting-religious-political-extremism-europe/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/tony-blairs-new-job-fighting-religious-political-extremism-europe/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS)  As chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, Blair hopes in particular to spread its message to students across the continent during the next two years."}, "article_summary": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has a new job campaigning against religious and political extremism in Europe.\nBlair, who was prime minister from 1997-2007, replaces a former Polish president as chairman of a board that also includes Jose Maria Aznar, the former Spanish prime minister.\nThe council was founded in 2007 by Russian-born Jewish businessman Moshe Kantor, now its president.\nIt is the abuse of religion, which then becomes a mask behind which those bent on death and destruction all too often hide.\u201dKantor is also president of the European Jewish Congress.\nThey said: \u201cIt is our firm belief that it is not religion or faith that causes or foments conflict."}
