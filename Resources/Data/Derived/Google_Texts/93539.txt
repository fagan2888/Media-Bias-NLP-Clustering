The seven things Bob Goodlatte needs to back an online sales tax bill - Business Roundtable prepares CEO economic survey

With an assist from Rachael Bade

THE SEVEN THINGS BOB GOODLATTE NEEDS TO BACK AN ONLINE SALES TAX BILL. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is ready to release a series of principles today outlining concerns and priorities for a bill that would allow online retailers to collect sales tax. The principles — described during three briefings Tuesday — are expected to be broad while detailing some of the ways the Virginia Republican would like to simplify the bill that passed the Senate in May, the sources said. They also are expected to offer more details on how businesses could collect and remit sales taxes for online purchases. Goodlatte has expressed concerns that the Senate bill is still too burdensome for small businesses. Briefings for Judiciary Committee staffers and trade groups focused on the issue were scheduled for Tuesday to give Goodlatte’s team a chance to detail seven points. Separate briefings were held for supporters and opponents of the issue. My story: http://politi.co/18awLNz

Story Continued Below

Here’s what we know about the seven principles:

-- Tax relief: No new precedents for taxing Internet sales. Do not want to require any more tax burden than is already due.

-- Tech neutrality — Want a level playing field for all businesses so online, brick-and-mortar and brick-and-click businesses are all equal.

-- No regulation without representation — Taxpayers should be able to protest bad enforcement.

-- Simplicity — The system should be simple enough to not need a small business exemption

-- Allow tax competition– States should be able to compete to keep their rates low

-- Sovereignty — State activity remains sovereign and it must be the states imposing the taxes, not the federal government.

-- Privacy — There is a need to protect consumers’ data.

The view from the influence world:

From the Marketplace Fairness Coalition, “It’s clear that Chairman Goodlatte is committed, as are many in Congress, to finally addressing this critical issue and leveling the playing field for all American businesses. The release of these principles will be a great first step in the House of Representatives towards closing the online loophole and restoring basic free market competition.”

From NetChoice, "Chairman Goodlatte’s principles are a litmus test for any plan that would impose new tax burdens on catalog and online businesses; and the Marketplace Fairness Act clearly fails that test. MFA would let 46 states demand taxes and audits of every business in America, while forcing businesses to follow different rules, definitions, and filing requirements for every state where they have even a single customer.”

From the TruST Coalition, “The principles also make it crystal clear that the Senate-backed Marketplace Fairness Act is not a viable solution. We're hopeful that future iterations of this proposal delve more deeply into simplification measures for businesses increasingly concerned about complying with dozens of different state taxing and auditing jurisdictions.”

Conservatives tap Reagan alum to whip support. Arthur Laffer — a former member of President Ronald Reagan’s Economic Policy Advisory Board — will hold a briefing for staffers and members today at 2 p.m. in the Capitol. Rep. Steve Womack, who introduced the House version of the Marketplace Fairness Act, and Colin Hanna, of Let Freedom Ring, will also make remarks. Laffer will discuss the study he authored earlier this summer that found potential for sustainable economic growth if Congress gives states the ability to collect the sales taxes from out-of-state online sellers.

COMING LATER THIS MORNING, THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE Q3 CEO ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SURVEY. From the trade association, “With all key indicators pointing to sluggish U.S. economic growth, today, at a 9:00 am briefing, Business Roundtable CEOs will share their expectations for sales, capital spending and hiring for the next six months. Expect to hear how business leaders are responding to continued fiscal uncertainty and political gridlock in Washington.”

DRIVING THE DAY. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget will host a discussion with Jared Bernstein, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Maya MacGuineas, Jim Kessler and Derrick Morgan on the upcoming budget negotiations. Event begins at 8:30 a.m. in SVC 208/209.

NOMINATED. President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Tamara Ashford as a judge to the U.S. Tax Court yesterday. “Tamara has demonstrated unwavering integrity and a firm commitment to public service throughout her career,” said Obama in a statement. Ashford is a deputy assistant attorney general for the appellate and review in the Department of Justice’s tax division and previous worked for Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP and the Internal Revenue Service.

DROP IN IRS AGENTS MEANS FEWER TAX CHEATS CAUGHT. There isn’t a lot of risk today of being a tax cheat, an IRS watchdog has found. A report published by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration finds enforcement revenue collected by IRS agents declined by nine percent in FY2012, from $55.2 billion to $50.2 billion. TIGTA notes that the drop “correlates to the 14 percent reduction in the number of enforcement personnel.” Since FY2010, the tax-collecting agency has cut 8,000 full time positions, 5,000 specifically from enforcement. TIGTA said those staffing levels are part of the problem. Reuter’s Patrick Temple-West has more: http://reut.rs/185HryJ

QUICK POLL LOOK. The International Franchise Association found in a poll released late yesterday that 90 percent of franchisors want Congress to pass comprehensive reform that simplifies the tax code and lowers both individual and corporate tax rates. http://bit.ly/1f3t29s

WHAT PROS ARE READING: Our Kelsey Snell has the inside look at Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)’s new tax proposal. “His plan would eliminate nearly every existing tax break in order to cut individual tax rates to as little as 15 percent and more than double the credits available for parents of minor children,” she writes. http://politico.pro/16d7Hmb

ICYMI: A PREVIEW OF THE FISCAL FIGHT STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS:

-- From Seung Min Kim, “A slew of House Democrats — including all five members of its leadership — warn of the dangers of defaulting on the nation’s debt and urge Obama to stand firm on his pledge to not negotiate on raising the debt limit.” http://politi.co/1gu6nkw

-- From Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan, “House Republican leadership will attempt to pass a government-funding bill with language that defunds Obamacare, according to senior aides…. The new strategy doesn’t come without risks. First, Senate Democrats will move to strip the Obamacare language — and potentially change other items in the bill like the expiration date for funding, and the overall price tag.” http://politi.co/18uZ5If

-- Also from Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan, “The House Republican leadership’s decision to try to defund Obamacare this week in their government funding bill, and their promise to wage a a no-holds-barred fight to delay the health care law as part of the debt ceiling fight, is a double-barreled strategy that could set Boehner (R-Ohio), Cantor (R-Va.), Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the House Republican Conference up for two big defeats.” http://politi.co/14gDJkx
