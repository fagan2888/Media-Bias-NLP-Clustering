(AP) - With a little more than a month left in the session, Nebraska lawmakers still must take final action on some of the year\u2019s largest and most contentious issues.\n\nThe list includes the state budget, property taxes, medical marijuana and a death-penalty repeal measure that has gained more support than usual. Lawmakers also have to decide whether to grant driver\u2019s licenses to youths in the federal deferred-action program, and whether all motorists should pay a higher fuel tax.\n\nSpeaker of the Legislature Galen Hadley said he\u2019s trying to allow debate on every priority bill that has advanced out of committee. With time running out, Hadley, of Kearney, said lawmakers are seeking agreements on thorny issues, such as prison sentencing reform.\n\nHadley announced last week the Legislature will test a new scheduling system designed to limit the number of late nights near the session\u2019s end. Instead of 90-minute lunch breaks and adjourning around 5 p.m., lawmakers will get a 20-minute break over the noon hour, with food served at the Capitol, and stay until 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cI just think people run out of gas when we go late, and I\u2019m always suspicious of the quality of legislation passed at 10 or 11 at night,\u201d he said.\n\nHere are some major items awaiting action:\n\nBUDGET, PROPERTY TAXES\n\nLawmakers will begin debate this week on a new budget package, but a drop in projected state revenue could require cuts.\n\nThe $8.7 billion, two-year budget proposal includes extra money for property tax relief and education, with lower-than-average spending growth. Senators are now waiting for a new revenue forecast Thursday, and early signs suggest the state could collect millions less than expected.\n\nA dramatically lower projection would reduce the $48 million that lawmakers tentatively have available for legislation this year.\n\nSen. Health Mello of Omaha, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said other Midwestern states appear to be collecting less because of a slowdown in the farm economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a likelihood that we\u2019re going to have to make some serious changes to provide a balanced budget to the Legislature,\u201d Mello said. \u201cWhen you have smaller revenue growth, it requires everyone to have to prioritize.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MARIJUANA\n\nSenators will debate whether to legalize medical marijuana for treatment of seizures, nausea and other ailments caused by chronic diseases.\n\nSupporters have flocked to the Capitol and are preparing a statewide ballot measure if lawmakers fail to act. But the proposal faces opposition from law enforcement, including Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson.\n\nA new version advanced by the Judiciary Committee would impose tight controls on where cannabis could be produced and who could receive it, and would not allow patients to ingest the drug by smoking it.\n\nDEATH PENALTY\n\nA bill to abolish the death penalty won first-round approval earlier this month, but its path through the Legislature isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nLawmakers voted 30-13 to advance the bill, showing just enough support to override Gov. Pete Ricketts\u2019 promised veto.\n\nYet even with a bipartisan majority, supporters of the bill may have to overcome filibusters by conservative lawmakers before the required the second- and third-round votes. Breaking a filibuster requires at least 33 senators, and votes on such procedural issues could prevent it from advancing.\n\nSen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha, who has fought to eliminate the death penalty for more than four decades, warned after the initial vote that nothing is final.\n\nDRIVER\u2019S LICENSES FOR DEFERRED-ACTION YOUTHS\n\nLawmakers haven\u2019t begun first-round debate on a bill that would allow driver\u2019s licenses for youths who brought to the United States illegally as young children, but allowed to stay under President Barack Obama\u2019s federal deferred-action program. Nebraska is the only state that still denies licenses to such youths.\n\nThe bill by Sen. Jeremy Nordquist of Omaha has won support from a majority of lawmakers, business and agriculture groups, and man Republicans, including Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert. But it\u2019s strongly opposed by some conservative senators.\n\n\u201cThese are hardworking Nebraskans, and I say \u2018Nebraskans\u2019 because they\u2019ve been here their whole lives,\u201d Nordquist said. \u201cThey are a net positive for the state, and this will help strengthen our communities.\u201d\n\nFUEL TAX\n\nA proposed increase in Nebraska\u2019s fuel tax won initial approval from lawmakers, 26-10, but it faces two more rounds of debate before going to Ricketts, who has promised a veto. The measure would phase in a 6-cent increase over four years, raising the total tax to 31.6 cents per gallon.\n\nSen. Jim Smith of Papillion said he introduced the bill to help pay for maintenance for the state\u2019s aging bridges and roads. Opponents say the tax increase will disproportionately affect the poor because many spend a larger proportion of their incomes on gas.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE, LGBT PROTECTIONS\n\nAlso pending are proposed new protections for gay and lesbian employees, and an effort to freeze the state\u2019s $8 an hour minimum wage for high school students.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a little more than a month left in the session, Nebraska lawmakers still must take final action on some of the year's largest and most contentious issues.", "Author": "GRANT SCHULTE", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/big-issues-loom-for-nebraska-lawmakers-as-session-/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With a little more than a month left in the session, Nebraska lawmakers still must take final action on some of the year\u2019s largest and most contentious issues.", "title": "Big issues loom for Nebraska lawmakers as session nears end"}, "twitter": {"title": "Big issues loom for Nebraska lawmakers as session nears end", "description": "With a little more than a month left in the session, Nebraska lawmakers still must take final action on some of the year's largest and most contentious issues.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "The list includes the state budget, property taxes, medical marijuana and a death-penalty repeal measure that has gained more support than usual.\nWith time running out, Hadley, of Kearney, said lawmakers are seeking agreements on thorny issues, such as prison sentencing reform.\n(AP) - With a little more than a month left in the session, Nebraska lawmakers still must take final action on some of the year\u2019s largest and most contentious issues.\nSpeaker of the Legislature Galen Hadley said he\u2019s trying to allow debate on every priority bill that has advanced out of committee.\nA dramatically lower projection would reduce the $48 million that lawmakers tentatively have available for legislation this year."}
