Scott Applewhite\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) emerges from the Senate Chamber on Wednesday, September 25, 2013, after his overnight crusade against the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe government shutdown, together with the propaganda battle that led up to it, has revealed a number of ugly truths about the current political climate. One that is particularly shocking\u2014no matter how many times I feel compelled to write about it\u2014is the lengths that reporters will go to create a sense of false equivalence between the right and the wrong, the guilty and the innocent, and the intelligent and the idiotic. I call it \u201cOn the One Handism.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s example is Politico\u2019s coverage of Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-TX) 21-hour speech on the Senate floor leading up to the vote on the budget bill. Politico\u2019s Dylan Byers rounded up right-wing complaints about the coverage and passed them along to his readers\u2014remarkably sympathetically, as though they made perfect sense\u2014even though judging by the evidence he presented, no such case could be made.\n\nByers\u2019 point of comparison was Texas Democratic State Sen. Wendy Davis\u2019 June 2012 filibuster of that state\u2019s proposed draconian abortion restrictions. Byers began his article by correctly pointing out that Cruz\u2019s talk was \u201cnot technically a filibuster.\u201d Nevertheless, he insisted that \u201csymbolically, it\u2019s more or less the same thing.\u201d The words \u201csymbolically\u201d and \u201cmore or less\u201d do an awful lot of heavy lifting. According to Byers\u2019 remarkably elastic criteria, one may:\n\n\u2026 forgive conservatives for being upset with the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of the Cruz affair. When a Democrat like Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis filibusters against abortion restrictions, she is elevated to hero status, her tennis shoes become totems. When Cruz grandstands against Obamacare, he is a laughingstock in the eyes of many journalists on Twitter, an \u201cembarrassment\u201d in the eyes of The New York Times editorial board.\n\nJust a few lines later, however, he allows that \u201cthe difference between filibustering and grandstanding plays a part.\u201d But he argues that:\n\n\u2026 part of the disparity in coverage is due to the fact that the mainstream media, generally speaking, don\u2019t admire Cruz the way they admired Davis\u2014or rather, they admire him only insofar as he makes for tragicomic theater, whereas they admired her on the merits.\n\nFinally Byers cannot bring himself to take a position on whether the harsh coverage of Cruz is \u201caccurate or inaccurate.\u201d He argues that it isn\u2019t the point; instead the point is that:\n\n\u2026 the coverage of Cruz has been critical, and in some cases unforgiving, from the outset. At least initially, Davis wasn\u2019t viewed through a critical lens at all. Her willingness to stand for 11 hours was evidence of the American dream in action. Period.\n\nByers\u2019 piece is an almost too perfect an example of the kind of coverage that led Michael Tomasky to write in The New York Review of Books, \u201cIf Politico had existed in Berlin in 1933, it might have been capable of producing sentences like \u2018Even the new chancellor\u2019s harshest critics agree that his recent moves, whatever their legality, have been politically masterful.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat were the actual differences, accounting for accuracy?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get past the actual filibuster versus fake filibuster problem. State Sen. Davis\u2019 filibuster was taken under extreme and extraordinary circumstances. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) had called a special session of the legislature to pass a remarkably restrictive abortion law. State Sen. Davis\u2019 filibuster succeeded and forced Gov. Perry to call two more special sessions: one to pass the law and one to deal with legislative business that was left undone during the abortion arguments. Sen. Cruz\u2019s talk-a-thon did nothing but eat up time in the Senate. When he was done, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) offered him another hour, as there was nothing going on anyway.\n\nSecond, there was the \u201cgreen eggs and ham\u201d difference. While State Sen. Davis filibustered a bill restricting a woman\u2019s right to choose, she spoke exclusively about\u2014you guessed it\u2014a woman\u2019s right to choose. Her speech brought the issue of the Texas law and similarly restrictive state reproductive laws, which, according to the Guttmacher Institute, have become an epidemic across much of America, to the forefront of political discourse. Abortion-rights advocates seized on the moment to force people to pay attention, while anti-choice activists did their best to ignore and marginalize her and her arguments. Before State Sen. Davis\u2019 filibuster, these restrictions hadn\u2019t received nearly as much attention.\n\nWith Sen. Cruz\u2019s marathon talk, the opposite was true. The news that Tea Party extremists don\u2019t like Obamacare is not exactly news, especially given the House of Representatives\u2019 42 attempts to repeal.. Sen. Cruz did not address the law he sought to oppose\u2014a law that, unlike the one State Sen. Davis had filibustered, had already passed. Because he did not even have his own Senate colleagues on his side\u2014to say nothing of the likes of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page\u2014his talk looked more like a circus act than an attempt to educate or galvanize a debate. As Salon\u2019s Alex Pareene rightly observed, \u201cEveryone knows this fun talk was entirely a waste of time. Everyone besides the people it\u2019s actually aimed at: Right-wing Obamacare-hating Fox viewers who don\u2019t understand how the Senate works.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that when Sen. Cruz wasn\u2019t quoting noted leftist Dr. Seuss, he was making stuff up. As The Washington Post\u2019s Ezra Klein pointed out, while Sen. Cruz went on and on about the sanctity of public opinion, he failed to notice that poll after poll demonstrated opposition to the position for which he was arguing:\n\nA recent CNBC poll asked whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act should be defunded. By 44 percent to 38 percent, Americans said no. Then the pollsters asked specifically about Cruz\u2019s plan: forcing a shutdown to defund Obamacare. The public rejected that idea 59 percent to 19 percent. But Cruz isn\u2019t listening.\n\nA poll by the Pew Research Center discovered that of Americans questioned, fully 69 percent\u2014consisting of 42 percent who approve of the law and 27 percent who do not\u2014want Congress to \u201cmake the law work as well as possible.\u201d Only 23 percent shared the view of Sen. Cruz and company that Congress ought to \u201cmake the law fail.\u201d\n\nThe odd ability to use journalistic weasel words to attempt to equate unrelated and different phenomena\u2014remember \u201csymbolically\u201d and \u201cmore or less\u201d\u2014has become a habit at the trend-setting Politico. As I noted in The Nation during the 2012 presidential campaign, Politico\u2019s executive editor Jim VandeHei and chief White House correspondent Mike Allen complained about two negative stories on the Romneys and the lack of similar stories about the Obamas. As I wrote back then, they made their argument by pretending that the press was treating the Obamas with kid gloves while doubling down on its harsh treatment of the Romneys with examples that could hardly have appeared more ridiculous if taken from a Politico parody issue\n\nTo top it all off, as Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel noted, \u201cCruz\u2019s filibuster was actually covered more than Davis\u2019 in real time. Davis\u2019 filibuster only became a story as social media, mostly Twitter, started discussing it.\u201d In The Verge, Carl Franzen reported that:\n\n\u2026 viewers of the major national cable and broadcast networks would be forgiven for not knowing who she is or what she did on Tuesday night. After all, during the filibuster\u2019s momentous conclusion, CNN aired a repeated segment of Piers Morgan and Anderson Cooper discussing the calories in a blueberry muffin.\n\nSen. Cruz\u2019s filibuster was covered heavily in real time by the Capitol Hill press corps. Byers\u2019 piece, as it happens, was actually posted while Sen. Cruz was still speaking.\n\nSame difference, I suppose, \u201cmore or less.\u201d\n\nEric Alterman is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and a CUNY distinguished professor of English and journalism at Brooklyn College.
