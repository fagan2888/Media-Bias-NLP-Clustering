One big reason for this is that as authorities poured billions of dollars into supply reduction efforts in the 1980s and '90s, many illicit drugs became cheaper and easier to get and overall rates of drug dependency stayed the same.\n\n[GOP contenders are talking about drug abuse, but racial and partisan rifts persist]\n\nBut federal drug control priorities, as reflected in the national drug budget, have been slow to reflect this shift. Well into Obama's first term, supply reduction efforts continued to account for over 60 percent of federal anti-drug spending.\n\nWith the administration's 2017 budget request, however, that would change. The White House has requested $15.8 billion for demand reduction efforts, a sharp jump from the $12.3 billion spent last year. That includes $1.1 billion in new spending to address a rise in heroin and opiate dependence.\n\nBy contrast, supply reduction spending would be essentially flat, at $15.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s 2017 Budget calls for our country\u2019s largest investment in treating and preventing substance use disorders in history,\u201d Michael Botticelli, director of the White House's National Drug Control Policy Office, said in a statement. \u201cBy funding public health and public safety efforts at near-identical levels, this budget demonstrates the Obama Administration\u2019s ongoing commitment to a balanced approach to drug policy.\"\n\nSome drug policy reformers were pleased with the shift, but frustrated to see so much money still spent on supply reduction efforts. \"This is a good start, but they\u2019re still wasting money on failed supply-side programs at a time when there\u2019s a consensus drugs should be treated as a health issue,\" said Bill Piper, director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance. \"It is hard to get excited about a balanced approach that is one half good, one half ineffective.\"\n\nBut experts cautioned against reading too much into the federal numbers. Keith Humphreys, a drug policy researcher at Stanford University, noted that there are ways federal policy can affect drug control efforts that aren't reflected in these budget numbers. The Affordable Care Act, for instance, required many health insurance policies to provide coverage for drug use disorders.\n\n\"This doesn't show up in the equation because only public dollars are counted in the famous [supply/demand] ratio statistic,\" Humphreys said. \"All that said, it is very good that the administration is spending more on treatment because we have an incredibly deadly epidemic underway and treatment shortages are common throughout the U.S.\"\n\nMore from Wonkblog:\n\nHardly anyone uses heroin.
