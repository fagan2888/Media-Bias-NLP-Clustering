The union is repeating a series of discredited claims and misleading allegations, including exaggerating the findings from a 2012 routine survey by the California Department of Managed Health Care that have all been well addressed, and did not involve the quality of mental health care that Kaiser Permanente medical teams provide.\"\n\nHe insists Kaiser provides top notch behavioral and mental health care and that officials \"are proud that KP Northern California's rating for behavioral health and mental health care is one of the highest in the state according to the 2014 California Office of the Patient Advocate report card.\"\n\nAlso, in 2013 the National Business Coalition on Health named Kaiser Northern California the top HMO health plan in the U.S. for behavioral health management, Nelson said.\n\nCall Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at 707-553-6824", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Union of Healthcare Workers says some of Kaiser Permanente's practices, including at the Vallejo facility, mimic those of the beleaguered Veterans Administration and calls on the federal government to investigate.", "title": "Union officials compare Kaiser Permanente's mental health system to embattled VA", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/ZZ/20140613/NEWS/140617376", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.timesheraldonline.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/timesheraldonline.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Union officials compare Kaiser Permanente's mental health system to embattled VA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timesheraldonline.com", "description": "The National Union of Healthcare Workers says some of Kaiser Permanente's practices, including at the Vallejo facility, mimic those of the beleaguered Veterans Administration and calls on the federal government to investigate.", "title": "Union officials compare Kaiser Permanente's mental health system to embattled VA", "url": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/ZZ/20140613/NEWS/140617376", "image": {"src": "http://local.timesheraldonline.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/timesheraldonline.png?052016"}, "site": "@vjotimesherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id508801494", "iphone": "id419623006", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.vallejotimesherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "Breaking News, Breaking news, Vallejo Breaking news, CA Breaking news, US Breaking news, world Breaking news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Breaking News, Breaking news, Vallejo Breaking news, CA Breaking news, US Breaking news, world Breaking news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3390\"", "article_summary": "These delays persist despite a $4 million fine levied by California's Department of Managed Health Care in 2013, and affect \"thousands of mental health patients,\" union officials said.\nscandal and the mental health care crisis at Kaiser is that lawsuits have demonstrated links between patient deaths and delays in care.\"\nPapazian said he hopes Kaiser will find a way to bring mental health care practices up to par with its other disciplines.\n\"Under the Affordable Care Act, Kaiser has added nearly a quarter million new members to its rolls, exacerbating its failures to provide timely and appropriate mental health care,\" union officials said.\nClement Papazian, a Kaiser clinician leader who represents mental health workers in Northern California, says the problem is system-wide with waits of four to six weeks for mental health visits."}
