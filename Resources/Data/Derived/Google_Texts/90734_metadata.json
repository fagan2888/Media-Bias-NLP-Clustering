Jason Ervin and 20 colleagues, and backed by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, treatment options would be expanded in needy, often crime-plagued neighborhoods by expanding community outreach and hiring more staff at the city's six mental health clinics.\n\n\"The six mental health clinics have the capacity to serve many more clients,\" sponsors said in a written summary.\n\nThe plan would be funded by requiring the city's Department of Public Health to join three managed-care networks that reimburse mental health care, using the Medicaid program.\n\nBut according to Morita, the plan wouldn't pay its own costs, much less get the city new money.\n\nEach psychiatric visit to a city clinic costs about $450, but Medicaid reimburses only $75, she said. And the federal system comes with so much red tape that the city's ability to get a better price from vendors would be harmed, leaving the city worse off than it is now.\n\nAFSCME spokesman Anders Lindall termed that response \"a red herring,\" since many of the medical personnel who would be used already are on the city payroll. But the group's own statement said the intent is to \"treat more people.\"\n\nEmanuel set off huge protests earlier in his tenure when he closed six other mental health clinics in a cost-cutting move. That storm never has quieted, and in fact has picked up recently with suggestions that some of those involved in police shootings were unable to get needed mental health treatment.\n\nLindall denied that AFSCME's intent in today's move is to reopen the clinics.\n\nErvin Mh Ordinance", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Sections": "Politics", "byline": "Greg Hinz", "timeCrawled": "20160527_06:38:20", "categoryName": "Blogs - On Politics", "title": "New fight over Chicago mental health clinics", "taxo_Industries": "Public Health", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New fight over Chicago mental health clinics"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Aldermen and AFSCME say more violence-affected youth could be served via Medicaid managed care, but City Hall says it won't work.", "title": "New fight over city mental health clinics", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160203/BLOGS02/160209930/new-fight-over-city-mental-health-clinics", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Aldermen and AFSCME say more violence-affected youth could be served via Medicaid managed care, but City Hall says it won't work.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//BLOGS02/160209930", "published_at": "2016-2-3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "taxo_Writers": "Greg Hinz on Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "\"The six mental health clinics have the capacity to serve many more clients,\" sponsors said in a written summary.\nEmanuel set off huge protests earlier in his tenure when he closed six other mental health clinics in a cost-cutting move.\nThat storm never has quieted, and in fact has picked up recently with suggestions that some of those involved in police shootings were unable to get needed mental health treatment.\nBut the city says it won't work and, in fact, would be \"counterproductive,\" according to Dr. Julie Morita, the city health commissioner.\nThe plan would be funded by requiring the city's Department of Public Health to join three managed-care networks that reimburse mental health care, using the Medicaid program."}
