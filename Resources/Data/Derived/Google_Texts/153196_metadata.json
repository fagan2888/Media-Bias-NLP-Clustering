It is vital that healthcare organizations clearly define and document the relationship between the legal, compliance and audit spheres, defining both departmental boundaries and expectations for collaboration, according to the document. Hospital boards should regularly assess each function's performance and independence.\n\nHospital boards should also develop and enforce standards for how to report compliance-related information, the guidance states, by requesting periodic reports on risk management and compliance from multiple functions and engaging leadership from various spheres to get the most relevant, accurate information about operations and risks. They must also make sure both the board and management have clearly defined protocols for risk-area identification, which may incorporate internal or external sources. \"For instance, boards and management may identify regulatory risks from internal sources, such as employee reports to an internal compliance hotline or internal audits,\" the guidance states. \"External sources that may be used to identify regulatory risks might include professional organization publications, OIG-issued guidance, consultants, competitors or news media.\"\n\nDespite the key roles that a provider's audit, compliance and legal sectors play, compliance involves the entire organization, the guidance states. To emphasize this, it suggests boards regularly assess employees' ability to further compliance goals at the individual, departmental or facility-wide level, and possibly withhold incentives or offer bonuses to promote these efforts.\n\nHealthcare compliance is particularly fraught post-Affordable Care Act, and many chief compliance officers say increased emphasis on it has made their position more important than ever. Corporate compliance is doubly important amid increased scrutiny of potential false claims or kickback schemes, FierceHealthPayerAntiFraud previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the guidance (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare compliance post-ACA: Challenges and opportunities [Special Report]\n\nACA regulations for nonprofits could have unintended consequences\n\nWhat healthcare providers should know about reverse false claims\n\nAs fraud crackdown grows, so does need for corporate compliance", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General has released jointly developed guidance to help healthcare providers' boards address compliance issues.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General has released jointly developed guidance to help healthcare providers' boards address compliance issues.", "title": "OIG to hospitals: Involve boards to strengthen compliance", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/oig-hospitals-involve-boards-strengthen-compliance/2015-04-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,compliance,hospital boards,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Office of The Inspector General (OIG),Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (OIG) has released jointly developed guidance to help healthcare providers' boards address compliance issues.\nHealthcare compliance is particularly fraught post-Affordable Care Act, and many chief compliance officers say increased emphasis on it has made their position more important than ever.\nDespite the key roles that a provider's audit, compliance and legal sectors play, compliance involves the entire organization, the guidance states.\n\"For instance, boards and management may identify regulatory risks from internal sources, such as employee reports to an internal compliance hotline or internal audits,\" the guidance states.\nCorporate compliance is doubly important amid increased scrutiny of potential false claims or kickback schemes, FierceHealthPayerAntiFraud previously reported."}
