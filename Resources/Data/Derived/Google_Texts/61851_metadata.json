I have lung disease, I\u2019m dying,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they deny me? If they do, give me a couple years and I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nToday, most state Medicaid programs cover only disabled adults or those with dependents, so Mr. Cannon and millions of other deeply impoverished Americans are left without access to the program. But starting Jan. 1, President Obama\u2019s health care law will expand Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes under 138 percent of the federal poverty line, and enrollment is expected to increase by about nine million next year. Thousands of homeless people will be among the newly covered.\n\nHousing advocates say they believe that the Medicaid expansion has the potential to reduce rates of homelessness significantly, both by preventing low-income Americans from becoming homeless as a result of illness or medical debt and by helping homeless people become eligible for and remain in housing.\n\n\u201cWe really feel like this is the last piece of the puzzle that we need to end chronic homelessness,\u201d said Steve Berg, the vice president for programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\nBut signing up homeless people for Medicaid is a huge logistical challenge, as housing advocates acknowledge. Homeless individuals often do not have an email address, phone number or permanent address. Many are unaware of the health care law or are skeptical of public programs.\n\nHousing advocates and social workers across the country are now on a major push to inform impoverished and homeless people that they are eligible for Medicaid in the 25 states that are expanding the program and in the District of Columbia, and to enroll them.\n\nFor homeless people, experts said, the Medicaid expansion will mean more consistent treatment for medical conditions, including alcoholism, drug addiction, chronic pain and depression. For states and cities, they said, it will mean a more effective safety net, and perhaps even a cheaper one.\n\n\u201cYou cannot successfully treat someone for diabetes if they\u2019re living under a bridge,\u201d said Ed Blackburn, the executive director of Central City Concern, a nonprofit agency in Portland, Ore. \u201cAnd serious mental illness and chronic health conditions are barriers to getting housing.\u201d\n\nTo help spread the word, Heartland Alliance, the nonprofit organization where Ms. Ward works, has stationed employees in soup kitchens, shelters and medical clinics to increase awareness and encourage enrollment. \u201cThey\u2019re accustomed to a no,\u201d Ms. Ward said of her homeless clients. \u201cYou really have to encourage them and let them know it\u2019s their right to be covered.\u201d\n\nThe conditions of homeless life can also make it difficult to enroll. At the House of Mary and Joseph, Julie Nelson, associate director of outreach, benefits and entitlements at Heartland Alliance, huddled with 48-year-old Marvin Cosper. \u201cI heard about Obamacare,\u201d he said, nodding, as Ms. Nelson walked him through the basics of the available plans.\n\nBut when she explained that it might take 60 days for him to be enrolled, he bristled. \u201cI\u2019m just passing through,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Cosper is a former drug addict and onetime crack cocaine dealer who has spent much of the past 20 years homeless, moving from state to state. \u201cI was under the impression it was federal,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was federal, so whatever state you were in, you could use that card.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good question,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. \u201cIt goes state by state.\u201d About half of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion, a decision made possible by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling on the law.\n\nMr. Cosper decided to sign up for Medicaid anyway.\n\nAnother client, Donna Terrell, who is 54 and has been homeless for a decade, worked with Ms. Nelson to sort out whether she was enrolled already.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in limbo,\u201d Ms. Terrell said, settling onto a cot with a plastic mattress in a room that would hold about 40 women that night. She said she had filled out the paperwork but had never received an enrollment card, ending up with $6,000 in medical bills instead. She and Ms. Nelson determined that Ms. Terrell did have coverage, but her card had been sent to a shelter that had shut down months before.\n\nIf the logistical challenges of signing up homeless people for Medicaid can be mitigated, housing advocates and social workers say, the Medicaid expansion could provide profound benefits for them, even though some experts caution that finding doctors who accept Medicaid will continue to be a challenge in many states.\n\nStudies suggest that most chronically homeless Americans are uninsured. It can be logistically difficult for people with very low or nonexistent incomes to gain access even to charity care and free clinics, because getting there costs money and because clinics\u2019 hours and ability to provide care are limited.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is expected to greatly improve access to care for hundreds of thousands of homeless Americans, who would be able to see physicians and specialists, often at no cost.\n\nIt might also shift the burden of care from emergency rooms to doctors\u2019 offices, with benefits for state budgets. Homeless people tend to use health care services in the most expensive ways, said Jennifer Ho, a senior adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cThey show up when they\u2019re sicker,\u201d she said. \u201cThey stay longer. And it\u2019s harder to discharge them because they don\u2019t have a place to go.\u201d\n\nHousing advocates emphasized that the Medicaid expansion would not directly help homeless people find housing. But officials at federal agencies, national housing organizations and local nonprofit organizations pointed to several ways it could reduce rates of homelessness.\n\nIn addition to helping prevent homelessness due to medical debt or untreated illness, the expansion could free up money for nonprofit groups to spend on housing, rather than on health care, officials at the National Alliance to End Homelessness said.\n\nThe expanded coverage might also make it easier for homeless people to find and stay in housing. For instance, some housing units require prospective tenants to have Medicaid, Ms. Nelson said. Moreover, the expanded Medicaid program would \u201cpay for services that help people become stable so that they can remain in housing,\u201d said Karen Batia, the executive director of Heartland Alliance\u2019s health outreach operations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a means to an end,\u201d said Ms. Ward, the social worker, adding that it would help organizations like Heartland \u201ctreat the person holistically.\u201d\n\nSome states might try to bring down medical costs by asking the federal government for waivers to spend Medicaid dollars on supportive housing, experts said.\n\nBut first, the challenge is expanding Medicaid to a fragile and hard-to-reach population.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131124201721, "twitter": {"description": "Housing advocates say the Medicaid expansion included in the health care law could reduce homelessness significantly, but there are obstacles to reaching and enrolling homeless people.", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Faces Major Logistical Challenges Among the Homeless", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/us/medicaid-expansion-faces-major-logistical-challenges-among-the-homeless.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/25/us/MEDICAID-1/MEDICAID-1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "creator": "@AnnieLowrey", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "xlarge": "images/2013/11/25/us/MEDICAID-1/MEDICAID-1-articleLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "Medicaid Expansion Faces Major Logistical Challenges Among the Homeless", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 24, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Medicaid,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Homeless Persons,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "xlarge_height": 400, "news_keywords": "Medicaid,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,Homelessness", "PT": "Article", "author": "ANNIE LOWREY", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/25/us/MEDICAID-1/MEDICAID-1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "xlarge_width": 600, "byl": "By ANNIE LOWREY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S.", "lp": "Housing advocates say the Medicaid expansion included in the health care law could reduce homelessness significantly, but there are obstacles to reaching and enrolling homeless people.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/25/us/MEDICAID-1/MEDICAID-1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "Housing advocates say the Medicaid expansion included in the health care law could reduce homelessness significantly, but there are obstacles to reaching and enrolling homeless people.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "November 24, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "25medicaid", "utime": 20131125110811, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/us/medicaid-expansion-faces-major-logistical-challenges-among-the-homeless.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/25/us/MEDICAID-1/MEDICAID-1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Housing advocates say the Medicaid expansion included in the health care law could reduce homelessness significantly, but there are obstacles to reaching and enrolling homeless people.", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Faces Major Logistical Challenges Among the Homeless"}, "pdate": 20131124, "des": "Medicaid;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Homeless Persons;Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002569678, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "3lvqdNuvKgxKs0Xr/rF+8A", "hdl": "Medicaid Expansion Faces Major Logistical Challenges Among the Homeless", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd057\"", "article_summary": "For homeless people, experts said, the Medicaid expansion will mean more consistent treatment for medical conditions, including alcoholism, drug addiction, chronic pain and depression.\nFor instance, some housing units require prospective tenants to have Medicaid, Ms. Nelson said.\n\u201cI heard about Obamacare,\u201d he said, nodding, as Ms. Nelson walked him through the basics of the available plans.\nBut signing up homeless people for Medicaid is a huge logistical challenge, as housing advocates acknowledge.\nMany are unaware of the health care law or are skeptical of public programs."}
