While it stayed light, the winds helped make for a messy commute. The snow helped Sioux Falls over the average snow for the month with 8.3 inches. The climate average is 7.4.\n\nThe light snow helped me inch closer to my prediction, here's an update as to where I stand so far early this year.\n\nSioux Falls is twenty-one percent of the way there while the eight inches so far in Aberdeen is 22 percent there. While Pierre is close to a third of the way, Rapid City's 15 inches is 42 percent there. The Hills need more, the 20 inches is just 12 percent of the prediction.\n\nThe new snow will keep us cold on Thanksgiving in central and eastern KELOLAND, but western South Dakota will warm to near fifty.
