At that time, the Illinois senator backed civil unions, but not gay marriage. His political wariness about states\u2019 fast-moving judicial rulings fell away after Vice President Biden embraced gay marriage during an interview in 2012. Biden accompanied the president Wednesday.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d the president said to loud applause. \u201cA decade ago, politicians ran against LGBT rights. Today they\u2019re running toward them because they\u2019ve learned what the rest of the country knows -- that marriage equality is about our civil rights, and our firm belief that every citizen should be treated equally under the law.\u201d\n\nWhile the president sent the Supreme Court another overt message about the country\u2019s evolving interpretations of same-sex marriage, legal rights for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, as well as civil rights, his former secretary of state released a campaign video celebrating gay marriage as a \u201chuman right.\u201d\n\nThe video, using footage of a diverse assemblage of same-sex couples exchanging wedding vows accompanied by a swelling sound track, promotes Clinton\u2019s candidacy using her words, drawn from speeches in which she\u2019s declared gay rights to be human rights.\n\n\u201cSome have suggested that gay rights and human rights are separate and distinct, but in fact they are one and the same,\u201d she says in the video\u2019s voiceover.\n\nOn the stump, the leading Democratic presidential candidate says as president she would be a \u201cchampion\u201d and a \u201cfighter\u201d for Americans left behind. As was true during Obama\u2019s presidential contests, the LGBT community is important to her donor base and to the grassroots organization her campaign is building nationwide.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, speaking publicly June 15, was asked why racial equality has moved more slowly through the courts and society, compared with the torrent of changes tied to sexual orientation and gay rights.\n\n\u201cFor gay people, once we find out they are people we know and we love and we respect and they are part of us, I think that accounts for the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the years when gay people hid who they were, there was a kind of discrimination that started to break down very rapidly once they no longer hid in the corner.\u201d\n\nGinsburg, who will be one of the justices to affirm a right for same-sex couples to marry, said the Supreme Court is \u201cinevitably \u2026 affected by the climate of the era.\u201d\n\nObama echoed that idea.\n\n\u201cThere are still battles to wage, more hearts and minds to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the people in this room and our friends and allies across the country have proven anything, it\u2019s that even in the toughest of circumstances, against the greatest possible odds, in America, change is possible. It\u2019s in our hands. Together, I know we\u2019ll get there. Look how far we\u2019ve already come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and Hillary Clinton Wednesday each found openings to publicly celebrate gay rights and marriage equality leading up to a June Supreme Court ruling that is widely expected to energize...", "title": "Obama, Clinton Hail Gay Marriage Rights on Eve of Ruling | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/06/24/obama_clinton_hail_gay_marriage_rights_on_eve_of_ruling.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/304821_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama and Hillary Clinton Wednesday each found openings to publicly celebrate gay rights and marriage equality leading up to a June Supreme Court ruling that is widely expected to energize...", "title": "Obama, Clinton Hail Gay Marriage Rights on Eve of Ruling | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Obama, Clinton Hail Gay Marriage Rights on Eve of Ruling | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Election 2016,Hillary Clinton,President Obama,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Supreme Court,gay rights,gay marriage,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5981\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSome have suggested that gay rights and human rights are separate and distinct, but in fact they are one and the same,\u201d she says in the video\u2019s voiceover.\nAt that time, the Illinois senator backed civil unions, but not gay marriage.\nWhether the Supreme Court affirms a federal right for same-sex couples to marry, \u201cone thing is undeniable,\u201d the president said.\nHis political wariness about states\u2019 fast-moving judicial rulings fell away after Vice President Biden embraced gay marriage during an interview in 2012.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton Wednesday each found openings to publicly celebrate gay rights and marriage equality leading up to a June Supreme Court ruling that is widely expected to energize the 2016 political bloodstream, no matter how it comes down."}
