There will be deep consequences for corporations, too.\n\nFinancial Times reporter Eric Platt joins me now for some insight. So, how did companies take advantage of these near-zero percent interest rates, cheap money over the past six, seven, eight years?\n\nERIC PLATT, FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTER: So, over the past three years, we\u2019ve seen more than a trillion dollars of issuance each year. And it\u2019s accelerated each year as they try to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs.\n\nThey\u2019ve used that money to fund buybacks and also to purchase other companies in what\u2019s been a record wave of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is how they are able to give some of those stock dividends or \u2014 to investors?\n\nERIC PLATT: Exactly. Instead of using cash that they have, they can, you know, tap debt markets nearly unlimitedly. We\u2019ve seen Apple doing it.\n\nThey have cash overseas that they\u2019d rather not take a tax hit on. So, instead they issue bonds here to pay back dividends to shareholders or buy back shares.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So Apple\u2019s a big, successful company. I get that. But what happens when the rates start to creep up little by little and the cost of borrowing gets more expensive?\n\nERIC PLATT: So the companies you would be looking at would be anything that\u2019s speculative grade, particularly in the energy sector, which has been hit by this drop in commodity prices.\n\nIt also is to companies like American Apparel, which is struggling under a debt load, companies like Sears and JCPenney, which have struggled with the rise of Amazon.\n\nSo, anyone that\u2019s borrowed heavily over the past few years to finance their operations or haven\u2019t been able to turn around their operations would be under threat.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So those companies, we could actually see them start to default on some their loans because it\u2019s not so cheap any more?\n\nERIC PLATT: Well, that won\u2019t be the main concern. It would be if energy prices continue to stay down here. However, the issue is if they were able to finance their operations over the past few years with debt issuance, and now they come to the market in 2016 or 2017 and investors aren\u2019t interested.\n\nThey might not be interested in paying six percent or seven percent interest rates if they can get access at all.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And so what happens on a consumer front? What\u2019s the ripple effect if there is this contraction in liquidity for companies?\n\nERIC PLATT: So that\u2019s what the Federal Reserve has been looking at. They have been hoping that robust jobs growth would take away any kind of default you would see.\n\nAnd so if these companies do fail, they would hope these jobs will be made up elsewhere. They could go into the health-care sector, education, which has been adding jobs at a very fast clip.\n\nThat said, their concern is if consumer confidence dips a little bit. If you see big companies go under. Which in the energy sector, if suddenly consumers don\u2019t want to\u2013 they spend a little bit less, so they pull out money from the stock market.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So what are the odds then going into this week? The Fed could raise the rates as soon as this week \u2014 who says what? Who is betting on now versus December?\n\nERIC PLATT: So, economists on Wall Street bet now. They say the Federal Reserve wants to get ahead of any potential crisis in the future. So if in 2017, suddenly we see economics growth slow, you know, they could lower rates to kind of spur borrowing costs.\n\nBut traders don\u2019t think they will. Traders say they are worried that with the ripple effects of China and financial market gyrations over the past few weeks that the Fed doesn\u2019t want to add to that volatility. And so they may wait until December.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Eric Platt of the Financial Times.
