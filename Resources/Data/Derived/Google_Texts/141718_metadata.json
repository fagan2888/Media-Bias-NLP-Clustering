On the latter score, Fetter expressed some frustration, though not with the decision to expand Tenet\u2019s market share in the state.\n\nValley Baptist has hospitals in Brownsville and Harlingen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a particularly great market for us,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cWith this acquisition, we\u2019ve doubled the amount of revenue we have in Texas.\u201d\n\nTenet previously owned Brownsville Medical Center, which it sold to Valley Baptist 10 years ago. Texas is now Tenet\u2019s largest market, Fetter said, noting that the company has operations in El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Nacogdoches and New Braunfels in addition to the Valley.\n\nWith the acquisition, the company has achieved roughly $15 billion a year in annual revenues, he said.\n\nTenet has 110,000 employees, making it the 65th largest employer in the United States, Fetter said.\n\n\u201cIt will be a year of significant growth for us into 2014,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, Tenet has the second largest number of medical residency slots of any health system in the country, experience that will come in handy with the new demand for residencies a medical school in the Valley will create, he said.\n\n\u201cWe operate a number of hospitals that are teaching hospitals for medical schools,\u201d Fetter said.\n\nWhile Tenet loves the Texas market, when it comes to insuring more of its residents toward the goal of making health care less expensive in general, the state is missing a golden opportunity, he said.\n\nFetter cites Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid eligibility as called for in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nIn doing so, the state is rejecting a huge investment in state dollars and allowing countless needy residents to fall through the cracks in terms of insurance \u2014 residents that would have otherwise been covered under some form of insurance.\n\nExpanding insurance eligibility would mean fewer people using the emergency room as their primary source for health care, which serves to drive up insurance rates for everyone else, he said.\n\n\u201cThe hospital industry in Texas has been very well aligned that (expansion) is the right thing to do,\u201d Fetter said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are actually caring for the people who come in and don\u2019t have insurance, but we\u2019re caring for them in the most expensive possible way, typically the emergency room, and it\u2019s typically after they\u2019ve had some condition that\u2019s been untreated for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the industry\u2019s perspective it\u2019s the right thing to do to provide some safety net for people.\u201d\n\nHe noted that business groups such as regional chambers of commerce in Austin, Dallas and Houston \u2014 groups that tend to lean conservative \u2014 support Medicaid expansion and in fact have adopted it as a priority.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that employers generally, when you explain it to them, understand that they\u2019re paying for it anyway,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cThey\u2019re paying higher insurance rates to help hospitals subsidize care for the uninsured. It\u2019s an incredibly inefficient way to do it.\u201d\n\nOther conservative states where Tenet operates have handled it differently, he said. For instance, in Arizona, a state with politics similar to Texas, the governor found a way working with that state\u2019s legislature to make Medicaid expansion happen, Fetter said.\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of Republican governors are finding a path to do this,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides the economic and social benefits of a healthier citizenry and workforce, in terms of simple arithmetic Texas is doing itself a disservice by rejecting Medicaid expansion, Fetter said. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the extra cost initially, then roughly 90 percent over a period of 10 years, he noted.\n\n\u201cThe return on investment for the state, if it were just a very cold financial calculation, would be enormous in terms of federal dollars matched for every state dollar put in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re talking about making an investment in the health of the citizens, which makes them more productive, then they\u2019re more employable and they\u2019ll remain on the job longer.\n\nThe reason expansion hasn\u2019t happened is that Medicaid has become politicized, Fetter said.\n\n\u201cIf we were talking about road construction or the establishment of expansion of military bases, this would have been a very short conversation in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s Medicaid it\u2019s gotten wrapped up in politics.\u201d\n\nsclark@brownsvilleherald.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Brownsville Herald", "description": "Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. announced on Oct. 1 that it had finalized a $4.3 billion acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, which owns Valley Baptist Health System.", "title": "Tenet CEO visits Valley", "url": "http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_d47bdb88-5651-11e3-bdae-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": "http://www.aim-ads.com/multimedia-themonitor-com/wwwroot/herald_icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@BrownsvilleNews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. announced on Oct. 1 that it had finalized a $4.3 billion acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, which owns Valley Baptist Health System.", "fb": {"app_id": 218220474972284}, "keywords": "local", "google-site-verification": "fIj8GGnpBGNOd0kOB7XPSmHJNw93FzFvUQDoiX4ibFY", "news_keywords": "local"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfaa\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter was in the Rio Grande Valley to discuss the deal and the health care climate in Texas.\nBesides the economic and social benefits of a healthier citizenry and workforce, in terms of simple arithmetic Texas is doing itself a disservice by rejecting Medicaid expansion, Fetter said.\n\u201cWith this acquisition, we\u2019ve doubled the amount of revenue we have in Texas.\u201dTenet previously owned Brownsville Medical Center, which it sold to Valley Baptist 10 years ago.\nFetter cites Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid eligibility as called for in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\nValley Baptist has hospitals in Brownsville and Harlingen."}
