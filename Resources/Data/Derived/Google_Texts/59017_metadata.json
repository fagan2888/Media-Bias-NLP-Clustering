They\u2019re filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing Obama\u2019s November 2014 unilateral actions are in violation of the \u201cspirit\u201d of immigration law and a threat to the separation of powers.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Executive has asserted that the acts challenged here are not even subject to judicial review, what is at stake in this matter is nothing less than an effort to supplant Congress\u2019s constitutional power to \u2018establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.\u2019 Such an action stands in stark contravention to federal law and to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers,\u201d the Senators\u2019 brief reads.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt adds, \u201cThere is little doubt that the Executive adopted the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\u2018DAPA\u2019) program as part of an explicit effort to circumvent the legislative process.\u201d\n\nLed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), 43 GOP senators signed on to the brief. The names of 11 senators were noticeably absent from the list, many of whom are up for reelection in relatively tough November races, including Sen. Mark Kirk (R-CO), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Dean Heller (R-NV), and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) also did not sign the brief.\n\nTwenty-six states, led by Texas, have challenged the Obama administration\u2019s executive amnesty programs, designed to offer pseudo-legal status and work permits to millions of illegal immigrants. To-date the states have been successful in their challenge in lower courts. A federal district court in Brownsville, Texas initially blocked the programs and in November the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the preliminary injunction.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the challenge in January. Oral arguments before the high court are slated for April 18.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIn a statement provided after publication, Sen. Portman\u2019s spokesman Kevin Smith stressed Portman\u2019s opposition to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cRob doesn\u2019t often sign amicus briefs but he certainly supports the intent of this one,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe agrees that the President\u2019s unilateral actions were unconstitutional, and trusts that the Supreme Court will affirm the decision of the Fifth Circuit striking it down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "43 Senate Republicans Sign Supreme Court Brief Against Executive Amnesty, 11 GOPers Sit Out", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "43 Senate Republicans Sign Supreme Court Brief Against Executive Amnesty, 11 GOPers Sit Out", "title": "43 Senate Republicans Sign Supreme Court Brief Against Executive Amnesty, 11 GOPers Sit Out - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Supreme-Court-statuary-columns-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-04-05T14:20:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/05/43-senate-republicans-sign-supreme-court-brief-exec-amnesty-11-gopers-sit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "43 Senate Republicans Sign Supreme Court Brief Against Executive Amnesty, 11 GOPers Sit Out", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Supreme-Court-statuary-columns-AP.jpg", "title": "43 Senate Republicans Sign Supreme Court Brief Against Executive Amnesty, 11 GOPers Sit Out - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, Illegal Immigrants, Mitch McConnell, SCOTUS, Supreme Court,Big Government, Immigration,executive amnesty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-05T08:12:54-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2016-04-05T14:20:24-07:00", "tag": "Supreme Court", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMany Senate Republicans are offering their support to the 26 states challenging the president\u2019s executive amnesty programs.\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the challenge in January.\n\u201cHe agrees that the President\u2019s unilateral actions were unconstitutional, and trusts that the Supreme Court will affirm the decision of the Fifth Circuit striking it down.\u201d\nThey\u2019re filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing Obama\u2019s November 2014 unilateral actions are in violation of the \u201cspirit\u201d of immigration law and a threat to the separation of powers.\nSen.
