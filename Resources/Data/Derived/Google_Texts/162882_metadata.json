But most of the time these activities are cut short as his body, stricken with sickle cell anemia since birth, fills with pain.\n\n\u201cIt just randomly happens,\u201d said Newsome of Des Moines. \u201cThere's no really preventing it or seeing it coming.\u201d\n\nObtaining insurance to cover his health care adequately all these years has not been easy, but at least he has had insurance the past year. Other black families in Iowa with low incomes do not, adding to difficulties they face getting health care.\n\nA University of Iowa Public Policy Center study in December 2013 put the problem into perspective, showing that black as well as Latino Iowans do not have the same access to adequate health care that Asian and white Iowans have.\n\nThe Public Policy Center went on to say in its report, which used data from a child and family health survey conducted in fall 2010 and spring 2011, that Iowa's blacks and Latinos are more likely to need medical care, even though they are more unlikely than Asian or white Iowans to receive it.\n\nThe disparities are a result of varying factors, the Public Policy Center report said, including a lower quality of care in general, higher than normal unmet need for care, poor diets, a higher likelihood to seek care from a hospital emergency room, and fewer safe and supportive neighborhoods.\n\nSocial aspects \u2014 including someone's poverty level, neighborhood, culture or race \u2014 account for 90 percent of what affects health status, the study's authors concluded.\n\n\u201cThe causes of health disparity vary, but we need to look beyond health care,\u201d said Dr. Peter Damiano, director of the Iowa Public Policy Center's director and also its health policy research program. \u201cIowa needs to be looking at behavior, genetics and environment.\u201d\n\nDisparity is defined as a lack of similarity or equality.\n\nNewsome's mother, Charice Williams, did not have health insurance coverage for herself or her children until she signed up under the Affordable Care Act in 2013.\n\n\u201cEven though I am low-income, I am still over-income for things. Everything goes by your gross income instead of what you really bring home as your net pay,\u201d said Williams, who works part-time for the city of Des Moines so that she can spend time caring for her son.\n\nThe Public Policy Center study focused on the several factors that create a disparity, including overall health status; insurance coverage; need and access to care; lifestyle, family, and social environment.\n\nThe study pointed out that more than 90 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander and white children in Iowa had an overall health rating of \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cvery good.\u201d This compares to a 76 percent health rating in the same categories for black Iowa children and 69 percent for Hispanic children in the state.\n\nLIFESTYLE AFFECTS HEALTH\n\nThe Public Policy Center report said 3 percent of Iowa's black children were not covered by health insurance during the 2010-2011 survey. The rate for Iowa's white children was 2 percent.\n\nThe rate jumped to 10 percent for Latino children in Iowa, the study showed.\n\nSix of every 10 black children in Iowa were in public insurance programs such as Medicaid or Hawk-i programs at the time of the study. Five of every 10 were Hispanic.\n\nBetween one and two of every 10 white Iowa children on average were in the program.\n\nPoverty-based problems are move prevalent for black Iowans \u2014 even though they comprised 3.3 percent of the state's population in 2013 \u2014 because 35.5 percent were living in poverty in 2012, the most recent figures from the Iowa Data Center show.\n\nThat poverty rate was close to triple the 12.7 percent for white Iowans, U.S. Census Bureau estimates show.\n\n\u201cThere are small pockets of African Americans secure in their jobs and have health coverage,\u201d said Cynthia Hunafa, of the northwest Des Moines urban neighborhood support organization Creative Visions. \u201cThen there is a larger segment that isn't secure and finally a huge segment that is scrambling to get things together.\u201d\n\nThe lack of insurance drives the trend of going to an emergency room instead of a doctor. But using emergency room care as the only method of maintaining health is a reactive measure, rather than a preventive one.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a better trend now with national health care, but individuals still don't think about going to the hospital or getting adequate care, and that is when we decided to open our own clinic,\u201d said state Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines, Creative Visions's founder and executive director.\n\nDamiano said people in certain racial groups, such as Latinos and blacks, also go untreated because they have to work through complicated cultural differences.\n\n\u201cIt's not as easy as giving someone a pill and it's done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a challenge for providers to assess what the patient needs based on cultural barriers and lack of quality care over long periods of time.\u201d\n\nBut while health providers need to be knowledgeable to treat complicated patients, patients also need to be more educated about the health system, sources interviewed by IowaWatch said.\n\n\u201cThe underserved are unfamiliar with the health system, which makes it difficult to navigate and gain access,\u201d said Betsy Richey, data management program manager in the Iowa Department of Public Health's Bureau of Communication and Planning.\n\nIowa was 5.5 percent Latino in 2013, Census Bureau estimates show. Latino Iowans' poverty rate was double that of white Iowans, at 26 percent, in 2012, the most recent figures available from the Iowa Data Center show.\n\nNon-native Iowans tend to have a language barrier with providers. Also, \u201cbeliefs and customs are different, which prevents some cultures from trusting providers or going for medical care,\u201d Joan Jaimes, outreach counselor at Marshalltown Community College, said.\n\nHospital staffs need to be more culturally competent when dealing with under-served Iowans but do not bear all the blame, Jaimes said. \u201cThe Hispanic culture is less healthy in general, not because of hospitals or doctors, but because of the way we eat and our customs, making us prone to more diseases like diabetes that go untreated.\u201d\n\nLucia Santillan and Iraima Franqui, of Fort Madison, can tell you about language barriers when getting health care in Iowa. \u201cI'm used to receiving weird looks from people in the Midwest because of my accent or when I speak Spanish,\u201d Franqui said in Spanish, with Santillan translating as they sat in a Hy-Vee in Burlington this past summer.\n\nSantillan, 27, and Franqui, 43, lived in a homeless shelter as recently as early 2013 but were operating a cleaning business after moving to Iowa almost two years ago.\n\nFranqui said her English is not 100 percent so Santillan translates for her when they go to the Great River Quick Care clinic in Burlington to keep their costs down. They also have gone to hospital emergency rooms for care. \u201cI prefer to not have insurance because the clinics work with you so well in Iowa to make payments without insurance,\u201d Santillan said.\n\nRESULTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIsaiah Newsome hopes things start looking up 2015. He and his mother are to go to the University of Minnesota in January so that Newsome can have a bone marrow transplant. He is to have chemotherapy to wipe out his diseased blood cells, giving new ones a chance to form normally and stop his constant pain.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues we find in the community is people of African or Latino dissent are not registered on the bone marrow registry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think it's just a lack of knowledge. And there's a fear of the medical community in the African American community \u2013 a fear of the unknown because that preventative care has never been a part of our community, so people are afraid to go to the doctor.\u201d\n\nThe family established a Go Fund Me account online and friends have held fundraisers in their name to help with the extreme costs. The transplant is a serious procedure, but the family has high hopes that the pain will cease once they return to their Des Moines home.\n\nThen Newsome will look forward to a new goal: attend college.\n\nThis story was produced by Iowa Center for Public Affairs Journalism-IowaWatch.org, a non-profit, online news Website that collaborates with Iowa news organizations to produce explanatory and investigative reporting.\n\nl This story was produced by Iowa Center for Public Affairs Journalism-IowaWatch.org, a non-profit, online news website that collaborates with Iowa news organizations to produce explanatory and investigative reporting.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Isaiah Newsome likes to play sports and hang out with friends, like any 17-year-old.
