PA-Sen: Toomey Attacks McGinty’s Business Career (VIDEO)

Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor

Senator Pat Toomey is making it clear that he will make sure Katie McGinty’s business career is at the center of the campaign debate if she wins the Democratic nomination.

Today the Toomey team released a web ad hitting McGinty for taking jobs in the private sector that were not in the state’s best interest.

Their video takes McGinty’s claim that she’s “fighting for us” and attempts to convince viewers that she is actually “fighting for herself” (which is the title of the spot).

“Fighting for us? Really?,” the narrator asks incredulously. “Fighting for notorious D.C. law firms? Check. Corporate special interests that receive millions in taxpayer money? Check. Fighting for herself? Check.”

“Katie McGinty, not for us,” the narrator concludes.

The ad appears to piggyback on a recent Fetterman video that painted McGinty as too close to oil and gas companies.

McGinty is running against Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and former Congressman Joe Sestak in the Democratic primary.

The McGinty campaign issued a press release providing counters for Toomey’s claims as well as the following statement.

“Toomey’s attack is the height of hypocrisy. Katie McGinty has consistently fought for protecting the environment and creating jobs for hard-working Pennsylvania families,” Communications Director Sabrina Singh stated. “Let’s be clear – Senator Toomey has been a roadblock for Pennsylvania by consistently voting to protect tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas, opposing efforts to make college more affordable and supporting the privatization of Medicare and Social Security and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Clearly he sees Katie as the strongest threat to his career as a Washington politician.”
