In 1932, Walter O. Gutlohn\u2019s animated cartoon short of Tom and Jerry titled Redskin Blues tells the story of the main characters being attacked by stereotypical 'savage' Indians, only to be rescued by the US Army. As NPR reported on the context of the team name in relation to this cartoon, \u201cJust a year after that stereotype-laden Tom and Jerry cartoon was released, Boston Braves owner George Preston Marshall decided in 1933 to change the franchise's name from the Braves (another name with a racial history) to the Redskins.\u201d\n\nSee video here.\n\n2. According to the NCAI's report, Marshall was well known for requiring the coach William Henry 'Lone Star' Dietz and players \u201cto wear Indian feathers and put on war paint before home games\u201d and Cliff Battles, a non-Native member of the team, said in an interview in Showdown: JFK and the Integration of the Washington Redskins, by Thomas G. Smith, in the 30\u2019s, players would do so and \u201cdo a little Indian dance to entertain the paying customers. None of us liked that very much\u2026it was embarrassing.\u201d\n\nRELATED http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/11/nfl-commissioner-tells-congress-redskins-positive-name-149843\n\n3. According to the report, in 1963 \u2013 four years before the Washington franchise first filed for trademark protection \u2013 the National Indian Youth Council was formed and began working on campuses, most notably the University of Oklahoma, to eliminate its mascot, 'Little Red,' and always made the case about the worst 'Indian' reference, the one in the nation\u2019s capital, the Red*kins. In 1968, \u2013 just one year after Pro-Football gained its first license for the \u201cRed*kins\u201d mark \u2013 the Native American community commenced a broad-scale effort to eradicate the use of all 'Native' names and symbols. In 1972, representatives of NCAI, the American Indian Press Association, the American Indian Movement, and others reached out directly to the team owner to request that the franchise change its name. And since that time there have been substantial efforts to protest the name and call for the name change.\n\n4. The trademark Redskins was declared harmful by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Redskins is a pejorative term for Native Americans and is a registered trademark that disparages an entire group and perpetuates a centuries old stereotype. The logo and term Redskins should never have been registered as a federally protected trademark, according to the report.\n\n5. The report also says that, \"to many Native Americans, the term 'Redskins' is associated with the barbaric practice of scalping. The record in this case is replete with evidence of bounty proclamations issued by the colonies and companies. These proclamations demonstrate that the term 'Redsk*ns' had its origins in the commodification of Indian skins and body parts; these 'Redsk*ns' were required as proof of Indian kill in order for bounty hunters to receive payment...\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 Reasons NCAI\u2019s Report Says Redskins Is a \u2018Racist and Ugly\u2019 Word", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/12/5-reasons-ncais-report-says-redskins-racist-and-ugly-word-151717", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/offensive_mascot_redskins.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "5 Reasons NCAI\u2019s Report Says Redskins Is a \u2018Racist and Ugly\u2019 Word"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-10-12T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/12/5-reasons-ncais-report-says-redskins-racist-and-ugly-word-151717", "dc": {"title": "5 Reasons NCAI\u2019s Report Says Redskins Is a \u2018Racist and Ugly\u2019 Word"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 11}, "dcterms.title": "5 Reasons NCAI\u2019s Report Says Redskins Is a \u2018Racist and Ugly\u2019 Word"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4ff\"", "article_summary": "The report also says that, \"to many Native Americans, the term 'Redskins' is associated with the barbaric practice of scalping.\nThe logo and term Redskins should never have been registered as a federally protected trademark, according to the report.\nIn 1972, representatives of NCAI, the American Indian Press Association, the American Indian Movement, and others reached out directly to the team owner to request that the franchise change its name.\nIn 1968, \u2013 just one year after Pro-Football gained its first license for the \u201cRed*kins\u201d mark \u2013 the Native American community commenced a broad-scale effort to eradicate the use of all 'Native' names and symbols.\nThe trademark Redskins was declared harmful by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Redskins is a pejorative term for Native Americans and is a registered trademark that disparages an entire group and perpetuates a centuries old stereotype."}
