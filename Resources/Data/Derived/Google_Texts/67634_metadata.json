One in every 783,333 visitors managed to close the deal: Dr. Obama could make house calls to every one and still have time for a round of golf.\n\n#page#In order to meet its target of 7 million enrollees by March 1, Obamacare needs to enroll approximately 46,358 Americans per day. So on its opening day it fell 46,352 short. Were it to maintain that enrollment rate, Obamacare would reach its target of 7 million enrollees in the year 5209. That\u2019s longer than waiting for a hip replacement on the Scottish NHS.\n\n#ad#At the same time as dozens of Obamacare enrollees were being signed up, millions of other Americans were having their health insurance canceled \u2014 including so many pundits of left (Kirsten Powers), right (Michelle Malkin), and center (David Frum) that the Pulitzers should introduce a prize for Best Suddenly Uninsured Writing. Among their number was Matthew Fleischer, who wrote in the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\nMost young, middle-class Americans I know are happy that millions of previously uninsured people will receive free or heavily subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe just didn\u2019t realize that, unless we had health insurance at work, we\u2019d be the ones paying for it.\n\n\nThe reason he didn\u2019t realize it is because the president lied to him, not just once in a casual aside, but on dozens of occasions, and very bluntly: \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you can keep your health-care plan. Period.\u201d But the entire premise of Obamacare was that, in order to cover (some of) the uninsured and (in many cases) uninsurable, other Americans were going to have to pay significantly more. Obamacare was always intended to be the Great Disruptor: Avik Roy reports that, by 2010, administration officials knew that 93 million Americans would lose their current plans under Obamacare. Small businesses are cutting back on full-time workers; medium businesses are dumping employees\u2019 spouses and children from their plans; and the largest businesses are eating nine-figure bottom-line increases. Delta Airlines claims that it will spend an extra $100 million on health-care expenses next year: Even with cutbacks on complimentary mini-pretzels, a tenth of a billion is a big sum to recover. Meanwhile, the Obamacare plans won\u2019t recognize your preferred doctor, and major hospitals won\u2019t recognize the Obamacare plans.\n\nMy old comrade David Frum was somewhat insouciant about the extra $2,400 a year he\u2019ll have to find for his new Obama-approved health arrangements. These days, comparatively few Americans are that liquid, and for most an extra $200 a month will have to be clawed away from real things of value.\u00a0\u201cNot only will I pay more,\u201d grumbled Mr. Frum, \u201cbut I have had to divert many otherwise useful hours to futzing around with websites and paperwork.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s life in the Republic of Paperwork, isn\u2019t it? The remorseless diversion of time and energy to \u201cfutzing around.\u201d That\u2019s why so much of American life seems to be seizing up, why so many routine features of human existence require time-consuming bureaucracy-heavy painstaking navigation (to borrow a term from Obamacare\u2019s \u201ccustomer-service representatives\u201d). America would benefit from an opposition party that offered a serious de-futzing of the nation: a platform on the scale of Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s privatization program in 1979 or Sir Roger Douglas\u2019s in New Zealand in the Eighties that offered to make ordinary life comprehensible to non-wonks once more. Instead, the Obama crowd have bet that, after the usual whining, you\u2019ll settle down and get used to it: higher co-pays, higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher mountain of paperwork, higher futzing. But the fact remains that nowhere\u00a0in the Western world has the governmentalization of health care been so incompetently introduced and required protection by such a phalanx of lies. Obamacare is not a left\u2013right issue; it\u2019s a fraud issue.\n\n\u2014\u00a0Mark Steyn, a\u00a0National Review\u00a0columnist, is the author of\u00a0After America: Get Ready for Armageddon. \u00a9 2013 Mark Steyn", "card": "summary", "title": "A Phalanx of Lies, by Mark Steyn, National Review"}, "tweettext": "A Phalanx of Lies", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "A Phalanx of Lies", "keywords": "Mark Steyn", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "A Phalanx of Lies, Mark Steyn, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Mark Steyn, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced2a\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the Obamacare plans won\u2019t recognize your preferred doctor, and major hospitals won\u2019t recognize the Obamacare plans.\n\u2014 Mark Steyn, a National Review columnist, is the author of After America: Get Ready for Armageddon.\nInstead, the Obama crowd have bet that, after the usual whining, you\u2019ll settle down and get used to it: higher co-pays, higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher mountain of paperwork, higher futzing.\nBut, as he put it, \u201cnobody\u2019s madder than me\u201d at this shadowy rogue entity called the \u201cGovernment of the United States\u201d that\u2019s running around pulling all this stuff.\nDear old John Roberts, chief justice of the United States, twisted himself into a pretzel to argue that, in fact, the government does."}
