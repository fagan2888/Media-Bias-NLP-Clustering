West Lauderdale senior Ryan Lane

Twenty Four hours before game one of the 4A state championship eries began, West Lauderdale head coach Jerry Boatner knew what would happen.

"Three great pitchers: Will Stokes, Ryan Lane and Mason Wooldridge, and I just don't believe they [Purvis] are going to be able to hit our pitching," said Boatner

And that's exactly what happened.

In game one of the championship, Stokes struck out nine Purvis batters in a complete game shut-out.

"It [was] going to be nervous pitching for a state championship," said Stokes. "I hadn't pitched on a major league field, but we got through it, so that's good."

After the 3-0 victory, it was Ryan Lane's turn to own the hill in game two. As his teammates struggled to score in the first 2 1/2 innings, Lane was relentless from the first inning to the last.

"I came into this game looking at it as just another game," said Lane. "I did what I knew I could. I threw strikes, tried to get ahead in the count, tried not to get nervous and tried to do what I knew i could do."

Boatner said that in a senior class that holds six future college baseball players, Lane -who signed with MCC in the winter- sometimes got lost in the shuffle.

"Blake Anderson and Will Stokes get a lot of publicity, but we said all along, Ryan Lane is right there with him."

Stokes watched Lane pitch from the shortstop position in game two.

"He did awesome. He always does awesome," said Stokes "I expected nothing less in this game, and he came through."

Next year, Lane will be an Eagle, and Stokes will suit up for Ole Miss, but on that warm night in Trustmark Park, nothing else seemed to matter except celebrating with teammates and living in the moment.
