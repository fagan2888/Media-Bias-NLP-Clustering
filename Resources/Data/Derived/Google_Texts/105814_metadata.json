And that harmonious melding of citizens of all races and colors was breathtaking.\n\nI have attended scores of demonstrations in my three decades as a Paris-based reporter, and never before encountered such huge, and peaceful, shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. No tear gas, no angry demands, no nastinesss of any kind reported. Yet the stakes are higher than anything the French had previously marched for. This time it was for democratic values that include the right to freedom of expression. These are values that the terror attacks by three French citizens, all Islamist radicals, sought to undermine, it is widely agreed \u2014 and force the nation that gave birth to the Enlightenment to go dark.\n\n\u201cJe suis Charlie or \u201cWe are Charlie\u201d or simply \u201cCharlie\u201d was the overriding slogan of the march, a phrase the world has taken up since the Jan. 7 newsroom massacre in the offices of the irreverent, satiric weekly Charlie Hebdo. France lost some of its top cartoonists.\n\nEven police officers, the fearsome silent presence at most demonstrations, where they occasionally move into action with tear gas and clubs, got their reputations dusted. Three were killed in the recent attacks and, with authorities fearing more terror, the citizenry is coming to appreciate their vigilance. The crowd applauded wildly as a line of police vans made its way through one packed boulevard leading to the Place de la Republique, the starting point of the march that some people never left \u2014 and others never reached. \u201cBravo police!\u201d the people cheered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different world today,\u201d said Michel Thebault, among those clapping. At 70, he lived through the student movement of 1968 that shook the foundations of France with street battles between police and protester and general strikes that brought the country to a standstill \u2014 an image that shadows authorities to this day.\n\n\u201cNearly 50 years ago, we were in this spot shouting \u201cCRS-SS,\u201d comparing France\u2019s riot police to Hitler\u2019s SS troops. \u201cToday we\u2019re happy to have police here.\u201d\n\nFrance knows it must be careful. Demonstrations are a national pastime, and a safety valve to air grievances against the government. But they can get unruly, and violent, when the subject is sensitive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "title": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "title": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/11/quarrelsome_french_bond_at_rally_to_protect_nations_values/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/france-attacks-rally.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "title": "Quarrelsome French bond at rally to protect nation\u2019s values", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/france-attacks-rally.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elaine Ganley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3189\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a different world today,\u201d said Michel Thebault, among those clapping.\nThis time it was for democratic values that include the right to freedom of expression.\nYet the stakes are higher than anything the French had previously marched for.\nI have attended scores of demonstrations in my three decades as a Paris-based reporter, and never before encountered such huge, and peaceful, shoulder-to-shoulder crowds.\n\u201cNearly 50 years ago, we were in this spot shouting \u201cCRS-SS,\u201d comparing France\u2019s riot police to Hitler\u2019s SS troops."}
