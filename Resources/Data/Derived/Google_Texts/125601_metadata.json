It\u2019s always poor working people who live on the edges,\u201d she added in a Tuesday telephone interview with The Hill.\n\nTrump has faced intensifying questions in recent days for his role in setting up the now-defunct university, which promised to teach students the secrets of his success in real estate investment.\n\nFormer students have filed lawsuits alleging that Trump University was a sham and that the teachers were unqualified and not hand-picked, as the billionaire had promised.\n\nTrump\u2019s rivals Marco Rubio Marco RubioSenate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill Analysis: Pa. senator missed most Budget Committee hearings Susana Martinez fires back at Trump MORE and Ted Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE have seized on the allegations, describing the GOP front-runner variously as a \u201ccon artist\u201d (Rubio\u2019s phrase) and as someone who takes advantage of working men and women (a line Cruz has been pushing out).\n\nOher Republican aligned super-PACs, American Future Fund and Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Rubio, are homing in on the Trump as \u201cfraud\u201d theme. Millions of dollars are now gushing into Rubio\u2019s super-PAC, sources familiar with the group tell The Hill, and GOP donors are scrambling in a last-ditch effort to destroy Trump\u2019s candidacy, though many worry it is too little and too late to stop the billionaire from securing the nomination.\n\nTrump has denied the university fraud allegations and his lawyers are demanding that the American Future Fund ads be taken down.\n\nPacker, whose group has already spent more than $4 million attacking Trump in early voting states, says she expects there will be more attacks coming along the same lines.\n\nExceeding $1 million, the size of the new buy suggests that Our Principles PAC has received another large influx of cash. Packer won\u2019t discuss donors or total amounts, saying only that new money is \u201ccoming in daily.\u201d\n\nMost of the super-PAC's contributions reported so far came from a single GOP mega-donor, Marlene Ricketts. Trump has already threatened the Ricketts family for coming after him.\n\nAsked whether there have been conversations between the anti-Trump groups, which are now all hitting the billionaire on the same theme, Packer replied, \"Yeah, there\u2019s been conversations among people that are legally permitted to have conversations.\"\n\nSuper-PACs are not legally allowed to coordinate with campaigns, so Packer and the other anti-Trump groups are also taking their cues from the media appearances of Rubio and Cruz, seeing their role as amplification of the candidates' messages attacking Trump.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is all of a sudden talking a lot about Donald Trump as a con man and it\u2019s getting a lot of play in national news coverage,\u201d said Packer, who supports Rubio but says she has received no payments from the Florida senator\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cTo some degree you ride the wave of where the campaign goes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A GOP super-PAC has hired an attack ad guru to take down the front-runner.", "description": "A GOP super-PAC has hired an attack ad guru to take down the front-runner.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A GOP super-PAC has hired an attack ad guru to take down the front-runner.", "title": "Anti-Trump group digs in on 'con man' attack", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/271262-anti-trump-group-digs-in-on-con-man-attack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_021816gn4.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-01T10:02:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-01T10:02-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/271262-anti-trump-group-digs-in-on-con-man-attack", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-01T10:02-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "author": "Jonathan Swan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T10:02:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T10:02:24-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/271262-anti-trump-group-digs-in-on-con-man-attack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A GOP super-PAC has hired an attack ad guru to take down the front-runner.", "card": "summary", "title": "Anti-Trump group digs in on 'con man' attack"}, "dcterms.title": "Anti-Trump group digs in on 'con man' attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42ac\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe McCarthy recruitment was first reported by The Washington Post and was confirmed to The Hill by a source close to the group.\nFormer students have filed lawsuits alleging that Trump University was a sham and that the teachers were unqualified and not hand-picked, as the billionaire had promised.\nTrump has denied the university fraud allegations and his lawyers are demanding that the American Future Fund ads be taken down.\nIt\u2019s always poor working people who live on the edges,\u201d she added in a Tuesday telephone interview with The Hill.\nA new anti-Trump ad, backed by a \u201cseven-figure\u201d national cable buy beginning this week \u2014 which will also include targeted purchases in post-Super Tuesday states including Florida \u2014 is called \u201cScam,\u201d and hits the billionaire for his controversial business venture, Trump University."}
