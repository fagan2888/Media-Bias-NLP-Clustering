The Satanists say their statue would \"complement and contrast\" with a Ten Commandments monument placed at the Capitol in Oklahoma City in 2012.\n\nThe Satanists' proposed monument depicts Baphomet, a goat-headed pagan idol sitting on a 7-foot-tall throne inscribed with an inverted pentagram. In an artist's rendering provided by the Satanic Temple, smiling children look adoringly at the devilish figure.\n\n\"The statue will serve as a beacon calling for compassion and empathy among all living creatures,\" Lucien Greaves, a spokesman for the Satanic Temple, said in a prepared statement. \"The statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.\u201d\n\nAccording to its Indiegogo page, the Satanists have raised more than $16,000 toward their goal of $20,000 for the monument, which Greaves said would \"be a historical marker commemorating the scapegoats, the marginalized, the demonized minority and the unjustly outcast.\u201d\n\nThe Temple of Satan is less a religious body organized around rituals and regular meetings than a roving band of political provocateurs, according to Greaves. They believe Satan is a \"literary construct,\" the spokesman said, not an actual being with horns and hooves.\n\nREAD MORE: Satanists want statue next to Ten Commandments\n\nThe proposed statue includes quotations from poets Lord Byron and William Blake.\n\n\u201cPrisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion\u201d runs the Blake quotation. The 18th-century poet was a Christian, albeit one with a mystical bent and little use for traditional morality.\n\nThe statue's main figure, Baphomet, has long been associated with Satan, Greaves said. In the 12th century, the Knights Templar, a group of Christian crusaders, were accused of worshiping Baphomet in their secretive rituals.\n\n\"From the mythology created by these accusations against the Templars, we now have a symbol for Satan pictured as a goat-headed beast,\" Greaves said.\n\nSince the 1960s, a variation of the horned goat head has been the official symbol of the Church of Satan, which is not affiliated with the Temple of Satan. The head of the Church of Satan has told CNN he does not approve of the idea of a Satanist statue on public grounds.\n\nOklahoma state Rep. Paul Wesselhoft told CNN that he doesn't think the Satanists' statue will be approved.\n\n\u201cWhat will disqualify them has really nothing to do with Satan as such; it's that it has no historical significance for the state of Oklahoma,\u201d he said.\n\nTrait Thompson, chairman of Oklahoma's Capitol Preservation Committee, said he has not received the Satanists' proposed design yet. He also said that no applications will be considered until a lawsuit over the Ten Commandments monument is settled.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has sued over Oklahoma's Ten Commandments monument, calling it an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.\n\nAfter news broke of the Satanists' proposal, the state was flooded with requests from religious groups seeking to erect monuments to their own faith, including Hindus and Pastafarians, a satirical religion that \"worships\" the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nAn Oklahoma lawmaker told CNN that the Satanists' message wouldn't fly in the Bible Belt state, where nearly two-thirds of the population is Christian.\n\n\"Any monument displayed on state property should reflect the values of Oklahoma or memorialize those who built or defended our freedom,\" Rep. Bob Cleveland said Tuesday. \"In my opinion, this Satanist monument does not meet with the values of Oklahomans.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- Satanists have unveiled their design for a proposed statue at the Oklahoma state Capitol, including a place for people to sit on the devil's lap \"for inspiration and contemplation.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Satanists unveil design for OK statehouse statue", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/07/satanists-unveil-design-for-statehouse-statue/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140107084905-01-satanic-statue-0107-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Satanists have unveiled their design for a proposed statue at the Oklahoma state Capitol, including a place for people to sit on the devil's lap \"for inspiration and contemplation.", "title": "Satanists unveil design for OK statehouse statue"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, church and state, satanism, 10 commandments, oklahoma, satanist, satanists, the temple of satan", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/07/satanists-unveil-design-for-statehouse-statue/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1b6\"", "article_summary": "The Satanists' proposed monument depicts Baphomet, a goat-headed pagan idol sitting on a 7-foot-tall throne inscribed with an inverted pentagram.\nREAD MORE: Satanists want statue next to Ten CommandmentsThe proposed statue includes quotations from poets Lord Byron and William Blake.\nTrait Thompson, chairman of Oklahoma's Capitol Preservation Committee, said he has not received the Satanists' proposed design yet.\nOklahoma state Rep.
