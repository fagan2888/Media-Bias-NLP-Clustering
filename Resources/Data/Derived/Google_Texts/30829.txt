Montgomery County, Maryland’s Autism Ambassador will get the opportunity to share his message with the high and mighty this week when he heads to Washington, D.C. Jake Edwards, 13, will be honored as Champions of Change at the White House and on Wednesday, Jake will meet with the Pope.

According to WUSA9:

Jake, who has autism, works with law enforcement to help them understand people who are different. “There are many different forms of autism, if someone doesn’t talk maybe it’s because they can’t. If someone doesn’t look at you, maybe it’s too painful for them,” explained Jake. Jake will meet the Pope on Wednesday to represent the Archdiocese of Washington’s Special Needs Ministry, he says he will talk to the Pope about his blessings, how thankful he is.

Officer Laurie Reyes with the Montgomery County’s Department’s Autism Outreach Program will also be honored at the White House.

Jake’s mom, Jenn Lynn, says this is such an honor for her son and the message he shares.

“We need to learn to accept them, and that’s his main thing. He talks about ‘why can’t everyone be nice?’ why can’t you just be nice?” Lynn told WUSA9.

On Friday, Jake will be in Rutherfordton, N.C. at a crisis intervention workshop to speak to law enforcement officials about his disorder.
