The historic flag, which dates back to the American Revolution, depicts a rattlesnake in a position ready to strike over a yellow background, with the words \"Don't tread on me\" at the bottom.\n\nOFA's bumper sticker, which replaces the rattlesnake with a coiled stethoscope with the words \"Don't tread on my Obamacare\" below, is being mailed to those who have connected with the group through Facebook.\n\nThe OFA promotion is part of a bigger push to boost enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, ahead of the March 31 deadline. Tea party activists have long opposed the health care measure.\n\n\"While OFA is mocking the tea party and American people who proudly fly the Gadsden Flag, they need to realize We The People will not surrender to this administration's attack on our freedom and liberty, through the overhaul of our health care system. Let their little stethoscope sticker supporting Obamacare be a reminder of that,\" Kremer told CNN.\n\n\"OFA is so desperate for a message of any kind, they want to troll off of one of the Tea Party's main symbols. There is an old truism, when you enemy is self destructing, don't get in their way. I think they wanted to provoke a reaction from the Tea Party. But Obamacare and Obama are sinking the Democrats, OFA and the left, I say just stay out of the way and watch them fail,\" Phillips added.\n\n\"I'd like to see some real solutions from the Democrats and the White House, rather than twerking GIFs and ironic bumper stickers,\" added Bodnar.\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) -- So what do some leaders in the tea party think about a group that supports President Barack Obama's agenda using a key symbol of the grassroots conservative movement to advocate for the health care law? \"Imitation is the highest form of flattery and in this case, it is no diff...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Tea party says OFA remake of its symbol is trolling", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/25/tea-party-says-ofa-remake-of-its-symbol-is-trolling/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140325115302-ofa-dont-tread-on-my-obamacare-bumper-sticker-story-top.png", "type": "article", "description": "Washington (CNN) -- So what do some leaders in the tea party think about a group that supports President Barack Obama's agenda using a key symbol of the grassroots conservative movement to advocate for the health care law?\r\n\r\n\"Imitation is the highest form of flattery and in this case, it is no diff...", "title": "Tea party says OFA remake of its symbol is trolling"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "2014, health care, healthcare, obamacare, ofa, organizing for america, tea party, tea party movement, cnn political editor paul steinhauser", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29d3\"", "article_summary": "\"Imitation is the highest form of flattery and in this case, it is no different,\" Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, one of the largest and most politically active national tea party organizations, told CNN.\nI think they wanted to provoke a reaction from the Tea Party.\nTea party activists have long opposed the health care measure.\nFollow @politicaltickerFollow @psteinhausercnn\"I laughed when I saw it,\" said Judson Phillips, founder of the Tea Party Nation, which commands a large following in the movement.\n2 years agoWashington (CNN) - So what do some leaders in the tea party think about a group that supports President Barack Obama's agenda using a key symbol of the grassroots conservative movement to advocate for the health care law?"}
