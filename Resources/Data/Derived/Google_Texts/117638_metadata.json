But the latest company to take hit is based deep in the Rust Belt.\n\nPeoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar singled out weakness in the mining and energy sectors as the main reason for its decision to lay off more than ten thousand workers over the next three years. Michelle Foss is chief energy economist at the University of Texas\u2019 Bureau of Economic Geology, based in Houston.\n\n\u201cEvery new oil and gas well location site, every drill site, to get that site built and ready, Caterpillar equipment will get used in that,\u201d Foss said. \u201cAs well, Caterpillar equipment gets used for site preparation and construction for all of the midstream businesses, meaning pipelines.\u201d\n\nAn oil well in Brazos County\n\nThe economist notes that oil and natural gas aren\u2019t the only commodities taking a hit. Prices for iron ore and other metals, as well as coal, have fallen sharply over the past year due to weak global growth.\n\nCaterpillar will start by cutting up to five thousand managers and salaried workers, in part by offering early retirement. Most of those cuts will take place by year end. The company will also close or consolidate several factories between now and 2018, eliminating at least another five thousand jobs.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/09/26/127135/downturn-in-texas-oil-production-a-factor-in-caterpillar-layoffs/", "site_name": "Houston Public Media", "image": {"url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/26050000/HOME_oil_production_well_in_Brazos_County.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/26050000/HOME_oil_production_well_in_Brazos_County.jpg"}, "type": "article", "title": "Downturn In Texas Oil Production A Factor In Caterpillar Layoffs | Houston Public Media"}, "wordCount": 224, "twitter": {"title": "Downturn In Texas Oil Production A Factor In Caterpillar Layoffs", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/09/26/127135/downturn-in-texas-oil-production-a-factor-in-caterpillar-layoffs/", "image": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/26050000/HOME_oil_production_well_in_Brazos_County.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Schneider", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-09-26T00:00:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "oil and gas", "published_time": "2015-09-26T00:00:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "Business, News, business desk, economy, energy, news, oil and gas", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0285\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery new oil and gas well location site, every drill site, to get that site built and ready, Caterpillar equipment will get used in that,\u201d according to an analyst.\n\u201cEvery new oil and gas well location site, every drill site, to get that site built and ready, Caterpillar equipment will get used in that,\u201d Foss said.\n/ DownloadThe low price of oil has been squeezing manufacturers of durable goods in Texas for months.\nCaterpillar will start by cutting up to five thousand managers and salaried workers, in part by offering early retirement.\nMichelle Foss is chief energy economist at the University of Texas\u2019 Bureau of Economic Geology, based in Houston."}
