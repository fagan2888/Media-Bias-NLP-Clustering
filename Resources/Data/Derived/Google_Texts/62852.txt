How long by carrier pigeon? MT @CoveredCA: It takes less than an hour to enroll in a CoveredCA health plan by phone. Call today: 800-F1UCKYO — Carl Gambolputty (@cdr999) October 18, 2013

@CoveredCA will the navigators freeze up when taking my information too? — Bing (@5OFive) October 18, 2013

And does it really take “less than an hour” to enroll in a Covered California insurance plan? Shorter citizens: You lie!

@CoveredCA this simply is not true. I've tried to enroll over 5 times and it has not worked once! — Matt Geller, O.D. (@MatthewGellerOD) October 18, 2013

@CoveredCA @charlescwcooke try two weeks and counting. — bayareagirl2012 (@bayareagirl2012) October 18, 2013

Well, there’s always the website, right?

@CoveredCA Takes 6 weeks if you try online. — Abe Rosenberg (@AbeRosenberg) October 18, 2013

@CoveredCA Made an account 2 weeks ago, still unable to log in. Stuck at "Logging in. Please wait." page. This getting fixed anytime soon? — Ryan Higgins (@RyanHigginsRyan) October 16, 2013

@CoveredCA The "Sound of Silence" from management on the exchange challenges, like down website, is deafening. What's your PR guy doing? — IMK (@Insuremekevin) October 16, 2013

@CoveredCA – When will we be able to apply for insurance through your site? The Apply link is still inactive/down. — Stig (@stiggreve) October 17, 2013

@CoveredCA I want to connect on the website. — Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) October 18, 2013

Good luck with that. It should work out well as long as you’re prepared to have your eye doctor come at you with some lube and a speculum.

KTLK reports:

The California Medical Association said it found mistakes such as obstetricians labeled as ophthalmologists and the wrong doctors described as fluent in Russian and Farsi, the Los Angeles Times reported. * * * Jef Kurfess of Westlake Village has been shopping for health plans on Covered California for his two adult sons and possibly for his wife. He says he hit snags while searching for local doctors and a nearby hospital. “Getting an incredibly inexpensive plan with no doctors you want to see will be a rude shock for people,” Kurfess told the Times.

But hey, if the online exchange and call center don’t work out for you, there’s always snail mail. Or fax.
