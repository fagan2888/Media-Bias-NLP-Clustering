A woman made her first appearance in court Saturday morning in Tallahassee following the double homicide of her mother and stepfather in Tampa Thursday night.

Nicole Nachtman, 21, is being held without bond.

Thursday night, Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies responded to a multiple "shots fired" call at a home in the Tampa area. When they arrived on scene, deputies found 56-year-old Myriam Dienes and 67-year-old Robert Dienes dead from multiple gunshot wounds.

During the course of the investigation, Nicole Nachtman was identified as a possible suspect.

Friday, Nachtman was located in Tallahassee for questioning. As a result of the investigation, necessary information was obtained to charge Nachtman with two counts of first degree murder with a firearm.

Nachtman is being held in the Leon County Jail. She is expected to be transported back to Tampa in the near future.
