The Newcastle Jets have named defender Kew Jaliens as their new captain for the upcoming A-League season.

The former Netherlands international was a key figure in the club's 2013-14 campaign, his first in Australia, contributing to six clean sheets in 18 appearances.

Jaliens, who previously enjoyed stints with Poland's Wisla Krakow and AZ Alkmaar in the Dutch top flight, said it was a privilege to lead his side.

"Hopefully I can lead by example with my actions both on and off the field and help guide the team to a successful season," the 35-year-old said in a statement on Monday.

Jets coach Phil Stubbins said the experience Jaliens had gained playing at the highest level for both club and country made him a great candidate to skipper the Jets.

"I'm sure Kew will do a fantastic job, along with the other senior players in the group, of leading the squad this coming season," Stubbins added.

Tuesday night's FFA Cup round-of-32 match against Perth Glory at Magic Park in Broadmeadow will be Jaliens' first competitive match as captain.
