I have a lot to learn.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Monroe County GOP urged Moore to step down from the position to which he was elected in 2013 and intends to run for again this fall.\n\nMoore confirmed that three town employees had filed complaints against him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but he declined to offer specifics.\n\nHowever, WHAM-TV reported that the complaints allege Moore bullied one employee who is a lesbian and another with a disability.\n\nThe lesbian employee said Moore told another employee she looks like \u201ca guy\u201d and drove toward her at a town park, only to swerve at the last minute.\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d Moore said, according to the complaint. \u201cSee I\u2019m nice, I missed you.\u201d\n\nThe disabled employee said Moore called him a variety of disparaging names to mock his disability and tried to fight him when he complained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called a slacker, a baby, (and) a woman, as well as being donned with the nickname, \u2018fat tortoise,'\u201d the man said, according to the complaint.\n\nMoore again cited his business experience to shrug off the complaints.\n\n\u201cWhen you apply business standards to government, you have to anticipate some employee discomfort,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch this video report posted online by WHAM-TV:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jack-Moore-WHAM-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Beleaguered NY town official: If I\u2019m a racist bully \u2014 why is my pumpkin patch so successful?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not a racist,\u201d said Moore, owner of Gro-Moore Farms.\nAnother town employee who heard the remarks filed a complaint with the Henrietta Board of Ethics \u2013 which ironically was formed by Moore.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about cousins in the city?\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s one of your cousins,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting up with that,\u201d said Donald Youngman, a black 36-year employee of the town."}
