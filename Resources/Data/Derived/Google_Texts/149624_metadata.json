Aaron Schock (R-IL) has resigned after comparing black people to animals in a series of racist Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cI am extremely disappointed by the inexcusable and offensive online comments made by a member of my staff,\u201d Schock said in a statement to the Peoria Journal Star. \u201cI would expect better from any member of my team. Upon learning about them I met with Mr. Cole and he offered his resignation which I have accepted.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Cole, a former Baptist pastor and energy industry spokesman, compared two black people he saw outside his Washington, D.C., apartment to zoo animals after recording video of their argument.\n\n\u201cSo apparently the closing of the National Zoo has forced the animals to conduct their mating rituals on my street,\u201d he complained in an Oct. 13, 2013, post that was obtained by Think Progress.\n\nThe National Zoo was closed that week as part of the federal government shutdown that Schock helped begin with his vote on a budget measure that would have delayed portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSchock made news earlier this week for his \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-themed office, which Cole admitted to reporters had \u201ccreated a bit of a crisis in the office.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Cole, who serves as the lawmaker\u2019s senior advisor for policy and communications, posted two video clips of the couple\u2019s argument, along with the hashtag #gentrifytoday.\n\nHe also claimed Dec. 13, 2013, that he watched \u201cone of the hood rats on my street get shot by another hood rat.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent post, Cole complained Jan. 29 that a black police officer told him \u201cyou white people need to learn\u201d when he reported an assault by another black woman.\n\nAll of the posts, which were captured in screen shots, were deleted by Wednesday, and neither Cole nor Schock\u2019s chief of staff responded to requests seeking comment.\n\nUpdate: Cole resigned Thursday afternoon.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Updated with Cole\u2019s resignation.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Benjamin-Cole-Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Top aide to GOP lawmaker deletes Facebook posts comparing black people to zoo animals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Benjamin Cole (Facebook)A top advisor to Rep.
