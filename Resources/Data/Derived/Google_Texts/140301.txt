Lawrence O'Donnell, Ed Schultz, Ezra Klein and Juan Williams reportedly met with President Obama at the White House on Thursday.

Fox News' Ed Henry tweeted earlier in the day,

MSNBC hosts relocated to West Wing today; @WeGotEd @Lawrence @ezraklein arrived for apparent meet w/President (Fox's @TheJuanWilliams too) — Ed Henry (@edhenryTV) November 21, 2013

Huffington Post Editorial Director Howard Fineman was also there.

After the meeting, Williams appeared on Fox News and discussed the "frustration" over the botched Obamacare rollout among Obama staffers, and the administration's attempt to change the narrative about the legislation.

"I met with other senior officials at the White House, I can tell you they are in full fight mode over the Affordable Healthcare Act right now," he said. “What you hear from these senior officials is they’re concerned about what happened with insurance companies; they wish the insurance companies hadn’t sent out the cancellation notices; and if they had, that they had simply call them renewals. They feel as if they had a major systems failure, a major management failure, and they’re trying to get back on track."

It is not the first time that Obama has met with MSNBC hosts at the White House. Last December, he met with Maddow, Al Sharpton, Lawrence O'Donnell and Ed Schultz (Huffington Post editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington was also in the 2012 meeting).



This time around, the White House has been embroiled in controversy over Obamacare. The introduction of the health care program has been plagued by healthcare.gov glitches and insurance policy cancellations.
