I worry that it\u2019s going to derail the over-the-counter movement.\u201d\n\nBut supporters of over-the-counter contraceptives acknowledge that getting Food and Drug Administration approval could take a long time because the agency often requires additional studies.\n\nCost is another possible drawback of over-the-counter sales. The Affordable Care Act does not explicitly require plans to cover over-the-counter medications, so women might wind up paying hundreds of dollars a year for over-the-counter birth control instead of obtaining it free with a prescription.\n\nPhoto\n\nA bill introduced in Congress in May by Republican senators would help expedite the process in which contraceptive manufacturers apply to the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter approval, but some Democrats and women\u2019s groups say it might ultimately reduce birth control use because it does not specify insurance coverage for over-the-counter methods. In response, Democrats have introduced a bill stipulating that contraceptives would remain covered if they were to become available without a prescription.\n\nIn the absence of federal action, states are stepping in.\n\nJill Vincik, a high school teacher who recently moved to Bend, Ore., said that being able to get her birth control pills without a doctor\u2019s appointment would make her life easier.\n\n\u201cI would certainly take advantage of it,\u201d said Ms. Vincik, 37, a single mother, who noted that she had a gynecological exam before moving and had not yet found a gynecologist in Oregon. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be in a position to have to go to a doctor when my pills run out. I\u2019m not going to do another Pap smear; I just did one.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of this approach, including pharmacists\u2019 organizations, plan to lobby for it across the country. \u201cWe are actively going to come up with a statute to spread to other states, and I think it can spread pretty quickly,\u201d said Mr. Buehler, the Oregon legislator, who is also an orthopedist. Pharmacy board representatives from states including Arizona and Idaho observed a recent meeting in Oregon about the new rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA New Mexico proposal that failed in 2012 is expected to be revised to reflect the Oregon and California measures, said Dale Tinker, the executive director of the New Mexico Pharmacists Association. Raley\u2019s, a grocery store and pharmacy chain with 80 stores in Northern California and 16 in Nevada, is urging Nevada to follow California\u2019s lead, said Lee Worthy, the chain\u2019s vice president for pharmacy and wellness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of the barriers away from that underserved community that we see surrounding every store,\u201d Mr. Worthy said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany reproductive health experts have come to support pharmacist-prescribed contraceptives, persuaded that pharmacists can safely dispense contraception without a doctor\u2019s prescription and that women can assess their health risks on questionnaires.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of evidence that there isn\u2019t a safety concern,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThere are studies showing that women can really accurately identify the conditions that make it appropriate to use certain contraceptives, using a simple checklist.\u201d\n\nSome people have argued that a need for contraception brings women to the doctor, ensuring that they get other important screening tests, like Pap smears to detect cervical cancer. But Dr. Nancy Stanwood, an obstetrician and chairwoman of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said a study of Texas women who received over-the-counter contraceptives in Mexico had found that many still visited doctors for Pap smears. And she noted that Pap smears were now recommended every three years, not annually, and not until women turn 21.\n\n\u201cWe were holding pregnancy prevention hostage to cancer screening,\u201d Dr. Stanwood said. \u201cThey\u2019re both worthwhile goals, but one should not be held hostage to the other.\u201d\n\nThe new laws are extensions of arrangements now found in almost every state: collaborative practice laws that allow pharmacists to administer vaccines or prescribe certain medications if they have agreements with physicians or other health providers. The laws vary widely, and some include only specific diseases or drugs. But in some places, like Washington State and Washington, D.C., collaborative practice laws are broad enough for pharmacists to prescribe birth control if their physician agreements permit it.\n\nIn Seattle, Beverly Schaefer, a co-owner of Katterman\u2019s Sand Point Pharmacy, has a physician\u2019s permission to prescribe various medications, including antibiotics and antihistamines. She charges a $35 fee, and will prescribe hormonal contraceptives for women who say they have previously been prescribed them.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, those customers have typically been college students who \u201chaven\u2019t planned ahead and are like, \u2018Oh, my god, I don\u2019t have any contraceptives,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI also see it in some ways as being more comfortable for women because it is a less clinical environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut arrangements like this have been sporadic, experts say, because arranging physician agreements can be time-consuming, and women often do not know which pharmacies have them.\n\nOne unanswered question, however, is whether insurers will pay for the time pharmacists spend reviewing women\u2019s questionnaires or helping evaluate options. To cover that cost, some pharmacists may charge fees of $25 or more, which could be an obstacle for some women.\n\nThe laws in Oregon and California differ in some ways. California\u2019s has no age restriction; the Oregon law requires that teenagers under 18 obtain their first contraceptive prescription from a doctor. In California, pharmacists will also most likely have to take women\u2019s blood pressure for contraceptives containing estrogen.\n\nDr. Stanwood of Physicians for Reproductive Health described these states as \u201cincubators, which may end up being a model at the national level.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cWe need to think outside of that old-fashioned box that just doesn\u2019t apply to women\u2019s lives now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151122061815, "twitter": {"description": "Starting sometime in the next few months, California and Oregon will allow
