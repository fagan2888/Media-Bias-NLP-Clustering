Patel, who operated the Outpatient Services for Women business.\n\nAccording to the attorney general, undercover agents from the Oklahoma Medical Licensure Board, the Oklahoma City Police Department and the attorney general\u2019s office set up appointments with Patel in which the doctor performed ultrasounds and pregnancy tests on the women.\n\nThe doctor is alleged to have fraudulently identified each undercover agent as pregnant. He then prescribed them an abortion-inducing drug, provided directions for administering it and \u201ccharged the female agents for the unnecessary treatment,\u201d the statement explained.\n\n\u201cThis type of fraudulent activity and blatant disregard for the health and well-being of Oklahoma women will not be tolerated,\u201d said Pruitt. \u201cOklahoma women should be able to trust that the advice they receive from their physicians is truthful, accurate and does not jeopardize their health.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general called the investigation \u201ca textbook demonstration of inter-agency cooperation to protect Oklahomans and prosecute the worst offenders.\u201d\n\nPatel could get up to three years in jail and a fine of $15,000, officials said.\n\nThe investigation was prompted by \u201ca complaint that he had performed an abortion procedure on Pamela King, even though she was not pregnant,\u201d the AG\u2019s report said.\n\nKing was diagnosed and died from complications of cervical cancer, and her autopsy determined she had not been pregnant in the time frame that the abortion occurred, the statement said.\n\nThe pro-life group Operation Rescue, which had filed complaints against Patel and had released a special report on his actions, said its concerns had been raised \u201cafter receiving incriminating information about Patel and his abortion business from an informant.\u201d\n\nStaff answering the phone at Patel\u2019s abortion business Tuesday said no one was available to take calls.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this morning\u2019s arrest,\u201d said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, who has worked with associate Cheryl Sullenger on a strategy for closing down abortion businesses, which is outlined in \u201cAbortion Free: Your manual for building a Pro-Life America one Community at a time,\u201d published by WND Books.\n\nOrder \u201cAbortion Free\u201d right away and start following the guidelines on how to make your community truly respectful of life.\n\nIn their book, Newman and Sullenger discuss making communities \u201cabortion free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have found that abortion clinics can close and lives can be saved by working strategically at the state and local level despite what the political climate might be,\u201d Newman said. \u201cWe know our ideas work because of the successes we have witnessed while employing the same tactics we share in \u2018Abortion Free.'\u201d\n\nFor example, they share how they closed abortion clinics, starting with 18 in San Diego County in the 1990s, and how they brought an end to George Tiller\u2019s huge, late-term, abortion work in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThey also found they could get abortionists\u2019 licenses revoked simply by filling out a form and discovered that records of abortion deaths helped shutter abortion businesses.\n\n\u201cAbortion Free\u201d details how to employ specific tactics, such as:\n\nDiscovering and documenting abortion abuses.\n\nUsing public records requests to obtain information the abortion cartel is hiding.\n\nFiling official complaints that can put abortionists out of business.\n\nGetting your message past the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d in the mainstream media.\n\nUsing your research as the basis for new laws that will shutter abortion clinics permanently.\n\nNewman said his organization is pleased with Patel\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cThis is the result of a collaborative effort that involved gritty pro-life work, active enforcement of state laws,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to especially thank AUL for their contributions to efforts to bring Patel to justice.\u201d\n\nOperation Rescue\u2019s extensive investigation report about Patel cited a number of complaints and allegations, including the dumping of dozens of unborn babies\u2019 bodies in a field.\n\nThe report earlier this year said the organization\u2019s own complaint to Oklahoma state officials about Patel alleged record-keeping violations, reporting violations, improper disposal of medical waste, and failure to observe 24-hour voluntary and informed consent requirements.\n\n\u201cPatel is an abortionist with a long and particularly horrific history of Medical Board disciplinary actions, malpractice claims and criminal cases,\u201d the report said, even while accumulating a net worth \u201clisted at $28 million.\u201d\n\nFor example, the report said Patel was disciplined in 1990 for \u201cfailing to maintain dispensing records for dangerous drugs and keep complete and accurate records of purchase and dispensing of controlled drugs.\u201d\n\nHe was reprimanded in Ohio in 1992.\n\nIn 1993, he admitted he dumped the remains of nearly 60 babies that had been aborted at his clinic in a field near Shawnee, Oklahoma.\n\nOR said he had attempted to burn them but only the plastic bags around the remains caught on fire. The bodies were discovered by two passers-by.\n\n\u201cPatel\u2019s excuse that he could not find a service to take away the remains lacked credibility,\u201d the OR report said.\n\nThe report also cited allegations of sexual battery and \u201cforcible oral sodomy.\u201d\n\nThe report said in 2003, an employee got a protective order against Patel, and there have been several malpractices cases filed against him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "An abortionist in Oklahoma City has been arrested and accused of falsely diagnosing undercover investigators as pregnant, prescribing abortion drugs for them and charging for his services, authorities report.
