Many Americans are really struggling to understand the shifting landscape of the U.S. health care system. Millions don’t know or don’t understand basic components of their health insurance, which may be a factor in the high number who avoid seeing a physician because they think they won’t be able to afford the care.

These were among the results of a Harris poll of more than 2,000 adults in the U.S., 1,872 of whom had health insurance at the time of the survey. The survey was commissioned by SCIO Health Analytics.
