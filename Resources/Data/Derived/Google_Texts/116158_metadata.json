They looked loose and energetic as they went through their normal Saturday morning routine.\n\nAnd when it was over, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll had no doubt his team is ready to start the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how we are. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s loose, but we\u2019re where we\u2019re supposed to be. This is how we always prepare. This is the exact routine we always do. And the guys did it perfectly today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great. We have no hesitation saying it\u2019s been exactly what we hoped to get done. We\u2019re physically right and mentally right and we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe day for the NFC champs began inside the Super Bowl stadium at around 10:30 a.m. when the players and coaches got a quick look at what normally is the New York Giants\u2019 locker room \u2014 though it now has a Seahawks logo above the door. From there they took to the field which was ringed by blue and yellow Super Bowl XLVIII banners. For about 15 minutes, players walked around on the turf and many took pictures and video of the empty stadium. Several position groups got together for group photos, too.\n\nAfter huddling briefly at the 35-yard line, they exited the stadium and boarded their buses for the short ride across the parking lot to the Quest Diagnostics Center where they\u2019ve been practicing all week. They held some more meetings, then went to the field house for their official team picture, which included Seahawks owner Paul Allen. Then, at 1:10 p.m. they were back out there again for a 35-minute walk-through.\n\nFor the rest of Saturday and Saturday night, Carroll said he will keep the Seahawks\u2019 routine \u201cexactly the same.\u201d They even plan to remain at the same Jersey City hotel that they\u2019ve been using all week long.\n\nHow loose were they during their final practice of the season? Early in the session, Carroll came over to the sidelines to greet former Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander and a friend. The coach made sure to talk to them while standing right behind his punter as they lined up for a kick. And when the ball was snapped, the punter, Carroll and Alexander all got out of the way so the ball landed right in the gut of the unsuspecting friend.\n\nThat prank got a good laugh out of everyone before the Seahawks went back to work.\n\nAlexander was joined on the sidelines by former Seahawks linebacker Isaiah Kacyvenski. Both were members of the 2005 Seahawks team that played in Super Bowl XL \u2014 the franchise\u2019s only other Super Bowl team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great to see Shaun and those guys,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have them around. It just kind of reminds us what we represent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Seahawks looking loose, energetic at final practice before Super Bowl", "title": "Seahawks looking loose, energetic at final practice before Super Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/seahawks-looking-loose-energetic-at-final-practice-before-super-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201_033555_seahawks.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201_033555_seahawks.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T15:22:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:21:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd76\"", "article_summary": "Both were members of the 2005 Seahawks team that played in Super Bowl XL \u2014 the franchise\u2019s only other Super Bowl team.\nFrom there they took to the field which was ringed by blue and yellow Super Bowl XLVIII banners.\nThat prank got a good laugh out of everyone before the Seahawks went back to work.\nAnd when it was over, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll had no doubt his team is ready to start the game.\nThey looked loose and energetic as they went through their normal Saturday morning routine."}
