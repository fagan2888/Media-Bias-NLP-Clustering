(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that the official implementation of the landmark deal reached between Tehran and six world powers has satisfied all parties except radical extremists.\n\nSpeaking before the parliament in comments broadcast live on state television, Rouhani said, \u201cIn (implementing) the deal, all are happy except Zionists, warmongers, sowers of discord among Islamic nations and extremists in the U.S. The rest are happy.\u201d\n\nRouhani said the deal has \u201copened new windows for engagement with the world.\u201d\n\nA strong supporter of the agreement, Rouhani sent out a celebratory tweet calling it a \u201cglorious victory\u201d late Saturday night while the speeches in Vienna were still taking place.\n\nRouhani also said the deal was a win for all negotiating parties and all factions inside Iran. \u201cNobody has been defeated in the deal neither inside the country nor the countries that were negotiating with us,\u201d he said, referring to the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany.\n\nRouhani said Iran should use the expected influx of money and investments to spark the \u201ceconomic mutation\u201d of the country, creating jobs and enhancing quality-of-life for Iranian citizens. Iran has been suffering double-digit inflation and unemployment rates for years.\n\nHe also said Iran now needs political tranquility to best benefit from the new economic reality. \u201cAll should prevent any domestic and foreign trivialities that thwart us,\u201d he said. \u201cAny irrelevant and diverting dispute is against national expedience.\u201d\n\nRouhani said his country needs up to $50 billion in foreign investment per year to reach its goal of eight-percent annual growth.\n\nFor Iran, long out in the economic cold over its contested atomic program, implementing the nuclear deal will be a welcome thaw.\n\nMore than $30 billion in assets overseas will become immediately available to the Islamic Republic. Official Iranian reports have set the total amount of frozen Iranian assets overseas at $100 billion.\n\nA European oil embargo on Iran will end. Already, some 38 million barrels of oil are in Iran\u2019s floating reserves, ready to enter the market, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nCelebrations in Tehran were relatively muted at first, because the Vienna implementation announcement came well after midnight. But on Sunday, many Tehran residents expressed optimism about Iran\u2019s future economic prospects.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable! This is a day without sanction after years,\u201d said taxi driver Reza Khoei. \u201cI lost my technical job in a petrochemical complex in south of Iran because of the damn sanctions.\u201d\n\nFahimeh Lotfi, a housewife and mother of two, said, \u201cI am very happy. Now we are like other countries. No more will we to go to bed every night while worrying about the worsening situation. Bravo Rouhani!\u201d\n\nHassan Dehghani, a 26-year-old street sweeper, said \u201cI hope this helps the municipality to pay my salary on time. Sometimes they pay us with months of delay.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone was enthused about the agreement, which limits Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The deal is designed with so-called \u201csnap-back\u201d elements that can quickly restore sanctions if Iran is judged to be in violation of its obligations.\n\nTehran resident Hossein Barati angrily asked, \u201cIf America restores the sanctions, can Iran restore its nuclear program? No it can\u2019t! They dismantled all the centrifuges. How many years will it take Iran to restore its program?\u201d\n\nTehran newspapers largely welcomed the implementation of the deal.\n\nThe state-owned IRAN daily wrote on its front-page, \u201cThe collapse of sanctions.\u201d The pro-reform Shargh daily, allocated part of its front page to pictures of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini with the headline: \u201cNow, without sanctions.\u201d\n\nEven the hard-line Kayhan daily remained impartial and said, \u201cIt is the time of implementation of promises,\u201d by the West.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/18/iranian-president-celebrates-nuke-deal-all-are-happy-except-zionists-warmongers-extremists-in-u-s/", "article_author_name": "CNS News", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mideast-Iran-Nuclear_Jank.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "deal, Hassan Rouhani, iran, nuclear, nuke, president, warmongers, zionists"}, "description": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday that the official implementation of the landmark deal reached between Tehran and six world powers has satisfied all", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mideast-Iran-Nuclear_Jank.jpg"}, "keywords": "hassan rouhani,iran,president,nuke,nuclear,deal,warmongers,zionists", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Iranian President celebrates nuke deal: \u2018All are happy except Zionists, warmongers \u2026 extremists in U.S.\u2019Printed from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/18/iranian-president-celebrates-nuke-deal-all-are-happy-except-zionists-warmongers-extremists-in-u-s/Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, center, is surrounded by lawmakers as he leaves the parliament after presenting draft of the country's next year budget and sixth development plan in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016.\nHow many years will it take Iran to restore its program?\u201dTehran newspapers largely welcomed the implementation of the deal.\nRouhani also said the deal was a win for all negotiating parties and all factions inside Iran.\nSpeaking before the parliament in comments broadcast live on state television, Rouhani said, \u201cIn (implementing) the deal, all are happy except Zionists, warmongers, sowers of discord among Islamic nations and extremists in the U.S.\nOfficial Iranian reports have set the total amount of frozen Iranian assets overseas at $100 billion."}
