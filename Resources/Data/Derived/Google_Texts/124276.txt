(CNSNews.com) – The latest Gallup poll shows that a majority of Americans, 51%, still opposes the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and only 41% approve of the health care law.

At the same time, 19% say the law is hurting their family and, in the long run, 37% say Obamacare will make their health care situation “worse.”

The telephone survey of 1,017 adults, 18 and older, was conducted Jan. 31-Feb.1. The results show “that even though many provisions of the law are now in effect, Americans’ views of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ‘Obamacare,’ still tilt negative,” said Gallup.

The poll asked, “Do you generally approve or disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Cae Act, signed into law by President Obama that restructured the U.S. healthcare system?” Fifty-one percent of Americans said they “disapprove” and 41% said they “approve.”

In addition, 64% said Obamacare has had no effect on them and 19% said it was hurting them and their family. Only 13% said the law was helping them.

When asked, “In the long run, how do you think the healthcare law will affect your family’s healthcare situation?” 37% said would “make things worse” while only 24% said it would “make things better.” Another 34% said the law would “not make much difference” in their lives.

“Even if the Affordable Care Act fulfills its purpose of improving the overall health of the nation by expanding individuals' access to insurance, public opinion of the law itself remains sickly,” said Gallup in its analysis. “Americans' disapproval of the law has declined slightly since its peak late last year during the flawed rollout of the federal health exchange website, but a majority still disapprove of the law, and few believe it will make their current or future healthcare situation better.”
