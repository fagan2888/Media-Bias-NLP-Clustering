The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino is urging parishioners without health insurance to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

A letter Bishop Gerald Barnes wrote on the topic is to be read during all Masses this weekend at the 91 parishes in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

The bishopâs message comes days after Catholic organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the lawâs requirement that insurance policies have birth-control coverage. Dozens of businesses and other religious groups have filed similar suits.

Barnes is worried that the Catholic Churchâs vocal opposition to the parts of the law that deal with coverage of contraception and abortion services led some Catholics to believe the church opposes the entire Affordable Care Act, said John Andrews, a spokesman for the diocese, which covers Riverside and San Bernardino counties and 1.6 million Catholics.

âThese factors do not mean that we, as Catholics, should disobey the new health care law,â Barnes said in the letter. âIf we happen to have an insurance plan that includes services that are objectionable to our faith, which most plans in California do, our response is to not utilize these services. We do this through an informed conscience and reflection on the teachings of our Church about the value and dignity of every human life and Godâs plan for creation.â

Barnes is very concerned that many without health insurance â" especially Latinos â" are not signing up for Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Andrews said.

âThis is an opportunity for a lot of families who havenât had health insurance before to get it, and the church is all for that,â Andrews said.

The deadline to sign up for coverage for this year is March 31.

At least one other Catholic diocese in California, Fresno, has sent parishes materials on Obamacare enrollment and clarifications of the churchâs position on health-care coverage, said Steve Pehanich, director of advocacy for the California Catholic Conference, which represents the stateâs 12 dioceses. Pehanich said heâs not aware of another California bishop who has had the message delivered during Mass.

Catholic leaders have conflicting views about the Affordable Care Act, which aims to provide health-care coverage â" much of it government-subsidized â" to millions of uninsured Americans.

The church has long supported access to medical care as a human right and a matter of basic dignity. But the church also teaches that contraception and abortion are sins.

The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance policies cover contraception, including intrauterine devices and the âmorning-after pill,â which some people view as akin to abortion because it can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.

There are some accommodations and exemptions for religious organizations, but the church contends they arenât broad enough.

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled March 25 to hear two lawsuits challenging the birth-control coverage mandate. Both were filed by businesses whose owners â" evangelical Christians in one case, Mennonites in another â" have religious objections.

The Affordable Care Act does not mandate coverage of abortion. But in about half the states, women can pay out of their own pockets for abortion coverage under insurance plans they buy on government insurance marketplaces.
