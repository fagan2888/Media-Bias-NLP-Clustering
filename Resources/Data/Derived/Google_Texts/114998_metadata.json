Can Lindsey Graham avoid a runoff?\n\nOn Saturday night, the two-term senator shared the stage with all of his primary opponents. Amid every charge that he supported \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants and was acting as a Democrat in disguise on key issues, it would have been easy for Graham to get dragged into the mud.\n\nBut he steered clear of the traps and remained above the fray, as he has done throughout the campaign, making a case that he is far and away the safest bet if Republicans want to keep his seat in November.\n\n\u201cWe have given away four seats over the last four years because we nominated people who couldn\u2019t withstand scrutiny,\u201d Graham said, according to The State. \u201cI\u2019ll beat the Democratic candidate\u2019s brains out.\n\nThat vivid promise appears to have resonated with GOP primary voters.\n\nAccording to a Clemson Palmetto poll released late last month, the incumbent was at 49 percent, with his nearest competition -- state Sen. Lee Bright -- not even breaking single digits, with only 9 percent of the vote.\n\nAn informal survey of South Carolina politicos on Monday revealed a consensus that Graham has sustained his momentum down the home stretch and most likely will avoid a runoff.\n\n\u201cThe turnout is going to be low, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that he\u2019ll get to 50 percent,\u201d predicted one South Carolina-based Republican operative.\n\n2. If he doesn\u2019t top 50 percent, who finishes second?\n\nIf Graham does end up below that threshold and is forced into a June 24 one-on-one contest, don\u2019t expect a repeat of what has happened in Mississippi, where incumbent Republican Sen. Thad Cochran is on the ropes against his runoff opponent, Chris McDaniel.\n\nTea Party-backed groups have not been nearly as active in South Carolina in trying to take out Graham as they have been in Mississippi, and it is difficult to imagine any of his largely unknown and severely underfunded challengers catching fire in just two weeks.\n\nBut in the event that Graham does not reach the magic number, the identity of his opponent will be key to determining the tone the runoff campaign takes.\n\nBright is a libertarian-leaning firebrand, who cited Patrick Henry\u2019s famous \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d quotation in announcing his candidacy. Among the most conservative and outspoken legislators in the state, he once introduced legislation to study the prospect of a South Carolina-specific currency and sponsored a separate bill to nullify Obamacare in the state.\n\nIf Bright gets into a runoff, he would no doubt gain some additional attention for his hardline views, but it is unlikely to make a difference in the ultimate outcome.\n\n\u201cThis is a red state, sure,\u201d said South Carolina Republican consultant Chip Felkel. \u201cBut most reasonable people know that Graham is conservative, maybe not as far right as the wackadoodles, but pretty darn conservative.\u201d\n\n3. Who will gain an early edge to succeed Gov. Nikki Haley in 2018?\n\nLieutenant governor\u2019s races don\u2019t typically generate much interest, but there is good reason to pay attention in the Republican contest to become South Carolina\u2019s next second-in-command.\n\nThis election will be the last time voters in the state elect their governor and lieutenant governor separately. Beginning in 2018, each gubernatorial candidate will select his or her running mate.\n\nWith Gov. Nikki Haley favored to win re-election but term-limited from running again in four years, whoever wins the lieutenant governor\u2019s race will have an early leg up on securing the state\u2019s top office in 2018.\n\nOf the four GOP contenders for that post in this heavily Republican state, former state Attorney General Henry McMaster enjoys significant name recognition, while Mike Campbell -- the son of popular former Gov. Carroll Campbell -- is also well known.\n\nBusinessman Pat McKinney is another strong contender, and there appears to be a significant possibility that the contest will result in a runoff. The winner will face off against Democratic Rep. Bakari Sellers -- a young up-and-comer -- in November.\n\n4. Will There Be an Atwater revival?\n\nEight Republicans are running for South Carolina education superintendent, but only one of them has a last name that requires no introduction in the state.\n\nSally Atwater -- the widow of legendary South Carolina Republican operative Lee Atwater, who managed George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign and helped pioneer the cutthroat style of campaigning for which the state is known -- is a special education teacher with experience in George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nOne of Atwater\u2019s strongest challengers is Meka Childs, who was an education adviser to former Gov. Mark Sanford and has received the endorsement of Sanford\u2019s ex-wife, Jenny.\n\nChilds and Sen. Tim Scott -- who was appointed by Haley in 2013 after Jim DeMint resigned -- both hope to become the first African-American to be elected to statewide office in South Carolina since Reconstruction.\n\nScott is likely to win his race in November to serve out the final two years of DeMint\u2019s term.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It wasn't supposed to be this easy for Lindsey Graham. \nAfter championing a bipartisan compromise on immigration reform last year, the senior South Carolina senator and occasional usurper of...", "title": "What to Watch for in the South Carolina Primary | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/06/10/what_to_watch_for_in_the_south_carolina_primary_122915.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/244535_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It wasn't supposed to be this easy for Lindsey Graham. \nAfter championing a bipartisan compromise on immigration reform last year, the senior South Carolina senator and occasional usurper of...", "title": "What to Watch for in the South Carolina Primary | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "What to Watch for in the South Carolina Primary | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Lindsey Graham,Election 2014,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe47b7\"", "article_summary": "Sally Atwater -- the widow of legendary South Carolina Republican operative Lee Atwater, who managed George H.W.\n\u201cThis is a red state, sure,\u201d said South Carolina Republican consultant Chip Felkel.\nEight Republicans are running for South Carolina education superintendent, but only one of them has a last name that requires no introduction in the state.\nAfter championing a bipartisan compromise on immigration reform last year, the senior South Carolina senator and occasional usurper of conservative orthodoxy appeared to have guaranteed himself a spirited GOP primary challenge in his bid for a third term.\nGraham may be in a commanding position heading into Primary Day, but there is still reason to pay attention as the votes are tabulated in South Carolina, a state whose politics are sometimes unpredictable and often compelling."}
