Tonight is the booziest award show of the year aka The Golden Globes. If you're watching, you should be drinking too! And if you really want to feel like a star, don't eat anything beforehand.

Stars, they're just like us! They get s--tfaced!

Take A Sip:

Every time Tina Fey and Amy Poehler mention drinking.

Every time someone namedrops Oprah.

Every time a winner uses a piece of paper to remember who to thank in their acceptance speech.

Every time the camera pans to Taylor Swift .

Take Two Sips:

Every time someone makes a joke about Amy Poehler losing.

Every time there is a political joke or commentary (Obamacare, Chris Christie, etc. etc.)

If anyone mentions Amy Adams' boobs in American Hustle.
