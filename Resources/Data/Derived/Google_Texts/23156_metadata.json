That means Republicans could overpower Democrats who still have the votes to filibuster.\n\nThe measure would still require Mr. Obama\u2019s signature, however, and he is not about to scrap his signature achievement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to sign anything, frankly,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, told the Hugh Hewitt Show late in the week, referring to a less ambitious effort to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax.\n\nDemocratic majorities used reconciliation to polish off Obamacare in 2010 after the election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts ruined their filibusterproof majority.\n\nToday\u2019s GOP leaders want to turn the tables by using Congress\u2018 first unified budget in six years to show they are serious about scrapping the health law ahead of its 2016 push to retake the White House.\n\nCommittee chairmen from both chambers must report their ideas by July 24, leaving a three-to-four-week window for them to address the potential fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell, which is due by the end of this month.\n\nJustices are deciding whether the IRS has unlawfully paid Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to customers in 34 states that declined to set up their own health exchanges.\n\nRepublicans hope to use the ruling as a bridge to 2017, when a GOP president and majorities in Congress would let them repeal and replace the health overhaul.\n\nCongressional Republicans say their use of reconciliation will largely be dictated by whether the justices strike down the subsidies.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian will permit the GOP\u2019s attempt at full Obamacare repeal, as reconciliation provisions must fit into strict budget rules. Most notably, a rule named for former Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd prohibits senators from including extraneous measures that distract from reconciliation\u2019s goal of deficit reduction.\n\nGOP aides said they haven\u2019t given up on full repeal, although they\u2019ve acknowledged that the Byrd rule does place limits on what they can do.\n\n\u201cThings would be easier for them if the [Congressional Budget Office] found a straight repeal reduces the deficit,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nSome Republicans disliked the way former CBO chief Douglas Elmendorf \u2014 who they ushered out the door in February \u2014 evaluated President Obama\u2019s health law, showing that once all the tax hikes were included, the legislation would reduce the deficit over the 10-year period that governs congressional laws.\n\nThe CRFB, meanwhile, has said it is disappointed the GOP majority decided to use reconciliation for Obamacare repeal, which faces a certain veto, instead of pushing for entitlement reform or other vehicles to reduce the debt.\n\nCongressional Democrats also have criticized the GOP\u2019s plans as weak and unnecessary, pointing to 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage under Obamacare. They also say there is no need to forge a backup plan for the King decision, arguing Congress never intended to treat the states differently and that the justices will see it the same way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top GOP lawmakers in Congress have given themselves seven weeks to turn a powerful, if limited and unwieldy, budget tool into a long-sought bill to repeal Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Top GOP lawmakers in Congress have given themselves seven weeks to turn a powerful, if limited and unwieldy, budget tool into a long-sought bill to repeal Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare repeal deadline set by GOP", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/obamacare-repeal-deadline-set-by-gop/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/mcconnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/mcconnell.jpg", "description": "Top GOP lawmakers in Congress have given themselves seven weeks to turn a powerful, if limited and unwieldy, budget tool into a long-sought bill to repeal Obamacare.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare repeal deadline set by GOP"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican Party, Congress, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96b4\"", "article_summary": "Top GOP lawmakers in Congress have given themselves seven weeks to turn a powerful, if limited and unwieldy, budget tool into a long-sought bill to repeal Obamacare.\nThe CRFB, meanwhile, has said it is disappointed the GOP majority decided to use reconciliation for Obamacare repeal, which faces a certain veto, instead of pushing for entitlement reform or other vehicles to reduce the debt.\nEither way, it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian will permit the GOP\u2019s attempt at full Obamacare repeal, as reconciliation provisions must fit into strict budget rules.\nRepublicans hope to use the ruling as a bridge to 2017, when a GOP president and majorities in Congress would let them repeal and replace the health overhaul.\nGOP aides said they haven\u2019t given up on full repeal, although they\u2019ve acknowledged that the Byrd rule does place limits on what they can do."}
