Israel's Arabs have nothing like the violence in the ghettos of American cities.\n\nAn overall measure of life quality is life expectancy. According to government statistics, the life expectancy of Israeli Arabs is lower than that of Israeli Jews, but equivalent to that of White Americans, and substantially longer than that of African Americans.\n\nPolitics can be nasty here, but if our standard of comparison is the politeness associated with the current US presidential campaign, and the expectations expressed by lots of Americans, then Bibi's new government and the comments about it are models of moderation.\n\nWashington Post-ABC poll finds that nearly 60 percent of Americans have unfavorable views about both poll finds that nearly 60 percent of Americans have unfavorable views about both candidates\n\nIt must be the decade's greatest political puzzle as to how a country of 320 million could fail to produce anyone substantially younger than 70, or anyone more desirable than those two candidates leading the competition for the world's most powerful office.\n\nAmerican meanness isn't all that new. Watergate set a high standard of political shenanigans, deception, and harsh criticism. Earlier were the accusations that Republicans leveled against Democrats for curtailing individual freedom with Social Security and other reforms associated with the New Deal.\n\nMy recollection of history as taught in Fall River was that it was almost entirely American, and that it stopped at World War I. Arguments about FDR and what he did were too controversial for our young minds.\n\nWe're seeing a repeat of the nastiness focused on the New Deal, now focused on Obamacare.\n\nBritain competes with the US for the title of being the mother of all democracies, and is often described as having a leg-up on matters of courtesy. There isn't anything in the US (or Israel) like polite Brits lining up to board a bus, with no shoving or otherwise violating the queue. Yet recent weeks have seen meanness in the Labour Party, with even its established anti-Semite leader Jeremy Corbyn removing from party offices colleagues whose anti-Semitism went too far even for him.\n\nIsrael's Labor Party, under its current label of Zionist Union, has gone beyond Likud in nastiness. Yitzhak Herzog seems likely to pay with his political life for participating in negotiations with the evil Bibi, even though Yitzhak pulled back from an agreement.\n\nLikud MKs are behaving reasonably well, especially when judged against the rough stuff that often marks their party conventions. However, former Likud MKs are letting us know, with terms equivalent to \"despicable,\" that Bibi's move toward Lieberman violates their view of party principles.\n\nThe height of nastiness has come from Ehud Barak, with his record of serving as Prime Minister in a Labor Government and Defense Minister in a Likud Government. Barak isn't stupid, but he was showing his lack of knowledge with the use of the term fascism.\n\nNo doubt that there are signs of extremism in some of the proposals coming from right wing Likudniks, Avigdor Lieberman, and the religious settlers of Jewish Home. However, politicians are known for proposing everything, enacting into law very little, with only some of the enactments actually implemented. It's part of the game, wherever there is freedom of expression and political competition.\n\nBarak's comments about fascism are at the height of intellectual sophistication compared to Donald's trumpeting the size of his penis, associating a media star's criticism with her monthly intemperance, providing life to the screed that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fraudulent, trying to revitalize Hillary's connection to the death of Vince Foster as well as\n\n\"You know, it really doesn\u2019t matter what the media write as long as you\u2019ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur great African-American President hasn\u2019t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.\u201d Trump's supporters seem open to such appeals. And because Hillary is vulnerable on a number of items that fits his style, Americans should get use to calling him Mr President. Trump's supporters seem open to such appeals. And because Hillary is vulnerable on a number of items that fits his style, Americans should get use to calling him Mr President.\n\nYou need another American example of greater extremism? Look at what the Oklahoma legislature enacted, criminalizing abortion.\n\nThere are courts in both the US and Israel that are among the prominent bulwarks of decent norms. In this case, Oklahoma's Governor used his veto to save federal courts the trouble of outlawing yet another challenge to its ruling, way back in 1973, that abortions could not be forbidden.\n\nYou want a learned, courteous discussion about politics, go to an academic seminar. But first check out the professor, and avoid those campuses where BDS is fashionable.\n\nComments welcome", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com", "description": "Ira Sharkansky", "title": "Who's extreme?", "url": "http://www.jpost.com/page.aspx?pageid=13&articleid=454945", "image": "http://www.jpost.com/HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?ID=249506", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163414806897}, "publishdate": 201605250531, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Yitzhak Herzog seems likely to pay with his political life for participating in negotiations with the evil Bibi, even though Yitzhak pulled back from an agreement.\nIn other words, an extremism of policy is about to come from this government, and there is already an extremism of political meanness.\nThere are courts in both the US and Israel that are among the prominent bulwarks of decent norms.\nHowever, politicians are known for proposing everything, enacting into law very little, with only some of the enactments actually implemented.\nLikud MKs are behaving reasonably well, especially when judged against the rough stuff that often marks their party conventions."}
