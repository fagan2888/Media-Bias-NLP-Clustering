He was adopted at 5 but things only got worse under the influence of drug-addicted parents who fought daily, he said. He and his adopted brothers were kept in a basement. His sisters lived upstairs. He ran away at 17 and eventually earned a GED.\n\nOn isolation as a foster care child:\n\n\u201cA person\u2019s mind isn\u2019t there, especially coming out of foster care, because no one is there to be there for them through the thick and thin. No one is there through life, teaching what being mature is.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the ideal setting for foster children:\n\n\u201cEach foster child should have one specific home, for one specific child, so that way, you don\u2019t have an adult focused on so many different things, so many different kids. One or two or three (children), not a group of people. That makes it so much easier for that foster parent and for those kids to get to where they want to get.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLatisha Alvarado Barrington, 21, studying at CU Denver\n\nWhen Latisha was 8, her parents left her and her siblings home alone. Her baby brother was crying and wouldn\u2019t stop. The children found a nipple, filled a Gatorade bottle with formula and fed him. Then, a firm knock on the door. Two Denver police officers. Latisha said she was the babysitter. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d they asked. She said 13. So began a journey through the foster care system that took her to a dozen placements in a few short years.\n\nOn how her biological parents influenced her schooling and her experience in a crisis center:\n\n\u201cIt was easier for us not to go (to school) because my parents wouldn\u2019t fight us on it. It was just, \u2018Whatever, do whatever you want.\u2019 So when we were taken away from our parents\u2019 home, I stayed in a crisis center for six months and wasn\u2019t in school. I did their worksheets but it was more third grade work than sixth grade. It was boring.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn all the moving around as a foster care child:\n\n\u201cI hated it. Hated going into a new school. Even when moving from school to school in foster care. I didn\u2019t have any friends. My clothes were big. My hair was a bit messy. I was sort of the poor kid. If it wasn\u2019t for my vibrant personality, of wanting to talk to people, to get involved, I think I would have gone under the radar.\u201d\n\nOn training foster parents:\n\n\u201cKids in foster care are extremely traumatized, extremely abused, extremely neglected and misunderstood, and all these things add up. All these things are not the fault of our own but the fault of their parents. We are like the consequences of their actions. So training parents to be trauma-informed, training parents on how to recognize that behavior. It isn\u2019t because the child is a jerk. It isn\u2019t because the child doesn\u2019t want to listen. It\u2019s because the child is severely messed up in one way or another. So it\u2019s about creating this awareness so compassion can be brought in a little bit stronger.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmily Samora, 26, living in Westminster with her 3-year-old daughter, beginning internship in program helping foster care youth\n\nEmily was 4 when she was taken from her drug-addicted mother and placed in foster care. Her rocky road included being expelled from school on a drug charge and graduation from an all-girls school that also serves as a residential treatment home.\n\nOn the instability of being a foster care kid:\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest struggles in my journey was it was really choppy, getting transferred from place to place to place, trying to go from one subject to another subject and not knowing what they are teaching you. You could go from pre-algebra in one school and you go to another school and they\u2019ll be on something like advanced algebra.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn what needs to happen to help foster care youth with school:\n\n\u201cYou need to know where they\u2019re at in school. You just can\u2019t assume you can take a child from this class and stick them in this class and assume they\u2019re being taught the same material. It\u2019s always going to be different, it\u2019s always going to be switched up. So if you had all the school districts comply to have the same subjects taught at the same (time) so the kids can stay where they\u2019re at in transition, that\u2019s a big, big thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlisiana Medina, 20, student at Community College of Denver with plans to become a paralegal and eventually a lawyer.\n\nAlisiana\u2019s mother died when she was 7. She was placed in the foster system after her father failed to enroll her and another sibling in school and was declared an unfit parent.\n\nOn arriving at yet another new school:\n\n\u201cWhen you come into a new school environment, it\u2019s always uncomfortable. It\u2019s always unsettling. Make them feel comfortable. Make them feel at home. Don\u2019t make them feel different. They\u2019re not different. They\u2019re just troubled. Everyone is troubled in one way or another.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn what needs to happen to help foster care youth with school:\n\n\u201cEvery middle school, high school, they all have different math classes and have different subjects being taught at different times. Putting (foster care youth) in the right class is key.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Colorado Classroom", "description": "In a new study, researchers find Colorado foster care children are far less likely to graduate high school than students from other challenging backgrounds.", "title": "Foster care youth: Faces of the invisible achievement gap", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coloradoclassroom/2014/09/14/faces-invisible-achievement-gap/3997/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coloradoclassroom/files/2014/09/Rayvon-495x328.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In a new study, researchers find Colorado foster care children are far less likely to graduate high school than students from other challenging backgrounds.", "creator": "@egorski", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coloradoclassroom/2014/09/14/faces-invisible-achievement-gap/3997/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coloradoclassroom/files/2014/09/Rayvon-495x328.jpg", "title": "Faces of the invisible achievement gap", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In a new study, researchers find Colorado foster care children are far less likely to graduate high school than students from other challenging backgrounds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b1c\"", "article_summary": "On isolation as a foster care child:\u201cA person\u2019s mind isn\u2019t there, especially coming out of foster care, because no one is there to be there for them through the thick and thin.\nSo began a journey through the foster care system that took her to a dozen placements in a few short years.\nPutting (foster care youth) in the right class is key.\u201d\nIn Colorado, homeless students are nearly twice as likely to graduate from high school as children in the foster care system.\nIt was boring.\u201dOn all the moving around as a foster care child:\u201cI hated it."}
