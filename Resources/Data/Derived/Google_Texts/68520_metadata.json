I\u2019d read and liked Trump\u2019s books, I found him to be gracious in person and I had friends who went to work for him. I also loved his charisma, his stance on the wall, his refreshing lack of political correctness, his scrappiness and his ability to just shrug off what would be career-ending mistakes for other Republican politicians.\n\nUnfortunately today, Trump looks to be completely unelectable. There are massive numbers of Republicans pledging not to vote for him in the general election; sitting members of congress are saying they won\u2019t support him in the general; Mitch McConnell is openly telling Republican senators they can distance themselves from him. Trump\u2019s been publicly condemned by the last GOP nominee (Romney); his unfavorability numbers are equaling those of Bill \u201cthe face of date rape\u201d Cosby (Cosby, July of last year, 62% unfavorability while Trump\u2019s rating is 62% now). He\u2019ll be dramatically outspent in a general election and contrary to what he\u2019s promised, he\u2019s not going to finance his own campaign. He will have to deal with a massive Trump University fraud case during the general election; he\u2019s the most gaffe-prone candidate in history and the mainstream media that has been carrying him on its shoulders will turn on him once he\u2019s the nominee.\n\nDespite all of this, there are many smart people who think Trump will do wonderfully in an election. Some of them note that Trump has driven record turn-out in the states he\u2019s won without noting that record numbers of people turned out to vote against him in the states he lost. Others point out that nobody thought Trump would be doing as well in the primary, but of course, it\u2019s a split field. Had this been a one on one race, Ted Cruz would be ahead of Trump in delegates right now. Then there are people who point to the outlier poll here and there that shows Trump winning the general, but he consistently loses to Hillary head-to-head.\n\nYet, there are many smart people who know something about campaigns that think Trump can win the general election. Not a one of them has ever made a rational, logical case for it, but \u201cthey have a feeling.\u201d Barring a miracle, the second Trump is the nominee, almost no matter what he does, Hillary wins; we lose the Senate big and bleed House seats; the SCOTUS swings wildly to the left; Obamacare and Obama\u2019s executive orders stay, but this doesn\u2019t bother people because \u201cTrump changes all the rules\u201d\u2026.or something.\n\nSetting that aside, as I have already noted, I can understand people liking Trump early on. I have friends and family members who still like him, which is why I don\u2019t criticize anyone for backing Trump, have nothing negative to say about the people endorsing him and won\u2019t actively encourage people not to vote for him. I believe intelligent, well-meaning people can have differences of opinion.\n\nHowever, I genuinely don\u2019t understand why so many people think a man who is unpredictable, thin-skinned, mean spirted, vindictive and who often blurts out stupid things is the sort of person who is suited to be President of the United States. The same traits that have made Trump a success on reality TV would make him a horrible POTUS. Even if you ignore the fact that Trump is temperamentally unsuited to be President of the United States, he\u2019s also saying creepy, fascistic things that should alarm people.\n\nIn the debate before last, the discussion was Donald Trump\u2019s policy of \u201ctaking out\u201d the families of terrorists. So, let\u2019s define the ugly reality of what Trump\u2019s glib remarks would look like in the real world. We\u2019re talking about sending American soldiers to peaceful areas to shoot women and babies in the head because they\u2019re related to someone who committed a terrorist attack. When the moderator noted that a former CIA director had said troops wouldn\u2019t obey that order because it was inarguably a war crime, Trump replied, \"They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not gonna refuse me. Believe me.\" That\u2019s a dangerous statement, the sort of statement you\u2019d expect to hear from a fascist or a dictator. It becomes even more troubling when you consider it in concert with Trump\u2019s comments about China violently suppressing a pro-democracy demonstration.\n\nWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak... as being spit on by the rest of the world.\n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that it would be dangerous to our republic to allow someone with those kind of openly fascistic leanings to ever have control of the IRS, the CIA, the FBI, the DOJ, our military or nuclear weapons. While we\u2019re at it, saying \u201cIslam hates us\u201d may impress people on some Internet comment boards, but that\u2019s not an appropriate thing to say for someone who wants to be President. Additionally, when asked about the violence that occurs at his rallies, Trump essentially said he condemns the violence unless it\u2019s deserved. Of course, we have no word on whether Trump thinks the female reporter who was assaulted by his campaign manager deserved it because Trump\u2019s dishonorable way of dealing with it is just lying and claiming it didn\u2019t happen. When you think a man should be allowed to assault a woman as long as he's affiliated with Donald Trump, your moral compass is broken and there\u2019s something wrong with your soul.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is why there are so many people who insist that every criticism of the world\u2019s least stable politician must be off base or worse yet, why they acknowledge that these criticisms are accurate and continue to support him anyway. It\u2019s so strange to talk to strong conservative Christian patriots who support Trump DESPITE THE FACT that they agree with most of the criticisms leveled at him. I guarantee you that 95% of Trump\u2019s current supporters would have considered it an insult if you told them a year ago that they\u2019d back a celebrity birther for President who\u2019d talk about his penis on stage at a debate, encourage violence at his rallies and mock POWs. Yet, here we are.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many good Christians can support an adulterer who claims to also be a Christian, but also says he\u2019s never had a reason to ask God for forgiveness.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many rock-ribbed conservatives can support an obvious flimflam man whose positions seem to change almost day-by-day and will undeniably change even more if he\u2019s nominated.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many parents can support a man who\u2019s a horrible example for their children. Yes, Trump\u2019s had a great business career, but his character is at the bottom of the barrel. He\u2019s crude and arrogant and he treats other people like garbage.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many people who say they only care about illegal immigration can support a guy who was pushing amnesty three years ago and is in favor of citizenship for illegal aliens now when a stronger candidate on illegal immigration, Ted Cruz, is in the race.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many people who care about the Constitution can support a man who\u2019s probably never even read it and wouldn\u2019t care about anything in it if he did.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many fundamentally decent people who were furious at Bill Clinton for degrading the presidency can back a man who mocks the disabled, lies as often as both of the Clintons put together, brags about sleeping with married women and who said, \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter what they write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many smart people can back a guy who\u2019s too lazy to study anything beyond the basics of any policy issue. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know any more about the policies of the country he\u2019d be running today than he did the day he got into the race. Trump knows the results of every poll in America that are favorable to him; so why can\u2019t he take the time to learn something about the government policies of the nation he wants to lead?\n\nMost of all, I don\u2019t understand how so many good people can support a hateful, fundamentally dishonest, divisive man who\u2019s turned friends and allies in the conservative movement against each other and who has shown over and over that he doesn\u2019t care about anything but himself.\n\nIf all these people were phony, insincere, dumb or corrupt, that would be an easy explanation, but I know that doesn\u2019t describe the vast majority of people who back Trump. Most of them are intelligent, well-meaning people. If the only choice were between Trump and some horrible establishment candidate no one wanted, I might understand at least a little bit, but it\u2019s not. If Donald Trump were a close relative or had saved your baby from being eaten by alligators, I could understand the blind loyalty that forgives him for anything, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe good news for people who support Trump and the bad news for those of us who find him to be a repulsive, narcissistic con man is that by staying in the race this long, John Kasich and Marco Rubio have nearly guaranteed Trump the nomination. If Trump does lock it down, my guess is that it will start off with cheers and joyful proclamations that the hated establishment has been defeated and it will likely end with cries of \u201cbetrayal,\u201d years of grudges and a lopsided defeat while Trump happily pitches his latest products from Mexico and China to the fans he picked up during his run at the presidency. The one thing we may never truly understand is why so many good and decent people were blindly loyal to someone like Trump when they had every opportunity to see what kind of man he really was beforehand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Its easy for me to understand why people were so favorably disposed toward Trump at first because initially, I liked him, too..05/27/2016 7:58:36AM EST.", "author": "John Hawkins", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Its easy for me to understand why people were so favorably disposed toward Trump at first because initially, I liked him, too.", "title": "John Hawkins - What I Will Probably Never Understand About The Undying Affection For Donald Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/03/12/what-i-will-probably-never-understand-about-the-undying-affection-for-donald-trump-n2132559", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/e4e5f13b-a589-424c-947b-68a1cd60e938.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Its easy for me to understand why people were so favorably disposed toward Trump at first because initially, I liked him, too.", "title": "John Hawkins - What I Will Probably Never Understand About The Undying Affection For Donald Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/03/12/what-i-will-probably-never-understand-about-the-undying-affection-for-donald-trump-n2132559", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/e4e5f13b-a589-424c-947b-68a1cd60e938.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "What I Will Probably Never Understand About The Undying Affection For Donald Trump, John Hawkins, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know any more about the policies of the country he\u2019d be running today than he did the day he got into the race.\nYet, there are many smart people who know something about campaigns that think Trump can win the general election.\nHe\u2019ll be dramatically outspent in a general election and contrary to what he\u2019s promised, he\u2019s not going to finance his own campaign.\nIt\u2019s so strange to talk to strong conservative Christian patriots who support Trump DESPITE THE FACT that they agree with most of the criticisms leveled at him.\nI don\u2019t understand how so many parents can support a man who\u2019s a horrible example for their children."}
