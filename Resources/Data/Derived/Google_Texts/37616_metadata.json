Mac Thornberry \u2014 a political veteran first elected with a tide of Republicans in 1994. The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Mike Minter in November.\n\nIf re-elected, Thornberry, 55, is widely expected to assume the chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee after Chairman Buck McKeon of California announced he would not seek re-election and endorsed the Clarendon Republican as his successor.\n\nDave Rausch, a political science professor at West Texas A&M University, termed the race \u201cfairly serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he thinks it\u2019s serious because he\u2019s obviously coming back to the district,\u201d Rausch said of Thornberry\u2019s multiple trips to the area recently.\n\n\u201cIf he were to lose the primary, that would be a significant loss of clout for the 13th District.\u201d\n\nThornberry said Friday he didn\u2019t know how many trips he\u2019s made to the district during this campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m returning more. I would say I\u2019m spending more total days (in the district) right now, at least in January and February,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s more often, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s more total days.\u201d\n\nHays said she decided to run because she felt Thornberry no longer truly represented the district\u2019s conservative voters.\n\nHays, a certified financial planner, said she would have voted against the federal budget pact he voted for, and said Republicans lost the momentum gained from the 2011 Budget Control Act that averted a government shutdown.\n\nHays said 75 percent of spending increases in the Ryan-Murray budget deal occur in the first five years and 75 percent of the savings crop up during the second five years.\n\n\u201cFrom a fiscal standpoint, I opposed it because we were supposed to be at least flattening the increase in our spending, but we walked away from it,\u201d Hays said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that Congress five or 10 years from now is going to have any more backbone and stick with those cuts.\u201d\n\nHays said she also was concerned about the budget pact\u2019s cuts on future military retirees.\n\nThornberry said he supported the pact because it somewhat shields defense programs from the budget ax, begins entitlement reforms and heads the nation toward a balanced budget.\n\n\u201cIt is not perfect, but it gets to balance within 10 years; it begins to reform entitlements, but it protects Social Security and Medicare for people who are already on it; and it protects defense,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best blueprint to follow.\u201d\n\nBarlow said she would have voted against the Ryan-Murray pact.\n\n\u201cThere were cuts that could have been made in many other directions,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cWe send our soldiers into war ... We owe them the benefits that they told them they were going to have.\u201d\n\nBarlow said many district residents are particularly worried about the federal deficit and overspending, which she likened to a cancer.\n\n\u201cThe major issue that is of concern to the people I have talked to is a $17 trillion debt and the fact that their children and grandchildren are mortgaged to the eyeballs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have absolutely got to stop the spending.\u201d\n\nInstead of slashing the federal budget, Barlow said she favors a zero-based budgeting approach under which agencies would have to better justify their expenditures for each budget year.\n\n\u201cThey should start with a zero to begin with and explain why they need X amount of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIn other words, you get 90 percent of the previous budget this year and next year when you come for your budget you get 90 percent of your previous budget ... so that you\u2019re going down 10 percent every budget.\u201d\n\nHays said she also differed with Thornberry\u2019s stance on spying by the National Security Agency. The spying program, first authorized under the Patriot Act, was narrowly tailored originally, but Hays said it has grown exponentially.\n\n\u201cIt was originally intended for citizens who were under investigation for terrorism. Now we find out (information is) basically being gathered on all citizens even if you are not under investigation,\u201d she said. \u201c(Thornberry) has just continued, even with more and more revelations of what they are doing ... to support, and for the sake of security, to defend that program.\u201d\n\nThornberry said such NSA programs are governed by several layers of oversight \u2014 including congressional committees, the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and agency watchdog inspectors \u2014 to ensure they are only used under conditions spelled out by law.\n\n\u201cPart of the oversight and the checks and balances are because of us, because we asked for them,\u201d he said of Congress during an earlier interview.\n\nOn immigration, Hays said she supports expanding opportunities for legal immigration, but is against a path to citizenship for those who have entered the country illegally.\n\nBarlow said she is against the path to citizenship for anyone who has entered the country illegally. She said, however, she supports worker visa programs that allow visitors from other nations to work in the United States for a year or two.\n\n\u201cTo begin with, I am 100 percent against amnesty or a path to citizenship for anyone who has broken the laws and entered our country illegally,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cI think that what we need is to enforce the laws that we currently have.\u201d\n\nThornberry said he also supports strengthening the nation\u2019s controls over its borders and favors guest programs that allow skilled workers to emigrate to the United States.\n\n\u201cI think you start with border security and enforcement, and on the enforcement side interior enforcement is very important because about half of the people here illegally came here legally on a visa, then they have stayed beyond their visa,\u201d he said. \u201cYou eliminate the lottery and bring in people based on their skills, education and what they can contribute to our society.\u201d\n\nThornberry said he has continued to support repealing the Affordable Care Act, but doesn\u2019t see that repeal moving forward any time soon. He supports more competition, more transparency so patients can get more information about health care costs, permitting insurance sales across state lines and tort reforms.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a way for someone who gets a disease to get health insurance that is affordable, and that is probably going to require some sort of government involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the folks that are proposing that the government cover everybody with kind of a catastrophic plan so that you\u2019re protected on the high end, and then you are responsible for the lower end maintenance kinds of things, more like we do for our car insurance.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the two challengers vying for his seat, Thornberry said he\u2019s looking forward to the upcoming primary.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go before the voters, I take it seriously because representing our area in Congress is a special trust. This year most everyone is understandably frustrated by what is, or is not, getting done in Washington,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cThrough the campaign, I want people to know that I will not let up in my efforts to represent them and to strengthen our country.\u201d\n\nAndrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Friday the committee considers Thornberry\u2019s seat a \u201csafe\u201d one, and that it doesn\u2019t normally focus on contested GOP primary races and instead focuses its efforts in competitive general election races that pit the GOP against Democrats.\n\nNo GOP primary challenger has drawn more than 23 percent of the vote in contested primary races against Thornberry since he was first elected in 1994, according to election results.\n\nBarlow, who battled Thornberry in the last GOP primary, garnered 22.4 percent of ballots cast in the 2012 GOP primary.\n\nThornberry was elected in 1994 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Bill Sarpalius, 79,416 votes (55.4 percent) to Sarpalius\u2019 63,923 votes (44.1 percent) in the 1994 general election.\n\nAccording to the most recent campaign contribution report from the Federal Election Commission, Thornberry received $700,083 in contributions in 2013. During the same period, Hays received $77,342 and Barlow received $11,985.\n\nRoll Call and the Cook Political Report, two political publications that monitor all U.S. House and Senate races, don\u2019t list the 13th District race among competitive House contests in the upcoming election.\n\nHarvey Kronberg, author of Austin-based political newsletter The Quorum Report, said he discussed the race Friday with a group of prominent Washington lobbyists and GOP contributors, and that none of them saw the upcoming election as a competitive contest.\n\n\u201cNobody saw Thornberry in any kind of danger,\u201d Kronberg said. \u201cThey were surprised at the thought that Thornberry could conceivably have any exposure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, News, Buck McKeon, Congress, Dave Rausch, Elaine Hays, Mac Thornberry, Medicare, Mike Minter, Pam Barlow, Republican Party, West Texas A&M University", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "A longtime congressman, an Amarillo certified financial planner and a veterinarian from Bowie will square off in the March 4 primary race for the 13th Congressional District seat.", "title": "ELECTIONS 2014: Federal budget, NSA take forefront in Congressional District 13 race", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2014-02-15/elections-2014-federal-budget-nsa-take-forefront-congressional-district", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/13069011.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A longtime congressman, an Amarillo certified financial planner and a veterinarian from Bowie will square off in the March 4 primary race for the 13th Congressional District seat.The contest pits Elaine Hays, 55, and Bowie veterinarian Pam Barlow, 59, against Rep.
