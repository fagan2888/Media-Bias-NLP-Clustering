But many adjunct or part-time instructors were used to working more than 30 hours a week, and that would have entitled them to a 50-percent subsidy on health coverage.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to pick up 2,600 people,\u201d Olguin-Ryan said. \u201cThere is no budget for it. They (the state) gave us a month and a half\u2019s notice last year, and there was no time to try to budget for it.\u201d\n\nInstructors who had been teaching more than three classes a week and would have been entitled to subsidized coverage were cut back to three or less, giving them the option to buy into the college\u2019s coverage only if they paid the full cost themselves.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Olguin-Ryan said, adding that the college did create an unprecedented 65 new full-time faculty positions to cover the lost hours.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter David Crowder at dcrowder@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422, ext. 122 and (915) 630-6622.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "The figures aren\u2019t in yet and it\u2019s a story that is just starting to be told: full-time workers forced into part-time work and part timers\u2019 hours cut sharply because of the Affordable Care Act.Standing behind the cash register, the manager of an El Paso Taco Cabana talked freely about how all his full-time workers had their hours cut to less than 30 a week last summer so the company wouldn\u2019t have to provide them with health insurance this year.", "title": "Obamacare impact: Cutting hours, going part time", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_67454d40-8128-11e3-ba8a-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/dd/0ddaacc8-8123-11e3-bf93-0019bb30f31a/52dbf702bebef.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The figures aren\u2019t in yet and it\u2019s a story that is just starting to be told: full-time workers forced into part-time work and part timers\u2019 hours cut sharply because of the Affordable Care Act.Standing behind the cash register, the manager of an El Paso Taco Cabana talked freely about how all his full-time workers had their hours cut to less than 30 a week last summer so the company wouldn\u2019t have to provide them with health insurance this year.", "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "local_news,editors_pick", "news_keywords": "local_news,editors_pick"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b0f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Olguin-Ryan said, adding that the college did create an unprecedented 65 new full-time faculty positions to cover the lost hours.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame.\u201dThe college\u2019s 400 full-time faculty pay nothing for their health coverage.\nMany of his students who work to pay for their education and living expenses are complaining about being cut to 28 hours.\nThe figures aren\u2019t in yet and it\u2019s a story that is just starting to be told: full-time workers forced into part-time work and part timers\u2019 hours cut sharply because of the Affordable Care Act.\nMost only make $2.13 an hour and live on tips, and with many seeing their hours cut, he said, they\u2019re desperately looking for full-time work or another part-time job \u2013 or two."}
