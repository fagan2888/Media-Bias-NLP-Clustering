The idea was that if more people had health insurance, they would be more likely to have access to a primary care doctor and avoid the emergency room.\n\nNew data released by the St. Louis Regional Health Commission shows that theory might be playing out. In 2014, St. Louis-area emergency rooms saw a 5 percent decrease in visits by people without health insurance. That only represents about 7,000 fewer visits, but it comes after three years of steady increases of the same size or larger.\n\nSome of this can be attributed to a small decrease in the number of people who are uninsured. Though the state legislature has voted not to expand Medicaid, many St. Louis-area patients have purchased coverage on the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, which went into effect that year. The unemployment rate also continued to decline between 2013 and 2014, so new hires may have been able to get coverage.\n\n\u201cWith the high deductible plans that are now taking hold, people are thinking twice to go to an emergency room and run up a big bill,\u201d said Rob Fruend, the commission\u2019s CEO.\n\nStill, a lot of people are still seeking care in emergency rooms, said Dr. Andwele Jolly, who sits on the committee\u2019s Provider Services Advisory Board. He\u2019d like to see more on how these trends happen over time.\n\n\u201cI think it will take time for behavior to change. For a long time, the emergency room was the primary care setting. So now with folks gaining access to insurance, hopefully, and getting a better understanding of how to use the system, they\u2019ll find it more useful to go to primary care settings or urgent care centers,\u201d Jolly said.\n\nA few hospitals did report increases in uninsured emergency visits, including Saint Louis University Hospital and Cardinal Glennon. Still, the largest portion of uninsured emergency visits went to just two emergency rooms: Christian Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. What is significant for 2014 is that those two also saw the steepest declines \u2014 about 5,400 fewer visits in total.\n\n\"What we had was an overall decrease in the number of patients coming into the Emergency Department,\" said June Fowler, a spokesperson for BJC Healthcare, the nonprofit that manages both hospitals. The percentage of uninsured patients, she said, stayed relatively stable.\n\n\"Some of it is likely attributable to people having more access to primary care. It could have been that it was not a bad flu season,\" Fowler said.\n\nThat timing also correlates with the start of a care coordination program for Christian Hospital in north St. Louis County, which reduces emergency room visits by sending paramedics to provide at-home preventive care.\n\nFollow Durrie on Twitter: @durrieB.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "When the Affordable Care Act went into effect, many health-care economists hoped it would reduce the number of emergency room visits made by uninsured", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/fewer-st-louis-emergency-room-visits-uninsured-first-year-healthcaregov", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201509/0916katiedude.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When the Affordable Care Act went into effect, many health-care economists hoped it would reduce the number of emergency room visits made by uninsured", "title": "Fewer St. Louis emergency room visits by the uninsured, in first year of Healthcare.gov"}, "story_id": 460013932, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@durrieB"}, "author": "Durrie Bouscaren", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Fewer St. Louis emergency room visits by the uninsured, in first year of Healthcare.gov"}, "nid": 50544, "datePublished": "2015-12-16", "keywords": "St. Louis Regional Health Commission, Emergency Care, Top Stories, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 523, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21db\"", "article_summary": "Still, the largest portion of uninsured emergency visits went to just two emergency rooms: Christian Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital.\nA few hospitals did report increases in uninsured emergency visits, including Saint Louis University Hospital and Cardinal Glennon.\nIn 2014, St. Louis-area emergency rooms saw a 5 percent decrease in visits by people without health insurance.\nWhen the Affordable Care Act went into effect, many health-care economists hoped it would reduce the number of emergency room visits made by uninsured people.\nFor a long time, the emergency room was the primary care setting."}
