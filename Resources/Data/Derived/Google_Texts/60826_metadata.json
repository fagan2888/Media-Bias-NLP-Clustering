Today the federal government is largely dedicated to compelling men and women to subsidize ideas they disbelieve and abhor. The Founders thought the people should shape their government, but today the government spends billions shaping its people (and importing new ones, when the existing populace proves resistant to \u201cchange.\u201d)\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFor example, a new report from watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com details how the federal government spends $4.34 billion on public relations.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers might be surprised to know that the federal government is the second-largest public relations firm in the world,\u201d OpenTheBooks.com founder and report author Adam Andrzejewski observes. \u201cOur nation\u2019s 3,092 federal public affairs officers have perfected the art of advancing an agency\u2019s interests \u2013 often for more dollars and higher salaries \u2013 ahead of the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe report, entitled The Department of Self-Promotion: How Federal Agency P.R. Spending Advances Their Interests Rather Than the Public Interest, offers plenty of examples, gleaned from government financial reports covering the years 2007 through 2014. If civics classes ever get around to teaching the vitally important lesson that government itself is the biggest, baddest \u201cspecial interest\u201d in America, Andrzejewski\u2019s work can serve as one of their textbooks.\n\nThe federal government has spent over $190 million on surveys and polls since 2007, for example, creating what the report describes as a \u201cvast data mining operation that collects all sorts of minutia information on citizens, society, personal behaviors, group behaviors, and business behaviors.\u201d Much of this work is contracted out at exorbitant rates, with one company billing the IRS $69.88 per hour for an \u201cinjured spouse satisfaction survey.\u201d That means taxpayers effectively paid each of the company\u2019s \u201cjunior survey statisticians\u201d over $145,000 per year.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency spent $141 million in salaries, plus $1.5 million in bonuses, on permanent \u201cpublic affairs officers\u201d\u2026 but still spent another $26 million on outside P.R. consultants. The EPA claims its social-media campaigns reach millions of Americans\u2026 prompting critics to argue that the agency\u2019s advocacy on its own behalf has violated the Anti-Lobbying Act.\n\nThe EPA might be the most glaring example of a government agency that has fused almost completely with its own lobbyists, becoming a special interest unto itself, but it\u2019s not the only such example. As The Department of Self-Promotion points out, the public has the right, and urgent need, to know what federal agencies are doing, and much of Washington\u2019s public-relations expenditure is justified in the name of \u201ctransparency\u201d\u2026 but the budget, and objectives, of these informational programs has grown so huge that much of what agencies publish is pure propaganda.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers have a right to know how their money is spent,\u201d said Andrzejewski. \u201cBut federal agencies don\u2019t have a right to spend $4.34 billion of taxpayer money on self-promotion campaigns. This report sheds light on an area of government spending that has gone unrestrained for far too long.\u201d\n\nMuch of this lavish spending would be difficult to justify to taxpayers\u2026 if federal agencies ever felt the need to do so.\n\nThe State Department spent $36.5 million on polling the opinions of foreigners. In another notorious incident spotlighted by then-Senator Tom Coburn, who is now the Honorary Chairman of OpenTheBooks.com, the State Department spent $630,000 convincing taxpayers to \u201clike\u201d it on Facebook.\n\nMillions of dollars in performance bonuses won\u2019t sit well with a public worried about flat private-sector wages, a shrunken workforce, and irresponsible government spending. Millions were spent on focus groups. Millions more were spent so the government could monitor news broadcasts and website postings about itself.\n\nThe Veterans Administration spent $1.7 million measuring employee satisfaction before, during, and after the greatest scandal in its history.\n\nThe IRS blew almost $18 million on customer satisfaction surveys, boasting of a 90 percent positive rating\u2026 leading Andrzejewski to wonder, \u201cWould a citizen really tell the IRS any differently?\u201d\n\nThe Army spent $23.6 million on public relations for Afghanistan, while a massive military withdrawal was being planned and executed. Judging by conditions in Afghanistan, that expensive P.R. campaign doesn\u2019t seem to have gone terribly well.\n\nOf course, since these are bloated federal agencies we\u2019re talking about, a great deal of money is hard to account for. OpentheBooks.com found $1.46 billion in payouts to three contractors for background and national security checks for federal employees, tucked into an account called \u201cSupport \u2013 Professional: Market Research/Public Opinion.\u201d $106.9 million in \u201cdirty data\u201d was scattered across \u201ccompletely unrecognizable spending transactions within P.R. fund accounts.\u201d\n\nAs always, outside groups profited handsomely from government contracts. Some of the hourly billing presented to the federal government implies salaries of over a million dollars per year, on contracts lasting for up to 20 years. In addition to the $191 million spent on polling and surveys mentioned above, the government paid over $50 million for website services, $17 million for conference services, $212 million for marketing services, $7 million on news services, and $12 million for direct advertising.\n\nThe pace of all this public-relations spending is increasing, as the report notes P.R. contracts were up 47.1 percent during the highest two years of the Obama Administration, versus the last two years of the Bush Administration, with new records being set for the price of individual contracts \u2013 and that\u2019s despite budget sequestration, which had the entire Washington bureaucracy howling about financial strangulation.\n\nIt\u2019s also troubling to see public relations spending on the rise during an Administration notorious for fighting public information requests, with such vigor that Freedom of Information Act lawsuits are frequently necessary to pry crucial documents loose\u2026 in a process that takes so long that every scandal dies of old age, and gets buried by the media in an unmarked grave in the Old News Cemetery, before the most striking revelations occur. There is something absolutely grotesque about the most opaque Administration in history spending billions of tax dollars on opinion-manufacturing, and calling it \u201ctransparency.\u201d\n\nAndrzejewski hopes his report will begin the process of holding the federal government responsible for \u201ca line item expenditure that most taxpayers find wasteful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public purpose of wanton public relations spending must be challenged,\u201d he asserted.\n\nFor years, the federal agencies have layered on more and more public relations spending. Our oversight report is one of the only comprehensive audits regarding this issue and uses government provided data to begin questioning the public purpose for some of these expenses. With $4.5 billion in federal public relations spending since 2007, have we reached a point where the people\u2019s consent is being manufactured by our government at taxpayer expense?\n\nThat\u2019s a crucial question, especially given the massive public-relations feedback loop created by the Internet.\n\nThe government spends big money working up social-media excitement \u2013 the EPA\u2019s \u201cI Choose Clean Water\u201d campaign, which claimed to reach over 1.8 million people, used software that has been described as creating a \u201cvirtual flash mob.\u201d Social-media buzz drives mainstream media coverage, especially when it leans to the left and favors bigger government. Mainstream media coverage heavily impacts election campaigns, giving us more big-spending politicians. Scientists tell us perpetual-motion machines are impossible, but politicians appear to have come up with a pretty good blueprint for one.\n\nI asked Andrzejewski what can be done to slow down the government\u2019s P.R. machine, as even complaints about legally questionable expenditures seem to have gone nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe new elites in America must be the citizen,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe people must powerfully organize and demand a commitment to basic law enforcement within the public sector. Our report, on PR spending \u2013 of all things \u2013 exposes just how deep the crisis is in regard to the lack of federal government accountability spanning multiple administrations.\u201d\n\nHe noted that outrageous examples of government waste must be cited to attract public attention and give people something to rally around, citing the infamous \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d in Alaska as an example.\n\n\u201cThe only way to hold the federal government accountable is to make the American people aware of the problem and remind them \u2018We the People\u2019 are the elites in American society,\u201d Andrzejewski said. \u201cExposing waste really does work. It doesn\u2019t just make noise. It produces change. This approach worked in the earmark fight, and it can work within the rest of the budget as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today the federal government is largely dedicated to compelling men and women to subsidize ideas they disbelieve and abhor.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Today the federal government is largely dedicated to compelling men and women to subsidize ideas they disbelieve and abhor.", "title": "Your Government Spends Billions Convincing You to Let It Spend More of Your Money", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-462802394-obamacare.jpg", "height": 874}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/09/government-spends-billions-convincing-let-spend-money/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today the federal government is largely dedicated to compelling men and women to subsidize ideas they disbelieve and abhor.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-462802394-obamacare.jpg", "title": "Your Government Spends Billions Convincing You to Let It Spend More of Your Money", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Big Government, Federal Spending, government waste, polls, public relations, surveys,Big Government, Cronyism, Taxes,government", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "surveys", "published_time": "2015-12-09T05:17:51-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Cronyism,Taxes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut federal agencies don\u2019t have a right to spend $4.34 billion of taxpayer money on self-promotion campaigns.\nOf course, since these are bloated federal agencies we\u2019re talking about, a great deal of money is hard to account for.\nFor years, the federal agencies have layered on more and more public relations spending.\nWith $4.5 billion in federal public relations spending since 2007, have we reached a point where the people\u2019s consent is being manufactured by our government at taxpayer expense?\n\u201cTaxpayers have a right to know how their money is spent,\u201d said Andrzejewski."}
