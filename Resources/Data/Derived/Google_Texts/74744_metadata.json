The clip gives away some of first season\u2019s twists, which could seriously dilute the game\u2019s surprises. If you haven\u2019t played season one, and you\u2019re a gamer, then you really should.\n\nFor those who are up to speed with Telltale\u2019s The Walking Dead video game, the recently-released season two trailer gives fan a glimpse at some of the things the writers have in store for the latest batch of episodes. It also shows that Clementine is a little older and wiser this time around.\n\nInstead of playing someone who protects the little girl from the legions of the undead, players actually jump into Clementine\u2019s shoes this time around. This should provide a somewhat different experience from season one, particularly since so much of the tension consisted of keeping her safe and sound.\n\nOf course, she isn\u2019t the only character from the first season who makes an appearance in Telltale\u2019s latest zombie-filled adventure. MTV News points out that Omid and Christa appear in the trailer for The Walking Dead: Season 2. However, it\u2019s unclear how prominently the pair figures into the storyline.\n\nThe Inquisitr previously revealed that The Walking Dead: Season 2 is presently scheduled to hit just in time for the holidays. The Steam release is all set for December 17, while Xbox Live gets the goods on December 18. According to Polygon, a release date for the Playstation Network isn\u2019t available as of this writing.\n\nCheck out the official synopsis below.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Walking Dead: Season Two\u2019 continues the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse. Left to fend for herself, she has been forced to learn how to survive in a world gone mad. Many months have passed since the events seen in Season One of The Walking Dead, and Clementine is searching for safety. But what can an ordinary child do to stay alive when the living can be just as bad \u2013 and sometimes worse \u2013 than the dead? As Clementine, you will be tested by situations and dilemmas that will test your morals and your instinct for survival. Your decisions and actions will change the story around you, in this sequel to 2012\u2019s Game of the Year.\n\nCheck out the launch trailer for \u201cAll That Remains\u201d below.\n\nAre you planning to check out Telltale Games\u2019 The Walking Dead: Season 2?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telltale Games recently dropped a trailer for The Walking Dead: Season 2.
