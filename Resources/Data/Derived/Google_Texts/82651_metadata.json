The article we used was a non-fiction article from the New York Times. The no-fiction [sic] skills were apparent in the article and the lesson. We allowed all students to share what they know about the government...\"\n\nAfter this dad responded to Mr. Yoder, the principal, Mr. Andrejack contacted Mr. Barry to schedule an appointment to discuss the situation. The principal said in part to Mr. Barry,\n\n\"As a parent myself who raised 4 boys, I take great offense to what you said.\"\n\nClearly, the principal was not happy. But at least they were working on a solution.\n\nEnter teacher Cydnee Cohen, who never met or spoke with Mr. Barry, but works at his daughter's school. She is a mutual friend of one of Josh's Facebook friends, and contacted the friend to presumably get information about Mr. Barry.\n\nMs. Cohen left a voicemail (click on the video to hear the voicemail) that said in part,\n\n\"We're having some problems with a parent in our school district and on his page you are one of his friends...but I would like to know, some of it seems like he is a neo-nazi...call me...\"\n\nThe mutual friend sent a text (see screenshot) to Cohen, saying that Josh is the \"furthest thing\" from a neo-nazi, as he is Jewish. Cohen responded, \"he is tea party right wing!\"\n\nBarry told the Examiner that he is perplexed why Cohen would call him a neo nazi, but speculated that with the political atmosphere, many have a kneejerk reaction to those who believe in limited government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nMr. Barry's speculation is not without merit, as President Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and many others have made inaccurate and denigrating comments aimed at the Tea Party.\n\nFollow Renee Nal on Twitter @ReneeNal and Facebook.\n\nCheck out her news and political commentary on Liberty Unyielding, Gather and TavernKeepers.com for news you won't find in the mainstream media.
