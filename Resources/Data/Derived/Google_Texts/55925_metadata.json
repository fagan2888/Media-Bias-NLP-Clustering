The historian and author of A Renegade History of America isn't surprised by the bloodlust coursing through the veins of liberals, progressives, and MSNBC hosts regarding Syria.\n\nLast week on MSNBC\u2019s All In, Chris Hayes featured a host of left-of-center hawks, including Rep.Eliot Engel (D-NY), Julia Ioffe of The New Republic, Iraqi-American writer Zainab Salbi, who called for a \u201clong-term intervention,\u201d Mouaz Moustafa, a representative of the Syrian rebels, and Tom Perriello of the Center for American Progress, who has argued elsewhere not just for missile strikes against Assad but for \u201ca more aggressive posture that would potentially include regime transition.\u201d On his show, Chris Matthews justified bombing the Assad regime by declaring that even \u201cHitler didn\u2019t use\u201d chemical weapons. The liberal network\u2019s call to war climaxed with a stunning piece of demagoguery on Wednesday\u2019s Last Word, when reporter Richard Engel put a 10-year-old Syrian refugee girl on camera to say, \u201cDoes [Obama] want his kids to be like us? \u2026 When we get bigger, we\u2019re going to write, \u2018Obama didn\u2019t help us.\u2019\u201d\n\nNobody should be surprised by this sort of turn, explains Russell, because back in the day, the Progressives were absolutely the war party.\n\nThis is not a new position for The New Republic or progressives. A century ago the magazine, along with most progressive intellectuals, called for the U.S. to intervene in World War I in order to save innocent Europeans from German aggressions. President Woodrow Wilson, who declared that the U.S. had the duty to \u201clift the burdens of mankind in the future and show the paths of freedom to all the world,\u201d took that advice. Some 116,000 U.S. servicemen were killed and more than 200,000 wounded in the war, while countless thousands of German conscripts were cut down by American steel in what many historians now see as an exercise in imperial competition that laid the ground for the rise of fascism.... More recent progressive-led humanitarian interventions were smaller-scale but yielded similar results.Bill Clinton\u2018s incursion into Somalia killed 18 American soldiers and hundreds of Somali militiamen and civilians, and brought no improvement to the world\u2019s most misgoverned country. Likewise, NATO\u2019s bombing of Kosovo left hundreds of civilians dead and gave the upper hand to the Kosovo Liberation Army \u2014 an organization described by Clinton\u2019s own special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, as \u201cwithout any questions, a terrorist group\u201d \u2014 which conducted its own campaign of ethnic cleansing after the war.\n\nRead the whole thing.
