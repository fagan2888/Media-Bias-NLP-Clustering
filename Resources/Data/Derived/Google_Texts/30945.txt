Seattle Children’s has filed an administrative action requesting that the state insurance office remove from the state exchange health insurance plans that don’t include the medical center in their networks.

The action, filed Tuesday, requests that the Office of the Insurance Commissioner remove the majority of plans from the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. Only two insurers, Group Health Cooperative and Community Health Plan of Washington, now include Children’s. The appeal seeks to remove Coordinated Care Corporation, Molina Healthcare of Washington, Premera Blue Cross, its subsdiary LifeWise, and BridgeSpan, a Regence subsidiary.

(Update, 2:30 p.m. Oct. 22: Seattle Children’s announced Tuesday afternoon that it has reached an agreement with Molina Healthcare of Washington and is now an in-network provider in the health plans Molina is offering through the state’s online insurance marketplace in 2014. Further details were not immediately available.)

The action comes less than a month after Children’s filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court on the same issue. Children’s, in a news release, said it is concerned “that the plans that exclude us don’t provide adequate coverage for kids,” because many of its services are unique and not available anywhere else in the state.

Children’s is also asking the community to directly lobby Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler, who is holding hearings today on his request to broaden his control over insurer network issues.
