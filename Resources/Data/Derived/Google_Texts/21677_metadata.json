And still, a Republican congressman went on national television Friday and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Obama presidency.\n\nRepublican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas came on Hardball to discuss how fellow Lone Star State lawmaker Sen. Ted Cruz tried to defund Obamacare, and how the strategy may be blowing up in his face. Host Chris Matthews asked him about the criticism Cruz has been facing from his fellow GOPers.\n\nFarenthold suggested those people might be preparing to run for president against Cruz.\n\nMatthews then asked about Cruz\u2019s eligibility, because he was born in Canada. (Matthews has long maintained that Cruz, who has an American mother, is indeed eligible to be president.)\n\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s eligible. He had an American mother. I believe you\u2019re a natural born citizen. Do you agree with that?\u201d Matthews asked the congressman.\n\nFarenthold replied, \u201cListen, we\u2019ve had this discussion on Obama\u2026He\u2019s as eligible as Obama is.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Matthews said, \u201cCan you repeat after me: he was legitimately elected president.\u201d\n\nFarenthold repeated, but with a key word left out: \u201cPresident Obama was elected president\u201d\n\n\u201cLegitimately,\u201d said Matthews.\n\n\u201cThe people elected him,\u201d Farenthold said, refusing to say \u201clegitimately.\u201d\n\nMatthews concluded: \u201cEverybody watching knows what you\u2019re doing.
