If I drop my insurance, I\u2019ve thrown away all that money,\u201d Klimenko said. \u201cIf I pay less, they\u2019re not going to cover what I need.\u201d\n\nLong-term care insurance was supposed to help the middle class ease the financial burden of expensive in-home or nursing home care that now can top $90,000 a year.\n\nConsumers were urged to buy policies in their 50s, because premiums rose the longer they waited. About 4.8 million people were covered by long-term care policies in 2014.\n\nBut insurers botched just about every aspect of the policies they sold in the early days of the industry, said Joseph Belth, a retired professor of insurance at Indiana University known as one of the insurance industry\u2019s toughest critics. They underestimated how long people would live and how long they\u2019d need nursing home care \u2014 but overestimated how many people would drop their policies and how much interest insurers could earn on the premiums they banked.\n\nHemorrhaging money, many insurers left the business. Those that remain are in financial trouble on their long-term care policies. They\u2019re charging far more for new policies, and sharply raising the premiums of old ones.\n\n\u201cThe industry is a state of severe decline,\u201d Belth said. \u201cCompanies \u2026 don\u2019t see a way to successfully market the product and make money on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Aging,Cost and Quality,Insurance,Syndicate,Long-Term Care,Premiums", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Seniors slammed with big premium increases face tough choices.", "title": "Long-Term Care Insurance: Less Bang, More Buck", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20160317/longterm-care-insurance-less-bang-more-buck", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Seniors slammed with big premium increases face tough choices.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1613\"", "article_summary": "About 4.8 million people were covered by long-term care policies in 2014.\nThose that remain are in financial trouble on their long-term care policies.\nMary Julia Klimenko thought she was prudent 20 years ago when she invested in a long-term care insurance policy, one she believed would help pay for the care she\u2019d need as she aged.\nIf I drop my insurance, I\u2019ve thrown away all that money,\u201d Klimenko said.\n\u201cIf I pay less, they\u2019re not going to cover what I need.\u201dLong-term care insurance was supposed to help the middle class ease the financial burden of expensive in-home or nursing home care that now can top $90,000 a year."}
