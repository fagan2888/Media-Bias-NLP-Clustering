BEIRUT -- The Latest on the civil war in Syria (all times local):

9 p.m.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has told Russia's defense minister that the Syrian conflict can only be resolved through a political process.

The official IRNA news agency reported the talks in Tehran on Sunday, and said visiting Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Rouhani. It did not elaborate.

Russia and Iran are key allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.

Moscow and Washington have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Syria that they can take to their respective allies on the ground. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier Sunday that a "provisional agreement" had been reached, without elaborating.

Russia also has a contract with Iran to deliver long-range S-300 air defense missiles, and Tehran has expressed interest in other Russian weapons such as Su-30 fighter jets.

Syrian state TV says the death toll from three blasts in a Shiite suburb of Damascus has reached 50, with more than 200 wounded.

It says the bombings on Sunday targeted a vegetable market in the afternoon during rush hour.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a triple blast in Sayyida Zeinab, saying two IS fighters set off a car bomb before detonating their explosive belts.

Residents said the attack was about a kilometer (0.6 mile) from one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines and did not damage it.

A triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month.

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a triple blast in a Damascus suburb that killed at least 22 people.

The Aamaq news agency, which is affiliated with the group, said two IS fighters detonated a car bomb before blowing up their explosive belts in Sayyida Zeinab, a Shiite neighborhood.

Residents said the attack was about a kilometer (0.6 mile) from one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines and did not damage it.

Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said the blasts killed 22 people, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 31 were killed and dozens wounded.

Different figures are not uncommon in the chaotic aftermath of such attacks.

Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV says explosions in a suburb of the Syrian capital killed 22 people and wounded dozens.

Al-Manar said Sunday's blasts were caused by a car bomb and two suicide attackers. Hezbollah is fighting alongside Syrian government forces and maintains a large presence in the Sayyida Zeinab area, where the blasts took place.

Syrian state TV showed still images of people running, damaged homes and billowing smoke. It provided no death toll. State TV earlier said two of the blasts were car bombs while the other two were suicide attackers on foot.

Sayyida Zeinab is home to one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines.

The blasts came hours after two explosions in the central city of Homs killed and wounded scores of people.

Syrian state TV says two blasts in the central city of Homs have killed 14 people and wounded 29.

The TV report said Sunday's blasts struck in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa - a frequent target for similar explosions.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first blast was caused by a vehicle rigged with explosives. It said it was not immediately clear if the second was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attacker wearing an explosive belt.

Homs, once dubbed the capital of the Syrian revolution, has been hit with a wave of explosions in recent months, killing and wounding scores of people.
