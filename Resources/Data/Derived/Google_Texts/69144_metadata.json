In their overly cautious attempt to appear \u201cfair and balanced,\u201d as Fox News calls it, D.C. bureaus bent over backwards to lay equal blame for the crisis on both political parties.\n\nI understand the need to present both sides. I\u2019ve sat in thousands of newsroom story meetings over four decades watching the sausage being made. No newsroom wants to be accused of bias. But that often means both sides of a crisis get blamed 50/50.\n\nWe are long past the days when we would do a story on African-American civil rights and then be sure to get \u201cthe other side\u201d from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAnd yet we still give credence to extremists who insist their points of view should have equal weight, like those who want Creationism taught right alongside Evolution in the schools.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how many smart people fall for D.C.\u2019s big lie: the folly of false equivalence.\n\nTake someone as bright as Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks. During the previous debt ceiling crisis in 2011, Schultz proposed that he and other big donors cut-off political contributions to politicians on both sides until it was solved.\n\nBut then came an embarrassing interview Schultz did with Jake Tapper, then with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Tapper had to educate Schultz on the fact that some members of Congress actually did compromise and did try to reach across the aisle to get things done. Should they be punished too?\n\nThe fact is the Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court and ratified by the re-election of President Obama (since voters chose not just a candidate but his policies as well).\n\nBut then came this fall\u2019s blackmail, led by political jihadists who, in many cases, simply hate government. They aren\u2019t far removed from their predecessors who hated Social Security, Medicare, welfare and anything that smacked of \u201centitlements.\u201d (See Calbuzz from Monday.)\n\nAnd members of the Tea Party (known as \u201cTeaBillies\u201d in some circles), will continue to be political extortionists as long as the news media and the rest of the public give them equal weight on the sanity scale.\n\nJust last week, financial guru Warren Buffet warned against tying controversial issues to the country\u2019s ability to pay its bills. The financial sovereignty of the United States should be sacrosanct, and discussed without linking it to the issue du jour.\n\nThe good news is some voters are able to wade through the false attempts at equal blame. This week\u2019s Washington Post-ABC News poll found 74 percent of Americans disapprove of how Republicans in Congress handled the debt ceiling negotiations, 61 percent disapprove of Democrats and 53 percent disapprove of President Obama.\n\nRepublicans getting slightly more of the blame may spur them into wrestling control of their party back before they face their own default \u2013 a political one.\n\nHank Plante is an Emmy and Peabody-winning reporter who spent three decades covering California politics for the CBS TV stations in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
