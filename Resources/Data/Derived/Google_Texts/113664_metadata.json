Economists called it good news, as the number was less than 300,000; that\u2019s the line they say separates good news from bad. But it isn\u2019t much less, and other news seems very bad. In February, housing starts plunged 17 percent. Inventories are high. Demand is low. Job growth is anemic. Still, economists say things are going so well we can raise interest rates. They call that good news \u2014 though they don\u2019t say for whom.\n\nThere\u2019ll be more news this week: home prices, consumer confidence, new growth figures. In our casino economy we hang on these reports like blackjack players waiting for a dealer to turn the next card. Republicans and Democrats alike believe growth will cure all our ills. President Obama and Hillary Clinton call it their No. 1 economic priority. Despite all evidence to the contrary, they still believe a rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nSome call Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s economic worldview \u2018neoliberal.\u2019 Like \u2018liberal\u2019 or \u2018conservative,\u2019 it\u2019s an imprecise word meant to signify a cluster of opinions; among them that globalization is inevitable and benign and that the revolution in information technology is fast democratizing commerce and politics. Neoliberals love fiscal austerity and free trade and are suckers for privatization, deregulation and \u2018education reform,\u2019 which they say will keep us competitive.\n\nLike the neoconservatives with whom they often ally on military matters, neoliberals seem to regard our present political and economic arrangements as civilization\u2019s final flowering, as close to perfect as one can get in a fallen world. It\u2019s the faith that made Bush think Iraqis would greet us as liberators\u2013who wouldn\u2019t want to be us\u2013 and why Obama bet his presidency on economic recovery rather than reform. It\u2019s our establishment orthodoxy, the \u2018bipartisan consensus\u2019 we\u2019re forever chasing. It\u2019s killing us.\n\nIn the neoliberal narrative, geniuses reinvent the world in their garages; risk takers invest in innovation; technology and trade spawns endless opportunity. It\u2019s a land without ideology; a true meritocracy where anyone with pluck and grit is sure to rise. (So long as they\u2019re really, really smart.) Above all it\u2019s an engine of prosperity, the only sure means by which to broaden and strengthen the middle class.\n\n*\n\nReal life is nothing like the neoliberal narrative. As PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel says, our overhyped innovations tend toward mere gadgetry and away from such vital areas as health and transportation. One reason: those stories about geniuses in garages and their angel investors are mostly made up. In 2014 venture capital funding hit $48.3 billion, but just $700 million of it went to \u2018seed stage\u2019 projects. Who really funds the little guys? The same folks who brought you the microchip, the Internet and GPS. Last year the federal government\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research Program alone lent or gave the real pioneers $2.4 billion; more than triple their take from \u2018venture capitalists.\u2019\n\nIf the story of our not-so-bold investors disappoints, it may matter less than you think, in that technology and trade never really lived up to their billing. In 2005, Tom Friedman, the Candide of globalization, said \u201cthe world is flat\u201d; meaning technology was a great leveling force that would soon topple the old political and economic oligarchies and give everyone a chance to be an entrepreneur, or at least work in a call center. America has since grown more economically stratified and politically corrupt and has fewer jobs than it did eight years ago.\n\nEarly critics who said the new information technology would lay waste to labor were dismissed as Luddites. Twenty years on it still kills more jobs than it creates; even \u2018serious people\u2019 now say this could be the first new technology wave to result in a net job loss. As for trade, the tide let in by NAFTA sank more middle-class boats than it lifted, which accounts for the resistance to Obama\u2019s fast track scheme.\n\nIn real life, we\u2019re a nation of middle men and corporate toll collectors, where health insurers get 20 cents on the dollar for services done everywhere else for a nickel or less; where big banks shun small business while raking in merger fees and taking a cut of every purchase charged to a credit card; where Comcast\u2019s pipeline is worth more than NBC\u2019s oil; where Google gorges on ad revenues that once supported world-class journalism. We\u2019re about cartels, not startups, not bound to the future but mortgaged to the past.\n\nIn real life, the middle class is in limbo. In the seven years since Wall Street\u2019s crash, stocks, profits and CEO pay are at historic highs, but wages haven\u2019t budged and we\u2019re still years away from adding back all the jobs we lost. Millions of older Americans who lost their pensions and the equity in their homes will retire broke. Millions of younger Americans fear they\u2019ll never have their parents\u2019 opportunities. They all know it will take more than a bailout or a stimulus to get our economy, or their lives, back on track. You can\u2019t prime a broken pump. We need real reform and everybody knows it; everybody, that is, except those in charge.\n\n*\n\nThe gap between elite and popular opinion on these issues is wide. Tension boiled over on the right long ago, but Democrats have mostly kept mum. It reflects their fear of Republicans, and the fact that Obama and Clinton are staunch neoliberals. Bill Clinton, more than anyone, made the consensus bipartisan. Hillary\u2019s rhetoric has a more populist hue now, but changing her actual views won\u2019t be easy for her.\n\nThe backlash against neoliberalism cuts across all political categories. If the Democrats resist debating it, progressives must force a debate. But they too may be reluctant, not because of any risk\u2014there\u2019s greater risk in silence\u2014but because they don\u2019t know what to say. Many progressive critics of neoliberalism are just like Republican critics of Obamacare; they hate it, but can offer no alternative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neoliberal fantasy world is filled with daring entrepreneurs competing in a meritocracy.
