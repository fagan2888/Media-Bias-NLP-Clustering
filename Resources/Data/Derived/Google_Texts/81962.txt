Aurora Police said Sunday that they are still sorting out potential charges after a road rage accident involving an automobile and motorcycle on Interstate 225.

Police are trying to determine whether the driver of the car that caused the accident, Daniell Marie Buffum, 24, of Aurora, should be charged.

The passenger in her car, Michael Christopher Hall, 25, of Aurora, was arrested and faces several charges including first-degree assault and attempted homicide. He is being held on bond.

At about 4:40 p.m. Saturday, officers were dispatched to an accident involving a motorcycle and an automobile north of the Illiff Avenue exit northbound I-225.

They found a Honda CBR 600 motorcycle on the right shoulder and a 2005 Silver Chrysler Sebring. Police said both vehicles had rolled several times.

Witnesses told officers that a passenger in the Chrysler northbound from East Iliff Avenue was having a dispute with the rider on the motorcycle.

“It is unknown at this time exactly what the dispute was about,” the Aurora Police Department said in a news release.

The Chrysler began moving into the right lane, edging the motorcycle to the right, according to a police statement.

Hall, the passenger in the Chrysler, grabbed the steering wheel and jerked it, forcing the Chrysler into the motorcycle.

Both drivers lost control after impact, the release said.

The motorcycle driver, whose name and age have not been released, suffered serious injuries and was transported to an area hospital.

The driver of the Chrysler, Buffum, was also injured when her vehicle overturned and was taken to an area hospital for treatment.

Hall was not injured.

Police said speed and alcohol do not appear to be factors in the incident and remain investigating.
