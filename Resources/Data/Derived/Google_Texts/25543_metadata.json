Nelson Mandela, revered for his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa, and Margaret Thatcher, the \u201cIron Lady\u201d who imposed her will on Britain\u2019s politics and economy, were among notables who died in 2013.\n\nMandela, who died Dec. 5 at age 95, was considered a master of forgiveness. He became South Africa\u2019s first black president after spending 27 years in prison for championing equality against the white-minority government, and he inspired the world by seeking a relatively peaceful transition of power.\n\nAs Britain\u2019s only female prime minister, Thatcher ruled for 11 years and showed an unshakable faith in the free market, leaving behind a leaner government and more prosperous nation. While she had fierce critics, praise for her leadership came in from around the world when she died in April at 87.\n\nOther political figures who died this year included Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, former Italian premier Giulio Andreotti, Poland\u2019s ex-prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, France\u2019s Pierre Mauroy, and Hungary\u2019s Gyula Horn, prominent past mayors of New York and Beijing, Ed Koch and Chen Xitong, and former U.S. Senators Frank Lautenberg and Harry F. Byrd.\n\nAlso dying in 2013 was a man whose invention you may hold as you read this. Doug Engelbart, who died in July, invented the computer mouse, among other things. Others from the world of science and technology who died this year included the Manhattan Project\u2019s Donald F. Hornig, Nobel Prize winners Frederick Sanger, Robert Edwards and Kenneth Wilson, audio pioneers Ray Dolby and Amar Bose and astronauts C. Gordon Fullerton and Scott Carpenter.\n\nIn the arena of arts and entertainment, this year saw the death of one who was hugely influential though not technically an entertainer at all. Roger Ebert, who died in April, was America\u2019s most popular film critic, telling audiences which movies to see or avoid with his famous thumbs-up or thumbs-down reviews.\n\nOthers from the entertainment world who died this year included actors James Gandolfini, Peter O\u2019Toole, Jane Kean, Annette Funicello, Jean Stapleton, Bonnie Franklin, Cory Monteith, Frank Thornton and Conrad Bain, as well as swimming star Esther Williams and Bollywood villain Pran. Musicians included George Jones, Van Cliburn, Lou Reed, Donald Byrd, Ray Manzarek, Bebo Valdes, Mindy McCready, Chrissy Amphle and Chris Kelly. Among others: writer Tom Clancy, director Nagisa Oshima and ballerina Maria Tallchief.\n\nHere is a roll call of some of the people who died in 2013.
