But with low physician reimbursement rates, the problem could get even worse.\n\nFor a typical quick patient visit, Dr. Doug Gerard, a Connecticut internist, told NPR a private insurer would pay $100 while Medicare would pay around $80. But Obamacare plans are more likely to pay closer to $80, which Gerard says is unsustainable for his practice.\n\n\u201cI cannot accept a plan [in which] potentially commercial-type reimbursement rates were now going to be reimbursed at Medicare rates,\u201d Dr. Gerard told NPR. \u201cYou have to maintain a certain mix in private practice between the low reimbursers and the high reimbursers to be able to keep the lights on.\u201d\n\nNarrow networks have become a hallmark of many Obamacare exchange plans, as one of few options left to insurance companies that allows them to save money by lowering reimbursement rates and covering fewer providers. In the health-care law\u2019s first year, 70 percent of all Obamacare plan networks were either narrow or ultra-narrow, according to an analysis from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nBut doctors are feeling even more financial pressure due to the changes and many believe there\u2019s a risk that Obamacare insurance will go the way of Medicaid, where patients still struggle to find a doctor after low reimbursement rates led many physicians to stop accepting it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most physicians know what they\u2019re being reimbursed,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cOnly when they start seeing some of those rates come through will they realize how low the rates are they agreed to.\u201d\n\nIf Obamacare coverage continues on its current track, exchange customers could face a lower level of care than those who buy coverage in the private market.\n\n\u201cI think it could lead potentially to this kind of distinction that there are these different tiers of quality of care,\u201d Connecticut Obamacare chief Kevin Counihan told NPR. \u201cThat\u2019s been something, at least in our state, that we\u2019re trying to work against. And the carriers are, as well.\u201d\n\nThe problem is especially bad for private practices like Gerard\u2019s, where physicians\u2019 income is directly tied to reimbursements. But hospitals \u2014 especially top-tier ones that treat the most difficult diseases \u2014 are also increasingly rejecting the low reimbursement rates. The nation\u2019s best cancer treatment centers are often covered by very few exchange plans in their states; if Obamacare customers end up with a difficult-to-treat cancer, they\u2019re likely to face a lower quality of care right off the bat.\n\n\u201cYou get what you pay for,\u201d said Connecticut State Medical Society president-elect Bob Russo. \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince [doctors] that they\u2019re not losing money doing their job, then it\u2019s a problem. And they haven\u2019t been able to convince people of that.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Obamacare plans have shrunk payments to physicians so much that some doctors say exchanges may end up offering a lower quality of care compared to private", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare plans have shrunk payments to physicians so much that some doctors say they won't be able to afford to accept Obamacare coverage,\u00a0NPR reports.
