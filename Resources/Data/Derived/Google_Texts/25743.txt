Carl Mark Force, one of the DEA agents responsible for the takedown of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, pled guilty to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin earlier this week, as Nick Gillespie noted here.

Exactly how much bitcoin Force stole during his time as a DEA agent is unclear, but on top of the money laundering, he is charged with multiple conflicts of interest, including one for inking a $240,000 movie deal about the Silk Road with 20th Century Fox.

Sentencing won't take place until October, but as Ars Technica reports, chances are slim that he'll receive anything close to Ulbricht's life sentence:

The plea deal doesn't include a specific sentence. The maximum sentence for money laundering is 20 years. Force has agreed to pay about $500,000 (Â£320,000) in restitution, according to his attorney. Around $150,000 of that has already been paid
