ERIE, Pa. (AP) - One of the largest employers in northwestern Pennsylvania says it’ll reduce its workforce through retirements and layoffs.

The Erie Times-News reports (http://bit.ly/1jRtYV4 ) that Lord Corp. isn’t saying yet how many jobs will be cut or where. The North Carolina-headquartered conglomerate produces materials for industries including aerospace and oil and gas production. It employs about 3,000 worldwide.

But it says it’s facing difficult market conditions, including downturns in defense, agriculture, oil and gas and construction, as well as currency fluctuations.

Lord recently unveiled a new $100 million facility in suburban Erie and has received state tax breaks in exchange for retaining its existing employment in Erie and increasing the local workforce.

The company was founded in Erie more than 90 years ago by Hugh Lord.
