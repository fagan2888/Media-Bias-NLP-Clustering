Advances in technology have made that practice more feasible, but some states are taking a more cautious approach.\n\nTexas and Arkansas have instituted rules that require a patient to be seen in-person by a doctor before conducting telemedicine appointments. The Texas Medical Board adopted the mandate on April 10. Experts believe the new requirements may have a chilling effect on telemedicine use, but differ on whether the development signals the start of a policy trend.\n\nGreg Billings, executive director of the Center for Telehealth and e-Health Law (CTeL), said he feels the decisions in Texas and Arkansas won\u2019t carry over to other states, largely due to each jurisdiction dealing with their own unique circumstances. He did predict, however, that Texas could see a decline in the amount of telehealth visits because of the rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the, \u2018Can someone diagnose my toddler\u2019s ear infection over a webcam\u2019 that\u2019s going to be chilled, until such time as the Texas Medical Board can be convinced that a medical encounter can be done in the home safely with video, with a first-time patient encounter with peripherals and diagnostics,\u201d Billings said.\n\nPeripherals are medical instruments connected to someone\u2019s computer that can be used to transmit data about a patient to a doctor observing them from a remote location.\n\nWhile the Texas Medical Board has since clarified that an interactive video encounter satisfies the \u201cin-person\u201d mandate, as opposed to a phone call or recorded video transmitted over the Web, it comes with a catch. The prospective patient needs to be accompanied by a trained professional during the visit, according to Dr. Dale Alverson, medical director of the University of New Mexico\u2019s Center for Telehealth.\n\nFor example, a person accompanied by a physician\u2019s assistant in a rural west Texas medical clinic located can virtually meet with a doctor over the Web in Dallas. That \u201cinitial visit\u201d would comply with the rules. But a mother whose infant child has a fever and bad rash in the middle of the night couldn\u2019t speak with that same Dallas doctor over a live video stream, unless a trained medical professional was with them.\n\nAlverson felt that nuance could be something other state medical boards consider, which could pose a threat to telemedicine proliferation in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt is a danger, and that\u2019s why we have to work collaboratively with our medical boards to address their concerns about patient safety and quality of care,\u201d Alverson said. \u201cYou can use telemedicine and still follow reasonable standards.\u201d\n\nPractical Struggles\n\nThe practice of telemedicine has a number of hurdles to overcome. From licensure issues to reimbursement for services, doctors, insurance companies and state legislatures are often at odds on what makes sense and why.\n\nTexas\u2019 new rules were, in Alverson\u2019s opinion, an overreaction of direct-to-consumer marketing where telemedicine technology vendors offer health-care advice and consultation. That has brought a lot of attention to the safety and quality of care of various telemedicine applications, which may not be operated with the same reasonable standard of care that is expected during a face-to-face visit.\n\nFor example, a doctor would typically look in a child\u2019s ear if he or she had an earache and if the observation showed the ear was infected, an antibiotic drug would likely be prescribed. But if that meeting is over video and no peripheral device to enable a deeper look into the child\u2019s ear was available, a doctor wouldn\u2019t be able to confirm that infection.\n\nThat issue has gotten a lot of attention in Texas, as Teladoc, a telehealth provider that offers medical consultations by phone and video, has sued the Texas Medical Board over its new rules, claiming it illegally limits competition.\n\nAlverson noted that Teladoc and the Texas Medical Board don\u2019t have a \u201cfriendly relationship,\u201d and while he had no proof to support the claim, said he felt the new telemedicine rules could be a bit of retaliation. He added that the move could be problematic, particularly with the shortage of physicians in the wake of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage, and more people seeking care.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful we don\u2019t go overboard and take away valuable services,\" Alverson said, \"and that\u2019s where we have some fear the Texas Medical Board is going a bit to the extreme, and creating barriers to using valuable IT tools.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Texas has joined Arkansas as the only two states that require patients to meet in-person with doctors before assuming a telemedicine relationship.", "pubDate": "2015-05-20", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/medical.jpg", "title": "Will New State Health-Care Mandates Stifle Telemedicine Progress?"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3e3\"", "article_summary": "The Texas Medical Board adopted the mandate on April 10.\nTexas\u2019 new rules were, in Alverson\u2019s opinion, an overreaction of direct-to-consumer marketing where telemedicine technology vendors offer health-care advice and consultation.\nTexas and Arkansas have instituted rules that require a patient to be seen in-person by a doctor before conducting telemedicine appointments.\n\u201cYou can use telemedicine and still follow reasonable standards.\u201dPractical StrugglesThe practice of telemedicine has a number of hurdles to overcome.\nAlverson noted that Teladoc and the Texas Medical Board don\u2019t have a \u201cfriendly relationship,\u201d and while he had no proof to support the claim, said he felt the new telemedicine rules could be a bit of retaliation."}
