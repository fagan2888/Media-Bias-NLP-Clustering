Renisha McBride was shot in the face, according to the autopsy released today by the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Gina Damron and Elisha Anderson report in the Free Press that the autopsy confirms the 19-year-old was not shot in the back of the head, as her family initially had said.

“There was an entrance shotgun wound to the face, with no evidence of close-range discharge of a firearm noted on the skin surrounding this wound,” the report said.

Controversy and questions have surrounded McBride’s death since she was shot on a Dearborn Heights porch in the early morning of Nov. 2.
