No, not that Brandon Marshall.

On Tuesday, the Broncos announced that they moved linebacker Brandon Marshall — of the same name as the former Broncos receiver — off their practice squad and onto the 53-man roster. Marshall takes the spot vacated by linebacker Von Miller, whom the team placed on injured reserve Tuesday.

Miller tore the ACL in his right knee in the first quarter of Denver’s game Sunday against the Houston Texans.

An MRI on Monday confirmed the injury, and Miller will miss the rest of the season as he recovers from his surgery, which has not yet taken place.

Marshall played in five games as a rookie for the Jacksonville Jaguars after being selected in the fifth round of the 2012 draft. He spent the first 16 weeks of this season on the Broncos’ practice squad.

The team signed second-year receiver Nathan Palmer to its practice squad to fill Marshall’s position.

Palmer spent most of this season on the Miami Dolphins’ practice squad and played in five games for the Indianapolis Colts in 2012.

In eight regular-season games this season — Sunday would have been his ninth, but he lasted only a quarter — Miller logged five sacks, well off pace of the 18½ he had last season, when he also made the AFC’s Pro Bowl team. He spent the first six games of this season serving a suspension. Linebacker Nate Irving likely will absorb the bulk of Miller’s playing time.
