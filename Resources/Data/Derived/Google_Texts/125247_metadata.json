But the online brokers, eager to tap a new market of people who\u2019ll qualify for federal subsidies, learned shortly before the Oct. 1 launch that they wouldn\u2019t be able to offer exchange plans right away.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe brokers say the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services didn\u2019t act fast enough to let them integrate their websites with the IT systems supporting the federal insurance marketplaces. They hope to get everything linked up with the feds in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI think it just comes down to they weren\u2019t ready,\u201d said Michael Mahoney, vice president of consumer marketing for Web broker GoHealth. \u201cLike anybody else, when they realized they weren\u2019t going to be ready with a variety of things, they have to look at circumstances and prioritize.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe online brokers\u2019 websites, which predate the health care law, offer an experience similar to what HealthCare.gov is supposed to provide. They allow consumers to shop and compare health plans \u2014 until now, only for insurers they\u2019ve had financial partnerships with. They\u2019ll now have to offer all the plans available on the federal-run exchanges, even if they don\u2019t financially benefit from the enrollment. And they\u2019ll let consumers know whether they can get government help to purchase insurance.\n\nThe Web brokers say system integration is the last step they need to take before connecting to the federal-run portal known as the data hub, which links several government agencies to determine subsidy eligibility. CMS says it\u2019s working closely with the Web brokers to bring them on board.\n\n\u201cWeb-based brokers are one of many ways in which consumers can comparison shop for health coverage,\u201d CMS spokesman Brian Cook said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken steps to make brokers\u2019 ability to sell marketplace plans as seamless as possible \u2014 giving them an application programming interface, user agreements and a public use file before the marketplace opened.\u201d\n\nThe online brokers are counting on new business from their partnerships with CMS, so they aren\u2019t ready to write HealthCare.gov\u2019s obituary just yet.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obamacare online: File not found)\n\n\u201cThese government exchanges will work \u2026 there are no ifs and buts about it,\u201d said eHealthInsurance CEO Gary Lauer, whose company lobbied the administration particularly hard to secure regulatory approval to offer subsidy-eligible health plans. \u201cThe real question is how well they work and how effective are they going to be.\u201d\n\nLauer said his own website has seen an uptick in traffic since the health care law\u2019s Oct. 1, launch. EHealth is still offering individual health plans, just off the exchanges so they aren\u2019t subsidy eligible. But those plans still must comply with Obamacare\u2019s new insurance market rules \u2014 including a ban on discriminating against pre-existing conditions and a mandated set of benefits.\n\nChini Krishnan, the CEO of Web broker Getinsured, said his company is preaching patience, pointing out that consumers can wait another two months to enroll and still get benefits when they kick in on Jan. 1. Though the open enrollment period lasts through March, Dec. 15 is considered the last day to enroll to receive benefits starting after the new year begins.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare timeline)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re educating them that you have all the way until Dec. 15,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cIn these first two weeks, what\u2019s more important is to educate yourself and understand [your options].\u201d\n\nTrying to leverage new Obamacare opportunities, the Web brokers also have announced private-sector partnerships in recent weeks. Walgreens will direct customers with coverage questions to GoHealth. Meanwhile, tax preparation company Jackson Hewitt will help customers determine eligibility for premium subsidies, then send them to Getinsured for more information about health plan choices.\n\nThe Web brokers are willing to give the Obama administration some room to address the HealthCare.gov problems \u2014 those that instantly became apparent and those still undiscovered. But they said they wouldn\u2019t have rolled out such a glitch-filled product.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is in the private sector, in the e-commerce world, that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Lauer said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They say the CMS didn\u2019t act fast enough to let them integrate their websites with IT systems.", "title": "Web brokers wait to sell Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/web-brokers-aca-obamacare-health-insurance-exchanges-98353.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/10/obamacare_signup4_reu_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (652),Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services (8),Affordable Care Act (485)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They say the CMS didn\u2019t act fast enough to let them integrate their websites with IT systems.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bad\"", "article_summary": "| REUTERS Web brokers wait to sell ObamacareThe Obama administration has enlisted a small army of online brokers to help sell new Obamacare health plans, but those sites have been sidelined in the health care law\u2019s first two weeks as the feds struggle to sort out their own glitch-filled website.\nThe Web brokers are willing to give the Obama administration some room to address the HealthCare.gov problems \u2014 those that instantly became apparent and those still undiscovered.\nCMS says it\u2019s working closely with the Web brokers to bring them on board.\n\u201cIn these first two weeks, what\u2019s more important is to educate yourself and understand [your options].\u201dTrying to leverage new Obamacare opportunities, the Web brokers also have announced private-sector partnerships in recent weeks.\nThe online brokers\u2019 websites offer an experience similar to HealthCare.gov."}
