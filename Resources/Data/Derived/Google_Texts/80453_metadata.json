But he is going north to direct the medical services at the brand-new 40,000-square-foot ICHS Shoreline medical-dental clinic at 165th and Aurora, slated to open in August.\n\nSays ICHS Medical Director Grace Wang of Hirayama\u2019s redeployment: \u201cYou always put your best foot forward, right? We\u2019re sending our very best to help get things set up in Shoreline.\u201d\n\nHirayama said many of his South Seattle patients have met the recent announcement of his move to Shoreline\u2014a \u201chard decision\u201d\u2014with great sadness. \u201cSome of my patients will follow me up there,\u201d Hirayama said. \u201cBut a lot of them won\u2019t. For me, the switch is for two reasons. One, it\u2019s closer to my home in North Seattle. Two, it\u2019s a new challenge, an opportunity to build a coherent new team and try innovative ideas in a smaller setting.\u201d\n\nHirayama grew up near Pittsburgh and attended Oberlin College, majoring in chemistry. He later attended medical school at the University of Pittsburgh, interning at the Chinatown Health Clinic in New York City, now the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center. There, he developed a keen interest in community health and first heard about a very similar clinic in Seattle: ICHS.\n\nMoving to the West Coast, Hirayama began his residency at Group Health Cooperative and started volunteering at ICHS in 1987. At the time, the agency staffing had dwindled as a result of severe Reagan era budget cuts, even though the number of patients being served had swelled dramatically with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees to the region.\n\nHirayama was hired at ICHS in 1989. At the time, he said, the obstetric care was provided by two midwives in a separate location in the Bush Hotel across the street from the main storefront clinic. After the second floor of the clinic was remodeled, the program moved in. Women\u2019s health services began to grow with the addition of the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program, a nutrition program supporting new families.\n\n\u201cAs we started to move from midwives delivering babies to having family doctors on staff delivering babies and attending to the ongoing health of the infants, ICHS began to really grow,\u201d Hirayama said. \u201cWe grew through word-of-mouth. Women are the brokers of health care for their families, and they bring in their whole extended families.\u201d\n\nWatching ICHS blossom from a bare-bones International District storefront clinic in the lean Reagan era into a multi-clinic health care provider in the era of the Affordable Care Act has brought Dr. Kimo \u201ca lot of good memories.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big part of my growing as a physician.\u201d\n\nHow does Hirayama unwind from the relentless stresses of work? He plays volleyball in an Asian church league for those over 40. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cMy shoulder is starting to go.\u201d He also goes fly fishing in Central Washington and Snoqualmie Pass: \u201cIt\u2019s challenging tying your own flies. I make some of my own rods.\u201d\n\nHirayama also enjoys making wheel-thrown pottery, a pastime he began in college. \u201cActually, doing this is great for doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt teaches manual dexterity and steadiness.\u201d\n\nDuring one New Year\u2019s party, he made bowls and gave them out as gifts to each of the 15 guests.\n\n\u201cI have a closet full of pottery rejects,\u201d Hirayama said. \u201cI looked at them again and I realized, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re not that bad.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat kind of future does Hirayama see for ICHS? \u201cOur area of expertise is the Asian Pacific American community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have that. We\u2019ll serve other populations as well, and that will depend on the providers and staff we bring on board. To grow, it will be helpful for us to have a strong nurse practitioner training program. We\u2019ll also need to be able to recruit family doctors\u2014it would be good to look at having a residency program in the future.\u201d\n\nHirayama describes the current time for ICHS as \u201creally crazy,\u201d with the addition of mobile dental services late last year, the opening of the new Bellevue clinic in May and the imminent launch of the new Shoreline clinic.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge has been patient volume,\u201d Hirayama said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fairly high.\u201d\n\nHirayama said he believes that the new Shoreline clinic will attract new Korean American and Chinese American patients, in addition to students from Shoreline Community College. He looks forward to serving them with the same care he brought to his work with patients in the International District.\n\nMeanwhile, Hirayama\u2019s patients\u2014learning of his impending departure\u2014have been wishing him well. Suet Tai Chin, a Beacon Hill resident who relied on Dr. Kimo as her family doctor for over 20 years, said she will miss him greatly. \u201cHe delivered three of my four kids,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me I am the only person that he has delivered three kids.\u201d\n\nStuart Chin, the youngest son of Suet Tai Chin, a freshman at the University of Washington, said, \u201cDr. Kimo has an adventurous spirit. He loves reaching out to many different people from different parts of the world. He is always busy, but attentive and careful when he meets me for appointments.\u201d\n\nChin\u2019s sister Melinda added, \u201cDr. Kimo wasn\u2019t just a doctor. He made you feel like family.\u201d\n\nAmanda Chin, the eldest of the Suet Tai Chin\u2019s children, summed it up for many others: \u201cHe\u2019s not just my doctor. He\u2019s the community\u2019s doctor.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Ron Chew is International Examiner board advisor and the director of the ICHS Foundation.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde613\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Kimo Hirayama to direct medical services at ICHS Shoreline Ron ChewAfter 25 years as one of the anchor physicians at International District Community Health Services (ICHS), Dr. Kimo Hirayama is packing up his medical bags and heading north.\nBut he is going north to direct the medical services at the brand-new 40,000-square-foot ICHS Shoreline medical-dental clinic at 165th and Aurora, slated to open in August.\nHe later attended medical school at the University of Pittsburgh, interning at the Chinatown Health Clinic in New York City, now the Charles B.
