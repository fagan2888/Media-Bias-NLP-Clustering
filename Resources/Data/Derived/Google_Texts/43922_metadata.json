We make up our faces and all of this. Behind all that lipstick, we have some issues,\" Fowler explains. \"If we just open up and tell other people about it, they will know that the person next to them is going through the exact same thing. \"\n\nThe idea behind this event is to help women physically, mentally and spiritually to let go of their past issues and push forward to become stronger and better as females.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A local church is helping to empower women with a three-day conference.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "A local church is helping to empower women with a three-day conference.", "title": "\"Uncovering the Lipstick\" Conference Aims to Empower Women", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Uncovering-the-Lipstick-Conference-Aims-to-Empower-Women-293272911.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5D9/222/5D922221CE3E4FB28E13B53BECC65275", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C60/249/C6024951BFB0447690935C14C08FE7B0.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A local church is helping to empower women with a three-day conference.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Uncovering-the-Lipstick-Conference-Aims-to-Empower-Women-293272911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/lipstick7.jpg", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "\"Uncovering the Lipstick\" Conference Aims to Empower Women", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Uncovering the Lipstick Conference Aims"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc53\"", "article_summary": "Behind all that lipstick, we have some issues,\" Fowler explains.\n\"We, as women, we walk around with our lipstick on.\nIt's called \"Uncovering the Lipstick.\"\nOrganizer Bridget Fowler says one of the main messages she hopes the women take away is that whatever you're dealing with, you're not alone.\nIf you opened the doors to New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church in Meridian Saturday, you would have found a room full of beautiful, empowered women."}
