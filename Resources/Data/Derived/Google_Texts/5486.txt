MONTGOMERY, AL, March 14, 2014, (LifeSiteNews.com) - Beginning April 1, taxpayers in Alabama will help fund various long-acting contraceptives, thanks to a recent change to the state’s Medicaid program.

The procedures covered by the new policy include the insertion of implantable subdermal contraceptives, insertion of intrauterine contraceptive devices, and insertion of an IUD.

The IUD (Intra-Uterine Device) is a device meant to prevent fertilization but it also works as an abortifacient, should fertilization occur.

Alabama, which was named by Gallup as the most conservative state in the country, is no stranger in the fight against the public subsidization of immoral contraceptives.

In October, the State of Alabama joined EWTN in a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, specifically targeted at the contraception mandate. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange stated, “This isn’t just about who ultimately has to pay. It is about the government forcing EWTN to participate in a scheme that violates its religious beliefs.”

“The freedom of religion, and to believe as conscience requires, is our ‘first freedom’ under the United States Constitution,” says Strange. “The people of Alabama have recognized the importance of this freedom and have enshrined it in their Constitution as well. Alabama law does not allow anyone to be forced to offer a product that is against his or her religious beliefs or conscience.”
