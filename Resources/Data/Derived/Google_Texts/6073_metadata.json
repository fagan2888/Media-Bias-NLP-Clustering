Renee Ellmers, R-NC. House leaders instead voted on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act \u2013 but reassured pro-life leaders the ban on abortions due to fetal pain will come to the floor for a vote this year.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, just released the communique with the House leadership's agenda for the month of February. Voting on the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not listed on it.\n\nMajor national pro-life organizations consistently rank the bill, introduced by Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona, as their top legislative goal.\n\nInstead, the memo begins by congratulating members for passing 27 bills so far, including a measure \u201cprohibiting taxpayer funding of abortions.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy lays out each week's priority and messaging opportunity during the shortest month of the year.\n\nCongress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe will stop the President from coercing states to adopt Common Core standards and we will consider proposals to replicate high-performing charter schools,\u201d McCarthy wrote.\n\nMembers also pledge to vote against any plan to tax 529 educational savings plans, reinforce tax benefits for small businesses, and discuss \u201cthe best way to continue to challenge the President\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty.\u201d\n\nYou may read the full memo here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Congress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core.", "title": "House of Representatives won\u2019t vote on 20-week abortion ban next month", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/flag_and_dome.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/house-of-representatives-wont-vote-on-20-week-abortion-ban-next-month", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Congress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core."}, "description": "Congress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, just released the communique with the House leadership's agenda for the month of February.\nThe House of Representatives will not vote on a bill that would restrict abortion to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy during the next month, according to a memo released by the leadership today.\nHouse leaders instead voted on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act \u2013 but reassured pro-life leaders the ban on abortions due to fetal pain will come to the floor for a vote this year.\nMajor national pro-life organizations consistently rank the bill, introduced by Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona, as their top legislative goal.\nCongress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core."}
