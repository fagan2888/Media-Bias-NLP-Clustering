Democratic voters are getting worried about their party’s prospects against Republicans in the 2014 congressional elections, according to poll results released Friday.

Only 43 percent of likely Democratic voters think their party will trump the GOP in the midterm elections. That’s compared with about 55 percent of Republicans who believe their party will do better, the Pew/USA Today poll found.

But William Galston, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution focusing on government, told Al Jazeera he was surprised that the difference in the parties’ outlooks wasn’t bigger.

“I was actually struck by the nearly even balance of the two political parties,” Galston said.

He said he had expected that Democrats’ woes over the Affordable Care Act would have bolstered Republican hopes more.

“Democrats have noticed that the Republican Party is very unpopular, and Republicans have noticed that the Democratic Party is not much more popular than they are,” Galston said.

Also, the latest Pew figures don’t reflect nearly the stark contrast in confidence that existed before midterm elections in 2006 and 2010, when seismic shifts in congressional seats shook up the balance of power between parties.

In June 2010, Democrats polled by Pew expressed little confidence in their party’s ability to best the GOP, with only 29 percent saying they thought their party would do better. By contrast, a full 72 percent of Republicans foresaw success.

Conservatives’ confidence was well founded. In November 2010, Republicans took back the House of Representatives as high unemployment, a weak economy and the rise of firebrand tea party candidates bedeviled Democrats and President Barack Obama.

It wasn't the first time optimism turned out right.
