Revenues become payroll, which is what\u2019s left after taxes, operating expenses and health insurance. No, this isn\u2019t a rant against the Affordable CAre Act or Connect for Health Colorado. I\u2019m in favor of affordable care, and still hope to find some.\n\nMy time budget is deducted from the 168 hours in each week (that\u2019s 24 times 7). Big chunks of time are spent serving clients or handling internal administrative trivia. What\u2019s left goes to family, friends, household chores, hobbies and, occasionally, personal hygiene and sleep.\n\nThen there are the time thieves. Lately, I\u2019ve been receiving about five robocalls a day, and they\u2019re getting sneakier at spoofing caller ID. Some are automated come-ons that promise awesome search rankings or amazing small-business loans.\n\nThe more malicious actors are live perpetrators. There was the heavily accented \u201cAgent Handerson, badge number 392467, from the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d He called three times, using different names and badge numbers but making the same dire threats.\n\nThe most recent call from the \u201cWindows Technical Support team\u201d was awash in background noise that sounded like a flea market in a train station. The tele-thug\u2019s voice was so garbled that I suggested he find a better phone service.\n\nMy digits are registered with the Colorado No-Call and National Do Not Call lists. They\u2019re from the government, and they want us to believe it\u2019s helping. Sadly, enforcement is virtually impossible when so many scammers operate offshore: Since 2003, the Federal Trade Commission has levied $1.2 billion in fines but collected only 8 percent. (That\u2019s $96 million.) So where does that money go?\n\nThe Colorado Attorney General puts the onus on us: Its No-Call Law webpage uses 842 words to explain how individuals can use small claims court to pursue financial remedies.\n\nAccording to the Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, robocalls cost us an estimated $350 million per year. Its current solution is a lobbying effort called End Robocalls (endrobocalls.org). The purpose is to put \u201cintense pressure\u201d on the government and the phone companies, which apparently are reluctant to deploy available blocking technologies.\n\nIt seems like yet another well-intentioned brain cramp. Worse, blocking is a defensive solution: What do you block when the bad guys spoof legitimate numbers?\n\nI want to go on the offensive with a robocall robo-terminator that plugs into my landline or runs as an app on my smartphone. On command, it will attack, holding the line open and sending coded signals that defeat and destroy the robocaller\u2019s system.\n\nMaybe a similarly outraged Colorado entrepreneur can create Weapons of Mass Robocall Destruction. What could possibly go wrong? No one would use the technology for anything other than its intended purpose, would they?\n\nOK, maybe I\u2019m being na\u00efve, or at least silly. But the desire to actually stop the bad guys feels semi-rational.\n\nThe robocallers are absolutely relentless. They\u2019ll never stop because they know every new scam will fool or frighten enough people to produce a fresh pile of money.\n\nThe state and federal governments are equally relentless. They\u2019ll keep wasting our time and tax dollars, announcing programs like no-call lists that are merely shiny objects, not actual solutions. They\u2019ll never stop because they know it will work often enough to keep them in business, too.\n\nRather than whining to the state or the feds every time someone doesn\u2019t play fair, why not accept those things that we cannot change? Instead, stay informed and be perpetually vigilant. Be skeptical of caller ID. Be quick to hang up on suspicious callers. And set aside a few dollars for your own robocall robo-terminator.\n\nRoss Van Woert of Loveland is founder and manager of a marketing consulting and communications agency.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Voices: Life in the age of robocalls", "title": "Colorado Voices: Life in the age of robocalls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/10/colorado-voices-life-in-the-age-of-robocalls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__20150712_Z00_OP12V_VANWOERTp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__20150712_Z00_OP12V_VANWOERTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-10T10:50:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T15:11:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce447\"", "article_summary": "My digits are registered with the Colorado No-Call and National Do Not Call lists.\nLately, I\u2019ve been receiving about five robocalls a day, and they\u2019re getting sneakier at spoofing caller ID.\nAccording to the Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, robocalls cost us an estimated $350 million per year.\nThey\u2019ll never stop because they know every new scam will fool or frighten enough people to produce a fresh pile of money.\nThey\u2019ll never stop because they know it will work often enough to keep them in business, too."}
