It was there that protestors gathered, The Tennessean reported.\n\nSee also: The Confederate flag is a symbol of racism.

Photos of suspect Dylann Roof and a manifesto attributed to Roof appeared online in the days after the shooting, underscoring the racially-based nature of his alleged crime. Among the photos were several of Roof appearing with a Confederate battle flag, a symbol that has long been defended by white Southerners as part of their \"heritage\" while serving as a difficult reminder of slavery during the Confederacy for African-Americans.\n\n\"For too long we were blind to the pain that the confederate flag stirred in our citizens... The flag has always represented more than ancestral pride,\" Obama said during his emotional eulogy for Charleston shooting victim Rev. Clementa Pinckney last week. \"For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression. It's true a flag did not cause these murders. But the flag was a reminder of oppression. By taking down that flag, we express God's grace.\"\n\n#ConfederateFlag supporters gather near where President Obama is speaking today in Madison. pic.twitter.com/vgPoRWA7vc \u2014 WKRN (@WKRN) July 1, 2015\n\n\"This flag isn't a race war, it's not a race thing. It's a heritage thing,\" Rick Martin, one of the pro-flag protesters, told the Tennessean. Noting that \"black people and white people fought under this flag,\" Martin added that as someone who served under Obama in the armed forces, he'd be happy to meet him.\n\nRick Martin said \"it would be a pleasure to meet the president.\" But he won't be doing it in the same spot. #ObamaTN pic.twitter.com/VX4wLGRg8s \u2014 Jordan Buie (@JordanBuie) July 1, 2015\n\nRick Martin waves to drivers passing.

He even enjoyed a few moments of levity when he sang a line from the song \"Davey Crockett.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?
