He took a seat on the bench, and was visibly shaken by the injury, holding his head in his hands as teammates tried to console him.\n\nHe was taken back to the locker room shortly after and at halftime was ruled out to return.\n\nAfterward, Ray, wearing a brace on the knee and walking with crutches, said he was hopeful the injury wouldn\u2019t keep him out for long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nRay will undergo further evaluation when the team returns to Denver.\n\nThe Broncos played without starting outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, who was ruled out Friday with a back injury. But he is expected back after the bye week for the Broncos\u2019 Nov. 1 home game against the Packers.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shane Ray, Broncos LB, has sprained MCL", "title": "Shane Ray, Broncos LB, has sprained MCL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/18/shane-ray-broncos-lb-has-sprained-mcl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151008_042020_shane-ray-2.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151008_042020_shane-ray-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T12:04:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T09:45:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ff0\"", "article_summary": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Broncos\u2019 depth at outside linebacker took another hit Sunday.\nThe Broncos played without starting outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, who was ruled out Friday with a back injury.\nShane Ray, the Broncos\u2019 first-round draft pick this year, was carted off the field after spraining the MCL in his right knee on a play in the second quarter against the Browns.\nAfterward, Ray, wearing a brace on the knee and walking with crutches, said he was hopeful the injury wouldn\u2019t keep him out for long.\nRay got caught in the fray on a tackle and had to be helped off the field by two trainers."}
