Colorado Gov. Hickenlooper talks to the Lt. General who brought calm to New Orleans post-Katrina on how to lead during a crisis.\n\nThe key to crisis leadership is \u201cbreak the rules, the rules were written for peacetime,\u201d says Lt. General Russel L. Honor\u00e9, who brought calm to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. He remembered pilots telling him he had to create a manifest before they could evacuate people from the flooded areas. \u201cWe got guns, you don\u2019t. Fly the damn planes,\u201d Honor\u00e9 told them.\n\n\u201cRules will stop a recovery in its tracks,\u201d he said, relating another story of people stranded at the airport and the authorities telling him they didn\u2019t have the resources to process everybody. \u201cOsama bin Laden was not in New Orleans,\u201d he barked into the phone. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for terrorists in all the wrong places.\u201d\n\nLt. General Russel L. Honor\u00e9: \"Be prepared to break the rules; the rules were written for peacetime.\"\n\nHonor\u00e9\u2019s take-charge attitude and his military bearing restored people\u2019s confidence in the government\u2019s ability to handle the after-effects of Katrina after a very shaky start by the Bush administration. Speaking at The Daily Beast\u2019s Hero Summit Thursday afternoon, Honor\u00e9 said government today is far more prepared to deal with Katrina-like events, but the American people have not absorbed the lessons they should. He asked how many in the audience have five days\u2019 worth of food and water at home. A sprinkling of hands went up, maybe 15 to 20 percent of the audience\u2014\u201cand some of them lie,\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was asked how the government shutdown is affecting his state\u2019s recovery from Biblical floods that are only seen perhaps once in 250 years. It\u2019s different from Katrina, he said, noting that FEMA almost immediately had 100 people on the ground, \u201cand they\u2019re still working.\u201d But the folks in Washington processing the extended paperwork are furloughed, and he can\u2019t get the EPA to do testing on suspected e-coli on grass and parklands because they\u2019re shut down. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before kids get sick,\u201d he said. All the agencies are \u201cdoing everything they can every single day but the shutdown slowed things down and put at risk people going through the most difficult time in their lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"pageNum": 1, "description": "Colorado Gov.
