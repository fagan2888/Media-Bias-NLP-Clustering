The company says it came up with a series of patterns in interpersonal voice and text communications that are related to certain emotional expressions. Then, the company developed a technology that aims to help consumers organize their mindsets to reduce stress. Feingold has offices in Munich and Berlin.

Sharecare, headquartered in Atlanta, says the acquisition is part of the company's plan to create a comprehensive health profile for every consumer. The company also announced the launch of a beta Android app on Feb. 26.

The company's technology integrates with wearable health trackers to help users manage their health. Sharecare was founded by Oz, who hosts a daily television show called "The Dr. Oz Show" and Arnold, a businessman who used to run HowStuffWorks.com.
