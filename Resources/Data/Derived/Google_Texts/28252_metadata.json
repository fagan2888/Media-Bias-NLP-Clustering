No, the El Salvadoran-born mom who has a green card and has been here for only two years, will not qualify for Medicaid until she has been in the U.S. five years.\n\nFor hours he sorts through and translates the complicated questions and answers.\n\nHe presses enter. All of the information disappears. His heart sinks.\n\nThen he begs for patience and begins the process anew.\n\nWelcome to Obamacare en Espa\u00f1ol.\n\nThe Obama administration is banking on the support of the Hispanic community, with its large numbers of young and uninsured, to help make the President's signature health care reform law a success.\n\n\"The population we serve is the most difficult,\" Joachim said, adding that it often takes several hours and a couple of visits to get an entire family signed up because of technical difficulties and the complexities of enrolling families of mixed immigration status.\n\nJoachim's challenges echo problems faced nationally by Spanish speakers when they try to enroll in the signature Obama administration program designed to serve as a safety net for millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nEfforts to register Spanish speakers are further complicated by technical problems on Obamacare-related websites, worries that information might be used for deportation purposes, problems verifying income, and a digital divide among those who might not have ready access to a computer said Alejandra Gepp, associate director of La Raza's Institute for Hispanic Health.\n\nJUST WATCHED DirectoUSA: La ley de salud Replay More Videos ...

Hispanics account for roughly 17% of the population, but they make up 32% of the country's uninsured who aren't elderly, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an organization which conducts health policy research.\n\n\"Disproportionately we are being counted on to sustain this program,\" said Daniel Garza, executive director of the Libre Initiative, a nonpartisan, nonprofit grassroots Hispanic advocacy organization. \"We are a heavy chunk of the folks who are being expected to sign up. \"\n\nBut when Spanish speakers want to sign up for Obamacare in their own language, they face problems.\n\nOn www.cuidadodesalud.gov, the Spanish language version of HealthCare.gov, sometimes links led to dead ends or pages in English. In other instances, some words and phrases are literal translations from English to Spanish, which health advocates in the Hispanic community say makes the site difficult to understand.\n\n\"To put up a website that is only cosmetic it's disrespectful of this administration,\" Garza said. \"If you're going to have a website, have it work, for the love of God.\"\n\nAfter media reports and questions by CNN, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees both the sites, has addressed a number of hyperlink-related problems on the website.\n\nThe Spanish language site did not launch until December 6 -- a full two months late and after its English language counterpart debuted. This means Spanish speakers have a much shorter window to browse online to make health care choices before the March 31 deadline for enrollment.\n\nUnlike their English speaking counterparts, Spanish speakers still cannot shop for insurance plans on the website.\n\n\"It is very disappointing that it is taking so long to get this critical element on the Spanish website,\" Gepp said.\n\nJUST WATCHED El portal de Obamacare sigue trabajando Replay More Videos ...

The soft launch has allowed us to identify areas of concerns early and ensure the best product possible.\"\n\nHHS also points out that Spanish-speakers can enroll on the phone with bilingual staffers. Since October 1, there have been more than 330,000 Spanish calls, which represents 4% of overall call volume, according to the agency.\n\nSpanish speakers can also fill out a paper application in that language. The administration is also relying heavily on bilingual specialists at community organizations, libraries and local health centers to help get people signed up.\n\nThe administration says it does not yet have figures on the number Spanish speakers who have enrolled in Obamacare thus far or a breakdown of those enrollments by state.\n\nHowever, recent enrollment figures of the overall population show that only one in four young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up for insurance plans under Obamacare. California, Florida, and Texas -- states with some of the nation's biggest Spanish speaking populations -- show similar figures.\n\nThe administration reiterated on the website and to community assistants who help Spanish-speakers enroll that \"information provided by applicants or beneficiaries won't be used for immigration enforcement purposes.\"\n\nAnd the Obama administration is redoubling efforts to boost Hispanic enrollment.\n\n\"In my opinion the Affordable Care Act is the single most life-saving act this country has had,\" Jose Luna, a physician in El Paso, Texas, stressed in a recent telephone news conference organized by the White House.\n\nOthers are taking a wait and see approach.\n\n\"The good news is Latinos are being enrolled,\" Gepp said. \"Not at the rate we would like to see. Let's see what happens from now to March 31.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inside La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo's adobe-colored confines, William Joachin works furiously to help the dozens of Spanish-speaking patients who queue up weekly seeking help registering for Obamacare.", "pubdate": "2014-01-15T17:57:38Z", "author": "By Halimah Abdullah, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Inside La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo's adobe-colored confines, William Joachin works furiously to help the dozens of Spanish-speaking patients who queue up weekly seeking help registering for Obamacare.", "pubdate": "2014-01-15T17:57:38Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/15/politics/obamacare-spanish-language-site/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140114091222-obamacare-spanish-site-1-t3-entertainment.png", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140114091222-obamacare-spanish-site-1-t3-entertainment.png", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/15/politics/obamacare-spanish-language-site/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Lost in translation: Obamacare en Espa\u00f1ol - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-01-15T17:57:38Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e4c\"", "article_summary": "JUST WATCHED Obamacare sign-ups miss target Replay More Videos ...
