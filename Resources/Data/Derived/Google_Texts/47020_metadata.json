Kelly, executive director of the St. John Paul II National Shrine and a member of the Knights of Columbus. Kelly was referring to the five tenets of qualifying characteristics that constitute Article II of the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention definition of genocide.\n\nThose qualifying characteristics include murder, causing serious harm, imposing conditions of life that attempt to destroy, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children outside a specific national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.\n\n\u201cI think we have a tendency to think governments always know what\u2019s going on on the ground,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t always have the best information. But churches often do, because of the grassroots, with-the-people nature of parishes and ministries. If governments say they don\u2019t have the evidence, they can do more to get the evidence, but they should be listening to the faith communities as well.\u201d\n\nAs of this week, according to sources, the State Department does not plan to include Christians in a statement to be released on the status of victims of ISIS-inflicted genocide in the region. The statement will include Yazidis, the Kurdish religious minority.\n\nWashington experts stress that any statement or widespread response must be inclusive of all religions.\n\n\u201cThe church and all Christians must be working for the religious freedom of all people, because that freedom is rooted in the dignity of the human person,\u201d Timothy Samuel Shah, associate director of the Religious Freedom Project at Georgetown University\u2019s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, said at The Heritage Foundation panel.\n\n\u201cWhat we are fighting for is not our own tribe, not our own group. We\u2019re fighting for religious freedom for everyone,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Monday, the Knights of Columbus announced they had written a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry urging the inclusion of Christians in any sort of State Department finding on Middle Eastern genocide.\n\n\u201cWe write as American citizens concerned about the vulnerable Christian and Yazidi minorities of Iraq and Syria who are being targeted for eradication in their ancient homelands solely because of their religious beliefs,\u201d the letter begins.\n\nThe letter goes on to request a meeting with a \u201csmall delegation\u201d to debrief Kerry on the crises confronting Christians including forcible conversion, mass murder, enslavement, rape, destruction of churches, and theft of lands and wealth, adding that Pope Francis has himself used the word \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the aforementioned persecution.\n\n\u201cAll faiths are under attack when one faith tries to kill others because they do not believe,\u201d said Roger Severino, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, at The Heritage Foundation panel last week. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A silent persecution of Christians tantamount to genocide is ongoing in the Middle East, according to experts in Washington.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A silent persecution of Christians tantamount to genocide is ongoing in the Middle East, according to experts in Washington.", "title": "State Department Not Including Christians in Genocide Finding", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/kerry2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T15:28:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SKn9QR"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A silent persecution of Christians tantamount to genocide is ongoing in the Middle East, according to experts in Washington.", "title": "State Department Not Including Christians in Genocide Finding", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/kerry2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-12-07T18:03:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T15:28:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Christians, Middle East, Genocide, ISIS, Syria, Iraq, refugees, Christian persecution, minority, religious freedom, religious liberty"}, "article_summary": "On Monday, the Knights of Columbus announced they had written a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry urging the inclusion of Christians in any sort of State Department finding on Middle Eastern genocide.\nA silent persecution of Christians tantamount to genocide is ongoing in the Middle East, according to experts in Washington.\nKelly was referring to the five tenets of qualifying characteristics that constitute Article II of the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention definition of genocide.\nWe\u2019re fighting for religious freedom for everyone,\u201d he added.\nAccording to recent estimates, the Christian population in Iraq has dropped to roughly 260,000, down from 1.5 million a decade ago."}
