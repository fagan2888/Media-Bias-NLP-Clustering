When I heard about it and learned the apparent cause \u2014 initial reports said it was a heroin overdose \u2014 my reaction wasn\u2019t only sadness. I was enraged.\n\nMy rage about Hoffman\u2019s death \u2014 and the more than 100 opiate deaths that occur every day \u2014 comes from the fact that it was preventable.\n\nHoffman was open about his addiction, which is rare in a culture that blames the afflicted and judges them as weak and selfish, bent on getting high no matter the toll it takes on those who love them \u2014 and on themselves. In interviews, Hoffman discussed his addiction in college that led, soon thereafter, to rehab. He said he remained sober over the decades since then, until last May, when a relapse led to another stint in treatment. Though addiction is a disease \u2014 a brain disease that\u2019s often progressive \u2014 addicts who relapse are often blamed. They didn\u2019t try hard enough to stay sober.\n\n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t Hoffman\u2019s fault that he relapsed. It was the fault of a disease that often includes relapse as a symptom and the fault of the ineffective treatment he received.\n\nAfter writing about addiction in a pair of books, I frequently hear from addicts and their family members about serial relapses followed by treatments followed by more relapses. It\u2019s not uncommon for addicts to go through a dozen treatment programs.\n\n(MORE: Viewpoint: We Need to Rethink Rehab)\n\nA parent whose son died two weeks ago wrote to say, \u201cI did everything I could, but I failed him.\u201d \u201cEverything\u201d included eight residential programs and four outpatient programs. It\u2019s not this father\u2019s fault. The tragic fact is that with addiction, like many other illnesses, sometimes you can do everything right and people die.\n\nBut with addicts, most treatment centers don\u2019t do everything right. In an article I wrote for TIME.com about the mental-health provisions in the Affordable Care Act, I noted that 90% of those who enter addiction-treatment programs in the U.S. don\u2019t receive evidence-based treatment.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what treatments Hoffman received, but it\u2019s unlikely that it was state-of-the-art care rooted in the fact that addiction is a brain disease. He should have received a range of treatments that have been proved to be effective. Traditionally, the only choices offered to addicts were 12-step programs, but now proven treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing and psychopharmacology. Indeed, medications are particularly effective in treating opiate addictions. Richard Rawson, associate director of the UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs, says, \u201cFailure to encourage patients to use these medications is unconscionable. It\u2019s comparable to conducting coronary bypass surgery and failing to prescribe aspirin, lipid and blood-pressure medications as part of a discharge plan.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Hoffman was, upon discharge from treatment, prescribed medications like Suboxone, which prevents opiate relapse, but it\u2019s unlikely, because most treatment programs eschew them. If he had been (and if he took them as prescribed), it\u2019s almost certain that he\u2019d be alive today. Another medication that may have saved his life is naloxone, a drug that reverses an overdose. All opiate addicts, as well as police and other first responders, should have access to the drug. Also, addicts\u2019 discharge plans should include follow-up treatment, including for co-occurring disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorder and others that often accompany addiction.\n\n(MORE: Glee\u2019s Tribute to Cory Monteith Will Surely Gloss Over Addiction)\n\nProper addiction treatment works in many cases, but the most tragic fact of Hoffman\u2019s and others\u2019 addictions is that they could have been prevented in the first place. Addiction is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and psychological factors. For now, genes aren\u2019t fixable, but it\u2019s possible to protect people from becoming addicted by improving their environments and addressing their psychological stresses. Risk factors such as mental illness; learning disabilities; ADHD; trauma; poverty; and growing up in dysfunctional families, where there\u2019s violence and abuse and in neighborhoods defined by drugs and violence, can be mitigated and replaced by protective factors including counseling, social programs, therapy, education and a range of other interventions. If they are, drug use can often be averted or nipped in the bud.\n\nMinutes after Hoffman\u2019s death was announced, on Twitter I was asked if I feel despair because of another overdose death. I do, but I also have reason to be hopeful that this catastrophe may lessen or even end.\n\nThese days, most heroin addictions are preceded by addictions to prescription opiates like Oxycontin and Vicodin. These drugs can be hard to get and expensive compared with a cheaper opiate: heroin. If we can prevent prescription-medicine misuse, we can prevent many instances of heroin addiction.\n\nIf pain-medication abuse is effectively curtailed, so will the sharp rise in heroin addiction. If the treatment system adopts evidence-based practices, heroin addicts like Hoffman can be saved.\n\nMORE: Give Rob Ford Rehab, Not Ridicule", "article_metadata": {"description": "An apparent heroin overdose is a reminder of why we need to move toward evidence-based treatments for addiction", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "An apparent heroin overdose is a reminder of why we need to move toward evidence-based treatments for addiction", "title": "How Philip Seymour Hoffman Could Have Been Saved", "url": "http://time.com/3390/how-philip-seymour-hoffman-could-have-been-saved/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hoffman.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hoffman.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "An apparent heroin overdose is a reminder of why we need to move toward evidence-based treatments for addiction", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Philip Seymour Hoffman Could Have Been Saved"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "addiction, heroin, opinion, rehab", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "addiction, heroin, opinion, rehab"}, "article_summary": "If the treatment system adopts evidence-based practices, heroin addicts like Hoffman can be saved.\nLike so many of us, I\u2019m brokenhearted about the death of the remarkably talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.\nThese drugs can be hard to get and expensive compared with a cheaper opiate: heroin.\nAll opiate addicts, as well as police and other first responders, should have access to the drug.\nIf pain-medication abuse is effectively curtailed, so will the sharp rise in heroin addiction."}
