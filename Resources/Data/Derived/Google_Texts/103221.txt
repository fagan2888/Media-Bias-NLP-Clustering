Chiropractic First of Abingdon

At Chiropractic First, we are committed to your health. Many people are looking for pain relief, or relief of other Secondary Conditions, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. There are many healthcare practitioners that provide that type of care, and we would be glad to direct you to ones that we trust. However, our goal at Chiropractic First is not to stop at relieving your Secondary Conditions, but to correct the Primary Condition that leads to those Secondary Conditions. By addressing the Structural Shift in your foundation, it is our goal to bring you back to your normal, thus optimizing your bodyâ€™s overall function. Our office is located in the heart of downtown Abingdon in Washington County. We are also proud to serve the surrounding communities of Emory, Bristol, Marion, Glade Spring, Lebanon, Saltville, Stone Mill, Fractionville, Vance Mill, Scott Addition, Cummings Heights, Morningside Hills, Watauga, Ashleys, Hayter, White Mill, Lowland, Parks Mill, Rust Hollow, Shortsville, Wyndale, Bethel, Glenford, Greendale, Osceola, Green Spring, Meadowview, Hansonville, Evergreen Hills, Hilander Park, Colonial Heights, and Holston Valley. We look forward to serving you.
