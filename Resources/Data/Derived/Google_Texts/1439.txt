The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is causing one Missouri school district to cough up the big bucks to keep its employees insured next year.

According to KMIZ-MO, Jefferson City Public Schools will be forced to pay an additional $150,000 — the approximate equivalent of three full-time teachers — in health insurance benefits next year because the law requires them to pay for health care for substitute teachers within the district.

The school district now faces one of two options — limiting the hours in which substitute teachers can work to 28 per week, or paying $6,000 per person for the health benefits of at least 25 employees already on the books who would need to be covered under the ACA.

Otherwise, the district will be fined millions of dollars for violating the new law.

“They knew it was coming, they just didn’t exactly know how they were going to handle it,” KMIZ-MO reporter Daniel Winn said during the broadcast.
