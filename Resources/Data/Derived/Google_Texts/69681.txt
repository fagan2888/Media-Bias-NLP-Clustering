The Juneteenth Heritage Festival kicked off in downtown Meridian tonight on 5th Street.

In its 12th year in Meridian, Juneteenth is a celebration that commemorates the abolition of slavery across the US. There are booths set up with food, drinks, and merchandise. Live music played to the hundreds in attendance and festival chairman Louis Sutton says the event allows others to learn their history.

"We have to know our history," said Sutton. "It's just like the Fourth of July, we celebrate that to commemorate the freedom of our country. We celebrate Juneteenth to commemorate the freedom of our people."

The festival is set to end sometime around midnight tonight.
