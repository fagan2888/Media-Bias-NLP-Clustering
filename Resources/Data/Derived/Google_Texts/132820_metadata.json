He showed both video of President Obama touting Gruber\u2019s work and Nancy Pelosi denying knowing Gruber, in video right before additional video of her mentioning Gruber by name.\n\nSo this is \u201cpretty lousy\u201d for the Democrats, as Stewart put it. And just to stick the knife in even further, the Supreme Court is going to hear a case that could dismantle the law.
