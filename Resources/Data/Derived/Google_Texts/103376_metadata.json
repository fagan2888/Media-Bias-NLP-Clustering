Fred Lucas, Jr., Letitia James and Ramya Ramana \u2014 spoke as though we are living 300 years in the past in a slave state instead of New York State.\n\nTake the Sanitation Department chaplain Lucas Jr. \u2014 or better yet, leave him. He stood on the podium with the city\u2019s first biracial first family, as well as with Letitia James, the first female African-American official elected citywide, and all he could see was a plantation full of slaves.\n\nHey Fred, it\u2019s 2014, do you know what year it is?\n\nIf Lucas was insulting, James, the new Public Advocate, a woman I\u2019ve always admired for her fiery sense of justice, was all smoke and no flame.\n\nNot only did she inexplicably bring dressed up-for-the-cameras homeless child Dasani Coates up on stage like a house pet, but the kid\u2019s mother, Chanel Coates, was sitting in the audience in the freezing cold without a coat, clad in a hoody sweatshirt. Hello?\n\nSPEAKERS AT MAYOR DE BLASIO'S INAUGURATION PAINT PICTURE OF DIVIDED CITY\n\nFinally there was Ramana, the youth poet laureate, who declared in her ancient wisdom, \u201cNo more brownstones and brown skin playing tug-of-war,\u201d apparently forgetting the white- and brown-skinned de Blasios had just taken the subway from their brownstone.\n\nMissing from the festivities was Lis Smith, de B\u2019s transition spokeswoman who is not a bigot and in fact is so fair-minded that she took a depraved, disgraced, disgruntled loser of an ex-guv Idiot Spitzer as her lover. Talk about smart women, really stupid choices! (Smith\u2019s former boyfriend was Missouri state senator, same-named Jeff Smith, who went to jail for election fraud.)\n\nSmith missed the festivities because she was \u201con vacation.\u201d Who takes a vacation from a two-month gig? What kind of vacation would she take if she had a full-time job?\n\nBut you\u2019ll be happy to know that is no longer a worry -- an insider at de Blasio\u2019s small, friends-and-family New Year\u2019s Eve inaugural bash at Bar Toto in Brooklyn told me Smith is now about as welcome at City Hall, as well, her boyfriend. ... Before she took up with Spitzer, all that stood between Smith and a permanent City Hall gig was her insistence on a loftier title than the one she was being offered.\n\nBut hey, who wouldn\u2019t give up a career with a rising star to crash to earth with a failed steamroller, baby?\n\nKarolina Wojtasik/A&E\n\nDUCK DIE-NASTY\n\nBecause $400 million a year from merchandising duck calls, hats, and dainty tea cups isn\u2019t enough, the Swamp Family Robertson hunted for something else that would better benefit their big-shot status. And they found it: Guns.\n\nAnd once again, A&E is capitulating even though it isn't getting a piece of the semiautomatic action.\n\nWho else on TV would keep their gig while being publicly anti-gay (homosexuality is bestiality), racist (blacks were happy picking cotton) and pro-child sexual abuse (nail a bride at 15, when she\u2019s young enough \u201cto pick your ducks\u201d -- as opposed to what? Pick your cotton?).\n\nDUCK DYNASTY\u2019 FAMILY LAUNCHES LINE OF CAMOUFLAGE GUNS\n\nLesser beings with lower ratings would have been thrown out with last week\u2019s catfish. Think Paula Deen, who lost everything when a white employee sued her for racial discrimination.\n\nIn an ad for their line of family guns, big daddy Phil intones, \u201cDo you know what makes me happy, ladies and gentlemen? To blow a mallard drake\u2019s head smooth off.\u201d\n\nSo how happy would he be to use the guns to hunt gays, disgruntled black cotton pickers and 15-year-old girls who don\u2019t want to be married off? Stay tuned. Or don\u2019t.\n\nTHE ROOT OF ALL MONEY\n\nThe folks who idolize money are threatening to keep it from the Catholic Church because Pope Francis recently denounced the rich for idolizing money instead of using it to serve others. Rich guy Ken Langone, who is spearheading the reconstruction of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, raised this concern to Timothy Cardinal Dolan, who promptly reported to CNN: \u201cThe pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people.\u201d Thing is? The pope would just love the rich more if they gave more of their riches to the poor. But St. Pat\u2019s doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cpoor\u201d -- the last diocesan estimate available puts its net worth at $275,900,000 in cash, properties and holdings.\n\nCBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images Dear John Miller, now that you\u2019re the anti-terrorist boss, would it be at all possible to make the following people disappear into obscurity?\n\nJason Kempin/Getty Images for Clear Channel Britney Spears. Her $15 million-a-year 'Piece of Me' Vegas show doesn\u2019t include a piece of her voice.\n\nDEAR JOHN MILLER:\n\nNow that you\u2019re the anti-terrorist boss, would it be at all possible to make the following people disappear into obscurity? No, they aren\u2019t technically terrorists, but they are so overexposed that they are terrifying.\n\n1) The Kardashian women, who are decimating the adult male population, one poor schmuck at a time. In 2013 alone, Lamar Odom became a crackhead and Bruce Jenner became a woman.\n\n2) Miley Cyrus. Seriously, what\u2019s left to see? Her dental records?\n\n3) Beyonce & Jay Z: He sells $700 ski masks at a racist establishment and she used audio from the shuttle disaster in her song, \u201cXO.\u201d Let\u2019s not even discuss the whole tacky Jesus business.\n\n4) Britney Spears. Her $15 million-a-year \u201cPiece of Me\u201d Vegas show doesn\u2019t include a piece of her voice.\n\n5) Sen. Ted Cruz, The anti-immigration senator Canuck-American citizen held the Senate hostage for 21 hours to protest Obamacare, which, ironically, uses broken-down Canadian software.\n\n6) Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner, who refuse to go away.\n\nHeidi Gutman/ABC 'GMA' host Robin Roberts, who bravely survived a horrific bout with cancer, last week did something equally courageous for an American icon, at least. She came out.\n\nOUT & ABOUT\n\n\u201cGMA\u201d host Robin Roberts, who bravely survived a horrific bout with cancer, last week did something equally courageous for an American icon, at least. She came out.\n\nOn Facebook, Roberts thanked her health care providers, her family, friends and yes, her long-time girlfriend, Amber Laign, a massage therapist who works with people recovering from accidents.\n\nROBIN ROBERTS, GIRLFRIEND AMBER LAIGN'S 10-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WAS NO SECRET TO FAMILY, FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES\n\nAlthough there were the expected ugly comments on social media, Roberts also received a congratulatory tweet from First Lady Michelle Obama, which was especially significant in a year when ugly remarks from folks like Phil Robertson made the news and were ultimately overlooked.\n\nFILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images 'The pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people.' Thing is? The pope would just love the rich more if they gave more of their riches to the poor.\n\nBEST DRESSED POPE\n\nEsquire Magazine jumped on Pope Francis\u2019 man-mag bandwagon by naming him \u201cBest Dressed Man of the Year.\u201d\n\nSure, Francis generally avoids the gold hat and robes thing that makes popes look like Elton John in concert, but citing a man for his taste in clothes when he wears clerical attire is like naming a woman in a burka as most chic.\n\nLIS AIN'T NO LIZ\n\nIt has come to my attention that people have confused political flack/Spitzer lover Lis Smith with my pal, columnist Liz Smith.\n\nThis seems impossible because, for one thing, Liz Smith has never worn a backless cocktail dress to her family\u2019s afternoon Christmas dinner. Smith the first\u2019s fashionista pals would have beat her senseless for such a style crime.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Linda Stasi", "twitter": {"description": "MAIN Did the mayoral inauguration ceremony signal the end of \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d and the start of \u201cLost In Space?\u201dThree of the speakers that day - the Rev.
