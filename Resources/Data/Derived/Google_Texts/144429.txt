INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) — Flavia Pennetta routed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-1 to win the BNP Paribas Open for the biggest tournament title of her career.

The 32-year-old Italian became the third-oldest winner of the desert tournament Sunday after Martina Navratilova, who won at age 33 and again at 34 in 1990-91. It was Pennetta’s first title since winning at Marbella in 2010.

As the 20th seed, Pennetta became the lowest seed to win the title. She’s projected to rise to No. 12 in the world Monday in the WTA Tour rankings. The victory was worth $1 million.

Radwanska, seeded second, was bothered with a left knee injury during the final. She twice called for the trainer in the second set and had her knee heavily taped. She was in tears apologizing to the sympathetic crowd afterward, saying she was unable to run.
