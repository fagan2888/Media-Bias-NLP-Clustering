Isn\u2019t what one finds funny the most particular signifier of taste, after all? Even CBS, which has lately been the one network to put together a successful slate of sitcoms with the likes of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d saw diminished returns last season with the underwhelming likes of \u201cThe Millers\u201d; the network\u2019s classic formula (multiple cameras, crass humor with a bit of \u201cheart\u201d) isn\u2019t quite connecting anymore. If they can\u2019t do it anymore, maybe no one can.\n\nAnd the anxiety is palpable in the shows themselves. Sitcoms in the new season are attempting to draw in viewers by making contemporary-seeming jokes about the Internet, but in the process are only revealing their own cluelessness.\n\nThe worst offender is ABC\u2019s \u201cSelfie,\u201d which premieres Sept. 30. The show takes as its framing device Eliza, a social-media-obsessed millennial (played by Karen Gillan) with sincere desire to change her ways. She wants, we\u2019re told, to stop texting and Instagramming so very much. The argument the show\u2019s making is embarrassingly simplistic \u2014 in short, it asks what we\u2019ve lost in our reliance on social media, what human connection is missing. John Cho\u2019s character, a co-worker who takes it upon himself to be the Henry Higgins to Eliza\u2019s, er, Eliza, only does so after a series of lectures about how narcissistic millennials are. It may be true and it may be false, but more than anything it feels utterly tired.\n\nOther aspects of the show do ring false: For many viewers, social media facilitates, rather than inhibits, human connection. The protagonist of \u201cSelfie\u201d is constantly getting online Likes and Favorites from people she seems never to have met and has no real friends; for a certain class of Internet ultra-celebrity, this may be true, but the majority of Facebook and Instagram users are keeping in touch with their friends. Whether the bubble effect this promotes is good or bad is another question, but it\u2019s a less loaded one than whether using the Internet to communicate with the world makes one a de facto sociopath. Cho, playing the thuddingly named Henry Higginbotham, instructs Eliza to greet a co-worker by asking her how she\u2019d slept the night before. What? That\u2019s far more overshare-y than anything that\u2019s ever been put on most active Twitter users\u2019 feeds. If this is the sort of real-world interaction that\u2019s been elided by social media, then \u2026 frankly, that\u2019s a good thing. Sites like Twitter and Facebook allow their users to meaningfully connect in a manner that in no way obviates chatting idly with co-workers \u2014 and if it forecloses deep talk about sleep patterns that borders on workplace harassment, so much the better?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fall sitcoms are overflowing with cartoonish digital-age anxieties", "title": "What fall TV \u2014 from \u201cSelfie\u201d to \u201cA to Z\u201d \u2014 gets so wrong about the Internet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fall sitcoms are overflowing with cartoonish digital-age anxieties", "title": "What fall TV \u2014 from \u201cSelfie\u201d to \u201cA to Z\u201d \u2014 gets so wrong about the Internet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/22/what_fall_tv_from_selfie_to_a_to_z_gets_so_wrong_about_the_internet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/selfie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fall sitcoms are overflowing with cartoonish digital-age anxieties", "title": "What fall TV \u2014 from \u201cSelfie\u201d to \u201cA to Z\u201d \u2014 gets so wrong about the Internet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/selfie.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, a to z, fall tv, Internet Culture, manhattan love story, Selfie, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2316\"", "article_summary": "Other aspects of the show do ring false: For many viewers, social media facilitates, rather than inhibits, human connection.\nIf this is the sort of real-world interaction that\u2019s been elided by social media, then \u2026 frankly, that\u2019s a good thing.\nThe argument the show\u2019s making is embarrassingly simplistic \u2014 in short, it asks what we\u2019ve lost in our reliance on social media, what human connection is missing.\nTopics: a to z, fall tv, Internet Culture, manhattan love story, Selfie, TV, Entertainment NewsNothing on broadcast TV (except for live events and dramas that approximate live events) is doing too well, but comedies are doing worst of all; the audience fragmentation that\u2019s caused the four major networks to collapse in the ratings seems to have especially impacted comedies.\nThat\u2019s far more overshare-y than anything that\u2019s ever been put on most active Twitter users\u2019 feeds."}
