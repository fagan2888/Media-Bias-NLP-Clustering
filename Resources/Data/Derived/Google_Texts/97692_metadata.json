The former first lady also will host a group of donors a day earlier in suburban Orlando.\n\n\u201cPolitics, you know, really does end up being a family business.\u201d Former first lady Laura Bush\n\nLaura Bush's plunge into the fundraising circuit, an arena she's shown some reluctance to enter in the past, comes as the family becomes increasingly involved in raising cash to help elect a third consecutive Bush Republican president. It also comes as the former Florida governor has taken on the front-runner, Donald Trump, more directly. Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz suggested there has been a boost in Bush fundraising as a result.\n\n\u201cThis has absolutely heightened people's awareness concerning the choice: a proven, reform-minded conservative versus a liberal, Democrat socialite masquerading as a Republican,\u201d Diaz wrote in an e-mail. \u201cAs a result, we are getting a great response from donors.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush acknowledges that he can't win by running as the third Bush, and interviews with voters last week in New Hampshire showed that, after more than six months on the trail, many are still reluctant to expand the family's political dynasty. Sensitive to that, Bush focuses his own legacy, relying on stories about his time as Florida governor. On Thursday in New Hampshire, Bush held a town hall meeting while standing in front of giant letters of his first (not last) name.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush at a town hall meeting on Sept. 10 in Salem, New Hampshire.

And the campaign's fundraising schedule indicates he\u2019s not about to hide the family or shun the advantages it can bring him.\n\nIn addition to Laura Bush's events, former President George W. Bush hosted a fundraiser on Thursday in New York and will hold a pair of events later this month in Texas and another in Rogers, Arkansas, in October. George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, will both be on hand for the campaign's next donor retreat on Oct. 25 in Houston.\n\nColumba Bush hosted a fundraiser in South Carolina last month, and is scheduled to host additional events this month in Los Angeles, suburban Washington, D.C., and San Antonio, Texas. Her sons, Jeb Jr. and Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, are also active. Jeb Jr. will host a half-dozen fundraisers within the next month, while George P. Bush is scheduled for one in Washington.\n\n\u201cPolitics, you know, really does end up being a family business,\u201d Laura Bush often said at fundraisers while her husband was president. \u201cEveryone gets involved, whether they want to or not.\u201d\n\nThen-President George W.

She's hosting an event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center later this month for the Global Women's Network, which promotes women's education, health and economic issues.\n\nLaura Bush, who recently became a grandmother for the second time, has also ventured into another family business as a paid speaker. She's the keynote speaker later this month at a fundraising dinner in Oklahoma City for Water4, a global clean-water initiative and has been the featured guest this year at events for Volunteer Center of North Texas, the Texas Legislative Conference and RootsTech, which bills itself as the world's largest genealogy conference.\n\n\u201cAfter many adventures, we are back home in Texas, living what I call the afterlife, in a state that George calls the promised land,\u201d she told the RootsTech conference in February.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael C Bender", "description": "The Bush family is increasingly being featured at campaign fundraisers for Jeb Bush.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The Bush family is increasingly being featured at campaign fundraisers for Jeb Bush.", "title": "Laura Bush Hits the Fundraising Circuit", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-12/laura-bush-hits-the-fundraising-circuit", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i37xlYGqWars/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Bush family is increasingly being featured at campaign fundraisers for Jeb Bush.", "title": "Laura Bush Hits the Fundraising Circuit", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-12/laura-bush-hits-the-fundraising-circuit", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i37xlYGqWars/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "The Bush family is increasingly being featured at campaign fundraisers for Jeb Bush."}, "parsely-title": "Laura Bush Hits the Fundraising Circuit", "parsely-tags": "Laura Welch Bush,Family Business,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NUKPG56S972801", "parsely-author": "Michael C Bender", "date": "2015-09-12T16:50:29.574Z", "keywords": "Laura Welch Bush,Family Business", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Laura Welch Bush,Family Business", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-12T16:50:29.574Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i37xlYGqWars/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-12/laura-bush-hits-the-fundraising-circuit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbc3\"", "article_summary": "Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz suggested there has been a boost in Bush fundraising as a result.\nGeorge W.
