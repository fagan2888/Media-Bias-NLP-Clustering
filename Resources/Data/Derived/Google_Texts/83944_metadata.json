In one major way, the law is working. But the most fundamental task of the law was reducing the number of Americans without health insurance, so it is hardly a cheap attempt to distract from the enrollment success to point out that it seems to be doing a rotten job of signing up the uninsured. Chris Conover, a Duke academic who blogs at Forbes with Avik Roy, has drawn up the below chart, comparing the share of uninsured Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage by this point versus each of the CBO\u2019s projections about the law.\n\nIt\u2019s doing absolutely terribly on this metric versus projections, to say nothing of rhetorical claims about vastly expanded coverage):\n\nThat is, even after many states rejected the Medicaid expansion and the HealthCare.gov debacle of last fall, the CBO still expected the law to cover twice as many of the uninsured as it did. Conover makes the right point: If the CBO had projected Obamacare would do this in its first year \u2014 disrupt individual markets and raise premiums for millions while covering one in eight uninsured Americans, it\u2019s hard to see how the law would have passed.\n\nI should note that I consider Conover\u2019s projections pretty conservative: I find it a little hard to believe 1 million people who were paying individual-market premiums before their plans were canceled are now going uninsured (if so, wow, this law is worse than I thought). The estimates about how many of the exchange enrollees were previously uninsured are still unreliable. People may be not becoming uninsured thanks to the ACA even if they had insurance last year. Etc. But Conover doesn\u2019t adjust for enrollees not paying their premiums, and he\u2019s doing careful work, so his basic conclusion is almost surely right: The law isn\u2019t meeting significantly lowered projections of how many insured it would cover.\n\nHere is the disheartening thing: Conservatives can talk all they want about whether Obamacare is covering the uninsured and doing so at a reasonable cost. But now that enrollments are no longer minuscule and because the exchanges, while they will be troubled and more costly than they should be thanks to a number of factors, aren\u2019t going to experience a death spiral, the law is solidifying its position.
