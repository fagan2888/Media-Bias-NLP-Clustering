I got to coach up some kids, learn from them, and hang around the Manning family,\u201d Grayson said in a conference call, after being selected in the third round at No. 75. \u201cI stayed in New Orleans for a couple of days after the game, and I loved the people down there. The southern hospitality is a true thing, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m definitely excited to be a part of. I love being around people and I\u2019m very social; I just love being in that type of environment. It\u2019s definitely something I\u2019m excited to be a part of.\u201d\n\nBecause of Brees, 36, and coach Sean Payton, \u201cthe Saints have been one of my dream teams throughout this entire process,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cSeeing how they go about their process and how routine-oriented those guys are, as well as talking to them about what their week is like, I think they mesh together extremely well.\u201d\n\nGrayson and Rams teammate Ty Sambrailo were the only Front Range players selected in the draft. Sambrailo went to the Broncos in the second round.\n\nLinebacker Darius Allen (6-foot-3, 229 pounds) of 2014 NCAA Division II national champion CSU-Pueblo signed a free agent contract with the Baltimore Ravens and ThunderWolves cornerback/returner C.J.
