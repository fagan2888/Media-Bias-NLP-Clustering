Most politicians would happily allow themselves to be lumped in with a president who defied odds and expectations and comfortably won two terms in the White House, but for Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, there is a certain amount of danger in those comparisons. The Republican Party and the conservative movement have spent the better part of the past eight years loudly complaining about what happens when you elect an \u201cinexperienced,\u201d \u201cuntested,\u201d and \u201crookie\u201d president who wasn\u2019t \u201cready on day one.\u201d The party\u2019s voters have been taught to believe that first-term senators make bad presidents.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio have tried to defuse these comparisons. Earlier this year, Cruz defiantly insisted that he\u2019s spent his short Senate career \u201cleading the fight on conservative principles,\u201d unlike Sen. Obama, who was a non-entity who \u201cdid not engage in a whole lot of issues of consequence.\u201d The argument didn\u2019t make a ton of sense, given that first-term senators are all backbenchers and Cruz\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d consisted mainly of grandstanding and obstructionism, but he nonetheless insisted that his \u201cexperience\u201d was infinitely superior to Obama\u2019s at the time.\n\nNow Rubio is fielding questions from voters who want to know what makes him so different from the last first-term senator elected president. And, like Cruz, Rubio is trying to make the case that he has far more experience than Obama did. Here\u2019s NBC News\u2019 report on Rubio\u2019s campaign swing through South Carolina:\n\nOne question hung over the senator all day \u2014 the question of his youth and inexperience, which echo President Obama\u2019s at the time he was elected. At both town halls on Saturday, Rubio was asked by a crowd member to explain how he\u2019d do better than Obama, with a similar amount of experience, but Rubio dispatched the question with ease. In Anderson, he argued he, unlike Obama, had done something in office, pointing to his effort to undermine Obamacare by effectively defunding the law\u2019s risk corridors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio lies and shades his record to claim more \"experience\" than another one-term senator: Barack Obama", "title": "Rubio\u2019s lying on his resume: His bogus boast that he has more experience than Obama in \u201908 is mere fantasy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Marco Rubio lies and shades his record to claim more \"experience\" than another one-term senator: Barack Obama", "title": "Rubio\u2019s lying on his resume: His bogus boast that he has more experience than Obama in \u201908 is mere fantasy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/23/rubios_lying_on_his_resume_his_bogus_boast_that_he_has_more_experience_than_obama_in_08_is_mere_fantasy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/obama_rubio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio lies and shades his record to claim more \"experience\" than another one-term senator: Barack Obama", "title": "Rubio\u2019s lying on his resume: His bogus boast that he has more experience than Obama in \u201908 is mere fantasy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/obama_rubio.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Affordable Care Act, aol_on, Barack Obama, Comprehensive Immigration Reform, gang of eight, Immigration Reform, Marco Rubio, Obamacare, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And, like Cruz, Rubio is trying to make the case that he has far more experience than Obama did.\nNow Rubio is fielding questions from voters who want to know what makes him so different from the last first-term senator elected president.\nIn Anderson, he argued he, unlike Obama, had done something in office, pointing to his effort to undermine Obamacare by effectively defunding the law\u2019s risk corridors.\nBoth Cruz and Rubio have tried to defuse these comparisons.\nAt both town halls on Saturday, Rubio was asked by a crowd member to explain how he\u2019d do better than Obama, with a similar amount of experience, but Rubio dispatched the question with ease."}
