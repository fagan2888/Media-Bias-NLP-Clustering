Beckley (WVVA) West Virginia had a greater percentage decline in residents without health insurance than any other state in the U.S. last year.



According to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control, the Mountain State experienced a 20 percent decline in uninsured West Virginians in 2015, leaving only nine percent in the state without health insurance.



Terri Giles, Executive Dir. of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, called the drop an unprecedented victory on Wednesday for the 200,000 West Virginians who have health care for the first time.



"A lot of it also has to do with the productivity in the state. We're a better work force when we're healthier. So now, thanks to the ACA, we're in a good place. When was the last time 90 percent of all Americans were covered by health care? Never."



Giles said the Affordable Health Care Act's emphasis on preventative medicine will go a long way toward cutting costs for not only patients, but hospitals across the state.



"You can go to the doctor now. You can catch things early. That's the beauty of the Affordable Care Act, that we catch things quick, that we get them fixed early, that it doesn't cost the system a tremendous amount of money, and it doesn't cost you your life."



Health Insurance Navigator Jeremy Smith has spent the last year helping West Virginians sign-up. While many West Virginians were hesitant at first, for many, he has seen the tide turn in attitudes as participants explore their plans.



"Consistently they rank us at the bottom of health care lists for everything, but this drop in the uninsured rate is going to be a great success in getting us healthier and toward the top of the list."



Smith said open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act starts again in December.
