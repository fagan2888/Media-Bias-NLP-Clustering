Health insurance premiums in major cities around the country are barely rising.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of two studies of data about newly public insurance rates. One, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, looked at 49 cities and found that prices for a popular type of plan are actually going down, on average. A second, from the actuarial firm Wakely Consulting Group, looked at the largest county in each of the 34 states with marketplaces run by the federal government and found an average rate decrease of one percent.\n\nDecreases in the price of health insurance are basically unheard-of. The individual insurance market that these new marketplaces replaced experienced annual increases of 10 percent in recent years. In the employer market, premiums went up by a record-low rate of 3 percent this year, but even that increase can\u2019t compare with what\u2019s happening in many exchange markets.\n\n\u201cUsually, health insurance premiums have gone in one direction, and that is up,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser who was a co-author on its paper. She said that the widespread premium decreases really stood out when she ran the numbers.\n\nThe studies suggest that, in large cities, at least, the new health insurance marketplaces are working as intended: Health insurers, competing for business, are keeping prices low. That\u2019s great news for the federal budget, since the government is paying subsidies to help some 85 percent of people on the market pay their bills. It\u2019s also good for consumers who will be coming to the market for the first time during open enrollment, which begins Saturday.\n\nBut just because the type of plan that the researchers examined \u2014 the second-cheapest plan in the \u201csilver\u201d category \u2014 is showing modest changes, that doesn\u2019t mean that every plan is a great deal. The Wakely analysis highlighted that many of the most popular plans from 2014 are getting much more expensive, while many of the cheapest plans will be new to the market in 2015. That means that consumers who simply renew their plans without shopping could get stuck with a substantial increase.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September, my colleague Amanda Cox and I looked at rates that were published early and found a similar pattern outside large cities. For an interactive map of the early rate data and a detailed explanation of the trade-offs between shopping and saving, read our article. (We\u2019ll be updating it soon with the new prices.)\n\nHistory suggests that a lot of people will avoid shopping again and simply renew their old plans. That will be a mistake. Some will miss out on savings. Others may face miscalculations of their federal subsidies and a surprise bill come tax time. \u201cConsumer beware,\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, a director at Wakely, and a co-author on its paper.\n\nThe good news on rates was not universal. In Anchorage, Alaska, for example, where very few people signed up for insurance this year, premiums are going up by 13 percent for a 40-year-old nonsmoker, according to the Wakely analysis. But if you take out the outliers on either side \u2014 premiums in Jackson, Miss., went down by 25 percent \u2014 most of the rates are either single-digit increases or single-digit decreases, moderate changes for health insurance.\n\nA full picture of the insurance exchanges will depend on filling in the missing parts of the country. Neither analysis looked at states in their entirety. And rates from Massachusetts and Hawaii won\u2019t be public until Saturday. But the city data looks promising for savvy consumers \u2014 and the federal budget.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141114065638, "twitter": {"description": "Premiums are barely rising in major cities, according to two studies, but shopping around is a key.", "creator": "sangerkatz", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/upshot/first-look-at-health-insurance-rates-for-next-year-is-encouraging.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003234071"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "First Look at Health Insurance Rates for Next Year Is Encouraging", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/upshot/first-look-at-health-insurance-rates-for-next-year-is-encouraging.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003234071", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/upshot/first-look-at-health-insurance-rates-for-next-year-is-encouraging.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 14, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Kaiser Family Foundation", "published": "2014-11-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates),Kaiser Family Foundation", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Premiums are barely rising in major cities, according to two studies, but shopping around is a key.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Premiums are barely rising in major cities, according to two studies, but shopping around is a key.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Kaiser Family Foundation", "slug": "15up-cities", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824163419, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/upshot/first-look-at-health-insurance-rates-for-next-year-is-encouraging.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Premiums are barely rising in major cities, according to two studies, but shopping around is a key.", "title": "First Look at Health Insurance Rates for Next Year Is Encouraging"}, "pdate": 20141114, "des": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "articleid": 100000003234071, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "First Look at Health Insurance Rates for Next Year Is Encouraging", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf558\"", "article_summary": "The studies suggest that, in large cities, at least, the new health insurance marketplaces are working as intended: Health insurers, competing for business, are keeping prices low.\nHealth insurance premiums in major cities around the country are barely rising.\n\u201cUsually, health insurance premiums have gone in one direction, and that is up,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser who was a co-author on its paper.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of two studies of data about newly public insurance rates.\nDecreases in the price of health insurance are basically unheard-of."}
