Twenty-seven percent have increased deductibles and 18% have implemented more intensive medical-management programs (e.g., prior authorization and/or disease management).\n\n\u201cThe study suggests plan sponsors have additional options and opportunities for managing the high cost of health care beyond increasing participant cost sharing, because relatively few plans have implemented strategies such as including financial incentives tied to wellness, moving to a narrower network or establishing an on-site clinic,\u201d says Andrew Sherman, senior vice president at Segal. \u201cThe Supreme Court affirmed with its King v.
