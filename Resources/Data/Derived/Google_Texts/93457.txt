The past few weeks have been filled with important conversations, enlightening discussions and significant decisions as it relates to the next year for Midland Memorial Hospital and its affiliated healthcare partners.

Looking ahead at what the next year has in store, the Midland County Hospital District leaders and board of directors had to face a challenging budget process this year which included setting a tax rate that would both support the hospital district’s responsibilities while remaining sensitive to the financial pressures in our community. The conversations circled around fiscal year 2015 Medicare cuts in excess of $4 million that will mostly carry forward into fiscal year 2016; no Medicaid expansion in Texas, while reimbursement reductions to finance the Affordable Care Act continue to impact the hospital; large capital expenditures required in coming years, including replacement of an obsolete Electronic Medical Record system, launch of a new Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, pharmacy/supply chain space renovation and operating room support redesign; and a continued increase in bad debt and charity care the hospital is facing as the local economy cools from recent levels of growth.

When all was said and done, an operating and capital budget for fiscal year 2016 as well as an ad valorem tax rate for the upcoming year were set and approved on Aug. 27 in a public meeting.

Below is a summary of the approved budget. It shows a $10.4 million improvement over fiscal year 2015 with budgeted net income of $5,948,337. While there was a proposal to consider a tax rate increase, the board determined no tax increase would be adopted this year due to the economic strain our community is already experiencing.

The proposed tax increase generated the most discussion during this year’s budget cycle and for good reason. There are many misconceptions surrounding tax rates and how they work. Check out the breakout Q&A section to learn more about the two components of the District’s tax rate, what they pay for, how they are calculated and how we compare to other hospital districts.

Running a hospital takes a very unique approach and philosophy compared to running any other business. Additionally, the topic of health care in general can be confusing and hard to navigate. In an effort to bring more awareness and understanding to the health care conundrum, we plan to break down these topics in future articles, including the rising costs of providing uncompensated care in Midland County, the impact the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) has had on Midland Memorial Hospital and health care in Texas, and how to understand the benefits of your health insurance plan. Feel free to also submit your ideas for future healthcare topics you’d like to learn more about by emailing marcy.madrid@midland-memorial.com.

Tax rate Q&A

What are the components of my tax rate?

There are two components to the tax rate for Midland County Hospital District: 1. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) - This rate represents the taxes generated that go directly to support the operations of the hospital. Technically, they can be used to pay salaries, supplies, cover the cost of indigent care or fund capital purchases for the District. Any day to day expenses the hospital incurs can be paid with M&O taxes. The hospital generates less than $20 million annually from M&O taxes while operating expenses are budgeted at just under $250 million in fiscal year 2016. For FY16, MCHD has adopted the “effective” rate of $0.08851 per $100 valuation, yielding the same net tax revenue as in FY15 (excluding properties newly added to the tax rolls).

2. Interest and Sinking (I&S) - This rate represents the taxes generated to pay debt service approved by the public in an election. In May 2009, voters in Midland County approved issuing of $115 million in bonds to support the construction of the Scharbauer Tower that opened in December 2012. This tax rate is calculated to generate enough tax dollars to meet the annual debt service on the bonds. For FY16, MCHD has adopted a rate of $0.03133 per $100 valuation.

How are taxes calculated and what do all the rates I read about really mean? There are a couple important terms and considerations when calculating a tax rate.

Effective Tax Rate - This is the rate that may be set by the hospital district that will generate the same amount of tax revenue as the prior year, on the exact same property from the prior year. If overall valuations in the district increase over the prior year, the effective tax rate will go down. If valuations in the district decrease, as happened this year, the effective tax rate must rise to generate the same tax revenues. Any increase or decrease in debt service (the Interest & Sinking Rate) is excluded from this calculation as the public has obligated itself to the debt service by way of election.

Rollback Rate - The rollback rate is an 8 percent increase over the effective rate. This rate also excludes any increase or decrease in debt service. If the board proposes any increase (even $1) over the effective rate, the district must provide public notice and hold two public hearings for resident to be able to present their feedback to the Board, before the board may finally vote to adopt a tax rate. Should the board vote to increase the tax rate more than 8 percent, the public can call an election to “roll” the rate back to a maximum increase of 8 percent.

How do the tax rates for Midland County Hospital District compare to other hospital districts in Texas?

Midland County Hospital District compares itself to seven other hospital districts in the state of Texas. Districts included are Bexar (San Antonio), Harris (Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), Dallas, Lubbock, Ector (Odessa) and El Paso. Of the revenue generated by Midland Memorial Hospital, only 8 percent of that revenue comes from taxes. Only Lubbock is lower in the peer group with 4.0 percent. Others range from 17-29 percent. As for overall tax rates posted for fiscal 2015 (the most recent available data), Midland’s rate was second lowest in the peer group at $0.1183 per $100 valuation. Only Lubbock was lower at $0.1168 while the others in the peer group ranged from $0.17 to $0.36 cents (including sales taxes for Districts that receive them).
