With some of the hurdles of the lame-duck session behind her and other obstacles ahead, the 27-year-old spoke with CQ Roll Call recently.\n\nShe said she's still working on a succinct way to sum up her job description \u2014 a challenge compounded by the fact that Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington gave her a \u201cblank slate\u201d mandate.\n\n\u201c\u2019Do what you want with it,\u2019\u201d Duppler said she was told. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that was appealing to me. It wasn\u2019t the Hill envisioning what they need; it was a member of Congress recognizing there was a vacuum, and soliciting from some outside person what they think the best practices are moving forward.\u201d\n\nA former GOP staffer on Capitol Hill familiar with coalitions work in Congress said Duppler wasn\u2019t alone in struggling to come up with a one-sentence mission-statement: \u201cIt was, and is, pretty nebulous,\u201d the ex-staffer conceded.\n\nPut simply, the job of the coalitions director is to work with outside lobby, influence and advocacy groups to minimize conflict around certain legislative and policy priorities. Many congressional offices have them, from the committee level to leadership.\n\nBeing the coalitions director for the House Republican Conference means being \u201ca mile wide and an inch deep\u201d on all of the relevant policy issues of the moment, a one-time Republican leadership aide said.\n\n\u201cConference shapes the message for the whole conference,\u201d he continued, \u201cso having someone in that office to interact both downtown and with conservative groups is important from a message standpoint, because sometimes that message gets lost.\u201d\n\nDuppler\u2019s longtime boss, ATR President Grover Norquist, compared coalitions building to conducting an orchestra.\n\n\u201cHaving been at ATR for four or five years, Mattie has sat through hundreds of meetings where somebody talked about taxes, somebody talked about guns, somebody talks about Uber, and if you understand why they\u2019re all connected, you can sort of play the movement as an orchestra. You can conduct the orchestra,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cEverybody plays their own instrument, but you understand why they\u2019re all there, maybe even better than they do. They understand why they\u2019re playing their instrument, but they don\u2019t know why these other guys are here.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview, Duppler talked about being a coalitions director in nearly identical terms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult when you\u2019re in a coalition \u2026 and you all care about different items,\u201d Duppler said, \u201cbut at the end of the day, your mission is to make [government] smaller, and you can all agree on that one singular issue.\u201d\n\nWhen Duppler was on the other side of the equation, \u201cwe didn\u2019t necessarily have to agree to still understand that we were on the same side of things. And I think that if you don\u2019t come from having that relationship beforehand, it\u2019s very hard to have a conversation where one or the other party thinks they\u2019re already at odds.\u201d\n\nDuppler said her status as outsider-turned-insider will make her most effective. Some of the other congressional coalitions directors rose up through members\u2019 offices or came to Capitol Hill from government affairs groups or lobby shops; Duppler earned her stripes in the advocacy circuit, fighting against competing interests to gain an audience with powerful lawmakers and score a seat at a crowded table.\n\nShe is no stranger to how quickly conflict can escalate, how rapidly discontent can boil over and wreak havoc on the legislative process. It\u2019s not always possible to bring that rage down to a simmer (see: Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth in 2013, egging on conservatives to defund Obamacare or shut down the government). But Duppler has an idea of what it takes to ease tensions and anticipate uproar.\n\n\u201cI want to communicate to outside groups what our prerogatives are, but also to go to groups and say, \u2018OK, what are your issues with that?\u2019\u201d Duppler explained. \u201cBeing able to really solicit their input before we run into a problem, which has been a shortcoming, I think, with a lot of interaction in the past.\n\n\u201cThere just isn\u2019t enough prior conversation until you hear about it when people are mad,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe story writes itself when people are mad, but the work that goes into that is really the important part.\u201d\n\nIn mapping out her vision for the job, she was careful not to criticize the work of predecessors: \u201cIt\u2019s not that people haven\u2019t been reaching out. It\u2019s just \u2026 knowing what questions to ask.\u201d\n\nDuppler attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a notoriously liberal institution where, in her words, \u201cI cut my teeth in politics disagreeing with people.\u201d\n\nShe graduated in 2008 and came to ATR in 2009 as an intern, where she quickly climbed the ranks. In five years, her name and face became recognizable across multiple platforms \u2014 in columns she wrote for Red Alert Politics and Town Hall and on TV news segments with the likes of Neil Cavuto and Chris Hayes.\n\nShe was both a policy wonk for and a public face of ATR. She worked her way up within the organization and became the first woman there to earn a director title. (She was also executive director of the Cost of Government Center, a project housed within ATR.)\n\nOver the summer, McMorris Rodgers\u2019 staff started soliciting names to replace Nick Muzin, who had left the coalitions director position to work for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Duppler\u2019s name was floated as a possible contender; her then-boss, Norquist, actually found out about it first.\n\n\u201cI knew she was open to working on the Hill, and that was fine,\u201d Norquist told CQ Roll Call. \u201cMattie had worked with us for five years and everyone was expecting that at some point she would leave. So I was delighted when the congresswoman from Washington \u2014 I ran into her at an airport \u2014 said, \u2018We\u2019d really like to hire her.' I said, \u2018That\u2019s exactly the right job for her.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn McMorris Rodgers\u2019 staff, Duppler isn\u2019t responsible for promoting policy positions and she isn\u2019t authorized to speak on the record. She says she\u2019s happy to offer lawmakers her opinion and perspective, but understands they might not always heed to her advice or pursue the path she would have chosen.\n\nGetting her way, Duppler insisted, \u201cis the last thing on the list of things that I care about.\"\n\n\"I am someone who has issues that I care very strongly about and I have issues that I continue to care about,\" she said, \"but I know at the end of the day that if I\u2019m someone who has to be agreed with 100 percent of the time on 100 percent of the issues, I am going to be a very unhappy person in Washington and in life.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a town where everyone wants to be heard, a big part of Mattie Duppler\u2019s job is to listen.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "In a town where everyone wants to be heard, a big part of Mattie Duppler\u2019s job is to listen.", "title": "In New Role on Capitol Hill, Duppler Goes From 'Outsider' to 'Insider'", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/in-new-role-on-capitol-hill-duppler-goes-from-outsider-to-insider", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2014/12/duppler002_102814-445x295.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-12-23T19:53:50Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "In a town where everyone wants to be heard, a big part of Mattie Duppler\u2019s job is to listen.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,category,author,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,club-for-growth,congressional-operations,conservatives,gop-brand,government-shutdown,health-care,heritage-action,life-in-congress,members,messaging,outside-groups,republicans-2,staff,icnw", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-12-23T19:53:50Z", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T19:53:50Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a town where everyone wants to be heard, a big part of Mattie Duppler\u2019s job is to listen.", "title": "In New Role on Capitol Hill, Duppler Goes From 'Outsider' to 'Insider'", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/in-new-role-on-capitol-hill-duppler-goes-from-outsider-to-insider", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2014/12/duppler002_102814-445x295.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Duppler, who made a name for herself as the director of budget and regulatory policy for Americans for Tax Reform, is the new coalitions director for the House Republican Conference.\nOver the summer, McMorris Rodgers\u2019 staff started soliciting names to replace Nick Muzin, who had left the coalitions director position to work for Sen.
