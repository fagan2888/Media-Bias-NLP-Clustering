American aid has been so slow to arrive that the money is no longer needed in the same ways it was planned, she said.\n\nFor example, the spread of Ebola has drastically slowed in Liberia, where most U.S. resources have been concentrated, while Sierra Leone has seen an alarming spike in cases in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cNow that [the funding] is being implemented on the ground, due to evolving nature of the outbreak, the needs have changed,\u201d she said.\n\nDoctors Without Borders also raised criticism about the pace of international funding in a grim report released Tuesday, warning that global efforts are \u201cfalling dangerously short of expectations.\u201d\n\nThe Ebola epidemic re-entered conversations on Capitol Hill this week, as Obama makes his case for a $6.2 billion emergency funding request. The Department of Defense will also hold a briefing on Ebola on Wednesday, its first since Congress returned from the midterm recess.\n\nMore than 2,900 members of the U.S. military are currently on the ground in West Africa, an official from the National Security Council said, an increase of about 800 over the last month.\n\nThe Pentagon had initially said it would deploy as many as 4,000 troops, though it recently revised that figure to 3,000.\n\nThe use of the military to fight Ebola has drawn intense scrutiny from Congress. Top defense officials were grilled at several hearings about how troops would be kept safe from the deadly disease.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic, which has now infected 17,000 people across West Africa, was also one of several challenges cited in Obama\u2019s decision to push out Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Chuck HagelHagel says NATO deployment could spark a new Cold War with Russia Overnight Defense: House panel unveils 5B defense spending bill Hagel to next president: We need to sit down with Putin MORE last week.\n\n\u201cThe system in place at the moment is not fully optimal, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Delaunay said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The head of the group's U.S. branch says too much work is being left to NGOs.", "description": "The head of the group's U.S. branch says too much work is being left to NGOs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The head of the group's U.S. branch says too much work is being left to NGOs.", "title": "Doctors Without Borders: Military must do more against Ebola outbreak", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225884-doctors-without-borders-head-military-must-to-do-more-against-ebola", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225884-doctors-without-borders-head-military-must-to-do-more-against-ebola", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-03T14:33-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Chuck Hagel,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T14:33:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225884-doctors-without-borders-head-military-must-to-do-more-against-ebola", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The head of the group's U.S. branch says too much work is being left to NGOs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Doctors Without Borders: Military must do more against Ebola outbreak"}, "dcterms.title": "Doctors Without Borders: Military must do more against Ebola outbreak"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3966\"", "article_summary": "The head of Doctors Without Borders' U.S. branch said Wednesday that the American military must do more than \u201ctransport cement\u201d to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\nThe use of the military to fight Ebola has drawn intense scrutiny from Congress.\n\u201cWe did very much welcome the military in this environment,\u201d Delaunay told The Hill.\nThe Department of Defense will also hold a briefing on Ebola on Wednesday, its first since Congress returned from the midterm recess.\nExecutive Director Sophie Delaunay said in an interview that the armed forces' current role in West Africa has been \u201cinsufficient,\" leaving too much of the work to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."}
