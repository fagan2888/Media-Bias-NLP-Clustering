The latest was a 66 pound (30 kg) package of cocaine that washed ashore on Monday.\n\nSchirard says Galveston sees drugs washing up on its beaches usually once every other month.\n\nThat has picked up this week due to bottlenecks at the Houston Shipping Channel, which is experiencing delays due to the storms that have snarled transport.\n\n\"Coast Guard and Customs are taking advantage to check these boats so when they get into the channel they have already been cleared,\" Schirard said.\n\n\"These guys see agents boarding the boat ahead of them and they know this is coming, so they go ahead and ditch these narcotics overboard.\"\n\n(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - The storm system pelting Texas with torrential rains this week", "title": "Texas floods spur drug purges from waiting ships: police", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/27/Texas-floods-spur-drug-purges-waiting-ships-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-storms_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/27/Texas-floods-spur-drug-purges-waiting-ships-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-storms_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - The storm system pelting Texas with torrential rains this week", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That has picked up this week due to bottlenecks at the Houston Shipping Channel, which is experiencing delays due to the storms that have snarled transport.\nSchirard says Galveston sees drugs washing up on its beaches usually once every other month.\n\"Six wash-ups within the last week,\" said Sergeant Joshua Schirard of the Galveston Police.\nSAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - The storm system pelting Texas with torrential rains this week has caused a stream of illegal drugs to wash up on the shores around Galveston, near a backed-up Houston Shipping Channel, police said on Wednesday.\nThe latest was a 66 pound (30 kg) package of cocaine that washed ashore on Monday."}
