What was their crime? Plotting a Modi assassination? A terrorist attack? Raping someone?\n\nNo. They were suspected of harboring and consuming beef. BEEF.\n\nBut what has PM Modi\u2019s reaction to this horrible incident that has sent shockwaves in India been. After all, Zuckerberg hailed Modi as a model leader who would revolutionize governance with his masterful use of social media \"to connect with citizens.\u201d\n\nComplete and total silence, I point out in my column at The Week. This frenetic tweeter has issued not a single tweet, nor posted a Facebook statement expressing regret or offering condolence for this dead Muslim citizen.\n\nBut if Modi thinks he can get away by giving Hindu zealots free rein to persecute and kill others in the name of his religion, it is because he thinks folks like Zuckerberg have his back. These CEOs engage in selective diplomacy, naively lapping up Modi's happy talk about \"inclusive development,\u201d allowing Modi to bury the rest of his odious agenda in international glory.\n\nBut there are three things Zuckerberg can do to wash off his bad Modi karma, including sponsoring the slain man\u2019s family for asylum.\n\nRead what the others are in my column here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Silicon Valley's shameless courting of Indian PM Modi has fed the flames of Hindu zealotry in India", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Should Sponsor for Asylum the Family of Indian Muslim Lynched for Eating Beef", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/08/mark-zucherberg-should-sponsor-for-asylu", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14443142257413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14443142257413.jpg", "description": "Silicon Valley's shameless courting of Indian PM Modi has fed the flames of Hindu zealotry in India", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Should Sponsor for Asylum the Family of Indian Muslim Lynched for Eating Beef"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2015-10-08T15:25:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/shikha-dalmia"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d03\"", "article_summary": "But there are three things Zuckerberg can do to wash off his bad Modi karma, including sponsoring the slain man\u2019s family for asylum.\nThis frenetic tweeter has issued not a single tweet, nor posted a Facebook statement expressing regret or offering condolence for this dead Muslim citizen.\nBut if Modi thinks he can get away by giving Hindu zealots free rein to persecute and kill others in the name of his religion, it is because he thinks folks like Zuckerberg have his back.\nBut what has PM Modi\u2019s reaction to this horrible incident that has sent shockwaves in India been.\nThese CEOs engage in selective diplomacy, naively lapping up Modi's happy talk about \"inclusive development,\u201d allowing Modi to bury the rest of his odious agenda in international glory."}
