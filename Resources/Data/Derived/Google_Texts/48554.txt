The draining of a Clarke Co. lake is continuing as authorities search for a missing Wayne Co. man.

Clarke county chief deputy Barry White says the lake has lowered to the point where search crews can get a better look at the land. He says the lake should be completely drained by late Monday or early Tuesday. The sheriff's department has been draining the lake for nearly a week after receiving a tip that Patrick Sellers might be at the bottom. Sellers has been missing for over a month. His family says he has been running with the wrong crowd and that has led to the current situation.
