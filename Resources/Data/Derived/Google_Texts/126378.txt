The Franklin High School Class of 1979 will hold its 35th reunion June 14 at Homestead Manor.

It has always been important that the bunch maintain close relationships with one another, Nancy Garrett, student body vice president, said in a statement. The Franklin High classes of 1978 and 1980 also are invited.

“We’re a unique group,” Garrett said. “From police officers and firefighters, to distinguished educators and doctors, to talented artists and renowned vocalists, our class has given so much back to this community. I’m proud to know I have such a wonderful set of friends to come back to.”

The reunion is at Homestead Manor, a restored antebellum home on Columbia Pike that is owned by Andy Marshall, a 1979 graduate and proprietor of Puckett’s family of restaurants.

The event is from 7 to 11 p.m., and tickets are $40 at the door. The evening includes appetizers, a cash bar and a DJ. Attire is dressy casual.
