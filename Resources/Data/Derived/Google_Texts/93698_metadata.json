In total, there were 27,151 abortions in Michigan in 2015, according to the report. The downturn reflects a larger trend across the U.S. where abortion rates are dropping to historic lows.\n\n\u201cWe would have liked to see a larger decrease, but these numbers represent almost 500 lives saved, which everyone should celebrate,\u201d said Barbara Listing, president of the Right to Life of Michigan.\n\nWhen compared with abortion numbers from 1990, however, the 2015 numbers shows that pro-lifers have been making progress in Michigan. The 2015 abortion numbers represent a 44.7 percent drop from the all-time high in 1987, according to the report. Abortions among minors also dropped significantly, down almost 79 percent since 1990, according to the report.\n\nHere is more from the Right to Life of Michigan:\n\nAbortion numbers increased in Michigan in 2013 and 2014. It\u2019s likely that much of those increases were due to failures to follow state reporting requirements in previous years. Michigan updated abortion clinic regulations in 2012, causing several clinics to close, at least one of which was known to be not reporting abortion numbers. Women are now going to clinics more likely to follow state reporting laws. In debates over Michigan\u2019s Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act in 2013, abortion supporters claimed that legislation would prevent women from using insurance to pay for abortions. The law protected conscience rights of individuals by preventing them from being forced to pay for abortions though Obamacare health exchanges. SUPPORT LIFENEWS!

In 2015, there were 1,538 paid for by insurance, more than double the number. Listing said, \u201cAs usual, the exaggerated rhetoric of abortion advocates proved to be completely detached from reality.\u201d In 2015 abortion rates declined, as well as the abortion ratios, meaning a higher percentage of women chose life for their children. Abortion numbers for Michigan residents and out-of-state residents both declined, ending the recent surge in women traveling to Michigan to have abortions.\n\nThe pro-life group also is working on a measure to protect even more unborn babies and their moms from the pain of abortion. According to their blog, the Michigan Coercive Abortion Prevention Act would protect women who are being pressured into having abortions. Coerced abortions are a major problem, with studies showing more than half of women felt pressure from a partner or parent to abort their unborn babies.\n\nThe legislation would make it illegal to \u201ccoerce a woman to abort by threatening or actually committing the following actions: physical assault, withdrawing financial support, or terminating or otherwise violating a legal contract, destroying or concealing a passport or other identification, and threats to deport or arrest,\u201d according to Michigan RTL.\n\n\u201cDespite claiming to be champions of choice, the abortion industry has an incentive to ignore this problem; they deny it even exists,\u201d Listing said. \u201cThey won\u2019t address it, so we will.\u201d\n\nMichigan RTL said it hopes the bill will pass this term. The state House passed it in March, and a Senate committee passed it earlier this month, LifeNews reported.\n\nACTION: Contact your Michigan state Senator here and urge them to pass the Coercive Abortion Prevention Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan Abortions Drop 1.7% as Pro-Life Groups Save Hundreds of Babies From Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Abortions dropped in Michigan for the first time in three years in 2015 saving almost 500 unborn babies' lives, according to the Right to Life of Michigan blog.", "title": "Michigan Abortions Drop 1.7% as Pro-Life Groups Save Hundreds of Babies From Abortion", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/19/michigan-abortions-drop-1-7-as-pro-life-groups-save-hundreds-of-babies-from-abortion/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ultrasound3d47.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "michigan abortions drop 1.7% as pro-life groups save hundreds of babies from abortion", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "When compared with abortion numbers from 1990, however, the 2015 numbers shows that pro-lifers have been making progress in Michigan.\nThe 2015 abortion numbers represent a 44.7 percent drop from the all-time high in 1987, according to the report.\nAbortion numbers for Michigan residents and out-of-state residents both declined, ending the recent surge in women traveling to Michigan to have abortions.\nMichigan updated abortion clinic regulations in 2012, causing several clinics to close, at least one of which was known to be not reporting abortion numbers.\nThis week, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services released its 2015 abortion report, showing a 1.7 percent decrease in the number of abortions."}
