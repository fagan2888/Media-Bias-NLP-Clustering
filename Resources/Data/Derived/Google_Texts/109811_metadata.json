(AP) - The Mohegan Sun casinos, threatened by increasing competition and battered by the worst recession in decades and consumers reluctant to spend money in a weak recovery, delivered some good news Thursday as it reported increases in first-quarter revenue and profit.\n\nRevenue rose at the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, the parent company of the Connecticut and Pennsylvania casinos, as table games and slot machines brought in more money and the casino\u2019s hotel in Pennsylvania completed its first full year in business.\n\nIn its fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, revenue was $316.7 million, up 1.2 percent from the same period in fiscal 2014. Profit of $14.8 million compared with a net loss of $67.3 million in the same three months of 2013.\n\n\u201cAlthough one quarter does not make a trend - and over the last several years we\u2019ve certainly learned not to be too optimistic - we\u2019re nonetheless encouraged by the quarter,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Grossinger Etess told investor analysts on a conference call.\n\nSeveral performance measures, including the largest quarterly increase in slot revenue since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 - before the start of the recession- indicate that the business is \u201con the upswing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe authority said the profit increase was due largely to payment of debt for refinancing before it was due and rising income.\n\nSlot revenue of $197.9 million was up 0.4 percent from last year\u2019s first quarter and table game revenue of $79 million rose 4.6 percent.\n\nMohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, \u201cbenefited from a full period of hotel and convention center operation,\u201d the tribal authority said.\n\nA 238-room hotel and 20,000-square-foot convention center debuted in November 2013.\n\nIt was the second round of positive financial results reported by the Mohegan Sun this month. On Jan. 15, it announced a 7 percent revenue increase in December, to $49 million, from December 2013. Slot machine bets also rose by 5 percent.\n\nEtess repeated his belief that the Mohegan Sun and its eastern Connecticut neighbor, Foxwoods Resort Casino, could work together to compete with a casino set to open in Springfield, Massachusetts, in a few years.\n\n\u201cSince the tribes have the exclusive right for gaming in Connecticut, it would certainly be an opportunity for that to happen and we think it could,\u201d he said.\n\nKevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority Management Board, said the Mashantucket Pequots, who operate Foxwoods, and Mohegan tribal officials have maintained \u201cregular and persistent contact\u201d with state legislators. However, they have not formed a partnership and are not seeking to expand gambling, which would likely meet opposition.\n\n\u201cWe are jointly interested and jointly pursuing this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both have the same impact to be felt and interest in the potential for what we might call reorganizing jobs and revenue within the state of Connecticut, not expanding gaming,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Stephen Singer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SteveSinger10", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mohegan Sun casinos, threatened by increasing competition and battered by the worst recession in decades and consumers reluctant to spend money in a weak recovery, delivered some good news Thursday as it reported increases in first-quarter revenue and profit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/29/mohegan-sun-casinos-report-1q-rise-in-revenue-prof/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Mohegan Sun casinos, threatened by increasing competition and battered by the worst recession in decades and consumers reluctant to spend money in a weak recovery, delivered some good news Thursday as it reported increases in first-quarter revenue and profit.", "title": "Mohegan Sun casinos report 1Q rise in revenue, profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mohegan Sun casinos, threatened by increasing competition and battered by the worst recession in decades and consumers reluctant to spend money in a weak recovery, delivered some good news Thursda", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mohegan Sun casinos report 1Q rise in revenue, profit"}, "Author": "STEPHEN SINGER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27fb\"", "article_summary": "Kevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority Management Board, said the Mashantucket Pequots, who operate Foxwoods, and Mohegan tribal officials have maintained \u201cregular and persistent contact\u201d with state legislators.\nSlot revenue of $197.9 million was up 0.4 percent from last year\u2019s first quarter and table game revenue of $79 million rose 4.6 percent.\nMohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, \u201cbenefited from a full period of hotel and convention center operation,\u201d the tribal authority said.\nRevenue rose at the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, the parent company of the Connecticut and Pennsylvania casinos, as table games and slot machines brought in more money and the casino\u2019s hotel in Pennsylvania completed its first full year in business.\nIn its fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31, revenue was $316.7 million, up 1.2 percent from the same period in fiscal 2014."}
