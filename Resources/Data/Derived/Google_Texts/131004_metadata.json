She was helped by the scrappy, brilliant Family Defense Center in Chicago. As the Chicago Tribune reports:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just relieved this is over,\u201d said Natasha Felix, a 27-year-old single mother. \u201cI knew that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d In July 2013, the three children \u2014 then ages 11, 9 and 5 \u2014 were left under the supervision of the eldest boy. A passer-by saw the Felix boys, along with their 9-year-old cousin, playing and called the DCFS hotline, unaware that Felix was checking on them from the window of her East Ukrainian Village apartment every 10 minutes, she said. The youngsters were unharmed, but she was cited for child neglect under a category called \u201cinadequate supervision.\u201d The state statute defines this as \u201ca child under the age of 14 whose parent \u2026 leaves the minor without supervision for an unreasonable amount of time, without regard for the mental or physical health or safety of the minor.\u201d The children were not removed from her home, but the finding of neglect kept her from volunteering at their school and limited her job prospects as the allegation remained in the state\u2019s central registry. But this week, DCFS reversed course and has filed no opposition to this motion, according to court documents. \u201cUnder the new leadership of Acting Director George Sheldon, the Department has determined that the best course of action is to unfound and expunge Ms. Felix\u2019s case,\u201d DCFS spokesman Andrew Flach said in an email. \u201cMoving forward, the Department will be taking a closer look at similar cases to ensure that we allow caretakers to be prudent parents and considering changes to Department rules and procedures.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great to see Sheldon suggesting that he will change the department\u2019s guidelines, the way Maryland did after that state humiliated itself after arresting the Meitiv family twice for letting their kids walk home from the park. It is honorable to recognize when regulations have gone too far, and to do something about it.\n\nHere\u2019s what Diane Redleaf, director of the Family Defense Center, wrote to me in an email:\n\nIt is urgent that child protection agencies stop investigating parents for making basic decisions as to when their children can be alone, can go out and play, and can be left briefly while the parent attends to the business of caring for them. There need to be standards that say that children are not neglected unless their parents knowingly subject them to serious and immediate risks of harm\u2013i.e. by blatantly disregarding the duties they owe their children. Those duties do not require require parents to protect children from boogeymen who might conceivably snatch them if they are allowed to play. We need to stop second guessing parents\u2019 decisions by labeling decisions about parenting \u2018neglectful\u2019 when no harm to the child has occurred. We\u2019re spending far too much energy in America on investigations of parents who have not hurt their children, and not enough resources helpful to the children whose parents have actually abused them.\n\nSo, to recap: Last week President Obama signed national legislation allowing kids to walk to school, and this week we have a mom exonerated after letting her children play outside.
