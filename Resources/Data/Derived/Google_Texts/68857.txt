California’s health insurance exchange Covered California — one of the largest in the country — is saying “thanks but no thanks” to President Obama’s offer to wait another year before canceling health plans that don’t comply with the Affordable Care Act.

Covered California’s five board members voted unanimously to stick with the administration’s original roll-out schedule, which means that 1.1 million policy holders will be getting cancellation notices.

Covered California’s executive director, Peter Lee says that delaying the cancellations would just delay the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, in effect, “making a bad situation worse.” He joins Here & Now’s Jeremy Hobson.
