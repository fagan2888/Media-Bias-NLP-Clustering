HHS said 5.7 million low-income people remain uninsured in those states.\n\nStates that expanded Medicaid have seen enrollment surge 18.5 percent, while those that have not expanded the program registered only a 4 percent increase, according to HHS.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is a centerpiece of the healthcare reform law, which also created new online marketplaces to provide federally subsidized private health insurance plans that have enrolled an additional 8 million people.\n\nOpen enrollment for private insurance ended in the spring. Medicaid enrollment remains open year round.\n\nThe administration has been unable to say how many new enrollees obtained private or public coverage for the first time under Obamacare.\n\nA recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that 10.3 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage through the marketplaces and Medicaid, resulting in a 5.2 percentage point drop in the U.S. uninsured rate since last September.\n\nThe study was produced by researchers from HHS, the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "More than seven million Americans have gained health coverage through government programs including Medicaid since enrollment in Obamacare health insurance was launched October 1, the U.S. administration said on Friday.", "title": "New Medicaid enrollments top 7 million under Obamacare", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140808&t=2&i=960323455&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA770QQ", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
