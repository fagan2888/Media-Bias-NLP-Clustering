When it is their time, they want to be consulted so they die in a way that they are respected, and they don\u2019t want their families burdened,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. V.J. Periyakoil, director of the Stanford Palliative Care Education and Training Program and associate director of palliative care services at the VA Palo Alto Health Care Center.\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, however, the researchers found that access to high-quality end-of-life care is often hampered by lack of financial means, poor communication with health providers, cultural mores and family conflicts. The study, involving more than 300 white, Asian and African-American seniors, was published last week in the Journal of Palliative Medicine.\n\nPeriyakoil, whose earlier research focused on how doctors discuss end-of-life care with patients from different cultures, said physicians often believe that talking about end-of-life care with patients of certain ethnic groups is taboo and that patients and their families are reluctant to have these sensitive conversations. The new study, though small and limited in geographic scope, suggests otherwise. The participants may have been more affluent and better educated than their counterparts nationwide, given the region\u2019s demographics, Periyakoil noted.\n\nThe researchers interviewed 315 people over 50 at senior centers in Fremont, Palo Alto, San Francisco, San Jose and Walnut Creek. The group included 38 African-Americans, 160 Asian-Americans and 117 Caucasians.\n\nInterviews were conducted in multiple languages: English, Burmese, Hindi, Mandarin, Tagalog and Vietnamese. Researchers examined participants\u2019 attitudes toward end-of-life care and whether they had experienced barriers to getting quality end-of-life care for relatives or others in their community.\n\nFinances an Issue for Many\n\nResearchers are still collecting data on Latino participants and plan to publish a separate study on their views, Periyakoil said.\n\nWhile all of the participants in the study said they valued high-quality end-of-life care, about 60 percent said they had experienced barriers to getting it, most notably financial difficulties and a lack of adequate health insurance. Medicare typically covers only short-term nursing home care and offers hospice benefits to patients whose doctors certify they have six months or less to live and who are willing to forgo treatment intended to cure their terminal illness.\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences among ethnic groups in reporting barriers to care. But participants with less education were more likely to report that their biggest barrier to care was financial.\n\nPatients with more education were more likely to cite doctor behaviors that hampered end-of-life communication. And women were more likely than men to cite barriers to care overall, perhaps because they were more likely to be direct caregivers and have more experience with end-of-life needs.\n\n\u2018Vague Responses\u2019 from Doctors\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, patients felt that \u201cdoctors were just too busy to initiate [end-of-life] conversations, reluctant to listen to their concerns and questions about EOL decision making, and often gave vague responses, making it difficult for the patient to comprehend their choices and make informed decisions,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nAn estimated 2.6 million Americans die every year, but how the American health care system handles their last days is problematic across ethnic groups, according to \u201cDying in America,\u201d a landmark report released in 2014 by the Institute of Medicine. Too many people end up having aggressive treatment that is ineffective and expensive and doesn\u2019t contribute to the patient\u2019s quality of life, the report found. Other research examining racial gaps in attitudes toward hospice care and other studies has found differences among ethnic and religious groups in how they approach end-of-life decisions.\n\nBut people want to talk about it regardless of background, says Dr. Steven Pantilat, director of UC San Francisco\u2019s palliative care program. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cWhat this study tells us is that all of our patients want us to have these conversations,\u201d Pantilat said. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for their doctors to bring it up, to not be rushed, to communicate sensitively.\u201d\n\nA new federal policy may make those conversations easier \u2013- and more routine. Starting in January, Medicare will reimburse physicians for discussing end-of-life care. That policy infamously \u2014 and incorrectly \u2014 was derided as promoting \u201cdeath panels\u201d during the debate over the Affordable Care Act, and a version of it was dropped from the legislation. The counseling will cover what kind of medical care patients want to receive as they approach their last days.\n\nPeriyakoil urges patients of all backgrounds to prepare for these conversations, and new planning tools are available in different languages to help. Among them is the Stanford Letter Project, which helps patients write a letter to their doctors about the end-of-life care they do and don\u2019t want in languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog and Russian.\n\nIn one redacted letter provided by Periyakoil, a woman named Patricia writes: \u201cI do not want my longevity to be more important than my comfort.\u201d\n\nPantilat advises the doctors he trains that they don\u2019t need deep knowledge of the beliefs of every religion and culture they might encounter, because every patient, of whatever ethnicity, has different goals.\n\n\u201cIf we come in with true curiosity, respect and openness, we can learn a lot about how to take care of someone in a sensitive way,\u201d he said. We need to ask: \u201cWhat do I need to know about your culture and your family to take good care of you?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stanford researchers queried three major ethnic groups in the Bay Area and found 'a common humanity' in responses.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Wishes for End-of-Life Care Are Common Across Ethnicities\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/23\\/wishes-for-end-of-life-care-common-across-ethnicities\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-23 14:37:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-24 13:29:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":112954,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"End of Life Care\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/iStock_000057498948_Large.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Stanford researchers queried three major ethnic groups in the Bay Area and found 'a common humanity' in responses.", "title": "Wishes for End-of-Life Care Are Common Across Ethnicities", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/23/wishes-for-end-of-life-care-common-across-ethnicities/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/iStock_000057498948_Large-1440x1282.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "end of life care,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Periyakoil, director of the Stanford Palliative Care Education and Training Program and associate director of palliative care services at the VA Palo Alto Health Care Center.\nResearchers examined participants\u2019 attitudes toward end-of-life care and whether they had experienced barriers to getting quality end-of-life care for relatives or others in their community.\nThe counseling will cover what kind of medical care patients want to receive as they approach their last days.\nStarting in January, Medicare will reimburse physicians for discussing end-of-life care.\nBut people want to talk about it regardless of background, says Dr. Steven Pantilat, director of UC San Francisco\u2019s palliative care program."}
