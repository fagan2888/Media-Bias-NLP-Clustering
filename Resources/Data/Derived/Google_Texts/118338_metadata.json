Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush was asked on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d what President Obama should do now. \u201cLead,\u201d Mr. Bush said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Reports of Syrian bomber in Paris undermine Obama refugee plans\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want him to do. I want him to lead,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cHe has the capability of doing this. We have the resources to do this. This is a threat to Western civilization, and we should consider it that way.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush ticked off a list of responses, including declaring a no-fly zone over Syria, arming directly the Kurdish peshmerga forces, and re-engaging with Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq.\n\nRep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called for the White House to stop its policy of trying to contain the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS, and move to defeat the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cI think Paris changes everything. It should galvanize the entire world behind our efforts to defeat and destroy ISIS, not just to contain them,\u201d Mr. McCaul said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been the policy of this administration, has been containment only. And when the president said that ISIS is being contained, I would hate to see what ISIS looks like unleashed.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has been ridiculed for describing the Islamic State as \u201ccontained\u201d in an interview Thursday on ABC News, one day before an estimated eight suicide gunmen attacked Paris, killing 129 people.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think we can brush it aside any longer,\u201d Mr. McCaul said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to deal with it at its core or we\u2019re going to continue to see these terrorist attacks not only in Europe, but what I am most concerned about is an attack against the United States and the homeland.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy in Syria as it relates to ISIL.\n\n\u201cThe president talked the other morning about ISIL was contained. America learned within 24 hours it\u2019s not contained,\u201d Mr. Burr said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rampant everywhere in the world that they intend to carry out these horrific acts. It just so happens the United States is a target. But Paris was easier.\u201d\n\nMr. Nunes said the issue wasn\u2019t with whether there should be \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve had boots on the ground there for over a year,\u201d said Mr. Nunes. \u201cThe problem is, as Chairman Burr said, trying to use pinpricks with our airstrikes.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe first rule of war for the Obama administration is not to take collateral damage. Well, that\u2019s not war. And if you\u2019re going to strap down the United States Air Force and our allies with these types of rules of engagement, we are never going to win and you\u2019re going to see more and more refugees flood into Europe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frustrated Republicans called Sunday on the White House to get serious about fighting Middle East terrorism in the wake of a series of attacks, culminating in the massacre in Paris.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Frustrated Republicans called Sunday on the White House to get serious about fighting Middle East terrorism in the wake of a series of attacks, culminating in the massacre in Paris.", "title": "Republicans call on Obama to start defeating Islamic State", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/15/republicans-call-obama-start-defeating-islamic-sta/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/26/mccaul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/26/mccaul.jpg", "description": "Frustrated Republicans called Sunday on the White House to get serious about fighting Middle East terrorism in the wake of a series of attacks, culminating in the massacre in Paris.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans call on Obama to start defeating Islamic State"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Paris, Devin Nunes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLead,\u201d Mr. Bush said.\nI want him to lead,\u201d Mr. Bush said.\nand Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush was asked on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d what President Obama should do now.\nSEE ALSO: Reports of Syrian bomber in Paris undermine Obama refugee plans\u201cThat\u2019s what I want him to do.\nAmerica learned within 24 hours it\u2019s not contained,\u201d Mr. Burr said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rampant everywhere in the world that they intend to carry out these horrific acts."}
