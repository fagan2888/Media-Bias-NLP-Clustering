The rest is history.\u201d\n\nCrosson\u2019s years of Obama impressions paid off last week when he was invited to the White House with other YouTube stars to talk about the administration\u2019s push to drive Affordable Care Act signups. On Thursday, the White House released a video of the interactions, including Crosson\u2019s one-on-one with the president.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely nerve-wracking to do that in front of him, but to do it and see the smile on his face, and to gesture to his camera lady and say, \u2018Are you recording this?\u2019 That was such a cool moment for me,\u201d Crosson said Friday.\n\nWhile his decision to start working on the impression was opportunistic, he said the chance to meet Obama, whom he supports and voted for, was the culmination of a long-held goal.\n\n\u201cIt was actually very amazing,\u201d Crosson said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I had wanted ever since I began doing the impression in late 2008, early 2009, and to actually finally get to the point of going there was amazing. It was a great experience and meeting the president and getting to see the man he is, it was all around amazing.\u201d\n\nGetting the chance to study his subject up close was both helpful and not, Crosson said. While he picked up on some subtleties in his conversations with the president, he distinguished between the different tones Obama uses and how it affects his impressions.\n\n\u201cI studied him a lot and his speeches and his candid interviews, his addresses, and the thing is when doing an impression of the president \u2014 because obviously its comical \u2014 it\u2019s a little bit more of a caricature then it is a spot-on voice,\u201d Crosson said.\n\nHe continued, slipping into his presidential voice at times: \u201cI use different tones when I do him, there\u2019s the speech voice which is a lot louder, and the interview voice, which there are pauses, and he takes his time, and there\u2019s his speaking voice, which I don\u2019t use a lot because it works better to do a little bit of a caricature than to do a dead-on voice. And when we were just talking, it was really cool to hear how he sounded and take note of that.\u201d\n\nCrosson said he was interested in meeting with the White House about the implementation of Obamacare, as he has had his own struggles with being uninsured and having medical bills in the past. The video released by the White House largely serves as a \u201cget covered\u201d advertisement, as the YouTube stars talk about the message of signing people up for health insurance.\n\nCrosson also said that the president acknowledged the problems with Obamacare in their meeting, saying there were still parts that needed to be worked on and improved.\n\nIt\u2019s a meeting the Cincinnati native wasn\u2019t sure would ever truly happen when the White House asked for Crosson to visit through a studio he works with.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018The White House is going to be meeting with some YouTubers, and they requested you by name, and they wanted to know if you could make it, and I said, \u2018Absolutely,\u2019\u201d Crosson said. \u201cAt the time I kind of felt there was no way this is actually happening, something is going to go wrong and fall through and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to get to go. But it came through, and I got my tickets and got my email that I was cleared, and I was kind of in shock.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;It was definitely nerve-wracking to do that in front of him,&quot; YouTube star Iman Crosson says.", "title": "Why I am an Obama impersonator", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/barack-obama-impersonator-iman-crosson-youtube-104430.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/06/140306_obamaimpersonator_sg_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,YouTube", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;It was definitely nerve-wracking to do that in front of him,&quot; YouTube star Iman Crosson says.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5de\"", "article_summary": "Crosson says meeting Obama was the culmination of a long-held goal.\n| POLITICO Screen grab Why I am an Obama impersonatorWhen Iman Crosson began working on his impersonation of President Barack Obama, he didn\u2019t expect to be invited to the White House one day, he was just a struggling actor looking for his big break.\nOn Thursday, the White House released a video of the interactions, including Crosson\u2019s one-on-one with the president.\nWhile he picked up on some subtleties in his conversations with the president, he distinguished between the different tones Obama uses and how it affects his impressions.\nThe rest is history.\u201dCrosson\u2019s years of Obama impressions paid off last week when he was invited to the White House with other YouTube stars to talk about the administration\u2019s push to drive Affordable Care Act signups."}
