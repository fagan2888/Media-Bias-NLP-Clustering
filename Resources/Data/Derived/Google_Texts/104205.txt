A panel of experts discussed ways to reduce health care costs in the state Wednesday at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.

Pennington Executive Director Peter Katzmarzyk said the biggest issues facing Louisiana are obesity and health literacy. He said 33 percent of Louisianans are obese, and Louisiana ranks 49th in health literacy.

"The root cause of a lot of the problems we'll talk about today is obesity," Katzmarzyk said.

Ochsner Health System President Warner Thomas said private businesses need to encourage better health practices. Ochsner has a incentive program that Thomas said is effective for people that take advantage of it.

"It's about creating momentum. It's about creating an 'I can do' attitude," Thomas said.

Thomas said another piece of the puzzle is insurance companies offering affordable plans that still provide the coverage people need.

"Middle class America cannot afford health insurance anymore. They just can't. If we don't solve it, it's going to be solved for us, and we're not going to like it," Thomas said.

Randy Watson, director of insurance for the Caddo Parish School Board, said the Affordable Care Act is not reducing costs the way it should because subsidies are putting a higher burden on customers by way of costs for premiums. He said the law is too restrictive on what the minimum and maximum benefits of a plan can be.

He said resources need to be shifted to primary care.

"Members need to be responsible too," Watson said. "The person that takes care of themselves should have a lower premium or cost out of pocket than someone who doesn't."

The discussion Wednesday was part of a program sponsored by The Atlantic where experts are brought together to discuss solutions to health care issues.
