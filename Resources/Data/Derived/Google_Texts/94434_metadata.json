The Alabama Finance Department is in the middle of updating its accounting software, and the upgrade has been anything but smooth.\n\nThroughout the state, government vendors and contractors have been paid late, if at all.\n\nTom Layfield, director of the Alabama Road Builders Association, told the Montgomery Advertiser this week that the late payments have been hurting some of their members.\n\n\"One of my members said, 'I've begged, borrowed and stolen everything I can. I really have to get paid now,'\" Layfield told the Advertiser.\n\nThe finance department has brought on extra staff to try to unstick the backlog of accounts payable.\n\nBut that's work the IT contractor should be doing.\n\nTwo years ago, the state hired CGI Technologies and Solutions to upgrade the state's systems. Under the four-year contract, the state will pay CGI $47 million.\n\nIf CGI seems familiar to you, you might have a nose as good as Rollins'.\n\nYou see, CGI has bungled another government project before \u2014 a little thing called HealthCare.gov, the online home of Obamacare. Even the president had to admit that the website's rollout was a failure.\n\nThe irony here is so thick we might have to wait until spring for it to thaw.\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley has been no fan or friend of Obamacare.\n\nTwo years ago, the governor refused to expand Medicaid in Alabama, turning away as much as $3 billion of federal money. That funding could have provided as many as 300,000 working Alabamians caught in the healthcare gap \u2014 too rich for Medicaid, too poor for insurance \u2014 with coverage.\n\nBut Bentley refused, calling Medicaid a broken system that creates dependency on government by giving folks something for nothing. He said that Obamacare and its namesake couldn't be trusted.\n\nBut at the same time Bentley was bashing on Obama at the expense of so many Alabamians, his administration hired the same contractor that bungled Healthcare.gov to upgrade the state's accounting software.\n\nNow the state has a whole other broken system.\n\nAnd after the state handed out that no-bid contract, Bentley's campaign got a little something from CGI's PAC.\n\nAccording to campaign finance reports, CGI Technologies and Solutions Inc. PAC gave the governor's campaign $2,500.\n\nThat's not crazy money by Montgomery standards, but what does a contractor from Virginia and a subsidiary of a Canadian conglomerate care about Alabama politics so much that it would write a check in the first place?\n\nAnd Bentley wasn't the only one to get a campaign contribution. Other beneficiaries included Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey, State Senate Pro Tem Del Marsh, Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, Sen. Arthur Orr, Sen. Jimmy Holley, Sen. Phil Williams, Rep. Craig Ford, Rep. Napoleon Bracy and Rep. Alan Boothe.\n\nThey don't have a problem with a flawed, broken system. Not so long as the money coming back to Alabama goes into their campaign accounts.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Robert J.
