This week, photos emerged of the actress in a bra and jeans combo and reactions from her fans varied, with some expressing thoughts that she\u2019s too thin. Earlier in her career, she was told she was too big, so it seems as though she can\u2019t catch a break!\n\nIt\u2019s true that Jennifer looks even slimmer than usual, but it\u2019s because she had to lose weight for a new movie titled \u201cThe Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete\u201d, where she plays a heroin addict named Gloria. In October she told Huffington Post:\n\n\u201cThey did request that I lose about 10 pounds for [the movie.] I don\u2019t know that I did. [Laughs] But for \u2018Winnie,\u2019 I did. But for this one, it was just like, \u201cOh, if you could lose a little more weight.\u201d But I did learn eventually that with heroin addicts, in doing our research, that it\u2019s not necessarily like a physical thing where you\u2019re too thin or too heavy. [Director George Tillman Jr.] had this thing where Gloria was so into her drugs that she sacrificed the food, like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat, I just want to get high.\u201d\n\nHudson isn\u2019t the only star to receive a negative response after weight loss. Rapper/actor 50 cent met the same fate while filming the movie \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d. Fans weren\u2019t at all happy with his drop in weight, and some even said his image had been Photoshopped.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen Jennifer Hudson drop major pounds as the spokesperson for Weight Watchers, and judging from a few\u00a0new photos, she\u2019s at her smallest size ever.\u00a0 This week,\u00a0photos\u00a0emerged of the actress in a bra and jeans combo and reactions from her fans varied, with some\u00a0expressing\u00a0thoughts that\u00a0she\u2019s too thin.
