She helps men and women with various forms of dementia create watercolor art.\n\n\u201cThrough the years, you can see the decline with their disease and how it\u2019s the same picture every year and now it\u2019s kind of deteriorated,\u201d Summers said.\n\nThe gallery is only a small part of the whole picture. The sketches, clothing and quilt art are just a few of the things on display.\n\nFor some, the art is personal, such as for the three daughters of Georgia Paskach who came to see the art show and their mother\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor,\u201d said Karen Queen, one of Paskach\u2019s daughters.\n\n\u201cIt feels like home. You feel her presence,\u201d said Cathy Pentagulio, another of Paskach\u2019s daughters.\n\nPaskach died five years ago, but her art still hangs at the assisted-living facility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she would be very happy, very pleased,\u201d the daughters said.\n\nFor the sisters, coming back is about supporting a community they love and for others. It is about getting to know the residents through their creativity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a testament to who they are and who they were,\u201d Summers said.\n\nThis is the facility\u2019s biggest event of the year and is in its eighth year. The hope is to continue the show again next year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 22:05:59 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "GinaLisa Tamayo", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Art shows are a chance to show off creativity and hard work, but there is one metro show that offers a lot more than that.", "title": "Assisted living facility puts on art show", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/assisted-living-facility-puts-on-art-show/38488324", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/38488552/highRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/v5e2gi/-/ketv-art-show-JPG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/assisted-living-facility-puts-on-art-show/38488324", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/38488324", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/38488324", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/38488324"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "description": "Art shows are a chance to show off creativity and hard work, but there is one metro show that offers a lot more than that.", "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/38488324", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/38488324", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "article": {"author": "ginalisa.tamayo?fref=ts"}, "keywords": "art show, assisted living facility, Hillcrest Mable Rose, Lisa Summers, Georgia Paskach, Karen Queen, Cathy Pentagulio,", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "art show, assisted living facility, Hillcrest Mable Rose, Lisa Summers, Georgia Paskach, Karen Queen, Cathy Pentagulio,"}, "article_summary": "At Hillcrest Mable Rose, an assisted living facility, music, photographs and paintings on the walls give visitors a glimpse into the lives of the people who live there.\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a work that culminates over 12 months,\u201d said Lisa Summers, administrator at Hillcrest Mable Rose.\nFor some, the art is personal, such as for the three daughters of Georgia Paskach who came to see the art show and their mother\u2019s work.\nYou feel her presence,\u201d said Cathy Pentagulio, another of Paskach\u2019s daughters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor,\u201d said Karen Queen, one of Paskach\u2019s daughters."}
