The political media consensus interpreted the scene as evidence of surging support for the senator from Vermont.\n\nIt did not occur to them that:\n\n\u2022The crowd almost certainly included many Hillary Clinton supporters just out to hear what Bernie had to say \u2014 not to mention some stray Republicans.\n\n\u2022The crowd included tourists who, on a pleasant spring evening, happened on an exciting event and hung around.\n\n\u2022Some attendees were Bernie backers who had neglected to register as Democrats in time for the Democratic primary.\n\n\u2022The numbers at Washington Square were dwarfed by the battalions of working-class New Yorkers juggling two children and three jobs. These mostly Clinton voters were unable to attend any rally.\n\nThis last group is the subject here. It is the silent liberal majority.\n\nRichard Nixon popularized the term \u201csilent majority\u201d in 1969. He was referring to the Middle Americans appalled by the Vietnam-era protests and associated social chaos. They didn\u2019t demonstrate, and the so-called media elite ignored them.\n\nToday\u2019s liberal version of the silent majority is heavy with minorities and older people. Its members tend to be more socially conservative than those on the hard left and believe President Obama is a good leader.\n\nObamacare has brought medical coverage to 90 percent of the population, with the greatest gains among Latinos. Thus, a politician who repeatedly complains that this is \u201cthe only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right\u201d sounds a bit off.\n\nMany political reporters belong to the white gentry that has fueled the Sanders phenomenon. Nothing wrong with that, as long as they know where they\u2019re coming from. But some don\u2019t seem to know about the vast galaxies of Democratic voters beyond the university and hipster ZIP codes.\n\nIn so many races \u2014 including those of the other party \u2014 reporters confine themselves to carefully staged political events and a few interviews with conveniently placed participants. From the atmospherics, they deduce the level of support for a particular candidate.\n\nIt can\u2019t be repeated often enough that a passionate vote counts no more than one cast with quiet consent or even resignation. Here are three examples of political analysts forgetting this:\n\nCommenting on the lively debate in Brooklyn, columnist Frank Bruni concluded that the Sanders camp is \u201cwhere the fiercest energy in the party resides right now.\u201d How did he know? \u201cIt was audible on Thursday night, in the boos from the audience that sometimes rained down on Clinton.\u201d\n\nSo, how many people were booing? Three? Four? Who were they? They possibly could have been Hillary people trying to summon sympathy for their candidate (which the booing undoubtedly did).\n\nThe day after the packed Sanders rally in Greenwich Village, CNN looped videos contrasting that massive turnout with the much smaller group listening to Clinton in the Bronx. That\u2019s as deep as this story went.\n\nEarly this month, New York magazine posted a piece titled \u201cIn the South Bronx, Bernie Sanders Gives Clinton Cause for Concern.\u201d The reporter\u2019s evidence was a sizable and \u201craucous\u201d Sanders rally headlined by a handful of black and Latino celebrities.\n\nWe await the magazine\u2019s follow-up analysis on how Clinton won 70 percent of the Bronx vote. Someone must have voted for her.\n\nThis is not to chide the Sanders campaign. Its job was to create an impression of mass support for its candidate \u2014 and job well-done. Rather, it\u2019s to remind the media that there\u2019s a huge electorate outside the focus of managed campaign events. And silent majorities, by their very nature, tend not to get noticed.\n\nFroma Harrop is a columnist for Creators Syndicate Inc.
