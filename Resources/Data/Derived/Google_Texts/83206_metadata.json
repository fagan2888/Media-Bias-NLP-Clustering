Others around the country will be watching to see if the money and the influence matters \u2026 It\u2019s going to be a very close election is my guess.'\u201d\n\nThe professor was mostly right, except about the margin of victory. It wasn\u2019t close. Voters \u201coverwhelmingly,\u201d according to the Denver Post, voted for the recall, with the charter school-backed board members going down by an average of 64 percent to 36 percent.\n\nA Jeffco classroom teacher involved in the resistance effort, Paula Reed, had this to say in an email to me about the importance of the recall win: \u201cThis was a major front in the battle to preserve public schools for kids and stop privatization for profit. I said to myself and everyone I pulled in that if we won, we would know for the rest of our lives that we had been part of something huge.\u201d\n\nWhy Grassroots Matters Most\n\n\u201cThe success of this recall has been a true testament to what grassroots can accomplish,\u201d Jeffco parent activist Jonna Levine tells me in an email. \u201cWe sent a strong message that community can win over big corporate machines like the Koch Brothers.\u201d\n\nLevine co-founded and leads, with Jeffco parent Shawna Fritzler, the grassroots group \u201cSupport Jeffco Kids.\u201d Organizing parents into these grassroots groups, including Jeffco United, that helped lead the petition effort proved to be a key to the successful campaign. Parents have an undeniable stake in anything related to public schools. And unlike teachers, they can\u2019t be intimidated by school administration or be fired.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kochs spent a fortune on a local school board race that was really a national proxy.
