In fact, most of us agree you are one of the best this country has ever had the pleasure of electing \u2013 not once, but twice. Your compassion, caring for the people has not gone unnoticed. Some of your crowning achievements: The Affordable Care Act, Cuba Diplomacy, Prison reform and most recently the Iran agreement. There is something else you can do, and that is to help with the unprecedented refugee crisis spilling into Europe. America is a large country and most of our population is concentrated in cities and suburbs. The rest of our country is wilderness or very small towns, many in need of development. As the economy continues to heal under your leadership, there are pockets of need that could benefit from an influx of refugees. As the new budget discussions with Congress are pending, you have already made it clear there should be more money made available to citizens. I wished America took a more active role in caring for the poor children and families fleeing war-torn sections of the Middle East and Europe. As our commander and chief I would hope you would consider sending a few ships to Europe to pick up several thousand refugees, and bring them back to America. There are millions of Americans who would open their hearts and hands to these unfortunate people. This is a humanitarian crisis that I think we cannot ignore. Let\u2019s show the rest of the world we not only care about our fellow humans in other parts of the world, but that we are strong and bright enough to do something about it, to actually help. \u2013 Preston Brady III, Mobile Tribune.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://mobiletribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mobiletribuneLOGO2-1.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "aocz6WAAYP8bK06F7GwODISReHmr4pqtETGSv836Iyo", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6df\"", "article_summary": "America Should Send Military Ships to Pick Up RefugeesDear President Obama,You are doing an outstanding job as president of America.\nAs our commander and chief I would hope you would consider sending a few ships to Europe to pick up several thousand refugees, and bring them back to America.\nAmerica is a large country and most of our population is concentrated in cities and suburbs.\nAs the economy continues to heal under your leadership, there are pockets of need that could benefit from an influx of refugees.\nThere is something else you can do, and that is to help with the unprecedented refugee crisis spilling into Europe."}
