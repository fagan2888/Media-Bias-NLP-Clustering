They claim there are several others in Lee, Collier, and Charlotte Counties researches say could make you sick.\n\n\n\n\"I've always known that there is bacteria in sea water, you just have to be careful with that,\" said beach goer Janelle Shivers.\n\n\n\nResearchers with the Natural Resources Defense Council have released the names of the beaches they say had more than normal levels of bacteria last year. There are seven beaches in Collier County, five in Lee County and 6 in Charlotte County raising concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey expect the bacteria levels to be up this year and they want to hear from the EPA now to force a clean up.\n\n\n\n\"They need to do that for our tourists,\" said McFall.\n\n\n\nUntil that happens, McFall says she will take extra safety measures to stay healthy. For example, Lee County health leaders recommend plugging your nose when you are in the water. Stay out of the water altogether if you have an open wound.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte County Health Department responded to say their latest reports as of July 21 show all beaches in their coverage area in good standing without problem water samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the list of beaches with water quality concerns from the Natural Resources Defense Council: You can check Charlotte County's results here Here is the list of beaches with water quality concerns from the Natural Resources Defense Council:\n\n\n\nCharlotte\n\n\n\nBoca Grande\n\n\n\nEnglewood Mid Beach\n\n\n\nEnglewood North\n\n\n\nPalm Island North\n\n\n\nPort Island North\n\n\n\nPort Charlotte Beach East\n\n\n\nPort Charlotte Beach West\n\n\n\nLee\n\n\n\nCape Coral Yacht Club\n\n\n\nLovers Key State Park\n\n\n\nLynn Hall Memorial Park\n\n\n\nSanibel Causeway Beach\n\n\n\nTurner Beach/ Blind Pass Beach\n\n\n\nCollier\n\n\n\nClam Pass\n\n\n\nDoctor\u2019s Pass\n\n\n\nLowdermilk Park\n\n\n\nNaples Pier\n\n\n\nSouth Marco Beach\n\n\n\nTigertail Beach\n\n\n\nVanderbilt Beach\n\n\n\nTo find out more about the Boca GrandeEnglewood Mid BeachEnglewood NorthPalm Island NorthPort Island NorthPort Charlotte Beach EastPort Charlotte Beach WestCape Coral Yacht ClubLovers Key State ParkLynn Hall Memorial ParkSanibel Causeway BeachTurner Beach/ Blind Pass BeachClam PassDoctor\u2019s PassLowdermilk ParkNaples PierSouth Marco BeachTigertail BeachVanderbilt BeachTo find out more about the study click here\n\nResearchers are concerned that more than a dozen Southwest Florida beaches are infested with bacteria.
