And so I think that having not negotiated a status of forces agreement...to have left some residual troops in Iraq, it did not allow that emerging government that stability and stability of security that it needed,\u201d says Miller-Meeks.\n\n\u201cIraq is not World War II. Iraq is not even North and South Korea, and if you\u2019re suggesting keeping 39,000 troops in Iraq as we did in Korea for all those years or hundreds of thousands of troops as we did in Europe, that makes absolutely no sense,\u201d countered Loebsack.\n\nThe two also sparred over domestic policy and the president's landmark piece of legislation -- the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- It\u2019s a race we've seen twice already, but this time Republican Marianette Miller-Meeks believes she\u2019ll finally unseat Congressman Dave Loebsack.
