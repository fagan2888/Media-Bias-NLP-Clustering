Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry co-founder, Jacqueline Keeler, was on MSNBC's All in With Chris Hayes to talk about the growing movement against Native mascots and names.

She told the show’s host, why all mascots have to go.

“We are stereotyped, we are marginalized, and our issues become obscure,” said Keller, who has worked in Native communities for 20 years. “Obscured by mascots. Everyone knows the mascots, they know the stereotypes, but they don’t know anything about us.”
