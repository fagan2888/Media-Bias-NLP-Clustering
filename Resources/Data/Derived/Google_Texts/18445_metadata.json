Nobody knew about them,\u201d said Zadnik, director of land stewardship for the conservancy, which obtained a $140,000 grant from shale well impact fee money to plug the first two wells and is considering what to do about others.\n\nOfficials estimate as many as 200,000 abandoned gas and oil wells dating to the 1860s dot the state\u2019s landscape, many uncataloged with no surviving record of ownership.\n\nMost are conventional vertical wells drilled before unconventional drilling took off in the shale play during the past decade, and before regulations required better reporting.\n\nAbandoned and unmapped wells pose dangers to people living or working nearby, especially shale drillers. Crews fracking wells have come into contact - or \u201ccommunicated,\u201d in engineering parlance - with abandoned wells, causing liquids and gas to shoot from the surface.\n\nNumerous efforts among federal, state, university and industry groups are under way to locate, map, assess and plug the wells. The challenge of finding them - combined with the high cost of plugging them - threatens to slow the push.\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection is responsible for tracking and plugging the wells with money raised through surcharges on drillers. Regulators hope more groups will tap the pool of money for plugging projects, and that rules aimed at protecting land and water around shale wells will encourage this generation of drillers to more quickly fix legacy problems of the industry\u2019s past.\n\nThe shale industry says it will continue to notify DEP about old wells it encounters, but it balks at paying more for fixes.\n\n\u201cIs it fair to require an operator in the unconventional industry to pay for that abandonment of a conventional well drilled by someone 50 or 60 years ago? I think not,\u201d said David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition. \u201cYou have funds that are there. This industry has invested those dollars for that purpose, and they should be used that way.\u201d\n\nFunds at the ready\n\nOne of the streams of money comes from surcharges on drilling permits and supports the DEP\u2019s Abandoned and Orphan Well program. Overseen by environmental program manager Seth Pelepko, DEP staff seek to find responsible parties for old, non-producing wells by researching property records or looking into ownership or operation of nearby equipment.\n\n\u201cIf there is a responsible party, we don\u2019t want to add a well to the orphan and abandoned list,\u201d Pelepko said.\n\nThat list - which includes GPS coordinates and other identifying information for wells whose ownership could not be determined - stands at 12,293 wells, about 3,000 of which have been plugged.\n\nWhen the drilling industry was most active, permit surcharges flowed, allowing hundreds of plugging operations a year, Pelepko said. Thirty-three were plugged last year, though, as drilling slowed.\n\nDepending on the depth of an oil or gas well and other factors, plugging it safely costs $5,000 to $200,000, DEP said. A well that poses an immediate risk to nearby structures or people will be plugged quickly, Pelepko said. Otherwise, the wells are ranked and addressed in order of need.\n\nWhen the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy called DEP to add the Toms Run wells to the list, it was told plugging would likely take 10 years, Zadnik said. DEP encouraged the conservancy to hire a contractor with money from a legacy fund supported by impact fees.\n\nEach year, millions of dollars collected in per-well fees go to the fund, which is managed by the Department of Community and Economic Development. The department\u2019s Commonwealth Financing Authority approves grants from the fund for environmental projects related to trails, watershed restoration, mine drainage cleaning, flood mitigation and abandoned well plugging.\n\nIn three years, only five groups have applied for well plugging funding, including the conservancy. Three were approved - for projects totaling $365,000 - and two requests are pending. The DCED started accepting new applications for funding this month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us at the agency to make more people aware of this,\u201d Pelepko acknowledged.\n\nIncomplete database\n\nFederal money has gone to locating and assessing emissions from abandoned wells.\n\nIn 2012, the South Park-based National Energy Technology Lab flew a helicopter equipped with a sensor over a portion of Washington County to locate old wells by detecting their magnetic signatures. Two years later, NETL signed a data-sharing agreement with DEP and flew three more surveys over Oil Creek State Park in Venango County, Hillman State Park in Washington County and Susquehannock State Forest in Potter County.\n\nResearchers went into those areas to find wells, determine whether they were in DEP databases, and measure any emissions they were leaking. State records showed Hillman had 34 old wells. Sensors picked up 165 possible targets; of the 80 hits that researchers investigated on the ground, 51 were found to be wells.\n\n\u201cThe database for wells before the 1950s is certainly incomplete,\u201d said Richard Hammack, a research physical scientist at NETL, noting the difference between the state records and what they found. \u201cAnd the locations of wells that are in the database are inaccurate.\u201d\n\nFlying helicopters is too expensive, though Hammack said he hopes drillers will eventually use cheaper drones to survey the land. In the meantime, NETL plans to share its data with Pelepko\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cFor smaller areas . we hope to have a more complete catalog of the wells that exist,\u201d Hammack said\n\nAt Penn State University, federal money has helped fund a more low-tech approach to finding wells. Nooreen Meghani, a research assistant in the school\u2019s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, is using part of a $2.5 million multiyear National Science Foundation grant to train volunteers to find wells and record their locations with GPS units.\n\nVolunteers have found 20 uncataloged wells and hope to find more during a push this summer, though money from the grant is running out. Meghani is working on a smartphone app that would help people locate and log wells they discover in the woods.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of training needed on how to research the wells, where to find maps or photos,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Venango Senior Environmental Corps tells its volunteers to watch for \u201cwhat looks different. That seems to be the key in finding the abandoned wells,\u201d said John Kolojejchick of Oil City, chairman of the group that\u2019s been hunting for wells around Oil Creek since 2003.\n\nThe Venango group reports its findings to DEP and has worked with Penn State. But when NETL reviewed its data, it found problems with location accuracy, Hammock said.\n\n\u201cAll of the groups are kind of doing their own version of solving the problem,\u201d Kolojejchick said. \u201cIt could probably use better coordination between the groups . so the time and effort is better spent. But I guess that takes money.\u201d\n\nPolicy change\n\nDEP hopes a new environmental rule for drillers will prompt the industry to find and plug more abandoned wells.\n\nRegulations expected to take effect this year include requirements that drillers survey an area of up to 1,000 feet around a proposed site for any old wells. Coming into contact with an abandoned well while fracking can create a hazard at the surface.\n\nDrillers must report any wells they find in their area of review to DEP and avoid what regulators call \u201ccommunication\u201d between old wells and new ones, Pelepko said.\n\n\u201cIn certain cases, we will undoubtably see some companies decide to plug a well,\u201d he said, calling more locational information and plugging a \u201cbeneficial outcome\u201d of the regulation.\n\nThe Marcellus Shale Coalition\u2019s Spigelmyer says the impact fee money controlled by the state should be used for plugging in such cases. The pace and process of awarding grants from that pool of money makes that scenario unlikely, though.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the money is set aside,\u201d Spigelmyer said.\n\nSidebar\n\nThe methane question\n\nLess known is the risk abandoned wells pose to air and water from escaping methane. The EPA does not include the wells in its annual inventory of emissions sources.\n\nAs the state and federal government look to limit methane emissions as a greenhouse gas, researchers are trying to determine how much abandoned wells contribute.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly justification for collecting more data, not just in Pennsylvania but in other states as well,\u201d said Natalie Pekney, a research engineer at the South Park-based National Energy Technology Lab.\n\nThe lab is measuring emissions from abandoned wells it located using a helicopter in Hillman State Park in Washington County to get an idea of how large of a source they are. A 2014 study led by Princeton University researcher Mary Kang found the wells could be a significant source.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the data analysis done, but I\u2019d say our measurements were in the same ballpark as what Kang\u2019s paper reported,\u201d Pekney said.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Protection, which has a data-sharing partnership with Pekney\u2019s lab, wants to study the wells\u2019 emissions and is working with Kang, according to Seth Pelepko, who oversees the department\u2019s Abandoned and Orphan Well program. The state is writing rules to limit methane leaks from shale gas wells and related equipment, though older, conventional wells will not be covered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important to determine the scope of an issue. That\u2019s the process we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Pelepko said.\n\n- David Conti\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/21pyFEq\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://pghtrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Zadnik probably walked through the same patch of woods in Toms Run Nature Reserve a dozen times while inspecting an abandoned oil well without realizing the remnants of another uncapped well were sticking out of the ground nearby.", "Author": "DAVID CONTI", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/19/abandoned-pennsylvania-gas-oil-wells-sought/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Andrew Zadnik probably walked through the same patch of woods in Toms Run Nature Reserve a dozen times while inspecting an abandoned oil well without realizing the remnants of another uncapped well were sticking out of the ground nearby.", "title": "Abandoned Pennsylvania gas, oil wells sought"}, "twitter": {"title": "Abandoned Pennsylvania gas, oil wells sought", "description": "Andrew Zadnik probably walked through the same patch of woods in Toms Run Nature Reserve a dozen times while inspecting an abandoned oil well without realizing the remnants of another uncapped well we", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Crews fracking wells have come into contact - or \u201ccommunicated,\u201d in engineering parlance - with abandoned wells, causing liquids and gas to shoot from the surface.\nThat seems to be the key in finding the abandoned wells,\u201d said John Kolojejchick of Oil City, chairman of the group that\u2019s been hunting for wells around Oil Creek since 2003.\nSidebarThe methane questionLess known is the risk abandoned wells pose to air and water from escaping methane.\nAs the state and federal government look to limit methane emissions as a greenhouse gas, researchers are trying to determine how much abandoned wells contribute.\nThe state is writing rules to limit methane leaks from shale gas wells and related equipment, though older, conventional wells will not be covered."}
