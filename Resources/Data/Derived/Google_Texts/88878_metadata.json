Jeff Denham has become the first House Republican to sponsor Democratic leaders\u2019 immigration bill in a move Hispanic activists said shows a fracturing of Republican opposition and momentum toward passing a bill this year that would legalize most illegal immigrants.\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday on Univision\u2019s \u201cAl Punto\u201d program, the Spanish-language network\u2019s weekly political talk show, Mr. Denham said he is trying to strike a bipartisan chord and put pressure on Republican leaders to take up a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration plan.\n\nMr. Denham, a California Republican whose district is 41 percent Hispanic, said he expects his party leaders to make good on their promise to have a debate this year.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to more and more Republicans that don\u2019t look at this as a Republican or Democrat issue, they want to just focus on a solution,\u201d Mr. Denham said. \u201cThis is a good solution. This is a bipartisan solution. And the challenges that we had in the Senate bill with the border security, we\u2019ve now fixed in the House, so I\u2019m going to continue to encourage more and more Republicans to come on board.\u201d\n\nHis party leaders, though, seem inclined to have a more modest debate.\n\nSpeaking last week, both House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said they want to try to pass some legislation before the end of this year, but they rejected taking up a broad bill such as the 1,137-page measure Mr. Denham has now signed up for. The Republican leaders said that would be like passing another version of Obamacare, which they said is the portrait of a government failure.\n\nOn Friday, they earned the backing of Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was one of the key authors of the Senate\u2019s own 1,200-page bill, but who now rejects that broad approach and urged Republican leaders to stick with their plan to tackle immigration piece by piece.\n\n\u201cWe have to address that issue in a realistic way,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d program. \u201cI think it gets easier to address that issue if we deal with some of the other issues first. I think if people have real confidence that the law is being enforced, that we are not going to have this problem again, that there is real border security \u2014 I think you buy yourself more space and flexibility in finally dealing with those who are here illegally.\u201d\n\nMr. Denham\u2019s decision to support the Democratic leaders\u2019 bill is not likely to give the measure any legislative heft in the House, but immigrant-rights advocates said it is an important moment politically.\n\n\u201cJeff Denham\u2019s announcement is a major crack in the dam that has been blocking reform from passing the House and become law,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an advocacy group.\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 bill uses the Senate bill, which passed that chamber on a bipartisan 68-32 vote in June, as its basis. It includes the same legalization provisions and interior enforcement rules.\n\nBut the bill, which was written by Democratic leaders and sponsored by Rep. Joe Garcia of Florida, rejects the 20,000 new Border Patrol agents and 350 miles of new fencing that were added into the Senate bill in order to win over some of that chamber\u2019s Republicans.\n\nInstead, the Democratic bill pushes the Department of Homeland Security to take the steps it deems necessary to secure the border.\n\nThat change was critical. Many House Democrats said the Senate bill was too strict in its demand for border security, so leaders watered down those provisions in order to increase Democratic unity.\n\nAs of Friday, 185 Democrats were sponsors of the bill. But no Republicans had been willing to join the bill, until Mr. Denham\u2019s announcement.\n\nSome immigrant-rights groups have panned the Democratic bill as an unrealistic wish-list that has little chance of passage, and they have called on President Obama to get directly involved with House Republicans in trying to negotiate a final deal.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Denham bristled at the suggestion by Mr. Obama, repeated by Univision host Jorge Ramos, that House Republicans are the chief roadblock to legalizing illegal immigrants through a broad bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true,\u201d Mr. Denham said. \u201cYou know, we need the president to show real leadership on this issue, as well as other issues that have really held up our schedule.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
