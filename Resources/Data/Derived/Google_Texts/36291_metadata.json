The conservative talk radio host and editor of RedState.com apparently disagreed so strongly with the New York Times\u2019 front-page gun safety editorial Saturday that he opened fire on a copy of the newspaper and posted the evidence on social media.\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, when the Huffington Post said Erickson \u201copened fire\u201d on the editorial, it\u2019s not a metaphorical expression or a euphemism for fierce criticism. The Republican pundit read the piece and felt compelled to shoot bullets \u2013 seven , to be precise \u2013 at the editorial as a way of registering his disapproval.\n\nAs a political blogger myself, I can relate to the feeling of reading an argument I disagree with, and wanting to poke holes in it. But I\u2019ll confess, it never occurred to me the phrase \u201cpoke holes in an argument\u201d should be taken literally.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a broader point to consider. There\u2019s something unsettling about the state of our discourse when high-profile media figures and candidates for public office effectively declare, \u201cI find myself confronted with ideas I disagree with. Where\u2019s my gun?\u201d\n\nLiterally shooting at inanimate objects as a form of political protest has become surprisingly common in recent years. Perhaps the most memorable example came in 2010, when Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) aired a television commercial showing him literally firing a rifle at a cap-and-trade bill.\n\nBut he\u2019s hardly alone. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) ran a commercial in which he shot a television. Matt Rosendale (R), an unsuccessful congressional candidate in Montana, had an ad in which he shot a drone . In 2014, Will Brooke, an unsuccessful congressional candidate in Alabama, had a commercial in which he shot the Affordable Care Act \u2013 with several different guns. Ron Gould, a Republican candidate in Arizona, did the same thing two years earlier.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "There's something unsettling when conservatives declare, \"I find myself confronted with ideas I disagree with.
