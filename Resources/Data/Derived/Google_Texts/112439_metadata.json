Aside from the red nose, I noticed my eyelids were swollen\u2014I call those Tippy the Turtle eyes. It occurred to me between bouts of self-pity that those eyelids might actually be a thing that will be permanent in my future. Today I\u2019m 47, I say that with pride because on Saturday I\u2019m going to turn 48. I started googling eyelid lifts and realized that, unless they started doing Kickstarters for vanity surgery, I was shit out of luck. I tucked it in the back of my mind where it stayed until yesterday when all of my social-media feeds were erupting in a frenzy over Renee Zellweger\u2019s new face. (I had not realized this until yesterday, but apparently she\u2019s been out of the public eye for four years.) And yes, I looked and I was bummed because I truly hate plastic surgery\u2014my mom\u2019s two older sisters had face lifts and eye lifts and I always thought (and think) that my mother is so much more beautiful and soft looking. But my mom lives in the woods, and squirrels don\u2019t judge. And I am a writer who goes from sweaty gym clothes to jeans and a hoody that has my kid\u2019s middle-school name emblazoned on the front, and rats don\u2019t judge.\n\nI know I used to mock celebrities who had excessive plastic surgery (okay, I still do but never publicly! And never on a Sunday!), but in the past couple of years I\u2019ve had my turtle eyes opened. When Kim Novak was mocked at the Oscars and admitted how hurt she was, that she\u2019d been terrified about appearing in public for the first time in years (she is FUCKING 81 YEARS OLD) and she just wanted to look her best, I felt heartbroken. I think after reading about her response, everyone got a grip and felt pretty bad.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cShe Could Have Been Diane Sawyer\u201d\n\nThen last week, Frances McDormand came out against plastic surgery in the New York Times. \u201cSomething happened culturally: No one is supposed to age past 45\u2014sartorially, cosmetically, attitudinally,\u201d said McDormand, who has been married to director Joel Coen for 30 years, \u201cEverybody dresses like a teenager. Everybody dyes their hair. Everybody is concerned about a smooth face.\u201d And I loved her for saying it, but let\u2019s face it, Frances McDormand and Renee Zellweger are two totally different people with two totally different kinds of careers. Frances was never the girl in Jerry Maguire. Renee was not Marge in Fargo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I used to mock celebrities who had excessive plastic surgery.
