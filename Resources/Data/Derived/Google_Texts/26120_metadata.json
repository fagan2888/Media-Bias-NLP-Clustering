The American Cancer Society\u2019s position swims in the mainstream of thought:\n\n\u201cAlthough available research has not supported claims that spirituality or prayer can cure cancer or any other disease, spiritual well-being is linked to better quality of life in people with cancer.\u201d\n\nTo doctors who have worked to keep Trujillo alive, there is no question that her faith has given her a quality of life not often seen in patients with Stage 4 cancer.\n\n\u201cShe is very spiritually strong,\u201d says Dr. Farzaneh Farzin, the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Nevada radiation oncologist who worked to kill Trujillo\u2019s cancer with radiation.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very realistic, not in denial, understands the depths of her disease. But she has a strong willpower to do whatever it takes to move on, to focus on how she can make things as good as possible for her and her family.\u201d\n\nTrujillo has needed all the strength she has been able to muster since July 2012. It was then, while exercising at home, that she discovered that she had two lumps in her right breast, each the size of a quarter.\n\nLaid off from a job without health benefits \u2014 husband Jorge Guevara\u2019s construction job also didn\u2019t offer them \u2014 Trujillo didn\u2019t have insurance coverage or money to pay for care.\n\nBecause her children received medical coverage under Medicaid, she tried to get covered under the government health program.\n\n\u201cI told the people at Medicaid about the lumps, and they told me the only way I could get coverage is if I was pregnant,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNo one told me then I could possibly get help from Clark County Social Services, like I have recently, or that I should call breast cancer organizations to refer me to help. I really wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I had never thought about breast cancer before, because I was so young. I never heard of a 28-year-old with breast cancer.\u201d\n\n(Clark County Social Services provides medical care to indigent and medically needy individuals who are not eligible for other public or private resources. Eligibility is based on an assessment of need.)\n\nTrujillo prayed about her predicament. She decided that the only way she could get treatment for the lumps in her breast, which seemed to be growing larger every day, was to find a job with medical insurance coverage.\n\nWeeks after she started her job search, she found one with a government housing program aimed at helping Nevada homeowners dealing with foreclosure.\n\nIn October, her medical insurance kicked in and she went to a place she found on the Internet, The Breast Care Center at Summerlin Hospital.\n\nNearly three months after Trujillo discovered the lumps in her breast \u2014 she says one had grown to the size of an orange \u2014 a biopsy performed by Dr. Souzan El-Eid at the Breast Care Center confirmed her fears.\n\nIt turned out she had breast cancer caused by a gene mutation that El-Eid says is \u201cassociated with bad cancers,\u201d one that is aggressive in young people.\n\nTrujillo, more scared than she had ever been in her life, raced home after the diagnosis and turned to the Bible that had always given her comfort. She said something immediately directed her straight to an unfamiliar verse in Philippians.\n\n\u201cI have the strength to face all conditions by the power that Christ gives me.\u201d\n\nShe got down on her knees, recited it in English and in Spanish, and she says she felt a strength and peace and faith enter her body that she had never known before.\n\nTrujillo says she knew right then that she not only would be able to endure months of treatment that would include chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy, she would do so without making her kids live in constant fear of losing her to cancer.\n\nEl-Eid, who performed Trujillo\u2019s double mastectomy, says she has never seen a young woman in her condition with her attitude.\n\n\u201cThe worst part of my job is delivering the bad news to patients,\u201d the surgeon said. \u201c\u201dWhen I told her the cancer was in her bones, her attitude was, \u2018It is what it is.\u2019 Some patients go through denial; some get depressed. Her attitude was, \u2018Now what can we do?\u2019 With her faith, whatever life throws at her, she just keeps going.\u201d\n\nEven with her faith, it hasn\u2019t been easy to keep going.\n\nJust before she began chemotherapy in November 2012, her husband, who she says has been a major help with the children and housecleaning, hit black ice as he drove the family to his wife\u2019s native Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe spun off the road and a truck almost hit us,\u201d Trujillo says. \u201cIt was a miracle we didn\u2019t get hurt, and it took us a couple of days to get there; but we got to my dad\u2019s, and he had his whole church pray for me. I think that helped me.\u201d\n\nBecause her radiation treatment burned her armpit to the point that she had difficulty moving her right arm, Trujillo wondered if she would be able to drive her stick-shift car without having an accident.\n\n\u201cI solved that,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cI taught Evelyn and Raquel both how to move the stick while I used the clutch. We didn\u2019t have any problems at all.\u201d\n\nShe did have problems with the strong chemotherapy regimen prescribed by Dr. Fadi Braiteh.\n\nOff and on, Trujillo suffered high fevers, diarrhea, vomiting and shingles.\n\nTo make matters even more challenging, Evelyn had to be rushed to Sunrise Hospital on Christmas Eve for an emergency appendectomy.\n\nTrujillo, although hurting, stayed with her daughter for several days in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what mothers do,\u201d she says.\n\nMIRACLES HAPPEN\n\nIt is a late Friday afternoon as Trujillo, her husband and their children spruce up the house for the weekly Bible study in their small living room.\n\nShe will cry tears of joy as friends, family and members of her church, Aguilas Family Christian Center, pray that her cancer stays in check.\n\n\u201cI felt the power,\u201d she says.\n\nDays later, she wants to talk about how she got her oncologist, Dr. Fadi Braiteh, to laugh.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very nice man, but I\u2019d like to see him laugh more,\u201d she says.\n\nShe remembers how she showed up for a bout of chemo wearing a black wig that looked just like her natural hair. \u201cYou told me I\u2019d lose my hair and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she told the doctor with a straight face.\n\nBraiteh admits being stunned. No one had ever taken the level of chemo he prescribed for her without losing his or her hair.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Trujillo remembers the doctor saying. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d\n\nThen Trujillo tore off the wig. She and the good doctor laughed. Hard.\n\n\u201cShe really got me that time,\u201d said Braiteh, who doesn\u2019t discount that Trujillo\u2019s amazing faith and desire for normalcy during a time of medical crisis could bring miracles.\n\n\u201cI have seen miracles. It doesn\u2019t happen every day, but I don\u2019t dismiss them,\u201d he says. \u201cScience can\u2019t understand everything.\u201d\n\nBraiteh doesn\u2019t pretend to know what Trujillo\u2019s future holds:\n\n\u201cRight now we are managing her cancer and she is only taking one drug to control her hormones. \u2026 It\u2019s almost in remission. Her cancer is now restricted to bone only. In her case, we are hoping for prolonged control of the disease, but I keep telling her that it might come back. \u2026 She had cancer cells that went out of control like a car going downhill without brakes.\n\n\u201cAnd I tell her what she already seems to know \u2014 to live as though you\u2019re dying tomorrow and to plan for tomorrow as if you\u2019re living forever.\u201d\n\nReporter Paul
