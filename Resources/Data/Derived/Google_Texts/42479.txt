Wallethub, a personal finance resource online, and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) recently teamed up to provide estimates about the proportion of private health plan enrollees who previously lacked health insurance and have enrolled in a plan through an insurance exchange.

According to the study, KFF finds that 57 percent of private plan enrollees were previously uninsured, based on their nationally representative survey of adults who purchase their own insurance. “Combining this new data point with information on the number of new Medicaid recipients and private plan enrollees under Obamacare, WalletHub analysts are now able to offer an initial projection of uninsured rates post-Obamacare for 43 states and the District of Columbia,” says the report, which you can find here.
