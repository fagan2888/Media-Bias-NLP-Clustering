The Quinnipiac University survey did, indeed, place President Obama at the top of the worst since FDR. But this was largely a measure of partisan concentration. Republicans were united in their unfavorable historical judgment of Obama. Democrats divided their votes (and would insist, I\u2019d imagine, that they have more options to choose from).\n\nWe already know that Obama is a highly polarizing figure. But beneath the headline, the poll identified serious problems for the president. Fifty-four percent of respondents said the Obama administration is \u201cnot competent running the government.\u201d (Shout-out to HealthCare.gov.) A majority believes the president does not have \u201cstrong leadership qualities.\u201d Obama is solidifying a perception that he is out of his depth. Once made, such an impression is difficult to unmake.\n\nAnd the failings of the Obama era are contributing to a deeper crisis for liberalism. Public confidence that government generally does the right thing is near an all-time low. In a recent Gallup poll, 79 percent of Americans agreed that corruption is \u201cwidespread throughout the government\u201d \u2014 up from 59 percent in 2006. During a presidency that placed considerable trust in government, public trust in government has been badly shaken.\n\nObama is left with a job approval rating \u2014 in the low to mid-40s \u2014 that is about the same as when his party lost 63 House seats during the 2010 midterm elections. On the stump, his strategy is a ferocious peevishness. Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t do anything except block me and call me names\u201d \u2014 an accusation in the best rhetorical tradition of school yards everywhere. His promised use of executive power seems more like a confession of powerlessness in the normal political realms of persuasion and legislation.\n\nOn his executive orders, Obama challenges the House speaker: \u201cSo sue me.\u201d As a former speechwriter, I\u2019d advise greater care in the choice of catchphrases. When Ronald Reagan goaded Congress on tax increases with \u201cGo ahead, make my day,\u201d he was channeling Clint Eastwood. \u201cSo sue me\u201d sounds like the guy who steals your parking space and taunts you afterward. Petulance does not signal strength.\n\nUS President Barack Obama speaks ahead of a lunch with a group of teachers on July 7, 2014 in the Blue Room of the White House in Washington.

The IRS and Veterans Affairs scandals continue to unfold. Foreign policy hardly offers a refuge \u2014 as years of disengagement in the Middle East now require engagement on dramatically less favorable terms.\n\nObama therefore turns to the two issues that Democrats keep in their back pocket, confident that broad social currents are running in their favor: immigration and contraception. (I suppose many Americans, not just Democrats, keep contraception in their back pocket.) In the long run, the political analysis that informs this strategy is correct. The U.S. electorate is becoming more demographically diverse and more culturally liberal on some issues. When it comes to Hispanic voters, younger voters and single voters, Republicans can seem out of touch (because they mostly are).\n\nSo the midterm contest sets up: \u201cOut of his depth\u201d vs. \u201cOut of touch.\u201d\n\nBut both of Obama\u2019s surefire issues offer complications. The appearance of chaos at the border \u2014 fueled, in part, by rumors of an immigration free pass \u2014 may lead the Obama administration to seek procedural reforms that expedite the deportation of children. The only successful immigration legislation this session may be a border-control measure \u2014 signed by a president whose administration has already deported more than 2 million immigrants.\n\nAnd the \u201cwar on women\u201d conducted by the Supreme Court turns out to be a narrow exception to a 2011 Health and Human Services regulation \u2014 an exception allowing a family-owned company to provide 16 types of contraception to its employees instead of 20. The court ordered the Obama administration, when it substantially burdens a religious belief, to pursue the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of achieving its goal \u2014 which has been the law since Bill Clinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that the president\u2019s use of cultural wedge issues will have much effect in battleground Senate races, conducted (this time around) mainly in red states. But even if it does \u2014 even if a deep blue appeal moves voters substantially \u2014 a historical reputation will be set.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pit red America against blue America,\u201d Obama once said. Now he organizes the sorting of America between red and blue. Best president or worst, he has left a nation more divided.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Gerson, michael gerson column, michael gerson washington post, obama approval rating, obama worst president, obama gallup, obama quinnipiac survey, obama leadership, obama public, obama job rating,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president has little to offer than school-yard taunts.", "title": "The divided states of Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-the-divided-states-of-obama/2014/07/07/9780a2a2-0602-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/07/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Was8807347.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mjgerson"}, "description": "The president has little to offer than school-yard taunts.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-the-divided-states-of-obama/2014/07/07/9780a2a2-0602-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michael Gerson, michael gerson column, michael gerson washington post, obama approval rating, obama worst president, obama gallup, obama quinnipiac survey, obama leadership, obama public, obama job rating,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "9780a2a2-0602-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ef5\"", "article_summary": "The headline \u2014 \u201cPoll: Obama worst president since World War II\u201d \u2014 was both provocative and misleading.\nFifty-four percent of respondents said the Obama administration is \u201cnot competent running the government.\u201d (Shout-out to HealthCare.gov.)\nWhen it comes to Hispanic voters, younger voters and single voters, Republicans can seem out of touch (because they mostly are).\nThe Quinnipiac University survey did, indeed, place President Obama at the top of the worst since FDR.\nA majority believes the president does not have \u201cstrong leadership qualities.\u201d Obama is solidifying a perception that he is out of his depth."}
