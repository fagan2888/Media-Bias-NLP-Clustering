Another digital health company is finding some market traction and some new funding in the home monitoring business.

Healthsense makes a remote monitoring system for people with chronic diseases. The systems are sold to healthcare providers who need to keep track of the health of these patients and intervene if they detect that something’s going wrong. If they can detect it early, the thinking goes, they can keep the patient healthy and avoid expensive hospital re-admissions.

The remote system consists of a series of sensors to ensure medication is taken and that elderly patients don’t wander. The sensors report back to a software system to establish a normal routine for each patient.

Healthsense has raised a $10 million funding round led by Mansa Capital. Previous investors Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, and Radius Ventures also threw in.

Healthsense says it will use the new funds to sell into more managed care and home health companies. Humana Cares/Senior Bridge and Fallon Health are already piloting the system, Healthsense says.

Home monitoring has began a key focus area for digital health and devices companies. With the Affordable Care Act, healthcare providers will increasingly be reimbursed based on how well they can keep patients, and how well they can keep them from utilizing health services.

Salesforce.com and Philips, for one, are launching a major initiative to put monitoring devices in homes to keep caregivers better informed about their general health. Proteus Health, for another, makes a remote monitoring system to make sure that elderly people are taking their medications correctly.
