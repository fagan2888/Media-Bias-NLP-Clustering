America is a free market capitalistic society. It's what built this country and it's what will continue to move it forward. We're living in the age of the entrepreneur, and that means anyone can go out there, bring massive value to the marketplace and achieve the American dream.\n\nThe Harvard study says millennials' skeptical attitude is in part due to the fact that the younger generation doesn't trust the government and doesn't feel the government is working enough for them. When has government ever been the source of our success? It's ridiculous and delusional. It's easy to want to play the blame game, but where does self-responsibility come into the picture? Stop living in a perpetual waiting game for outside forces to save you.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A Harvard study shows that millennials think the American Dream doesn't exist anymore.
