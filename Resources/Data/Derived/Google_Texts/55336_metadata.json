Lois Wolk, (D-Davis), and Bill Monning, (D-Monterey), and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, (D-Stockton) in a joint statement. \u201cFor dying Californians, like Jennifer Glass, who was scheduled to testify today, this issue is urgent. We remain committed to passing the End of Life Option Act for all Californians who want and need the option of medical aid in dying.\u201d\n\nUnder the bill, mentally competent adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live could request lethal medication from a physician.\n\nIn an interview, Monning stressed that the bill is \u201cnot dead\u201d and that it has two years \u2014 not one \u2014 for passage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to review our options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe invested a lot of energy in the Senate side, and we walk away from the decision today knowing that we\u2019re going to have to spend more time cultivating our colleagues in the Assembly.\u201d\n\nA poll last month found that 69 percent of Californians \u2014 and 70 percent of Latinos \u2014 supported the bill. The poll was conducted by the advocacy group Compassion and Choices. \u201cThe bill is still alive and well,\u201d Patricia Gonzalez-Portillo, a spokeswoman for the organization, said in an interview. She also said her organization would continue working with Assembly members to advocate for the bill.\n\nThe bill had received a boost after the California Medical Association changed its stance from opposed to neutral.\n\nThe bill is modeled after a 1994 Oregon law which permits aid-in-dying. Four other states \u2014 Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico \u2014 have authorized it as well.\n\nThe issue was brought home to Californians after 29-year-old resident Brittany Maynard moved to Oregon so she could get a lethal prescription under that state\u2019s death with dignity law. She was terminally ill with brain cancer and died last November. A video she recorded 19 days before she took life-ending drugs was shown at a Senate hearing in March.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill would have allowed terminally-ill adults with 6 months to live to request prescription of lethal medication from a doctor.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California's Physician-Assisted Suicide Bill Shelved for the Year\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/07\\/07\\/californias-physician-assisted-suicide-bill-shelved-for-the-year\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-07 12:42:32\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-08 11:19:08\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":45139,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Aid in Dying\",\"Physician-assisted Suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/RS5102_56531571-e1436298045887.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Bill would have allowed terminally-ill adults with 6 months to live to request prescription of lethal medication from a doctor.", "title": "California\u2019s Physician-Assisted Suicide Bill Shelved for the Year", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/07/07/californias-physician-assisted-suicide-bill-shelved-for-the-year/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/RS5102_56531571-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aid in dying,physician-assisted suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2d8\"", "article_summary": "She was terminally ill with brain cancer and died last November.\nRecognizing they lacked votes in a key Assembly committee, authors of legislation that would have allowed terminally ill Californians to legally end their lives pulled the bill Tuesday morning.\n\u201cWe continue to work with Assembly Members to ensure they are comfortable with the bill,\u201d said Sens.\nIn an interview, Monning stressed that the bill is \u201cnot dead\u201d and that it has two years \u2014 not one \u2014 for passage.\n\u201cThe bill is still alive and well,\u201d Patricia Gonzalez-Portillo, a spokeswoman for the organization, said in an interview."}
