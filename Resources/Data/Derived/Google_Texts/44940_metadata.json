Do they not read their Salon Dot Com analysis of parliamentary rules?\n\nNovember 11: \u201cThere are other problems with using the reconciliation process, for either a full Obamacare repeal or a repeal of the medical device or individual mandate, beyond the existence of the presidential veto. The so-called Byrd Rule does not allow the reconciliation process to be used for anything that adds to the deficit. The Affordable Care Act, by the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s scoring, reduces the budget deficit by billions of dollars over the 10-year horizon.\u201d\n\nJanuary 16: \u201cIt\u2019s a convoluted process, but in short, budget reconciliation allows a Senate majority to bypass the filibuster on a piece of legislation that meets certain budgetary requirements \u2014 that it doesn\u2019t increase the deficit, for example, at least if the legislative changes are to be permanent.\u201d\n\nMarch 18: \u201cLegislation passed through budget reconciliation has to reduce the deficit if it\u2019s to be permanent\u2026 Republicans don\u2019t like to admit it, but repealing Obamacare would increase the deficit, so some other deficit-reduction reduction measures would have to be thrown into the package to get it past the watchful gaze of the Senate parliamentarian.\u201d\n\nSeparate and apart for their post-King v. Burwell contingency plans, congressional Republican leaders, egged on by conservatives, passed in their budget resolution reconciliation instructions for repealing the Affordable Care Act. This would allow them to move an ACA repeal bill through the Senate by a simple majority, without the threat of a filibuster. Though it would be instantly vetoed, the bill is intended as a political tactic (shocker!) heading into 2016. Congressional Republicans would show that they can get a full ACA repeal to the president\u2019s desk; just send a Republican to the White House and the dreaded Obamacare would be no more.\n\nSo the Republicans wrote up an Obamacare repeal bill and sent it over to CBO and its new director, Keith Hall. You\u2019ll recall that when Republicans took over the Senate, one of their first moves was to oust CBO director Doug Elmendorf, whom conservatives like Grover Norquist considered a filthy Keynesian far-left radical. Hall, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, was installed to show Americans the truth about the true costs of Obamacare. He would use so-called \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring methods to show that, once the macroeconomic effects of an Obamacare repeal \u2014 annualized GDP growth of fifty million percent! \u2014 was factored into the score, the Affordable Care Act would be shown to be a the budget-buster that conservatives have always known it in their hearts to be.\n\nAlas, we learned last Friday that even the magic wand of dynamic scoring could not transform a straight ACA repeal bill into a deficit reducer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans try and try, but still's can't prove Obamacare is a budget-buster", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort hits major snag: Even their special math doesn\u2019t make the numbers work", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans try and try, but still's can't prove Obamacare is a budget-buster", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort hits major snag: Even their special math doesn\u2019t make the numbers work", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/23/gops_obamacare_repeal_effort_hits_major_snag_even_their_special_math_doesnt_make_the_numbers_work/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/mcconnell_ryan_boehner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans try and try, but still's can't prove Obamacare is a budget-buster", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort hits major snag: Even their special math doesn\u2019t make the numbers work", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/mcconnell_ryan_boehner.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, budget reconciliation, CBO, Congress, Doug Elmendorf, dynamic scoring, Editor's Picks, GOP, House, keith hall, Obamacare, Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6ed\"", "article_summary": "So the Republicans wrote up an Obamacare repeal bill and sent it over to CBO and its new director, Keith Hall.\nThis would allow them to move an ACA repeal bill through the Senate by a simple majority, without the threat of a filibuster.\nHe would use so-called \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring methods to show that, once the macroeconomic effects of an Obamacare repeal \u2014 annualized GDP growth of fifty million percent!\nNovember 11: \u201cThere are other problems with using the reconciliation process, for either a full Obamacare repeal or a repeal of the medical device or individual mandate, beyond the existence of the presidential veto.\nAlas, we learned last Friday that even the magic wand of dynamic scoring could not transform a straight ACA repeal bill into a deficit reducer."}
