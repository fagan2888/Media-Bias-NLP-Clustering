She was CEO of BCBST for nearly a decade, from January 2003 until late 2012.\n\n\"We are very pleased to be adding an individual to Acadia's board with the healthcare expertise and accomplishments that Vicky Gregg has achieved across her outstanding career.

The company has transformed since 2010 as it has expanded its territory and federal legislation, notably the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and Affordable Care Act, increased access to mental health and addiction recovery services.\n\nGregg, a nurse, started her career at Erlanger Regional Medical Center and has held numerous high-level positions. She's served on the boards of the BlueCross BlueShield Association, National Institute of Healthcare Management, America's Health Insurance Plans, National Institutes of Health Commission on Systemic Interoperability and the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/27F8wam", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vicky Gregg, former chief of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, is taking a seat on\u00a0Acadia's board of directors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Vicky Gregg, former chief of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, is taking a seat on\u00a0Acadia's board of directors.", "title": "Vicky Gregg joins Acadia Healthcare board", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/05/19/vicky-gregg-joins-acadia-healthcare-board/84616094/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vicky Gregg, former chief of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, is taking a seat on\u00a0Acadia's board of directors.", "title": "Vicky Gregg joins Acadia Healthcare board", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a4b677266972da2befdee155931e36bfd03fcb1/c=128-40-404-316&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Nashville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Nashville", "title": "Vicky Gregg joins Acadia Healthcare board", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca38b7b4db0f75d9ae92193b055693700c6689b8/c=126-0-423-396/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0cea497658a93ada2b1fccc0afc2944718196fc3/c=128-40-404-316/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d4e2781e33b04d32ae2aaac99f59d687bbd0085/c=119-60-431-295/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a86e172cda86b664382a84f7dd4e8ed447ea0519/c=107-79-479-289&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-19T16:12:37.030000-05:00", "shorthed": "Vicky Gregg joins Acadia's board", "articleid": 84616094, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4450b95b035eb2b7fee444b9c50c53b921a6907f/c=107-79-479-289/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4529d39e126f996c9f8b3add61a2aa4ba8f39869/c=160-0-382-396/local/-/media/2016/05/19/TennGroup/Nashville/635992734903258711-acadia.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Acadia Healthcare, Vicky Gregg, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee"}, "article_summary": "Acadia Healthcare (Photo: Logo)Vicky Gregg, the former chief of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, is taking a seat on Acadia Healthcare's board of directors.\n\"We are very pleased to be adding an individual to Acadia's board with the healthcare expertise and accomplishments that Vicky Gregg has achieved across her outstanding career.\nBuy Photo Joey Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Acadia Healthcare.\nAcadia, based in Franklin, provides patient behavioral health and addiction dependency care for children, teens and adults of all ages.\nGregg replaces Kyle Lattner of Waud Capital Partners, whose term expired, said Chris Howard, Acadia's general counsel."}
