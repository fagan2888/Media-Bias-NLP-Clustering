In her mid-50s, she had been battling breast cancer for years, but it had spread to her bones, causing unrelenting pain that required hospitalization. Jeremy Force, a first-year oncology fellow at Duke University Medical Center who had never met the woman, was assigned to stop by her room last November to discuss her decision to enter hospice.\n\nEmploying the skills he had just learned in a day-long course, Force sat at the end of her bed and listened intently. The woman wept, telling him she was exhausted and worried about the impact her death would have on her two daughters.\n\n\u201cI acknowledged how hard what she was going through was,\u201d Force said of their 15-minute conversation, \u201cand told her I had two children, too\u201d and that hospice was designed to provide her additional support.\n\nA few days later, he ran into the woman in the hall. \u201cYou\u2019re the best physician I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Force remembers her telling him. \u201cI was blown away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was such an honor.\u201d\n\nRelated Content\n\nForce credits \u201cOncotalk,\u201d a course required of Duke\u2019s oncology fellows, for the unexpected accolade. Developed by medical faculty at Duke, the University of Pittsburgh and several other medical schools, \u201cOncotalk\u201d is part of a burgeoning effort to teach doctors an essential but often overlooked skill: clinical empathy. Unlike sympathy, which is defined as feeling sorry for another person, clinical empathy is the ability to stand in a patient\u2019s shoes and to convey an understanding of the patient\u2019s situation as well as the desire to help.\n\nClinical empathy was once dismissively known as \u201cgood bedside manner\u201d and traditionally regarded as far less important than technical acumen. But a spate of studies in the past decade has found that it is no mere frill. Increasingly, empathy is considered essential to establishing trust, the foundation of a good doctor-patient relationship.\n\nStudies have linked empathy to greater patient satisfaction, better outcomes, decreased physician burnout and a lower risk of malpractice suits and errors. Beginning this year, the Medical College Admission Test will contain questions involving human behavior and psychology, a recognition that being a good doctor \u201crequires an understanding of people,\u201d not just science, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. Patient satisfaction scores are now being used to calculate Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act. And more than 70 percent of hospitals and health networks are using patient satisfaction scores in physician compensation decisions.\n\nWhile some people are naturally better at being empathic, said Mohammadreza Hojat, a research professor of psychiatry at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, empathy can be taught. \u201cEmpathy is a cognitive attribute, not a personality trait,\u201d said Hojat, who developed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, a tool used by researchers to measure it.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is really on,\u201d said psychiatrist Helen Riess. The director of the empathy and relational science program at Massachusetts General Hospital, she designed \u201cEmpathetics,\u201d a series of online courses for physicians. \u201cThe ACA and accountability for health improvement is really heightening the importance of a relationship\u201d between patients and their doctors when it comes to boosting adherence to treatment and improving health outcomes.\n\n\u201cDemographics and economics are driving this,\u201d said James A. Tulsky, one of the developers of \u201cOncotalk.\u201d (The original course for oncologists has been adapted for other specialties under the aegis of Vital Talk.) \u201cBaby boomers have higher expectations\u201d and are less willing to tolerate doctors they consider arrogant or unapproachable, added Tulsky, director of the Duke Center for Palliative Care. A 2011 study he headed found that doctors who took the course inspired greater trust in their patients than those who did not.\n\nWhile empathy courses are rarely required in medical training, interest in them is growing, experts say, and programs are underway at Jefferson Medical College and at Columbia University School of Medicine. Columbia has pioneered a program in narrative medicine, which emphasizes the importance of understanding patients\u2019 life stories in providing compassionate care.\n\nWhile the curricula differ, most focus on self-monitoring by doctors to reduce defensiveness, improve listening skills (one study found that, on average, doctors interrupt patients within 18 seconds) and decode facial expressions and body language. Some programs use actors as simulated patients and provide feedback to individual doctors.\n\nToo Busy For Empathy\n\n\u201cIn the 1980s, when I trained, the emphasis was on medical knowledge and technical skills,\u201d said Debra Weinstein, vice president for graduate medical education at Partners HealthCare, the largest provider of medical services in Massachusetts. But in the past decade, \u201cthe profession has been more attuned to patient satisfaction and the connection between satisfaction and outcomes and incentives.\u201d\n\nPartners, which includes Mass General and other Harvard teaching hospitals, is requiring that its 2,000 residents take \u201cEmpathetics.\u201d In a 2012 study involving 100 residents, researchers found that doctors randomly assigned to take the course were judged by patients as significantly better at understanding their concerns and making them feel at ease than residents who had not undergone the training.\n\nRiess said that while some doctors have told her they don\u2019t have the time to be empathic, the skill has proved to be a timesaver rather than a time sink. It can help doctors zero in on the real source of a patient\u2019s concern, short-circuiting repeated visits or those \u201cdoorknob moments\u201d doctors dread, when the patient says \u201cOh, by the way . . . \u201d and raises the primary concern as the doctor is headed out of the room.\n\nBecause a lack of empathy and poor communication drive many malpractice cases, a large malpractice insurer, MMIC, is urging doctors it insures to take the \u201cEmpathetics\u201d course. Another benefit: Empathy training appears to combat physician burnout.\n\n\u201cEmpathy training is naturally self-rewarding,\u201d said Laurie Drill-Mellum, a former emergency room doctor who is chief medical officer of the Minneapolis-based insurer. \u201cIt gives [doctors] the love back,\u201d she said, referring to the positive feedback empathic doctors receive from their patients.\n\n\u2018Doctors Are Explainaholics\u2019\n\nBoth Riess and Tulsky say their interest in empathy was sparked by personal experience. In Riess\u2019 case, it was the flood of patients in her psychiatric practice a decade ago who spent their time in therapy discussing devastating interactions with doctors. \u201cThese are not just innocuous effects,\u201d she said, \u201cbut often experiences that were profound and deeply affected people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nTulsky said that his father, an obstetrician-gynecologist in a solo practice, routinely talked about his patients at dinner. \u201cHis stories were about their lives, so I got this idea that medicine was about more than the illness,\u201d he recalled. In medical school, Tulsky said, \u201cI was very drawn to challenging moments in patients\u2019 lives and volunteered to give bad news,\u201d particularly when he believed other doctors would botch it.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot that disturbed me,\u201d Tulsky said. One memorable incident involved his chief resident loudly berating a frightened, impoverished and very sick old man, saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this operation, you\u2019ll die. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d\n\nTulsky said that researchers have found that some doctors don\u2019t respond with empathy because they are clueless when it comes to reading other people. Many others, he said, do recognize distress but fear unleashing a flood of emotion in the patient, and sometimes in themselves.\n\n\u201cDoctors are explainaholics,\u201d Tulsky said. \u201cOur answer to distress is more information, that if a patient just understood it better, they would come around.\u201d In reality, bombarding a patient with information does little to alleviate the underlying worry.\n\nThe \u201cEmpathetics\u201d program teaches doctors \u201chow to show up, not what to say,\u201d said Riess. \u201cWe do a lot of training in emotional recognition and self-monitoring.\u201d That includes learning to identify seven universal facial expressions \u2014 using research pioneered by psychologist Paul Ekman \u2014 and to take stock of one\u2019s own emotional responses to patients or situations.\n\nSome of the course is explicitly prescriptive: Make eye contact with the patient, not the computer. Don\u2019t stand over a hospitalized patient, pull up a chair. Don\u2019t conduct a monologue in off-putting medicalese. Pay attention to tone of voice, which can be more important than what is said. When delivering bad news, schedule the patient for the end of the day and do not allow interruptions. Find out what the patient is most concerned about and figure out how best to address that.\n\nOne Doctor\u2019s Experience\n\nAndy Lipman has taken the Duke course twice: first as an oncology fellow in 2004 and last year as a practicing oncologist in Naples, Fla., when he felt in need of a \u201cbooster shot.\u201d Oncology, he said, \u201cis a full-contact\u201d specialty with a high burnout rate.\n\nAmong the most important lessons Lipman said he learned during both sessions was to let go of \u201cmy own medical agenda, the desire to fix something or make something happen in that visit.\u201d He learned to pace himself, monitor his reactions and talk less.\n\nEvery day, he said, he thinks about what he was told in 2004: \u201cNever answer a feeling with a fact.\u201d That means responding to a patient in a six-month remission from cancer who reports having a sore elbow by saying, \u201cTell me more about your elbow. This is probably scary stuff\u201d and not \u201cYour scans show no evidence of disease.\u201d\n\nOne technique Lipman routinely employs is taking 15 seconds before entering an exam room to ask himself, \u201cWhat is needed here?\u201d\n\nOn the day he was interviewed, Lipman said, he used what he has learned with a patient with end-stage cancer. She was scheduled for a brief appointment but began weeping loudly as she told Lipman how alone she felt.\n\n\u201cI engaged, I expected the emotional response and I hung in there,\u201d he said of the meeting, which lasted 45 minutes. \u201cIt felt good to me,\u201d Lipman said, and he hoped it gave his patient some comfort.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
