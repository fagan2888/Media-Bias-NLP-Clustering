Lots and lots of crow poop. It fell from the trees onto a big white tarp, where Julie Ellis, an infectious disease professor at Tufts University, collected and tested the poop for bacteria. What she found from her samples collected last winter was evidence that wild animals are developing a resistance to antibiotics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve documented human-derived drug resistance where it shouldn\u2019t be\u2014in wildlife and the environment,\u201d Ellis told Lindsey Konkel from Environmental Health Newsfor a disturbing report published earlier this week.\n\nIt\u2019s not unheard of for bacteria in the guts of birds and other animals to exhibit naturally antibiotic-resistant genes. But Ellis and the other scientists who participated in her study, whose results were published in July in Environmental Microbiology, wrote that evidence of resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin likely comes from a human source. Vancomycin is used to treat staph infections that cause a number of illnesses, including pneumonia and meningitis.\n\nThose are clearly serious diseases, but a lot of the complaints treated with antibiotics are not. Half of the antibiotics prescribed to people in the United States are unnecessary, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And even more of the drugs\u201480 percent, or an estimated 30,000 tons of antibiotics\u2014are sold for use in livestock, to promote growth and prevent infection.\n\nBacteria that live in animals\u2019 digestive tracts can trade genes with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, passing on the immunity to certain drugs. People who ingest these bacteria, like in the case of the recent salmonella outbreak from a chicken processing facility in California (See \u201cWho You Calling Chicken Little\u201d), don\u2019t respond to the very medications meant to help treat the illness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drugs given to livestock may be creating superbugs that leave us vulnerable to illnesses like meningitis", "title": "Aw crap!
