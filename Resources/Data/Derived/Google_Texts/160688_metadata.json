We\u2019re going to work very hard,\u201d Watson Coleman said in her victory speech last night at the hotel, where she was introduced by outgoing U.S. Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th Dist.)\n\nWith 90 percent of precincts reporting, the Associated Press reported that Watson Coleman received 14,356 votes from Democrats in Mercer, Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties.\n\nWatson Coleman, a Ewing resident, will face Franklin Township doctor Alieta Eck, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary election.\n\nA victory by Watson Coleman Nov. 4 would keep the 12th District Congressional seat in Mercer County. Holt (D-12th Dist.) announced in February that he wouldn\u2019t seek reelection to a ninth term in the House.\n\nWatson Coleman, if elected, would become the state\u2019s first African American woman in Congress, to which she stated last night, \u201cI believe that Congress and our Legislature always benefit from having someone that sees the issues and the needs and the opportunities through the lens of both the women and the minorities.\u201d\n\nIn her speech last night, she talked about tackling immigration reform, health care, and education.\n\nIn a statement last night, Holt remarked, \u201cI look forward to talking with voters about Bonnie Watson Coleman, who I\u2019m confident will be a fierce advocate for progressive issues in Washington, as she has been in the Legislature.\u201d\n\nAs expected by pollsters and political insiders, the primary election came down to a race between Watson Coleman and second-place finisher, 14th Legislative District state Sen. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex), who received 9,475 votes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure out what I\u2019m going to do and continue to be a senator,\u201d Greenstein told about two dozen supporters at a North Brunswick union hall. \u201cI must enjoy my life with or without Congress, though I sure would have liked to go.\u201d\n\nGreenstein picked up the endorsements of her home county\u2019s Democratic organization and a number of powerful union allies, but Watson Coleman\u2019s base \u2014 anchored by county and church endorsements in Mercer and Union \u2014 proved enough to win the nomination.\n\nAssemblyman Upendra Chivukula (D-Somerset) finished with 4,979 primary votes, good for third place, while South Brunswick resident Andrew Zwicker \u2014 who works at Holt\u2019s former home, the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory \u2014 finished in fourth place, with 2,430 votes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of everything we were able to accomplish,\u201d Zwicker said. \u201cWe started from nothing and built up this wonderful, wonderful beginning.\u201d\n\nChivukula could not be reached for comment before press time.\n\nFIRST CONGRESSWOMAN\n\nWith Watson Coleman and Eck set to face off on Nov. 4, voters will likely elect the state\u2019s first female member in either house of Congress since 2003, when former U.S. Rep. Marge Roukema (R-5th and 7th Dists.) retired from politics.\n\nFor Eck, the win last night was her first political victory since she burst onto the scene last year, filing as a Republican candidate in the primary election to replace Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg after his death.\n\nEck lost that primary election to former Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan, who lost his bid for a seat in the 3rd Congressional District last night, but used her political debut as a springboard for her Congressional campaign this year.\n\n\u201cThere are no women physicians in Congress and the Affordable Care Act has been purported to do for women what they can\u2019t do for themselves. That\u2019s a fallacy,\u201d said Eck, who runs a free medical clinic in Franklin Township.\n\nBut Eck faces a tough road in the general election: The 12th District has been a Democratic stronghold since Holt was first elected in 1998, aided by redistricting efforts that placed historically Democratic communities, such as Trenton and Plainfield, within its borders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to prove them wrong,\u201d Eck said. \u201cThe message I have resonates with every group, the message that we don\u2019t have to have government as usual. Our economy is at the bottom of the other states, and it\u2019s because of the policies of these legislators.\u201d\n\nWatson Coleman last night said she wouldn\u2019t take anything for granted, instead vowing to keep her campaign team focused on the next five months of campaigning throughout the district.\n\nContact Mike Davis at (609) 989-5708 or mdavis@njtimes.com.\n\nContact Brendan McGrath at (609) 989-5731 or bmcgrath@njtimes.com.\n\nOn mobile or desktop:\n\n\u2022 Like Times of Trenton on Facebook\n\n\u2022 Follow @TimesofTrenton on Twitter\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'2014-congressional-races','@news','@politics','@river','@times','bonnie-watson-coleman','linda-greenstein','upendra-chivukula'", "title": "Watson Coleman wins Democratic primary for 12th congressional district", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Watson Coleman wins Democratic primary for 12th congressional district\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/06/watson_coleman_wins_democratic_primary_for_12th_congressional_district.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/the-times/photo/2014/06/15117955-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13102300\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-04T03:32:20Z\", \"author\": \"Times of Trenton Staff Writers\", \"tags\": [\"2014-congressional-races\",\"@news\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"@times\",\"bonnie-watson-coleman\",\"linda-greenstein\",\"upendra-chivukula\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2014/06/15117955-small.jpg", "description": "It was viewed as a dead heat by pollsters and political insiders from the start, but in the end it was a resounding victory for Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, June 04, 2014,  1:52 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2014/06/15117955-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njotimesstaff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Times of Trenton Staff Writers\", \"author_id\": \"9432956\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Mercer County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "It was viewed as a dead heat by pollsters and political insiders from the start, but in the end it was a resounding victory for Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman.", "title": "Watson Coleman wins Democratic primary for 12th congressional district", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/06/watson_coleman_wins_democratic_primary_for_12th_congressional_district.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, June 03, 2014, 11:20 PM", "article_author": "Times of Trenton Staff Writers", "Description": "It was viewed as a dead heat by pollsters and political insiders from the start, but in the end it was a resounding victory for Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman."}, "article_summary": "A victory by Watson Coleman Nov. 4 would keep the 12th District Congressional seat in Mercer County.\nWatson Coleman, a Ewing resident, will face Franklin Township doctor Alieta Eck, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary election.\nWith 90 percent of precincts reporting, the Associated Press reported that Watson Coleman received 14,356 votes from Democrats in Mercer, Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties.\nWe\u2019re going to work very hard,\u201d Watson Coleman said in her victory speech last night at the hotel, where she was introduced by outgoing U.S. Rep.\nSupporters at the Lafayette Yard Hotel & Conference Center last night erupted in cheers as whispers of the results circled around the room."}
