But a new tool, made possible by a provision in the Affordable Care Act, now makes that connection more transparent and has the potential to change the way doctors conduct business.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the launch of the Open Payments online database. The inaugural data set reveals payments totaling $3.5 billion between August and December 2013 for the speaking fees, consulting fees, and stake ownership for more than 500,000 physicians.\n\nThat data set begins to reveal a piece of what\u2019s become a lucrative industry. Pharmaceutical companies spend nearly $20 billion annually marketing their products to physicians, efforts that yields profits of nearly $300 billion per year in prescription drug sales. At the peak of Big Pharma\u2019s profitable relationship with the medical industry in 2007, more than 100,000 representatives made visits to more than 650,000 physicians across the country.\n\nIn 2010, investigative news site ProPublica launched Dollars for Docs, an online database that discloses payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors and other healthcare providers. The data showed that more than 20 doctors amassed more than $500,000 for speaking engagements and their services as consultants.\n\nBut what many consider to be Big Pharma\u2019s unethical marketing strategy often doesn\u2019t stop there: Representatives also dole out free samples of prescription medication and shower physicians with gifts like coffee mugs emblazoned with the drug company\u2019s logo, tickets to sporting events, expensive dinners, and trips to exotic destinations.\n\nReports have also shown that pharmaceutical companies have ghostwritten studies extolling their products, even when the medication in question poses serious health risks. In one of the most well-known examples, representatives of New York-based drug company Pfizer penned more than 50 articles designating hormone replacement therapy as a viable solution for breast cancer and post-menopausal heart disease \u2014 a claim that has since been discredited.\n\nExperts say the CMS\u2019s new system shows promise of changing how Big Pharma interacts with doctors and hospitals. But it has yet to be seen if pharmaceutical companies will follow the lead of British drug company GlaxoSmithKline, which recently became the first major player to cease its payments to doctors as part of its marketing strategy.\n\nThe Open Payment data as it currently exists omits some information \u2014 including data that physicians and hospitals disputed and payments connected to products not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. CMS officials said that a full data set spanning 12 months that includes physicians\u2019 names will be released in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "There's now a public database revealing the speaking fees, consulting fees, and stake ownership of more than 500,000 physicians.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "There's now a public database revealing the speaking fees, consulting fees, and stake ownership of more than 500,000 physicians.", "title": "You Can Now Find Out How Much Big Pharma Is Paying Your Doctor", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/01/3574509/big-pharma-doctor-payments-database/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP502312135448.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's now a public database revealing the speaking fees, consulting fees, and stake ownership of more than 500,000 physicians.", "title": "You Can Now Find Out How Much Big Pharma Is Paying Your Doctor", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP502312135448-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP502312135448.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP502312135448.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-01T12:37:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Experts say the CMS\u2019s new system shows promise of changing how Big Pharma interacts with doctors and hospitals.\nCMS officials said that a full data set spanning 12 months that includes physicians\u2019 names will be released in 2015.\nHealth You Can Now Find Out How Much Big Pharma Is Paying Your Doctor CREDIT: AP Photo/HHS This image provided by the Department of Health and Humans Services shows the Open Payments page of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nThat data set begins to reveal a piece of what\u2019s become a lucrative industry.\nReports have also shown that pharmaceutical companies have ghostwritten studies extolling their products, even when the medication in question poses serious health risks."}
