(AP) - The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract for its long-promised new medical clinic in Savannah to Johnson Development of Birmingham, Ala., which will build and manage the expanded facility at 11111 Rio Road on property currently owned by Providence Presbyterian Church.\n\nAs is the standard policy with VA clinics, Johnson Development will buy the property, develop it and lease it to the VA.\n\nDerek Weaver, Johnson\u2019s senior vice president for federal property management, said his company plans to begin the next phase immediately, with a target completion date of June 2016.\n\n\u201cWe will be meeting with Savannah city planners in the next few weeks to go over designs,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019d say we\u2019re looking at an April groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe new clinic will replace the nearly 25-year-old, 39,000-square-foot facility off Middleground Road.\n\nWhile that clinic has traditionally received good reviews from veterans for medical care, the VA determined five years ago that it had become too small and offered too few services for its growing patient load.\n\nSince that time, the area\u2019s veteran population has grown from 8,000 to nearly 13,000.\n\nThe new clinic will come close to doubling the current space with a total of 69,000 square feet, Weaver said, considerably more than the minimum 50,500 the VA requested.\n\nIn addition to primary care, ophthalmology, mental health care and minor surgical procedures, the facility will also include a women\u2019s health clinic.\n\nThe property selected is within blocks of the 9-acre site on Mohawk Street originally designated for the new clinic in 2011, when the VA held a bid conference attended by more than 125 would-be developers, architects and contractors.\n\nConstruction had been expected to begin within the year. But the property, owned by attorney Howard Spiva, was deemed to have appraisal issues and the process was put on hold, only to emerge in 2013 with a decidedly different look.\n\nInstead of inviting developers to bid on an already determined site, the VA asked developers to submit their plans - complete with a site of their choosing - according to Brad Seifert, whose Washington, D.C., firm represents the VA in real estate and construction matters.\n\nThose submittals that matched VA requirements were sent requests for proposals. Seifert said, adding that a contract award was expected in early 2014, with the winning developer expected to buy the property and begin construction shortly thereafter.\n\nBut delays are more often the norm than the exception with VA projects.\n\nAn audit last year by the watchdog U.S. Government Accountability office indicates efforts to lease and build new VA clinics across the country are running years behind, with 39 of 41 proposed clinics - including Savannah\u2019s - delayed.\n\nNow that a contract has been awarded, delays on the Savannah project should be a thing of the past, Weaver said.\n\nSince 1994, Johnson Development, a private, independent firm, has developed more than 4 million square feet of medical office and healthcare facility space, providing a full menu of advisory and project management services.\n\nThe Savannah facility will be the company\u2019s third VA clinic.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Savannah Morning News, http://www.savannahnow.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract for its long-promised new medical clinic in Savannah to Johnson Development of Birmingham, Ala., which will build and manage the expanded facility at 11111 Rio Road on property currently owned by Providence Presbyterian Church.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/11/new-savannah-veterans-administration-clinic-finall/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract for its long-promised new medical clinic in Savannah to Johnson Development of Birmingham, Ala., which will build and manage the expanded facility at 11111 Rio Road on property currently owned by Providence Presbyterian Church.", "title": "New Savannah Veterans Administration Clinic finally on way"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract for its long-promised new medical clinic in Savannah to Johnson Development of Birmingham, Ala., which will build and manage the expanded", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New Savannah Veterans Administration Clinic finally on way"}, "Author": "MARY CARR MAYLE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15b8\"", "article_summary": "The Savannah facility will be the company\u2019s third VA clinic.\n\u201cWe will be meeting with Savannah city planners in the next few weeks to go over designs,\u201d Weaver said.\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019d say we\u2019re looking at an April groundbreaking.\u201dThe new clinic will replace the nearly 25-year-old, 39,000-square-foot facility off Middleground Road.\nNow that a contract has been awarded, delays on the Savannah project should be a thing of the past, Weaver said.\nIn addition to primary care, ophthalmology, mental health care and minor surgical procedures, the facility will also include a women\u2019s health clinic."}
