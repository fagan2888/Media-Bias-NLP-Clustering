With a $10,000 matching donation to start, from the Lifeboat Foundation of Chicago, Peninsula Free Health hopes to raise money from the community.\n\n\n\nBut first, the clinic must discover what the community needs from a free health clinic.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out what the community wants rather than saying to the community, this is what you should have,\u201d Garfield said.\n\n\n\nThe clinic will cover \u201cpediatrics to geriatrics,\u201d said Garfield, and provide health checks, urine analyses and diabetic and hypertension checks.\n\n\n\nThe clinic has the support of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital, although the specific services the hospital can offer are not yet formalized.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the important thing is that they\u2019re committed to being supportive of the effort,\u201d said hospital board member Jim Schatz, who serves as clinic liaison with BHMH. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them a laundry list of things that would be most helpful\u2026Procedures have to be fleshed out after the people are coming to the clinic.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe board is also working to secure low-cost online prescriptions, as well as a cost comparison for individual drugs from local pharmacies.\n\n\n\nGarfield and Dr. Robert Walker (retired) are the volunteer doctors on staff; both are covered by their own malpractice insurance.\n\n\n\nA retired Associate Professor of Medicine at New York University, Garfield ran the now-closed MedNow health clinic in Ellsworth for 20 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been trying to see how [to] set up services for the uninsured, who amount to 70-100,000 in Maine,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nCovering the \u201cgap\u201d in the ACA\n\n\n\nWhile the Affordable Healthcare Act goes into effect on January 1, government subsidies will not cover all individuals, said Vice President Leslie Goode, who has worked in the public health policy field for 20 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ACA is the biggest advance we\u2019ve had in this country since Medicare/Medicaid was enacted in 1965, but it\u2019s still going to leave gaps,\u201d she said, especially since Maine is one of 21 states \u201cthat is not taking up the federal government\u2019s offer to expand Medicare.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor those who can\u2019t accurately predict their income\u2014the self-employed, those whose income fluctuates and/or who work seasonable jobs\u2014\u201cthe ACA is difficult to know,\u201d said Goode.\n\n\n\nACA Navigator Lynn Cheney, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the clinic board, will be at the clinic to guide people through the ACA website.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ACA will probably act as a net that will catch a number of people,\u201d agreed Schatz, \u201cbut it won\u2019t catch everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a Blue Hill selectman, Schatz knows there are people in need. \u201cVery often people come in [to the town office] for general assistance,\u201d he said in a recent telephone call. \u201cMore than just a need for heating oil help. Often they are uninsured and they don\u2019t even have MaineCare. They feel they can\u2019t afford to go someplace. This gives a resource.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeninsula Free Health has nine members on its board of directors: Garfield, Goode, Cheney, Schatz, Walker, Molly Blake, Sarah Hudson, Rob McCall and Anne Schroth.\n\n\n\nNow that word of the clinic is out, \u201cpeople are coming out of the woodwork to volunteer,\u201d said Cheney. \u201c[This is] a community that\u2019s loaded with professionals.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the message Garfield stressed was that the community is the main architect of Peninsula Free Health.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is breaking new ground,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cWe want to be sure we have input, and we know where we\u2019re going. We really want the community to help us to decide our future plans.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Weekly Packet", "description": "Want health care? \nIf you\u2019re uninsured, or not sure if you qualify for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Peninsula Free Health can help.", "title": "Free Blue Hill health clinic to open its doors on November 25", "url": "http://weeklypacket.com/news/2013/nov/14/free-blue-hill-health-clinic-to-open-its-doors-on/", "image": "https://penobscotbaypress.com/media/darkroom/photos/cache/wp_garfield_111413_facebook_og_image.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "google-site-verification": "frKfps1DIXF9RPfYymQiWG-FtAXS5yQdL2gR1Ko5vE0", "description": "Want health care? \nIf you\u2019re uninsured, or not sure if you qualify for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Peninsula Free Health can help."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7c9\"", "article_summary": "News FeatureBlue Hill Originally published in The Weekly Packet, November 14, 2013 Free Blue Hill health clinic to open its doors on November 25 Garfield: \u201cAnyone who comes in can be seen, no matter what\u201dFrom left, Peninsula Free Health board officials Leslie Goode (vice president), Dr. Jane Garfield (president) and Lynn Cheney (secretary-treasurer) meet at the Blue Hill Congregational Church\u2014the site of a free health clinic opening November 25.by Anne BerleantWant health care?\nBut first, the clinic must discover what the community needs from a free health clinic.\nIf you\u2019re uninsured, or not sure if you qualify for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Peninsula Free Health can help.\nACA Navigator Lynn Cheney, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the clinic board, will be at the clinic to guide people through the ACA website.\nThe clinic has the support of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital, although the specific services the hospital can offer are not yet formalized."}
