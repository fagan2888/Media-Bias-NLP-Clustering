An ambitious cross-disciplinary effort fashioned after the Kennedy-era space efforts, its aim is to dramatically reduce mortality rates of a group of cancers \u2014 breast, ovarian, lung and prostate cancer, multiple types of leukemia, and melanoma.\n\nBut the tenure of DePinho, who has been president since 2011 and is the fourth in the institution\u2019s 72-year history, has been marked by distractions and growing unease as much as by lofty aspirations. Most recently, a survey of clinical faculty members found that a majority of respondents believed that the program\u2019s demands were having an impact on patient care and MD Anderson\u2019s clinical reputation.\n\nWith pressure mounting from University of Texas System leaders, DePinho acknowledged that his hard-charging style might have resulted in some missteps. He said he has learned from his experiences and is making changes.\n\n\u201cI have stumbled,\u201d DePinho said Monday during an interview in his office. \u201cIt comes from running really fast.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in New York, DePinho moved to Houston with big ideas after 14 years in Massachusetts at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. His wife, Lynda Chin, a renowned cancer genomics researcher, came with him, as did most of the employees of his Boston lab, to help establish the new Institute for Applied Cancer Science.\n\nHe soon encountered financial pressures.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that all academic institutions are going to have to find ways to increase the quality of care and the numbers of patients they see, and do so with less support,\u201d DePinho said, citing the advent of the Affordable Care Act and the erosion of federal research financing, among other factors.\n\nBut the demands of such ambitious efforts and financing challenges are taking a toll.\n\nIn 2012, clinical departments were asked to increase revenue targets by 5 to 10 percent. This year, austerity measures, including salary freezes, were announced.\n\nA clinical faculty survey conducted in September indicated that deep concerns are taking root.\n\nOf nearly 550 clinical faculty members who participated \u2014 out of about 850 total \u2014 a majority indicated that they had at least considered other job opportunities. More than 56 percent of respondents agreed that demands for increased clinical productivity have had an impact on patient safety.\n\nDePinho said patient safety and care remain MD Anderson\u2019s top priorities, and he takes such concerns seriously.\n\n\u201cIf there is any veracity to those claims, we want to find out and we want to open up the lines of communication,\u201d he said, adding that the survey has sparked \u201chealthy dialogue where people are now focused on good discussion, trying to come together and think about what the solutions might be.\u201d\n\nThe survey, the latest in a series showing declining morale, was presented during a faculty senate meeting last month that was attended by University of Texas System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa.\n\nMembers of the executive committee of MD Anderson\u2019s faculty senate declined to comment further on the matter this week.\n\nIn a statement, Cigarroa described his discussions with faculty as \u201cvery productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe identified several areas that we felt needed immediate attention as it related to better communication, compensation, reviewing how funding mechanisms are currently used to support clinical operations and research, involving faculty in decision-making and planning, and a better balance of near-term needs and long-term goals,\u201d Cigarroa said.\n\nHe added that he is working with MD Anderson leaders to address faculty concerns and believes they can forge \u201ca constructive and successful path forward.\u201d\n\nIn addition to malaise among the faculty, the last two years have featured some controversy.\n\nIn 2012, questions were raised when the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas bypassed the standard approval process in issuing a $20 million grant to a project co-directed by Chin at the Institute for Applied Cancer Science. CPRIT was the subject of legislative hearings and an administrative overhaul. A UT System review found no conflicts of interest related to the grant.\n\nGiven recent budget constraints, a nearly $550,000 price tag for office renovations approved by the UT System as part of the effort to attract DePinho and Chin also caused heartburn among some faculty.\n\nDePinho\u2019s ties to Aveo Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge company he co-founded with Chin, have also been scrutinized. In 2012, he appeared on CNBC in his capacity as president and touted a renal cancer drug developed by the company. He later apologized for doing so. Though there had been internal discussions about troubling test results within the company, DePinho has said he was not aware of them at the time.\n\nAt the end of last year, DePinho resigned from the Aveo board and two other companies with which he had retained ties. He also put his investments into a blind trust.\n\nBut Aveo has continued to create headaches. The Food and Drug Administration rejected the renal cancer drug in June. Less than a month later, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into the company.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the company has been informed that the action \u201cshould not be construed as an indication that any violations of law have occurred or that the SEC has any negative opinion of any person, entity or security.\u201d\n\nDePinho said these episodes have been instructive. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been really good lessons that one has to be a lot more proactive in managing the information so that perceptions don\u2019t build,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he intends to adopt a more inclusive approach to planning and to step up the dissemination of information to encourage data-driven decision-making. \u201cWe have an extraordinary faculty and a phenomenal staff,\u201d he said, noting that they shared common motivations.\n\n\u201cThe thing we all agree on is that we hate cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we agree that patients come first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ronald DePinho's first two years as president of MD Anderson Cancer Center have been marked by distractions and growing unease as much as by lofty aspirations.
