The Texas House Appropriations Committee has begun a two-day hearing over the future of the state’s Medicaid program, including what to do should the feds not offer as much relief as in the past.

Austin’s KUT-FM reports about the nuts and bolts of what will be discussed. The state is awaiting word about whether its 1115 Transformation Waiver will be renewed. It expires in September, and last year Texas again applied for the funds. The waiver has sent billions of dollars to healthcare providers to both offset the cost of uncompensated care and to implement initiatives that will increase access and affordability. The latter, known as DSRIP (Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments), have gone toward hundreds of programs that are just getting off the ground.

But as KUT notes, the Obama administration may decide to balk at providing those funds (or at least as much of those funds) should Texas again decline to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. So stay tuned on that.

The state will also hear public testimony on the historical growth of the Texas Medicaid program and how providers have implemented plans to “detect or deter waste, fraud, and abuse; to reduce cost; or improve the quality of healthcare” in Medicaid. It will also hear testimony on how the program’s providers have provided long-term care for those with disabilities.
