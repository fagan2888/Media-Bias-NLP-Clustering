As candidates made their final appeals to Iowa voters ahead of Monday’s caucuses, Republican front-runner Donald Trump once again leveraged his social media presence to send his loyal followers a last-minute call to action.

“Our country is in serious trouble,” he asserted. “We don’t win anymore.”

The brash billionaire went on to tout a few of the broad ideas he has repeated throughout his unconventional White House bid.

“We don’t win with our military,” Trump said. “We don’t take care of our vets. We don’t win with health care. Obamacare is a disaster. It’s got to be repealed and replaced. We don’t win with education. Common core has to be ended. So many things have to be done.”

Instead of elaborating on his plan to achieve these reforms, however, Trump felt his time would be best used imploring his supporters to plead his case across the state.

“The fact is I could go on and on,” he concluded, “but I don’t want you to listen. I want you to get out and vote.”

Trump went on to describe his campaign as “a big, big movement,” suggesting a vote for him would help usher in real amelioration.

“Changing our government and changing our grossly incompetent leaders starts today in Iowa,” he said. “So get out and vote.”

The short video ended with a familiar campaign pledge.

“We will make America great again,” Trump said. “I promise.”
