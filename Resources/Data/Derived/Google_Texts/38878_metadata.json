Dennis Daugaard\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid, targeting conservative voters to mobilize against the plan.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a heavyweight among conservative grassroots organizations, started the campaign this morning by running radio ads on KELO Newstalk radio in Sioux Falls and KOTA-AM in Rapid City. Ben Lee, the group\u2019s state director, said the ad buy would run for at least a week, and could be expanded.\n\nExpanding Medicaid, the ad says, would drive up the federal debt, which is a big concern to many fiscal conservatives in South Dakota. Medicaid is a state/federal health program for the poor, and the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act allows states to expand the program to poorer adults who aren\u2019t already covered.\n\nThe ad features two women speaking in a restaurant. One says she\u2019s been reading about Medicaid expansion and she asks the other what it\u2019s about.\n\nThe other woman \u2013 identified as Mary \u2013 explains that it was part of President Obama\u2019s health care expansion, and she says that expanding Medicaid would add nearly $400 million a year to the national debt.\n\n\u201cAnd they expect us to pay for this?\u201d says the first woman.\n\n\u201cOur children and grandchildren, too,\u201d Mary answers.\n\nThe first woman then says that she thought South Dakotans were trying to stop Obamacare, not expand it. She asks what she can do about stopping it. Mary conveniently tells her to call Gov. Daugaard\u2019s office, giving the phone number twice: \u201cTell him South Dakota doesn\u2019t need Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion,\u201d she says.\n\nThe ad was produced in-house by AFP\u2019s state organization, Lee said. It\u2019s running hourly and more frequently during drive times.\n\nLee described it as a \u201csignificant ad buy\u201d to be able to run it hourly and during drive times.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have expressed concerns about expanding the program because of cost overruns in other states, Lee said.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few of them that are concerned about it because of the costs and because of the unknowns,\u201d he said.\n\nDaugaard\u2019s plan centers on the federal government picking up the tab of Native American health care that the state is currently paying. If the federal government can do that, then the state would be able to shift tens of millions of dollars into expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe state of South Dakota is leaving millions of dollars on the table by not expanding Medicaid.
