Individuals making less than roughly $46,000 a year and a four-person family with an income of less than $94,000 a year will qualify for subsidies to offset costs.\n\nMonroe County, home to the Florida Keys, had the highest average premiums for \u201csilver plans\u201d for all three groups of policyholders, as it did last year. In 2015, a 27-year-old individual in Monroe County will pay almost $370 a month for coverage in the \u201csilver\u201d plan without subsidies, while a 40-year-old couple with two children will pay almost $1,350 a month.\n\nGulf County in the Panhandle had the lowest average premiums for all three groups of policy holders. In 2015, a 27-year-old individual will pay on average $260 a month without subsidies, while a 40-year-old couple with two children will pay on average $952 a month in Gulf County.\n\nNearly 1 million Floridians signed up for health plans in the inaugural year of the law and 91 percent received a subsidy to help pay their monthly premiums.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
