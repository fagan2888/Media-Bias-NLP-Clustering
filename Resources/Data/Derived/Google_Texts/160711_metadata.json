Republicans in particular have worked to be more appealing to Latino voters, who have often swayed national elections into the favor of Democrats.\n\nBut Ms. Mark-Viverito urged those at the Latino Victory Project event not to take for granted headway made on issues she identified as important to their community, including the economy and healthcare.\n\n\u201cIn each of these issues, we\u2019ve seen what will happen if the wrong candidates get elected\u2014and it isn\u2019t pretty. On immigration, what\u2019s happened in Congress is a travesty,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito said, according to her prepared remarks. \u201cPolitical fear mongering has created such a toxic political environment that some called unaccompanied minors\u2014children\u2014\u2019diseased.\u2019 Or call humans \u2018illegal.\u2019 No human is illegal. It\u2019s a derogatory term that must be swept away.\u201d\n\nShe argued that GOP presidential candidates have also pushed a \u201cpro-deportation, anti-family agenda\u201d that she called \u2018inhumane.\u201d\n\nMs. Mark-Viverito pointed out that while Latinos are 17 percent of the population, they made up just 10 percent of the electorate in 2012\u2014with a voter turnout just about the same as in 2008.\n\n\u201cThis means for all the stories about a giant being awoken, we still have not fully roused from our slumber,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to immigration, Ms. Mark-Viverito highlighted income inequality\u2014saying net worth in Latino households dropped 14 percent from 2010 to 2013\u2014and healthcare as key priorities for Latino constituents. saying a rollback of the Affordable Care Act would be \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the stakes for Latinos as we look to 2016. For too long, our issues have been ignored, forgotten or disregarded. But no more. No puede ganar la Casa Blanca sin nosotros,\u201d she said in Spanish, before translating, \u201cYou can\u2019t win the White House without us. No candidates, no matter their background, should take us for granted next year.\u201d\n\nIn addition to loudly calling for immigration reform in Washington, the speaker has backed local measures like the municipal identification card program, IDNYC, and the ending of the city\u2019s cooperation with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Jillian Jorgensen", "sailthru.author": "Jillian Jorgensen", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80&w=640&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016, Immigration, immigration reform, latino victory project, Melissa Mark-Viverito, Puerto Rico, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "melissa mark-viverito, immigration, puerto rico, immigration reform, latino victory project, 2016, congress, mmv,", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "melissa mark-viverito, immigration, puerto rico, immigration reform, latino victory project, 2016, congress, mmv,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Citing Immigration \u2018Travesty\u2019 in Congress, Mark-Viverito Urges Latinos to Vote", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "jill-jorgensen", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito urged Latinos to get out to the polls in 2016 during a speech in her native Puerto Rico.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/jillianjorgensen-1-e1411581421359.jpg?quality=80&w=117", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "Jill_Jorgensen", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-03-13T22:41:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T22:54:45+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/jill-jorgensen"}, "sailthru.description": "Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito urged Latinos to get out to the polls in 2016 during a speech in her native Puerto Rico.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito urged Latinos to get out to the polls in 2016 during a speech in her native Puerto Rico.", "title": "Citing Immigration \u2018Travesty\u2019 in Congress, Mark-Viverito Urges Latinos to Vote", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/03/citing-immigration-travesty-in-congress-mark-viverito-urges-latinos-to-vote/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Jill Jorgensen is the Senior Politics Editor for the New York Observer. follow her on twitter: @Jill_Jorgensen", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-13 18:41:53", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/15421254345_3f67ff7328_z.jpg?quality=80"}, "article_summary": "Calling the current congressional impasse over immigration reform a \u201ctravesty,\u201d Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito urged Latinos to get out to the polls in 2016 during a speech in her native Puerto Rico.\nOn immigration, what\u2019s happened in Congress is a travesty,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito said, according to her prepared remarks.\nIn addition to immigration, Ms. Mark-Viverito highlighted income inequality\u2014saying net worth in Latino households dropped 14 percent from 2010 to 2013\u2014and healthcare as key priorities for Latino constituents.\nsaying a rollback of the Affordable Care Act would be \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\u201cThese are the stakes for Latinos as we look to 2016.\n\u201cThe truth is our influence has been felt and seen, but it has not truly been decisive,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito told the Latino Victory Project, a national group that advocates for Latino candidates and voices."}
