We do not claim him as a dependent.\n\nHe is a freelancer, and his income can vary month to month. For 2013, his income will be about $12,000. He estimates his income next year will range from $14,000 to $18,000.\n\nOn the exchange application, if he estimates his income to be $16,000 he is eligible to select a policy with a very good subsidy which makes his insurance affordable. If he estimates his income to be $15,000 he must sign up for Medicaid. But he really doesn\u2019t want to do that because his doctor doesn\u2019t take Medicaid.\n\nIf he estimates high and he doesn\u2019t make that amount, what happens with his subsidy?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe exchange clearly states that applicants should answer questions truthfully and that there may be implications for giving fraudulent information. However, projected income for 2014 is just that \u2014 projected. If the son estimated on the high side and enrolled in the non-Medicaid insurance, he would pay a monthly premium and any required out-of-pocket costs. It\u2019s possible there would be some tax refund/credit due him if his income doesn\u2019t rise to the estimated level, but given the income examples, it should be minimal.\n\nIf estimated income changes during the year, the son should update his account with the exchange. This is especially important if income increases because there may be a tax liability at the end of the year he received a higher tax credit amount than he was eligible for.\n\nChildren up to age 26 whose employer does offer coverage that meets the Affordable Care Act\u2019s standards for affordability and adequacy, however, wouldn\u2019t be eligible for subsidies on the exchange. Under the ACA, a plan is considered affordable if self-only coverage costs no more than 9.5 percent of a person\u2019s income, and adequate if it pays for at least 60 percent of covered medical expenses.\n\nIf a young person is claimed as a dependent and shops on the exchange, he or she will generally be eligible for subsidies only if coverage for an individual in the family\u2019s plan is considered unaffordable based on the family\u2019s income, and then only if the family\u2019s household income is between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Similarly, if the young person wishes to apply for Medicaid and lives in New York or another state that has expanded coverage, he or she would generally be eligible if the family\u2019s household income is less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nSources: Healthcare Access Team, St. Joseph\u2019s Neighborhood Center; Kaiser Family Foundation; New York state Department of Health.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1bSxR2e", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A young adult on his own may qualify for subsidies on the exchange.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "A young adult on his own may qualify for subsidies on the exchange.", "title": "Health care Q&A: How do you estimate income?", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2013/11/17/health-care-qa-how-do-you-estimate-income/3622791/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A young adult on his own may qualify for subsidies on the exchange.", "creator": "@DandC", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa77f3348ffc5d1a6fc7b108d152dd5dc1c3ac32/c=100-0-700-600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "title": "Health care Q&A: How do you estimate income?", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/New York", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/New York", "title": "Health care Q&A: How do you estimate income?", "author": "Staff reports", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d12e560710c0c5002fcfcba9b8bedd0f8343208b/c=175-0-625-600/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d804982f752b8153e6eb75436230efd1f0eb228/c=100-0-700-600/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a283460d0e7def1919a10d9c9eee2a2cdd57ee24/c=1-0-799-600/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68f30c51bf8c21dab09e0bcdd78823c22e752410/c=0-74-800-526&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-11-17T20:50:28-05:00", "shorthed": "Health care Q&A: How do you estimate income?", "articleid": 3622791, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad5946d00eb22b0c5d9837abdffc8cd7dc75dd07/c=0-74-800-526/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eadc57e727f4235427c9371dd0d23e1b7d484a86/c=232-0-568-600/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/11/17/qanda.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd827\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s possible there would be some tax refund/credit due him if his income doesn\u2019t rise to the estimated level, but given the income examples, it should be minimal.\nIf he estimates his income to be $15,000 he must sign up for Medicaid.\nHe estimates his income next year will range from $14,000 to $18,000.\nIf estimated income changes during the year, the son should update his account with the exchange.\nOn the exchange application, if he estimates his income to be $16,000 he is eligible to select a policy with a very good subsidy which makes his insurance affordable."}
