And Florida is a big part of that projection.\n\nThe report is due out later this month, but according to the executive summary, Florida is one of four states best positioned to legalize medical marijuana. John Kagia, director of industry analytics for New Frontier and an editor on the report, said he expects Florida\u2019s medical marijuana sales to hit $193 million in 2018.\n\n\u201cWhen the market is fully operational and the patient counts have grown, we anticipate that the Florida market will have grown to nearly 1.5 billion dollars by 2020,\u201d Kagia said.\n\nFlorida\u2019s older population will play a big role in that. That means there will be more patients with conditions like cancer that may turn to medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see a lot of interest within this population for using medical marijuana as an alternative to the conventional therapies they\u2019re using today,\u201d Kagia said.\n\nOne wild card? Reciprocity. If Florida goes the way of Nevada and allows certified medical marijuana patients from other states to purchase cannabis in Florida, there could be a medical marijuana tourist market as well. The report doesn\u2019t account for reciprocity.\n\nVoters will decide in November whether to legalize medical marijuana. Florida\u2019s legislature passed a narrow medical marijuana bill in 2014, but implementation has been delayed by lawsuits.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
