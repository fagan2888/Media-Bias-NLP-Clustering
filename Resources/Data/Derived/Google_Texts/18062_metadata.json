Nonetheless, abortion rights are certainly still up for vote. As Americans head to the polls on Tuesday, they\u2019ll help determine the future of reproductive health policy in several key states, as well as potentially across the country.\n\nFirst of all, voters in three states \u2014 Tennessee, Colorado, and North Dakota \u2014 will have the opportunity to vote directly on abortion rights. The issue is the subject of controversial ballot initiatives in those states; the anti-choice community will be dealt a significant victory if any of those measures succeed.\n\nThe measures in Colorado and North Dakota fit into the radical \u201cpersonhood\u201d movement that\u2019s seeking to define fetuses as people. Colorado\u2019s would update the state criminal code to include \u201cunborn human beings,\u201d while North Dakota\u2019s would amend the state constitution to protect \u201cthe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development.\u201d Meanwhile, Tennessee\u2019s ballot initiative would roll back the protections for reproductive rights that are currently in the state constitution, which would give lawmakers there an opportunity to further restrict the procedure.\n\nThe latest polling indicates that the measure in Colorado will likely be defeated. The vote is expected to be much closer in Tennessee and North Dakota, where large portions of voters remain undecided.\n\nAnd even in the states where abortion isn\u2019t on the ballot, voters will still indirectly affect the issue depending who they elect on a local level. More than 6,000 state legislative seats are up for election this year. As Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff points out, those seats may have the greatest practical influence on women\u2019s reproductive rights, since abortion is largely restricted on a state level while Roe v. Wade still stands.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the recent evidence illustrating how much these races matter. The 2010 election, during which Republicans picked up hundreds of legislative seats and essentially took over the states, ushered in a new era of harsh anti-abortion laws. Between 2010 and 2013, more abortion restrictions were enacted than during the entire previous decade. The successful advancement of an indirect strategy known as the Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP, has forced dozens of clinics to close over the past three years. If voters keep electing right-wing state lawmakers who oppose abortion, those trends will continue.\n\nPlus, on a national level, Republicans are expected to take control of the U.S. Senate, and women\u2019s health advocates are concerned about the types of anti-choice legislation a GOP-dominated Congress could force through. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a 20-week abortion ban last fall, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) \u2014 who is expected to become the majority leader \u2014 has already promised that legislation will be one of his top priorities.\n\n\u201cWe are taking very seriously the threat that Mitch McConnell has repeated, that he is eager to take on the 20-week ban,\u201d Donna Crane, the vice president for policy at NARAL Pro-Choice America, recently told RH Reality Check.\n\nAlthough President Obama can veto the abortion restrictions that come to his desk, some reproductive rights experts are concerned that the GOP may attach an anti-abortion bill to a larger piece of must-pass legislation, like a bill to avert a government shutdown.\n\nAnd even aside from legislation, GOP advances in Congress could have a big influence on whether stringent abortion laws are enforced, since the party that controls the Senate also controls judicial appointments. A GOP-controlled Senate could prevent the president from confirming any additional progressive judges, which could tip the political landscape of the courts further in favor of Republicans. As demonstrated by the deeply conservative U.S. Circuit of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which recently allowed an extremely harsh abortion law to take effect in Texas, conservative courts are not necessarily sympathetic to arguments about women\u2019s eroding access to abortion.\n\nThis is exactly why Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm launched its largest campaign offensive ever this election season, attempting to influence the outcome of key races in favor of abortion rights. Many Democrats have also adopted the group\u2019s framing, speaking out about why it\u2019s important to protect women\u2019s health.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether those messages will be successful in mobilizing pro-choice voters.
