And that\u2019s the kind of debate I think I\u2019m furthering as I go around the country speaking.\u201d\n\nClinton, who's considering another presidential bid, is currently in Europe promoting her new book, \"Hard Choices.\"\n\nSupreme Court rulings, immigration\n\nDays after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of family owned Hobby Lobby - which protested the federal mandate requiring certain employees cover contraceptives in health care plans - the high court angered many Democrats again, letting Wheaton College avoid the mandate, as well.\n\nClinton called the latest development \u201ca serious breach of a woman\u2019s right,\u201d and urged Washington to take action.\n\n\"There has to be some action taken, in the Congress or by the executive to try to clarify what the court just did,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the situation at the border involving an influx of immigrant children trying to get into the United States, Clinton said they should not be allowed to stay in the country.\n\n\u201cIf they do make it they cannot believe they have any opportunity to stay. They have to be processed appropriately and then returned,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton said Friday she's donated her speaking fees from colleges and universities over the past year and a half to her family's foundation.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Hillary Clinton weighs in on speaking fees, Supreme Court rulings", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/07/04/hillary-clinton-weighs-in-on-speaking-fees-supreme-court-rulings/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140321182633-hillary-clinton-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton said Friday she's donated her speaking fees from colleges and universities over the past year and a half to her family's foundation.", "title": "Hillary Clinton weighs in on speaking fees, Supreme Court rulings"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "2016, hillary clinton, immigration, supreme court, cnn's ashley killough", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf829\"", "article_summary": "Speaking fees donatedAmid criticism about her personal wealth and the sky-high speaking fees she collects from colleges, Clinton said \"all of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work.\"\n2 years ago(CNN) - Hillary Clinton said Friday she's donated her speaking fees from colleges and universities over the past year and a half to her family's foundation.\nA Clinton aide told CNN last week that the UNLV speaking fee would go to the Clinton Foundation, not to the former first lady directly.\nBut her comments in the ABC News interview go further in saying that she's donated all university speaking fees to her family's organization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my experience,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cThat they\u2019re not worried about my speaking or my household, they\u2019re worried about their own."}
