Many foods on offer were high in salt (ham, cheese, salted crackers, etc.), so those who ate them naturally ended up buying a lot of beer.\n\nIn his 1966 sci-fi novel, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Robert Heinlein used this practice in a saloon on the moon to highlight an economic principle:\n\n\u201cIt was when you insisted that the, uh, young lady, Tish\u2014that Tish must pay, too. \u2018Tone-stopple,\u2019 or something like it.\u201d \u201cOh, \u2018tanstaa\ufb02.\u2019 Means \u2018There ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch.\u2019 And isn\u2019t,\u201d I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room, \u201cor these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless.\u201d \u201cAn interesting philosophy.\u201d \u201cNot philosophy, fact. One way or other, what you get, you pay for.\u201d\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cthere ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch\u201d didn\u2019t originate with Heinlein, he did help to popularize the concept. It\u2019s an important economic concept that is often overlooked, particularly when it comes to policy issues. A couple of years ago, in regards to, when Obamacare, economist Thomas Sowell asked, \u201cdo you seriously believe that millions more people can be given medical care and vast new bureaucracies created to administer payment for it, with no additional costs?\u201d\n\nJust as there is no free lunch, there is no free red tape. Bureaucrats have to eat, just like everyone else, and they need a place to live and some other amenities. How do you suppose the price of medical care can go down when the costs of new government bureaucracies are added to the costs of the medical treatment itself? By the way, where are the extra doctors going to come from, to treat the millions of additional patients? Training more people to become doctors is not free. Politicians may ignore costs but ignoring those costs will not make them go away. With bureaucratically controlled medical care, you are going to need more doctors, just to treat a given number of patients, because time that is spent filling out government forms is time that is not spent treating patients. And doctors have the same 24 hours in the day as everybody else. When you add more patients to more paperwork per patient, you are talking about still more costs. How can that lower medical costs? But although that may be impossible, politics is the art of the impossible. All it takes is rhetoric and a public that does not think beyond the rhetoric they hear.\n\nRead more . . .", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was once a common practice of saloons in America to provide a \u201cfree lunch\u201d to patrons who had purchased at least one drink.
