Suzanne Bonamici.\n\nSo they handed her an Xbox controller.\n\nBut the Oregon Democrat wasn\u2019t there to play video games. The controller operated the giant robot the students used in competitions earlier this year, and Bonamici tried her hand at using it to shoot flying discs through a goal.\n\n\u201cIt was so fun,\u201d Bonamici said of the demonstration. She was visiting Glencoe to talk to students about STEM \u2013 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 education and learn about what they\u2019re doing in Glencoe\u2019s classrooms.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space and Technology and Committee on Education and the Workforce, Bonamici hopes to use Glencoe\u2019s example to persuade lawmakers to prioritize federal dollars for education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really helpful to be able to talk about specific examples of how these programs engage students,\u201d she said.\n\nShe asked the robotics students how their high school careers would be different without the program, and the general consensus was that the hands-on work has taught them more about design, machinery, communication and teamwork than a traditional classroom experience ever could.\n\nChris Steiner, an engineering teacher who helped launch Glencoe\u2019s robotics team last year, said he and his students were excited to show Bonamici their work and hoped to influence the conversation about STEM funding in schools with constrained budgets.\n\n\u201cWe have an expressed interest in meeting elected officials,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cTo have a U.S. congresswoman here who is active in science subcommittees is a great opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nSteen Smith, a senior with the robotics team, said being able to meet Bonamici was \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means we\u2019re getting noticed. \u2026 It means our team is doing something right,\u201d he said.\n\nBonamici then visited Glencoe teacher Peter Schmurr\u2019s digital electronics class, where more robotics students were designing smaller robots \u2013 one could hang itself from a metal bar, and another could detect which of a series of buckets was equipped with an \u201cinfrared beacon\u201d and drop a block into that bucket. The students designed the robots themselves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to focus on design, not to parrot what other people have done,\u201d Schmurr said, adding that Bonamici had just missed a 45-minute, student-led discussion about circuitry design.\n\nThe appearance wasn\u2019t all STEM-related. Bonamici\u2019s final visit was with Glencoe\u2019s student government, whose students asked her about what working in Washington, D.C. is like. She was candid, talking on such topics as the new Common Core State Standards (which she likes, though has some worries about a possible overemphasis on testing) and the \u201crocky\u201d implementation of the Affordable Care Act in recent months.\n\nThere were even some student journalists on hand to cover the event, Anisha Datta and Lorena Colcer, the senior co-editors of the Glencoe Crimson Times, had notebooks out throughout Bonamici\u2019s appearance.\n\nIt was the second visit this fall to a Hillsboro high school by a member of Congress. Sen. Ron Wyden spoke to Century High students last month in the wake of the government shutdown.\n\n-- Luke Hammill\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hillsboro school district,suzanne bonamici", "title": "Rep.
