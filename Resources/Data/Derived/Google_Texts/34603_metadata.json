Loudon walked right into the rhetorical hypocrisy in saying she believed that the government had no business being in the doctor\u2019s examination room, treatment is a private matter, and should be between a patient and her doctor, and so on.\n\nThen Jason asked Ms. Loudon if she was pro-choice. She stammered, \u201cIt depends on what issue you\u2019re talking about.\u201d And then tried to assert a \u2018right to life\u2019 in the Constitution. (Funny how most conservatives don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a right to life when talking about convicted criminals though\u2026 Or a right to life for children and adults who can\u2019t afford health care.) Anyway, click on over to John\u2019s post if you want to see the Jason Jones video. It\u2019s a classic.\n\nFar-right conservatives deliberately conflate abortion and contraception\n\nI\u2019m coming at this post from the abortion-angle in particular because conservatives (Republicans, fundamentalists, ConservaDems) just love to conflate abortion with contraception and family planning. Then they use their opposition to abortion, on what they feel are moral grounds, also to oppose the right of women to control what happens to our bodies.\n\nIncluding whether or not we get preggers in the first place.\n\n// // //\n\nAs I\u2019ve remarked before, it\u2019s not enough for them to say we can\u2019t have abortions \u2014 whether medically necessary or by choice \u2014 we\u2019re also not really supposed to do anything that would interfere with any man\u2019s sperm fertilizing an egg inside our bodies. Even if that sperm was introduced by rape or incest, or if that resulting pregnancy will endanger our lives.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not even a fertilized egg that has more rights than we do. The sperm cell does.\n\nThink about that: According to the radical right, a rapist\u2019s sperm cell has more rights than women do.\n\nAnd they accuse Uncle Sam of invading my gynecological personal space? Uncle Sam\u2019s got nothing on these guys.\n\nThe far-right lies constantly about contraception and women\u2019s reproduction\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re dealing with a nearly endless barrage of lies and deliberate misinformation whenever the radical (often religious) right talks about contraception (or any issue really):\n\nRush Limbaugh describing contraceptive medication as if it\u2019s something women take every time we have sex. (The pill form is usually taken daily, regardless of sexy-time plans. I\u2019m not going to bother linking anything because it\u2019s self-evident to anyone who isn\u2019t an ignorant misogynist.)\n\n\u201cPlan B is actually an abortion pill.\u201d (No, it\u2019s not. It prevents ovulation, and if an egg has been released, prevents fertilization. While it does affect the uterus lining, it won\u2019t prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. This is why it needs to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. It will not cause an abortion if the woman is already pregnant.)\n\n\u201cHormonal contraceptives cause cancer.\u201d (They don\u2019t. There\u2019s a slight increase in risk of breast cancer, but significantly reduced chances for cervical and uterine cancer.)\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is essentially an abortion mill.\u201d (No. Abortion services are 3% of what they do. Contraception is 35% \u2014 which makes me wonder if that isn\u2019t the real objection of the radical right.)\n\n\u201cContraceptives make it harder to get pregnant after stopping them.\u201d (Nope. It\u2019s possible to get pregnant in the very next cycle after stopping, and a return to full fertility is usually reached within six months max.)\n\n\u201cContraception is an entirely new thing.\u201d (Actually, condoms date back at least to the middle 1600s. And women have been using herbs for millennia. We\u2019ve just become more scientific about it.)\n\n\u201cWomen taking birth control causes prostate cancer in men.\u201d (Another lie.)\n\n\u201cWomen who don\u2019t have sex don\u2019t need contraceptive medication.\u201d (Not true. A mere 42% of women use it only for that reason.)\n\nAnd of course: \u201cWomen can\u2019t get pregnant from rape.\u201d (5% of rapes result in pregnancy. Roughly the same rate for any woman of fertile age having unprotected, unplanned sex.)\n\nHalf the time, it seems like we\u2019re reduced to fighting a defensive war against these outright falsehoods, 24/7.\n\nWhy publicly supported family planning services are essential for women\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, whose mission statement is, \u201cadvancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research, policy analysis, and public education,\u201d just came out with a video. In just 3.5 minutes, it does a fantastic job of explaining why publicly supported family planning services are essential. Not just for women, but for society in general.\n\nA few of the highlights:\n\nContraceptive and reproductive health services help women avoid well over two million unplanned pregnancies each year.\n\nAn estimated 760,000 of those pregnancies would otherwise result in abortions, pushing the current abortion rate 2/3 higher than it is now.\n\nFamily planning enables parents to space out the births of their kids, resulting in healthier mothers and children, both.\n\nHelping low-income women avoid unplanned pregnancies saves $5.68 in Medicaid costs for every dollar invested. (Isn\u2019t keeping people off of public assistance a conservative goal?)\n\nFor many women, places like Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s health clinics are their entry point to receiving healthcare at all \u2014 including preventive health screening for cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, and much more.\n\nMedicaid, family planning funding, and Title X programs are facing relentless cuts and attacks from the radical right.\n\nClose to seven million low-income women are at risk of losing this vital social safety net due to far-right anti-woman ideology.\n\nAccess to contraception reduces abortions. There is no rational debate about this, no arguments save those which deny facts and reality.\n\nAbstinence-only sex ed has been proven time and time again not to work at all. (It reminds me of the old joke I grew up with, raised Irish Roman Catholic as I was: What\u2019s the other name for the Rhythm Method? A new baby once every year.)\n\nAccess to contraceptive medication enables young women to finish their educations and to get good jobs. It also makes it more possible for us to serve our country in the armed forces, where an unplanned pregnancy could really be a problem.\n\nThe difference between having an unplanned pregnancy when 18 and unmarried should be obvious when compared to having that baby a few years later, after college, settled down, employed and married, etc. The planned family will, in most cases, be far better off than the unplanned one. It\u2019s also obviously better for the kids.\n\nIt bears repeating: Access to contraception results in fewer abortions. Family planning results in healthier women and children. It also results in more stable and prosperous families.\n\n\n\nThe fact these pro-family goals are not priorities for the conservative far right is telling.\n\nI myself come from an extended family where unplanned pregnancies \u2014 including the health-threatening one that resulted in me \u2014 were the norm, not the exception. Another family member unwisely ended up in a horrible marriage to a drug addict as a result of an unplanned pregnancy (due entirely because contraception wasn\u2019t used, not even a condom). Why? She was 19 and had no job, no prospects, and had been still living in her parents\u2019 house. She\u2019s okay now, but those were hellish years of abuse and poverty. The S.O.B. even sold the family groceries to support his addiction.\n\nAs good Roman Catholics, my parents didn\u2019t believe in contraception or abortion either. My folks argued most often about money, and I know it was in large part because while affording to raise two kids would\u2019ve been a challenge, four was a whole lot harder.\n\nBeing able to control how and when we get pregnant is a health issue for women\n\nBeing able to control how and when we get pregnant is a health issue for women. It\u2019s a vital economic issue for us. It\u2019s also an issue of personal freedom and privacy. The right to control what goes on in our bodies is one of the core pillars of women\u2019s liberation in modern times.\n\nPersonally, people can argue back and forth on the abortion issue, although I know where I stand: I am 100% in favor of women\u2019s right to choose what happens to our bodies. Pro-Choice. I support a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion; I also support her right to choose not to have one. I further support the idea that access to healthcare should be considered a fundamental civil right for everyone. There\u2019s actually a good chance that known, guaranteed access to healthcare might convince more than a few pregnant women they can actually cope with an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nYet the far right is opposed to this. I can see no other reason than a desire to make a woman\u2019s unplanned pregnancy as painful, unpleasant, and dangerous as possible. To punish her.\n\nTo me, the right to use contraception is a no-brainer. Plus yes, I do feel that preventing a pregnancy in the first place is morally preferable to ending one.\n\nWhat am I against? Well, for one, I\u2019m definitely against panels of men forcing their misogynistic, patronizing decisions on us. Like this one.\n\nEvery time a man wants to mandate a medically unnecessary trans-vaginal ultrasound for women, I want to mandate a required manual digital prostate exam for any male who wants a Viagra prescription. For his own safety, of course. Plus a two-visit minimum and a 48 hour waiting period. And a ban on insurance coverage for it. Plus he should have to look at photos that graphically show the physical dangers of uncontrolled priapsis. (I\u2019ll spare you the links.)\n\nIf there\u2019s one assertion the radical fundamentalist right likes to make that needs absolute refutation, it\u2019s that using contraception is intrinsically morally wrong. There is no non-religious philosophical or ethical justification for this position, unless one posits that a sperm cell and an unfertilized egg cell actually have more civil rights than the adult woman they happen to be inside.\n\nThat the mere potential that an egg might be fertilized is of greater value than the actuality of an adult woman and her life and health.\n\nWriting in Esquire back in July, Charles Pierce astutely notes how the real target of the far-right conservatives isn\u2019t abortion. It\u2019s the right women have been enjoying since 1965: To be able to have sex without the risk of unplanned pregnancy. The right not to fear our own bodies.\n\nThe simple fact is that American women have a right that these people do not want them to have. Period. (That right is based in a right to privacy that most of these people believe is at best a constitutional confection and, at worst, an outright lie. The target always has been Griswold, not Roe.) They do not want that right exercised and they will do anything they can to keep it from being exercised, and they absolutely\u2026will\u2026not\u2026stop.\n\nI agree. The goal, as I\u2019ve said many times, isn\u2019t to protect unborn fetuses \u2014 because if that was the goal, pre- and post-natal healthcare would be an absolute civil right. As would pediatric care.\n\nNo, the goal is to punish women for having sex. To force us into positions of dependence and submission. To ensure that the consequences of sex \u2014 whether it was invited or compelled through violence \u2014 remain entirely upon us.\n\nThere are women who need contraceptive medication for health reasons totally unrelated to avoiding pregnancy \u2014 I was one of them. There are those who need to take it because a pregnancy could kill them. And yes, there are those of us who simply want a choice over whether we get pregnant or not, but be able also to engage in normal, natural, human sexual activity. Quite frankly, if non-reproductive sex wasn\u2019t natural, women wouldn\u2019t be sexually receptive throughout our monthly reproductive cycles and even after menopause.\n\nSimply telling women \u201cdon\u2019t have sex\u201d isn\u2019t an answer. And family planning is only \u201cmorally wrong\u201d according to certain patriarchist religions, not all of them.\n\nAs far as that creepy \u201cgyno-rape Uncle Sam\u201d anti-Obamacare ad goes, I prefer this version \u2013 though someone ought to do a version of the ad where John Boehner, or Ken Cuccinelli, pops up between your legs.
