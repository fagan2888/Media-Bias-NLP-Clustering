Yet their leadership has dismissed the idea as a suicide mission that could squander the recent gains.\n\nOne thing that will prove popular among the base is a commitment by Senator Mitch McConnell, the presumptive new majority leader, to bring up a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which he is expected to do next year.\n\nWhether the party can reconcile more demands of its base with the will of its leadership could determine how enduring the Republican Senate majority will be. The crop of senators up for re-election in 2016 includes those elected in the first Tea Party wave of 2010. And in a sign of what is at stake, even some of them are sounding notes of compromise and caution that would have been unthinkable at the height of the right\u2019s resurgence.\n\n\u201cI understand the frustrations of the conservative base; I am one of them,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of the original class of Tea Party-inspired senators. \u201cI also recognize reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to pass the entire conservative agenda tomorrow. We can certainly lay it out,\u201d Mr. Johnson added. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the things we can pass. Doesn\u2019t that make more sense?\u201d\n\nBut in a stark reminder of the difficulties Republican leaders will face from within their own ranks, other lawmakers popular with the Tea Party base are saying the fight is on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs votes were still being counted on election night Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said Republicans could still work through Congress to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 even though the president is guaranteed to veto anything Congress passes that undermines it. \u201cAfter winning a historic majority, it is incumbent on us to honor promises and do everything humanly possible to stop Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview.\n\nSome Republican senators rejected that outright. \u201cThere are intelligent things to do, and there are some not-so-intelligent things to do,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah. \u201cAnd one of the first things we should do is find some areas of common ground with our Democrat friends.\u201d\n\nTea Party conservatives, many of whom argue that the government shutdown last year was a sound strategy, said they were baffled by remarks after the election by Mr. McConnell that the Senate under his control would prioritize policies that Republicans knew Democrats would also support.\n\nMany also fumed when Mr. McConnell stated the obvious: Republicans do not have the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act because they cannot override a presidential veto on their own. (It takes 67 votes to do so; they have 52 seats now, with the possibility of picking up two more.) The next day, he and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal insisting that, indeed, repeal remained a goal.\n\nAny perception that Mr. McConnell is not sufficiently committed to repealing the health care law, despite his running hard against it in his own re-election campaign, would renew the same fissures among Republicans that preceded the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThat would cause a civil war inside the Republican Party,\u201d said Richard Viguerie, a longtime conservative activist, referring to anything the party\u2019s base saw as a halfhearted attempt at repeal. \u201cThere\u2019s almost zero trust between the base and the Republican leaders.\u201d\n\nNo one did more to demoralize Tea Party candidates and conservative agitators than Mr. McConnell, who vowed to \u201ccrush\u201d every Republican primary challenger. (He did; none defeated an incumbent senator.) He also blacklisted Republicans who worked with groups supporting insurgents.\n\nPrivately, McConnell aides say they are less concerned these days about the impact of senators like Mr. Cruz, whom they describe as an \u201carmy of one.\u201d Mr. McConnell believes his standing with conservative voters is solid. And he has the votes to prove it. He won his own primary over a Tea Party conservative, 60 percent to 35 percent. An NBC News/Marist College poll showed him beating his main primary opponent 53 percent to 33 percent among Tea Party voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and his allies dismiss their Tea Party opponents as \u201cfor-profit conservatives\u201d because of the fund-raising they do in the name of purifying the Republican brand.\n\n\u201cThe for-profit wing of the Republican Party will always have a voice, but after this last election, they don\u2019t have much credibility,\u201d said Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s senior political strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not sure many folks will listen to it much longer. Governing still matters, and the good news is, everybody who was elected is into governing.\u201d\n\nMost of the Republicans just elected to the Senate appear to be team players. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Steve Daines of Montana are all low-key members of Congress. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is the speaker of the State House and a favorite of the party establishment.\n\nStill, Tea Party conservatives are a formidable voting bloc. Mr. McConnell will have to negotiate an especially cautious balance between their demands and those of the senators in his conference who are contemplating running for president in 2016, and so need the support of the party\u2019s base. With no one is this more fraught than Mr. McConnell\u2019s fellow Kentuckian, Senator Rand Paul. Mr. Paul and his advisers say that they recognize Tea Party supporters helped deliver the Senate for the Republicans, and that the party ignores them at its peril.\n\n\u201cThey showed up,\u201d said Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Mr. Paul. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at the turnout models, the polling pre-election and the results, and not think that conservatives showed up for this. They did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141108182958, "twitter": {"description": "As Republicans on Capitol Hill move from being the opposition party to being one that has to show it can govern, a powerful tension is emerging between its establishment and its activist wing.", "title": "With Fear of Being Sidelined, Tea Party Sees the Republican Rise as New Threat", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/us/politics/before-battling-democrats-gop-is-fighting-itself-.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003224728"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jwpetersNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/09/us/JP-REPUBS/JP-REPUBS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/us/politics/before-battling-democrats-gop-is-fighting-itself-.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003224728", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/us/politics/before-battling-democrats-gop-is-fighting-itself-.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 8, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Judicial Watch", "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack,Republican Party,Judicial Watch,Midterm Elections (2014),McConnell  Mitch,Tea Party Movement", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jeremy W.
