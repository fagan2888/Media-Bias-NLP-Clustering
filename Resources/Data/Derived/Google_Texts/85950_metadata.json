This year, dermatologists, at 65%, were the most satisfied, followed by oncologists (59%) and psychiatrists (58%). Dermatologists have consistently led in career satisfaction over the past five annual compensation reports. Gary Goldenberg, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, offered a reason for this. \"I believe it's because our patients tend to do well with treatment. We are also on the forefront of early detection and skin cancer prevention.\" At the bottom were nephrologists (47%), internists (48%), endocrinologists (49%), and allergists (49%). Their satisfaction rankings using these criteria appeared to have little to do with their earnings rank. Dermatologists are third in earnings, but oncologists and psychiatrists fall somewhere in the middle of the pack. And among the three groups least unsatisfied, only endocrinologists were among the lowest three in earnings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost 19,000 physicians in 25 specialties described their income, career satisfaction, hours worked, and whether they\u2019d go into medicine again.", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Dermatologists have consistently led in career satisfaction over the past five annual compensation reports.\nAt the bottom were nephrologists (47%), internists (48%), endocrinologists (49%), and allergists (49%).\nTo determine the level of general career satisfaction, Medscape averaged the percentage of physicians who again would choose medicine as a career, those who again would choose their specialty, and those who thought they were fairly compensated.\nDermatologists are third in earnings, but oncologists and psychiatrists fall somewhere in the middle of the pack.\nThis year, dermatologists, at 65%, were the most satisfied, followed by oncologists (59%) and psychiatrists (58%)."}
