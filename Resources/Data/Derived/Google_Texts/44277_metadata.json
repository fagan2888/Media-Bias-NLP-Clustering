The result is a missed opportunity\u2014both for nations and local places but also tech companies, which may be losing out on the powerful synergies of co-located innovation and growth.\n\nHowever, a recent workshop I led at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee suggested there may be another way. Populated by two dozen technology, business and regional economic-development leaders, the session probed the question of what factors allow tech growth to occur near tech innovation. Several insights emerged:\n\nThe local ecosystem matters intensely. Even though decisions about where and how to scale up technology innovations are made entirely by individual firms with often a national or global perspective, key local factors matter\u2014and can tip the decision. Local cities or metro areas can become compelling platforms on which to grow as well as innovate if they assemble the right assets, talent, infrastructure and networks.\n\nLocal leaders need to listen to the customer. To have a chance to hold on to the commercialization of innovation, places need to understand what tech companies (whether software- or hardware-oriented) really need to stay put with growth. In almost all cases, the need begins with an adequate pool of relevantly trained technical workers, whether software developers or IT-literature machine operators. But it also often includes responsive, practical, scale-up oriented laboratory or university units ready to work on industrial process questions, siting issues or specialized training topics. Would-be scale-up regions need to learn and provide what would allow innovations to stay home and to do that they need to ask the firms\u2014again and again.\n\nAuthenticity and true relevance are essential. Ultimately, generic pitches and programs won\u2019t cut it. Tech and advanced manufacturing companies will scale up wherever they can achieve critical, specific objectives. If that place lies near the research center or university out of which their intellectual property came, then they will scale up there. If it doesn\u2019t, they won\u2019t. Which is why local places won\u2019t be able to fake it. To the extent their technical competencies, labor force, cluster attributes and supply chains are truly relevant, growth will occur close to home.\n\nThe upshot: Regions very much can \u201cmake innovation sticky\u201d\u2014that is, more likely to be locally commercialized. However, success will depend on making sure the local ecosystem caters to what tech companies actually want and need.\n\nMark Muro (@markmuro1) is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the policy director of the Metropolitan Policy Program there.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "MARK MURO: Regional tech leaders and city economic-development people keep asking: How can we keep more of the beneficial growth of homegrown innovation gains local?", "title": "How Cities Can Capitalize on Local Tech Innovation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/10/16/how-cities-can-capitalize-on-local-tech-innovation/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS298_CITIES_P_20151012094833.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "How Cities Can Capitalize on Local Tech Innovation", "description": "MARK MURO: Regional tech leaders and city economic-development people keep asking: How can we keep more of the beneficial growth of homegrown innovation gains local?", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "MARK MURO: Regional tech leaders and city economic-development people keep asking: How can we keep more of the beneficial growth of homegrown innovation gains local?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-10-16T10:00:10-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/10/16/how-cities-can-capitalize-on-local-tech-innovation/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-6312", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "MARK MURO: Regional tech leaders and city economic-development people keep asking: How can we keep more of the beneficial growth of homegrown innovation gains local?", "title": "How Cities Can Capitalize on Local Tech Innovation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/10/16/how-cities-can-capitalize-on-local-tech-innovation/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS298_CITIES_P_20151012094833.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-6312", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-16T11:20:14-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccce9\"", "article_summary": "Populated by two dozen technology, business and regional economic-development leaders, the session probed the question of what factors allow tech growth to occur near tech innovation.\nHowever, success will depend on making sure the local ecosystem caters to what tech companies actually want and need.\nThe result is a missed opportunity\u2014both for nations and local places but also tech companies, which may be losing out on the powerful synergies of co-located innovation and growth.\nISTOCKMARK MURO: Regional tech leaders and city economic-development people keep asking: How can we keep more of the beneficial growth of homegrown innovation gains local?\nTo have a chance to hold on to the commercialization of innovation, places need to understand what tech companies (whether software- or hardware-oriented) really need to stay put with growth."}
