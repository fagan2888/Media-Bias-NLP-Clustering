(AP) - Chris Mintz spent a good half hour flexing one of the muscles he can still use at the moment: his right hand.\n\nThe 30-year-old U.S. Army veteran, confined to a wheelchair after he confronted the gunman at Umpqua Community College on Oct. 1, made a surprise appearance at the kickoff of a two-day memorial concert at Stewart Park. He was dressed in casual gray sweatpants and a hoodie while shaking hands with armed servicemen and women, concert-goers and musicians who poured on their thanks and well-wishes.\n\nIn spite of the tragedy that spotlighted Mintz\u2019s heroics in the first place, he was optimistic. He was shot five times that day - in both legs, his abdomen, his shoulder blade and his finger. Before the incident, he had been seen taking citywide jogs throughout Roseburg.\n\n\u201cSoon enough you\u2019ll see me running again,\u201d he said as he shook a soldier\u2019s hand.\n\nIt was a somber beginning for the Umpqua Strong Music Festival, a two-day event that hosted more than 20 bands hailing from all over Oregon and California. One hundred percent of the donations made at the free concert were given to the UCC Strong Fund. Roseburg residents Brody Jansen and the band Crossroads to Jericho performed original music, and covers of popular tunes were also performed throughout the day.\n\nA food stand offered up complementary hot dogs and soda. Another table featured a silent auction for items like a football signed by Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman and a specially made electronic snare drum, customized with the UCC\u2019s green and white school colors.\n\nThe festival started with performances from the North Umpqua Violin Quartet and the Northern Oregon Scottish Bagpipe Band; the latter of which filled the already gloomy morning with heavy-hearted tones in a tribute to the shooting victims.\n\n\u201cOct. 1 changed a lot of things for a lot of people,\u201d said Matt Stubbs, a firefighter from Drain who helped organize the music festival. \u201cBefore, were just people going to our jobs every day, going home to our families, spending time with our kids - doing our everyday functions. And this brought our community so much closer together.\u201d\n\nJust before the concert formally started, representatives from the U.S. Army presented Mintz with a \u201cWarrior Certificate of Appreciation.\u201d Cpt. Brent Heller spoke of Mintz\u2019s heroics and said his actions represented the values of the army, the country \u201cand humanity itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the face of a ruthless, deadly and premeditated threat, your complete disregard for your safety in an effort to save others is worthy of the highest commendation,\u201d Heller said.\n\nTwo American flags were held high around the site: one large flag hoisted by the ladder of a large fire engine and another, attached to a scissor lift next to the stage, which was carried into the air during the North Umpqua Violin Quartet\u2019s rendition of the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner.\u201d A third flag, the American flag that flew over the campus the morning of the shooting, was retired by the local Veterans of Foreign Wars. The flag was folded ten times in the retirement - a fold for each of the nine victims and one for the community itself.\n\nThe event itself was organized through that tenth fold. Stubbs, 36, neither attended UCC nor knew anyone who was directly affected by the shooting, yet he felt compelled to start something to help the victims and the community itself. The concert began as a Facebook event on Oct. 4, but gained momentum and turned into a two-day festival.\n\nWhen asked what drove him to get involved, Stubbs said, \u201cWhy not? Ever have something reach out and grab a hold of you that you just can\u2019t explain? And no matter which way you look at it and no matter how hard you fight it, you just can\u2019t figure out why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing? Why not?\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News-Review, http://www.nrtoday.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Mintz spent a good half hour flexing one of the muscles he can still use at the moment: his right hand.", "Author": "TROY BRYNELSON", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Chris Mintz spent a good half hour flexing one of the muscles he can still use at the moment: his right hand.", "title": "Chris Mintz honored at Umpqua Strong Music Festival", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/1/chris-mintz-honored-at-umpqua-strong-music-festiva/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/01/f25933da75252430860f6a706700529a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/01/f25933da75252430860f6a706700529a.jpg", "title": "Chris Mintz honored at Umpqua Strong Music Festival", "description": "Chris Mintz spent a good half hour flexing one of the muscles he can still use at the moment: his right hand.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "It was a somber beginning for the Umpqua Strong Music Festival, a two-day event that hosted more than 20 bands hailing from all over Oregon and California.\n1 changed a lot of things for a lot of people,\u201d said Matt Stubbs, a firefighter from Drain who helped organize the music festival.\nThe concert began as a Facebook event on Oct. 4, but gained momentum and turned into a two-day festival.\nROSEBURG, Ore.
