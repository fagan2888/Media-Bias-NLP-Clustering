Mark Warner , center, needed rural Virginia voters to support him when he ran for governor in 2001. That may not be true in this year\u2019s Senate race. ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 Turkey hunting, NASCAR and a bluegrass campaign ditty: not the most obvious path to the governor\u2019s mansion for a multimillionaire raised in Connecticut. Yet it worked for Mark R. Warner, running in Virginia in 2001, and still looks like a stroke of genius to many an admiring Democrat.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Steve Jarding, manager of that campaign, to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t geniuses at all. We were desperate,\u201d Jarding said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to get votes in Southside and all of rural Virginia or we weren\u2019t going to win.\u201d\n\nToday, as Warner seeks a second term in the U.S. Senate in a deeply changed Virginia, rural voters are not nearly as receptive to Democrats as they used to be \u2014 and Democrats no longer need them.\n\nExplosive population growth in the Washington suburbs and near-stagnant rural numbers have allowed other Democrats \u2014 President Obama, U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2014 to win with little support outside of Northern Virginia and other urban centers.\n\nView Graphic Virginia Democrats banking on urban voters\n\nAll of which helps explain how a man who long ago branded himself a \u201cradical centrist\u201d found himself on a debate stage this summer celebrating gay marriage, injecting abortion and birth control into the discussion, and pushing for a higher minimum wage. Warner even went after his opponent, former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, for avoiding taking a position on climate change.\n\nIn other words, Virginia has changed so much that Mark Warner has changed, too.\n\nPartisan shift in approach\n\nWarner has not executed a dramatic about-face so much as he has begun weaving bits of highly partisan flash into his old, more moderate appeal.\n\nHe continues to sell himself as a pragmatic, bipartisan dealmaker focused on economic development. On a spin through Southside Virginia this week, he talked up the ways he has disagreed with Obama \u2014 such as his support for letting Virginia open up its coastline to offshore drilling for oil and natural gas.\n\nAnd when Warner met Gillespie for their first debate at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia late last month, the Democrat made his usual overtures toward rural Virginians, with lots of mentions of moderate positions on energy, federal spending and foreign affairs.\n\nBut with just three minutes left in the question-and-answer segment, in the middle of a discussion on same-sex marriage (which Gillespie opposes and Warner has publicly supported since early 2013), the Democrat sharply pivoted to abortion and birth control.\n\nWarner said Gillespie, who opposes abortion in most cases, would seek to ban not only abortion but also \u201ccertain common forms of contraception.\u201d\n\nThen-Virginia Gov. Mark Warner waves a checkered flag as he and NASCAR chief executive George Pyne, center right, rally with NASCAR supporters in Richmond. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\n\u201cI respect women\u2019s reproductive health. He would vote to repeal Roe v. Wade,\u201d Warner said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Warner also said Gillespie supports \u201cpersonhood legislation,\u201d which would define a fertilized egg as a human. Abortion rights groups argue that such legislation could be used to outlaw common forms of contraception that prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg, such as IUDs and some types of birth-control pills.\n\nWarner\u2019s campaign said those assertions were based on the fact that the Republican platform adopted in 2004, during Gillespie\u2019s tenure as party chairman, called for both a personhood amendment and for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nGillespie has tried to bat down the \u201cwar on women\u201d themes that Virginia Democrats have used against Republicans in recent years. He said Warner was inventing positions for him, and he made a surprise call for letting adults buy birth-control pills without a prescription.\n\nWarner also went after Gillespie for not taking a clear position on whether human activity is contributing to climate change and for opposing a minimum-wage increase \u2014 issues that, until recently, were avoided more by Democrats than by Republicans in business-friendly Virginia.\n\nThe senator\u2019s travels reveal a similar pattern.\n\nIn May and June, he popped up in Danville, Martinsville and Wise County, an Appalachian coal-mining community on the Kentucky border. And this week, he hit the Old Fiddlers\u2019 Convention in Galax, near the North Carolina line.\n\nBut July had him mostly in Northern Virginia and Richmond. And with the final stretch of the campaign fast approaching, it would be difficult for him to devote anything close to the 45 days he spent in Southside and southwest Virginia in 2001.\n\nA difficult balance\n\nThat\u2019s especially true given the outsize political importance that Northern Virginia has acquired since then \u2014 and the necessity for both candidates to spend lots of time there.\n\nThe region was so different in 2001, 13 years ago, that Warner was able to win the election without carrying Loudoun and Prince William counties. The two Washington exurbs\u2019 combined population was 450,000 in a state of 7 million, and Warner\u2019s strong performance in the inner suburbs, the cities and along the state\u2019s southern border more than made up for the deficit.\n\nBy the time McAuliffe came along last year, Loudoun and Prince William had become must-win bellwethers, with more than 788,000 residents in a state of 8.2 million. The two counties accounted for nearly 10 percent of Virginians, up from 6 percent in 2001.\n\nMcAuliffe got clobbered last year in Southside and southwest, two regions Warner won 13 years ago. But because Northern Virginia had grown tremendously bigger and bluer, McAuliffe was able to more than make up ground there, winning the Washington area by more than twice the margin that Warner had in 2001.\n\nThose trends might look like pure electoral gravy for Warner, who left the governor\u2019s office with soaring approval ratings and remains the state\u2019s most popular politician. But Warner has probably lost support in what is now bright-red rural Virginia. At the same time, his moderate record might not inspire the heavy Democratic turnout in the cities and suburbs that put Obama, Kaine and McAuliffe over the top.\n\nAs a result, he is actually courting both worlds this year. And trying to appeal to the Democratic base without alienating rural Virginians has required a sometimes awkward balancing act.\n\nConsider how he has navigated the Affordable Care Act, neither fully renouncing his vote for Obama\u2019s troubled signature achievement nor giving it a full-throated defense. He has acknowledged the health-care initiative\u2019s many flaws \u2014 \u201cThe Obamacare rollout was a disaster,\u201d he said in the debate \u2014 but has called for legislative fixes rather than repeal.\n\nHis posture is a world away from that of McAuliffe, who campaigned on a promise to expand Medicaid under the federal law and continues to beat the drum for it. In July, the governor flew to Wise to press his case, visiting a field hospital that volunteers set up annually on the county fairgrounds. People had camped out for days to see a doctor or have rotten teeth pulled.\n\nIf Warner had wanted to make a hearty plea for the uninsured, there was the perfect backdrop: a heartbreaking spectacle of profound medical want. But Warner did not tag along with McAuliffe. Instead of red meat, Warner has offered the \u201ccopper plan,\u201d a lower-cost insurance option.\n\nWarner\u2019s campaign spokesman, David Turner, declined to discuss strategy but said: \u201cThe political calculus hasn\u2019t changed for Senator Warner. He\u2019s able to maintain his broad appeal across the political spectrum because he\u2019s been a pragmatic, sensible centrist who tries to work with everyone.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans say the balancing act shows that the moderate sales pitch no longer works for Warner, who pulled off a $1 billion tax increase as governor and \u2014 as Gillespie often notes \u2014 has voted with Obama 97 percent of the time as senator.\n\n\u201cMark Warner faces a complex dilemma, because if he tries to run like the Mark Warner of 2001, the public voting record shows something different,\u201d Republican strategist Chris LaCivita said. \u201cIf he tries to run a base campaign, which is just to turn out Democrats, there aren\u2019t enough motivated Democrats right now to do that. You\u2019re still going to need the independents. Independents aren\u2019t thrilled right now with some of Mark Warner\u2019s hallmark achievements.\u201d\n\nGillespie quipped at the debate: \u201cGovernor Warner wouldn\u2019t recognize Senator Warner today.\u201d\n\nRural appeal\n\nWarner pollster Geoffrey Garin said the senator has nothing to worry about, even in parts of Virginia that have largely turned on Democrats. Indeed, the incumbent logged double-digit leads in several recent polls.\n\n\u201cVoters there in rural Virginia feel a very strong sense of connection with Senator Warner,\u201d Garin said. \u201cGillespie\u2019s betting that politics is only about ideology. But politics in southwest Virginia is deeply personal.\u201d\n\nWarner started establishing those bonds before his race for governor, as an entrepreneur who invested in those economically depressed regions. Then came the rural strategy hatched by Jarding, the 2001 campaign manager, and strategist David \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders. They had Warner try his hand at turkey shooting, splash his name on a NASCAR truck and set his campaign jingle to a bluegrass toe-tapper.\n\n\u201cHe was clear he wasn\u2019t from the culture but he liked it, and he got right in the middle of it and had fun,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWhen somebody shows love down here, it\u2019s returned with love.\u201d\n\nWarner schlepped to the woods of rural southeastern Virginia last spring for the Shad Planking, an annual gathering where politicos chew the fat \u2014 and the fish, fire-cooked on wooden boards and a far cry from the fancy fare of Williams-Sonoma. For decades, the event was a must for statewide candidates. Kaine broke with tradition and skipped it in 2012. McAuliffe was a no-show last year, a decision Saunders called a snub to rural voters.\n\nThe state party tapped Saunders in June to represent Warner outside the Roanoke convention hall where Gillespie was being nominated, voicing in his backwoods twang a populist message against the former lobbyist.\n\nYet Warner\u2019s one-time ambassador to \u201cBubba,\u201d as Saunders affectionately calls rural voters, is not on the campaign payroll this time. Saunders said that is a sign of Warner\u2019s security with the rural vote, not of a decision to cede it.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t think he needs me,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cI think he is already branded, and I think once you\u2019re already branded, it\u2019s hard to wash that off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. senator no longer needs to court the rural vote as a moderate as much as when he ran for governor.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The U.S. senator no longer needs to court the rural vote as a moderate as much as when he ran for governor.", "title": "As Virginia\u2019s demographics have changed, so has Mark Warner\u2019s campaign approach", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/as-virginias-demographics-have-changed-so-has-mark-warners-campaign-approach/2014/08/07/29902c22-1115-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/07/Local-Politics/Images/Virginia_Senate_Debate-02120.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, mark warner, ed gillespie, mark warner rural strategy, mark warner southside, mark warner southwest, mudcat saunders, steve jarding, mark warner nascar, jennifer duffy, cook political report, stuart rothenberg, rothenberg political report", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, mark warner, ed gillespie, mark warner rural strategy, mark warner southside, mark warner southwest, mudcat saunders, steve jarding, mark warner nascar, jennifer duffy, cook political report, stuart rothenberg, rothenberg political report", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "29902c22-1115-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb666\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMark Warner faces a complex dilemma, because if he tries to run like the Mark Warner of 2001, the public voting record shows something different,\u201d Republican strategist Chris LaCivita said.\nIn other words, Virginia has changed so much that Mark Warner has changed, too.\nU.S. Sen.
