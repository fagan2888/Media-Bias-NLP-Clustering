But first: Fireworks on the Hill, and a surprise confession from the NFL.\n\nNO BIPARTISAN LOVE FOR E&C HEALTH SAVINGS BILL \u2014 Will the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s plan to scrap the ACA\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund \u2014 a pot of money that Republicans have long derided as a \"slush fund\" for the Obama administration \u2014 turn into another fight about Zika money?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Monday night, as the committee began considering a bill that would squeeze $30 billion out of health care programs over a decade, top Democrat Frank Pallone criticized efforts to eliminate the fund \"in the midst of serious public health crises,\" Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports. \"This legislation would defund critical public health investments in efforts such as preventing childhood lead poisoning and building epidemiology and laboratory capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks like Zika,\" he said in his opening statement.\n\n\u2026 Democrats blasted the legislation as shortsighted while Republicans said it was needed to contain entitlement program spending. About $15 billion of the bill\u2019s savings come from cuts to federal Medicaid and CHIP spending; the remaining $10 billion is from nixing the prevention fund. Look for fireworks today when the committee reconvenes at 10 a.m.\n\nFIRST IN PULSE: SENATE HELP's MANAGER's AMENDMENT \u2014 The Senate HELP Committee will consider a manager\u2019s amendment to its mental health reform and opioid abuse bill during a mark-up Wednesday, Pro's Brianna Ehley reports. The manager's amendment, shared with POLITICO, creates and reauthorizes grants for mental health and substance abuse, and establishes workforce training to detect eating disorders and other behavioral health issues, among other things. Pros can read the manager's amendment here: http://politico.pro/1M3IN3X\n\nThe manager\u2019s amendment includes the following, among other provisions:\n\n\u2014 A block grant for prevention and treatment of substance use disorders\n\n\u2014 A provision to help states and local communities address emerging drug issues\n\n\u2014 A reauthorization of mental and behavioral health education and training grants\n\n\u2014 Education and training on eating disorders\n\n\u2014 Encouragement of screening and treatment for maternal depression\n\n\u2014 Instructions for the CDC to improve the National Violent Death Reporting System\n\nNFL CONCEDES CONNECTION BETWEEN CONCUSSIONS, BRAIN DAMAGE \u2014 At the House's roundtable discussion on concussions, a NFL official on Monday admitted that there's \"certainly\" a link between playing football and suffering from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky was able to pin down Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety, and get him to confirm a connection between the contact sport and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It's the first time that a senior league official has admitted to the link.\n\n\u2014 Experts said brain-injury awareness is at an all-time high. \"The sky is not falling,\" said Dr. David Cifu of Virginia Commonwealth University, pointing out that treatment is improving and that concussions are less of a public health challenge for America's children than obesity.\n\nWELCOME TO ANOTHER SUPER TUESDAY PULSE \u2014 And if you're reading this, thanks for casting your vote with PULSE today.

Expect Democrats to point out the irony that the committee will hold a hearing on previously defeated legislation \u2014 at a time when it's refusing to even consider a Supreme Court nominee. The sparks fly at 10 a.m. http://1.usa.gov/21s2YdA\n\nDEMS TO LINK SCOTUS OPENING WITH GOP's ABORTION BILL \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to turn the GOP's refusal to move on the Supreme Court vacancy into the latest episode of the \"war on women,\" POLITICO's Seung Min Kim reports.\n\nLed by some of their most senior female members, Senate Democrats will take to the floor Tuesday to launch a new messaging offensive that ties the battle over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia to a GOP-led hearing on late-term abortions scheduled to occur later Tuesday. http://politi.co/1RKV5uC\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Ben Sasse on Monday issued a report that concludes that the insurance options available through the ACA exchanges in 2016 \"are significantly less competitive\" than the individual market was in 2013, before the ACA was implemented.\n\n\"Facts don\u2019t spin,\" Sasse told The Washington Times. \"Families are forced to choose between fewer insurers on the ACA\u2019s exchanges.\"\n\n\u2014 HHS says Sasse is comparing 'apples to oranges.' \"Namely, he\u2019s comparing the whole individual market in 2013 to the Marketplace alone in 2016,\" an HHS spokesperson told PULSE. \"There are a significant number of issuers that offer off-Marketplace coverage, and those are left out of the 2016 analysis.\"\n\nFIRST IN PULSE: SEIU SIGNS ON TO MA RETIREE FIGHT \u2014 The labor union just joined the Coalition to Save Medicare Advantage Retiree Coverage, which now counts 50 member organizations \u2014 including the National Association of Manufacturers, which has joined too.

Bondi helped lead the 2012 lawsuit that challenged the ACA's individual mandate and, by extension, the entire law's legality.\n\nTHERANOS HOSTING CLINTON FUNDRAISER \u2014 CEO Elizabeth Holmes is hosting a \"Conversation with Chelsea Clinton\" next Monday in Theranos' Palo Alto offices, Re/code reported.

Bill Nelson and colleagues on Monday filed legislation to fix a glitch in the Medicare Graduate Medical Education rules. The snafu in question? Hospitals that already accept part-time medical residents on a rotating basis face challenges when trying to establish their own full-time residency programs. The bill text: http://1.usa.gov/22gRN9S\n\n\u2014 The Association of American Medical Colleges applauds the legislation. The AAMC had lobbied Medicare officials for years to make the change. \"We thought CMS had the authority to interpret the statute,\" AAMC's Atul Grover tells PULSE. The Senate Finance Committee will now take up the bill.\n\nPRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES \u2014 A report out today from the National Association of Community Health Centers highlights that nearly all centers are struggling with at least one clinical vacancy and suffer higher vacancy rates for physicians than hospitals. According to the report, health centers are serving more than 24 million people \u2014 but would be able to serve 2 million more patients if all vacancies were filled. NACHC's report: http://bit.ly/1V8vJvY\n\nFLU LEVELS AT HIGHEST POINT IN PAST YEAR \u2014 That's according to athenaResearch's weekly flu report, which finds that diagnoses of influenza-like illness (ILI) are now above the entire 2013-2014 season.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
