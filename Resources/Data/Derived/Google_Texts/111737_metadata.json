The Obama economy is stalled. It grew at a measly .7 percent annualized rate the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s compared with the 3.5 percent rate the US enjoyed for most of the 20th century \u2014 what\u2019s needed to sustain employment and optimism.\n\nTrue, the economy slowed under George W. Bush. Obama inherited a recession and, with it, a suicide epidemic. When the recession hit, suicide deaths suddenly started outnumbering deaths from auto accidents. But eight years later, job losses are still driving the suicide rate higher and higher.\n\nClinton seems unmoved. She\u2019s pledging to close down the coal industry and block natural-gas fracking. More pain for coal country or for portions of upstate New York that are sitting on natural-gas treasure.\n\nSelf-inflicted deaths in the Syracuse area are up about 40 percent in the past five years, and rates in depressed western New York are double New York City\u2019s rate. Upstate New Yorkers are literally dying for jobs.\n\nSimilarly, joblessness is killing people in Walker County, Ala., where the coal mines have been shutting down, leaving families destitute. Since 1999, premature deaths among the middle-aged there have more than doubled \u2014 some from suicide and others from slower methods of self-destruction like alcohol and opioids.\n\nNew Jersey used to have one of the lowest suicide rates in the nation, but it\u2019s shot up 13 percent in two years. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a wave of suicides that resulted from the financial crisis a little bit later than other parts of the country,\u201d reports prevention advocate Phil Lubitz.\n\nEconomic distress is so widespread that for the first time ever, life expectancy for white women in the United States actually dropped. Despite progress against cancer and heart disease, lives are being cut short by hopelessness.\n\nIt\u2019s a national health emergency. Suicide kills more middle-agers than flu, pneumonia and diabetes combined \u2014 often after dashed expectations, abandonment by a spouse and loss of self-worth. Then a bullet to the head or a noose (for men), or a deliberate drug overdose (for women) ends the pain.\n\nThese tragedies should awaken this nation to the real issue in the coming presidential election. It\u2019s not inequality, despite Bernie Sanders\u2019 rantings. It\u2019s lack of growth and the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to make growth a priority.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/04/the_obama_economy_is_killing_people.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: The Obama economy is killing people"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14ff\"", "article_summary": "But eight years later, job losses are still driving the suicide rate higher and higher.\nNew Jersey used to have one of the lowest suicide rates in the nation, but it\u2019s shot up 13 percent in two years.\nWhen the recession hit, suicide deaths suddenly started outnumbering deaths from auto accidents.\nThe Obama economy is stalled.\nSimilarly, joblessness is killing people in Walker County, Ala., where the coal mines have been shutting down, leaving families destitute."}
