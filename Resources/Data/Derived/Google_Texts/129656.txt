Type 2 diabetes is a serious and expensive health condition. Two problems in the U.S. — overweight or obesity and a sedentary lifestyle — are also two of the most common causes for the disease, according to WebMd. The American Diabetes Association estimated the cost of diagnosed diabetes at $245 billion in 2012.

A map posted on the That Data Dude blog, shows how startling the problem of diabetes is for the U.S.: There were only 10 counties where the percentage of the population diagnosed with diabetes decreased between 2004 and 2012. In every other county, the diabetes prevalence rate increased.





Although the number of new cases of diagnosed diabetes has been decreasing a bit in the last few years, showing some progress, it's expected the trend may reverse itself as patients gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act and its related Medicaid expansion.
