Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is preparing to interrogate Clinton in a highly-anticipated, day-long hearing next month that will likely cap the latest congressional probe of the tragedy.\n\nRelated: On Benghazi and Emails, Clinton and House GOP Are Spoiling For a Fight\n\nClinton has been dogged for months by the scandal over her use of a personal email server during her four years as secretary of state. Some authorities say that arrangement may have resulted in the improper transmission of classified government information in personal emails.\n\nThe setup was uncovered by the Benghazi panel, and Gowdy and other Republicans are certain to spend hours questioning Clinton on her mishandling \u2013 and possible destruction\u2014of government-related messages.\n\nThe controversy has badly undercut Clinton\u2019s campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination and prompted many Democrats to question her honesty and integrity, something the select committee\u2019s seven Republicans are certain to try to capitalize on during the hearing.\n\nSo much attention has been focused on the email controversy that the GOP\u2019s overarching concerns about the Benghazi attacks have been largely forgotten or ignored.\n\nRelated: Hillary\u2019s E-Mail Lapse ... Mistake ... Responsibility ... er, 'Apology'\n\nThis is the ninth congressional investigation into the attacks on the U.S. compound. Previous examinations have explored every facet of the event, from questions regarding embassy security and existing intelligence warnings to the response by the State Department and the military in its aftermath.\n\nAt the time of the select committee\u2019s creation, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said Gowdy\u2019s past \u201cas a federal prosecutor and his zeal for the truth make him the ideal person to lead this panel. I know he shares my commitment to get to the bottom of this tragedy and will not tolerate any stonewalling from the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nDemocrats argue their initial concerns that the probe would turn into a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d aimed a damaging Clinton\u2019s White House bid have come true. They charge the investigation has lasted longer than previous congressional examinations, including the one into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI think we got sidetracked and it\u2019s become a committee to investigate Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD), the select committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cWe could have probably done more to look at Benghazi if we hadn\u2019t gotten so sidetracked with regard to Secretary Clinton.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Congress Deals With This To-Do List Impacts Everything\n\nHe said the 12-member panel should have focused more on how to boost security measures at U.S. embassies and diplomatic outposts around the world.\n\nCummings said he knows the panel is \u201cgoing to look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails\u201d when she appears but predicted that when the select committee\u2019s final report is written there will be no findings about the more outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks, such as Clinton issuing a \u201cstand-down\u201d order to two military personnel at the compound or approving an illicit weapons program in the country.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes whether we have made thing safer for our diplomatic corps and I think we have, in spite of our committee,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said the agency had adopted all 29 security recommendations made by its Accountability Review Board in the wake of the 2012 assault and is \u201ccommitted to implementing each.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have closed 26 of 29 recommendations, some of which require long-term technical upgrades. The remaining three are in progress,\u201d he added.\n\nStill, the GOP is likely to press Clinton on the question of whether she and her team followed security protocols before and after the assault or did enough after a June email from her chief foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan warned there was a \u201ccredible threat\u201d against a hotel Stevens was staying in at the time.\n\nRepublicans no doubt will also ask about the now infamous talking points then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice used on Sunday talk shows to deliver the administration\u2019s message on Benghazi.\n\nThe talking points fueled questions by the GOP about whether Rice tried to mislead the American public about whether Benghazi was in fact a terrorist attack just weeks before Election Day.\n\nAnother topic will be the role of longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, who served as an unofficial adviser and passed along on-the-ground memos from Libya that were authored by retired CIA officer Tyler Drumheller. Drumheller died from complications from pancreatic cancer early last month.\n\nLastly, select committee members like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) could ask about why the U.S. had a presence in Libya in the first place.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) guessed Clinton\u2019s appearance next month wouldn\u2019t stop Republicans \u201cobsession\u201d with her, saying the GOP views the probe as \u201cgood politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never going to be satisfied because it\u2019s not about what the committee was supposedly established to do,\u201d according to Cummings, noting that Gowdy has said publicly the panel\u2019s final report may not contain any definitive conclusions about what transpired that fateful day.\n\nOn Friday, the three year anniversary of the attacks, Gowdy struck a somber tone.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Chris Stevens and Sean Smith were diplomats we asked to represent us in a foreign land. Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were former Navy Seals who continued to serve even after the uniforms were pressed and put away,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nGowdy said the panel\u2019s goal has always been to conduct as \u201cstraightforward\u201d investigation.\n\n\"While much outside attention has been paid to the former Secretary, this investigation has never been about her and never will be. It is about our four fellow Americans murdered three years ago, and ensuring we provide answers for their families and loved ones.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created last year to investigate the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the role former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and others played in the run up and the aftermath of the violence that claimed the lives of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens.", "title": "After 16 Months and $4.4 Million, Benghazi Panel Still Searching for Charges", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/After-16-Months-and-44-Million-Benghazi-Panel-Still-Searching-Charges", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/After-16-Months-and-44-Million-Benghazi-Panel-Still-Searching-Charges", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created last year to investigate the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the role former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and others played in the run up and the aftermath of the violence that claimed the lives of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc957f\"", "article_summary": "So much attention has been focused on the email controversy that the GOP\u2019s overarching concerns about the Benghazi attacks have been largely forgotten or ignored.\nThe setup was uncovered by the Benghazi panel, and Gowdy and other Republicans are certain to spend hours questioning Clinton on her mishandling \u2013 and possible destruction\u2014of government-related messages.\nLastly, select committee members like Rep.
