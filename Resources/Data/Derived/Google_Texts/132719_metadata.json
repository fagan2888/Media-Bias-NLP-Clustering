We had her examine claims from both camps.\n\nWe'll start with Mr. Trump's ad claim.\n\nClaim: After John Kasich helped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy.\n\nYes, Kasich did work for Lehman Brothers in a two-man office in Columbus but his campaign claims he had no executive or strategic role. Is this claim true?\n\n\u201cLehman Brothers was not at all helpful to the world's economy,\" Hanauer said. \"But I wouldn't say they destroyed the world's economy, it's still functioning.\"\n\nWe're calling this ad claim FALSE.\n\nClaim: Kasich gave Ohio Obamacare.\n\nThis claim takes some explaining.\n\n\u201cHe didn't bring Ohio Obamacare; that was a federal decision,\u201d Hanauer said.\n\nBut since Kasich used Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, to pay to expand Medicaid which allowed thousands of Ohioans to get health coverage.\n\nWe're saying this claim is TRUE.\n\nA new ad from the group New Day For America, boasts Kasich's jobs record.\n\nClaim: 417,000 of us now have good paying jobs.\n\nHanauer says it's not the whole story.\n\n\u201cIt's not inaccurate to say those jobs came to the state but it's not much to brag about because our job creation has been lower than the nation as a whole,\u201d she said.\n\nWe're giving this claim PARTLY TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim: Kasich cut state spending cut our taxes increased our wages.\n\nIs this true?\n\n\u201cHe cut taxes for the wealthiest Ohioans and raised taxes for lower income Ohioans,\" Hanauer said. \"He did cut spending for local governments.\"\n\nWhich she says forced those local governments to ask voters to approve more taxes. We're giving this claim PARTLY TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the November election draws closer, expect to see more ads like these. Hanauer says don't rely on ads for the facts.\n\n\u201cI don't think any of these ads give you a full picture,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Anti-Trump ads appear to be working for Kasich who is now tied in with Trump in the latest Quinnipiac University survey released Monday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kevin Landers found the new ads are littered with some truths, some half-truths and some thrown in exaggeration.", "og": {"site_name": "WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio", "description": "Kevin Landers found the new ads are littered with some truths, some half-truths and some thrown in exaggeration.", "title": "Truth Test: A closer look at Kasich & Trump campaign ads", "url": "http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2016/03/14/columbus-ohio-true-or-false-a-closer-look-at-kasich--trump-campaign-ads.html", "image": "http://www.10tv.com/content/videos/2016/03/14/truth-test.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100480996669326}, "dfp-id": 8919, "dfp-adunit": "10TV_ROS/10TV_News", "google-site-verification": "oAfV5ExqDpMG7IN3s-onYSMOZYzGcQsWBAOUMvXCw_c", "dfp-targeting": "{\"cat\":[\"news\",\"pol\"]}"}, "article_summary": "Claim: Kasich cut state spending cut our taxes increased our wages.\n\u201cHe cut taxes for the wealthiest Ohioans and raised taxes for lower income Ohioans,\" Hanauer said.\nThe attack ads between Donald Trump and Governor John Kasich are appearing all over TV, radio, and online.\n\u201cJohn Kasich just another all talk no action politician,\u201d says the ad produced by the Trump campaign.\nClaim: Kasich gave Ohio Obamacare."}
