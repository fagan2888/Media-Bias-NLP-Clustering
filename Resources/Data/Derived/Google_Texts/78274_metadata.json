But Republicans were not worrying about that for the moment. They were too busy celebrating the decision.\n\nAfter years of complaints that the Obama White House was flagrantly exceeding its executive authority on a range of issues, a federal district court judge in Washington, Rosemary W. Collyer, agreed with Republicans on the Affordable Care Act, finding that Congress had not funded a $130 billion program providing subsides to insurance companies.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic win for the Constitution and the American people,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said in a typical reaction. \u201cThe executive branch is being held accountable to We the People.\u201d\n\nThe victory was particularly sweet for former Speaker John A. Boehner, but it may have also been bittersweet. The suit was the brainchild of Mr. Boehner and members of his staff, who initiated it as a way to challenge the new health care law. They recognized that congressional Republicans were never going to be successful in repealing the health care law with Mr. Obama in the White House (i.e., the failed shutdown in 2013) and looked for a more fruitful way to undermine it.\n\nDespite his efforts, Mr. Boehner was ultimately forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who viewed him as not aggressive enough in calling the administration to account. But their tactics failed, while his have produced some actual results, however the case ultimately turns out at the appeals court level.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160513060043, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Boehner, John A", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Boehner John A,Law and Legislation,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Carl Hulse", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Carl Hulse", "byl": "Carl Hulse", "twitter": {"description": "A court ruling on Thursday gutting a central provision of the Affordable Care Act is the result of a suit initiated by Mr. Boehner before he was forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who said he was not aggressive enough in trying to repeal the health care law.", "title": "Health Care Ruling Gives John Boehner at Least Some Temporary Vindication", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/13/health-care-ruling-gives-john-boehner-at-least-some-temporary-vindication/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/05/12/us/12firstdraftnl-boehner2/12firstdraftnl-boehner2-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@hillhulse", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004404300, "description": "A court ruling on Thursday gutting a central provision of the Affordable Care Act is the result of a suit initiated by Mr. Boehner before he was forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who said he was not aggressive enough in trying to repeal the health care law.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "May 13, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-05132016.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1463133643, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/carl_hulse/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-05-13T11:01:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160513110125, "PUD": 20160513, "pdate": 20160513, "des": "Law and Legislation;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/05/12/us/12firstdraftnl-boehner2/12firstdraftnl-boehner2-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "A court ruling on Thursday gutting a central provision of the Affordable Care Act is the result of a suit initiated by Mr. Boehner before he was forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who said he was not aggressive enough in trying to repeal the health care law.", "title": "Health Care Ruling Gives John Boehner at Least Some Temporary Vindication", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/13/health-care-ruling-gives-john-boehner-at-least-some-temporary-vindication/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/05/12/us/12firstdraftnl-boehner2/12firstdraftnl-boehner2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Health Care Ruling Gives John Boehner at Least Some Temporary Vindication", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/05/12/us/12firstdraftnl-boehner2/12firstdraftnl-boehner2-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 13, 2016"}, "article_summary": "The suit was the brainchild of Mr. Boehner and members of his staff, who initiated it as a way to challenge the new health care law.\nPhotoThe Obama administration and its allies are confident that Thursday\u2019s federal court ruling, gutting an important part of the new health care law, will be overturned on appeal.\nDespite his efforts, Mr. Boehner was ultimately forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who viewed him as not aggressive enough in calling the administration to account.\nBut their tactics failed, while his have produced some actual results, however the case ultimately turns out at the appeals court level.\n\u201cThe executive branch is being held accountable to We the People.\u201dThe victory was particularly sweet for former Speaker John A.
