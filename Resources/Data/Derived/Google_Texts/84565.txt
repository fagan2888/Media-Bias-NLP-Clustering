House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Monday defended Obamacare amid fellow Democrats’ concerns, saying that while the politics may be tricky right now, eventually having voted for the health care law will be a boon.

“We’ll ride this out,” the California Democrat said on a conference call with reporters.

Some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, are worried about facing voters having backed the health law, which has seen a rocky rollout and is costing millions of Americans their health plans — even as it is aided millions of others to sign up or get on their parents’ plans.

“It’s worth the trouble, it’s going to be a glorious thing,” Mrs. Pelosi said.

Still, she said when it comes to voters, she believes they will not have the health law at the front of their minds when they head to the polls less than a year from now for midterm congressional elections.

She signaled that Democrats are likely to reprise the income inequality message President Obama used successfully against GOP nominee Mitt Romney last year.

“I think the election is going to be, as all elections are, about the economy and what is the initiative that is going forth from the administration, from the Democrats, to make a distinction as to who benefits from a fair and just economy,” Mrs. Pelosi said.
