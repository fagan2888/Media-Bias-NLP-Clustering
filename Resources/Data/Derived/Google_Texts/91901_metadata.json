Despite significant opposition which prevented the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill from becoming law, Obama even said that \u201cnobody\u2019s stopping \u2019em\u201d from passing a bill.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what I can do through executive action,\u201d Obama insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be everything that needs to get done. And it will take time to put that in place.\u201d\n\nObama said that he would be \u201cimplementing an executive action\u201d on a \u201cparallel track\u201d to a potential bill, which he said would \u201csupersede\u201d his executive action the minute it passes. Obama, as he has said many times before, said if Congress does not pass an amnesty bill that will be \u201cpermanent rather than temporary\u201d by the end of the year, then he would enact his executive amnesty. Republican leaders warned last week that enacting an exective amnesty would kill a potential bill. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has said a GOP-led Congress should \u201cdeal\u201d with immigration reform. Pro-amnesty advocates had previously expressed hope that an amnesty bill could be the final act of the lame-duck Congress.\n\nObama also blamed the lack of an amnesty bill for the federal government\u2019s inability to deport \u201cdangerous\u201d illegal immigrants. He said that \u201cevery day that I wait\u201d for an amnesty bill, \u201cwe\u2019re misallocating resources, we\u2019re deporting people that shouldn\u2019t be deported, we\u2019re not deporting folks that are dangerous and need to be deported.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to host Bob Schieffer about the midterms, Obama simply stated, \u201cwe got beat.\u201d Obama, who delayed his executive amnesty until after the midterms because Senate Democrats begged him to help them save their seats, then the \u201cthe message that I took from this election\u201d is that \u201cpeople want to see this city work.\u201d\n\nTo Obama, that means pushing for a pathway to citizenship for nearly all of the country\u2019s illegal immigrants. He said that \u201cmillions of people\u201d who have lived in the country illegally should \u201chave a capacity to legalize themselves here\u201d after \u201cthey pay a fine, they pay penalties, they learn English,\u201d and get back to the end of the line.\n\n\u201cEveryone agrees on that,\u201d Obama claimed, even though at least three national polls taken before the midterms found that a plurality of Americans were \u201cless likely\u201d to vote for those who supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In addition, immigration was Obama\u2019s worst issue heading into the midterms, and exit polls showed that 75% of Americans rejected Obama\u2019s executive amnesty while another 80% did not want more foreigners taking jobs from Americans and legal immigrants already here.\n\nObama claimed that while the \u201ceconomy has improved significantly,\u201d but conceded that \u201cwages haven\u2019t gone up, incomes haven\u2019t gone up\u201d and Americans are having trouble saving for retirement and paying tuition for their kids. As Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow has repeatedly emphasized in letters to Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus, massive amnesty legislation would lower the wages of Americans, particularly black Americans, whose 10.9% unemployment rate is the worst among all groups. The Congressional Budget Office has also determined that the Senate\u2019s massive \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty legislation would lower the wages of American workers over the next decade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama: 'Time Hasn't Run Out' on Lame-Duck Congress Amnesty Bill", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama: 'Time Hasn't Run Out' on Lame-Duck Congress Amnesty Bill", "title": "Obama: 'Time Hasn't Run Out' on Lame-Duck Congress Amnesty Bill - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-it-could-happen-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/09/obama-time-hasn-t-run-out-on-lame-duck-congress-amnesty-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: 'Time Hasn't Run Out' on Lame-Duck Congress Amnesty Bill", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-it-could-happen-ap.jpg", "title": "Obama: 'Time Hasn't Run Out' on Lame-Duck Congress Amnesty Bill - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Illegal Immigrants, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-11-09T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Pro-amnesty advocates had previously expressed hope that an amnesty bill could be the final act of the lame-duck Congress.\nObama also blamed the lack of an amnesty bill for the federal government\u2019s inability to deport \u201cdangerous\u201d illegal immigrants.\nOn CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Obama even urged those in the lame-duck Congress\u2013some of whom were thrown out by voters because of illegal immigration\u2013to pass an amnesty bill, saying \u201ctime hasn\u2019t run out\u201d on the lame-duck Congress to pass amnesty legislation that would permanently legalize nearly all of the country\u2019s illegal immigrants.\nObama, as he has said many times before, said if Congress does not pass an amnesty bill that will be \u201cpermanent rather than temporary\u201d by the end of the year, then he would enact his executive amnesty.\nDespite significant opposition which prevented the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill from becoming law, Obama even said that \u201cnobody\u2019s stopping \u2019em\u201d from passing a bill."}
