Scalia, a stalwart conservative, famously said the Affordable Care Act should be called \u201cSCOTUScare.\u201d\n\nAccording to Modern Healthcare, Scalia joined a dissenting opinion in the 2012 case that upheld the ACA\u2019s individual mandate and penned the dissenting opinion in last year\u2019s King v. Burwell decision which allowed Americans in all states to receive insurance premium subsidies.\n\nThe Supreme Court is slated to consider a number of major cases this term, including a big abortion case, a challenge to the contraceptive mandate, Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co\u2014 a case on whether a self-funded insurer should have to turn over certain informationsuch as on claims and member eligibilityto the state of Vermont for its all-payer database cases, and Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel Escobar\u2014 a case challenging the validity of a legal theory now used to bring many fraud lawsuits against healthcare organizations which case has the potential to reduce the number of False Claims Act suits brought against providers and other companies. Each of these cases have important implications for healthcare.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a CNN contributor and law professor at American University Washington College Law said,\u201cThe entire tenor of this term has now changed. The court can try to go ahead, but on cases where they are split 4-4, their only options are to leave the lower court decision intact or to hold the case over until Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement is confirmed.\u201d\n\nTim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, told Modern Healthcare that, in strongly divisive cases, conservatives will have a harder time carrying a ruling without Scalia. \u201cOn really controversial cases where there would have been a 5-4 split, the business of the court essentially stops because you won\u2019t have a precedential decision from the court,\u201d Jost said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have a decision from the court binding on the whole country.\u201d\n\nIn the case of a 4-4 split among the remaining justices, the lower court\u2019s decision would remain in place, but only for the area of the country served by that circuit. This would mean messy results, including the challenge over the ACA contraception mandate.A 4-4 split could mean different rules in different parts of the nation, since seven circuit courts have sided with the government, while one has sided with the religious not-for-profits.\n\nIn the abortion case, however, a 4-4 split would mean that the Texas law that requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and providers to comply with the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers would remain in effect.That case is known as WholeWoman\u2019s Health v. Cole. The case has potential broader implications when it comes to how all states may regulate abortions.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Antonin Scalia&rsquo;s death means the court&rsquo;s balance will be altered, leaving healthcare cases in limbo. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "What Justice Scalia's Death Could Mean For Healthcare", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/c7377305/c7377305-fb37-49d8-923b-138301302948/judge_with_gavel.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Antonin Scalia&rsquo;s death means the court&rsquo;s balance will be altered, leaving healthcare cases in limbo.
