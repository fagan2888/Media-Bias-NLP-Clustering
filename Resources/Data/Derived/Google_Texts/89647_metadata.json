Now my challenge is to convince them not to rest on their laurels,\u201d Mrs. Savage said.\n\nThe reprieve, which the Treasury Department announced Dec. 28, gives companies until March 31 \u2014 two months longer than anticipated \u2014 to report to their employees, and until June to report that information to the IRS.\n\nThe announcement served as a curtain raiser for yet another pivotal year for President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, which he is eager to set on firmer footing before he leaves office in early 2017.\n\nThe reporting requirement is a key part of the law\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d which demands that companies with at least 50 full-time staff members offer their employees health insurance or pay a penalty to the government for failing to do so.\n\nAlthough most Americans faced the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d tax penalty beginning in 2014, the administration delayed full enforcement of the employer mandate for a couple of years.\n\nHaving both in place is supposed to help the IRS vet both businesses and employees and try to spot those attempting to cheat the system or duck their obligations under the law.\n\nBut the delay means the IRS may not have companies\u2019 reports in hand until the middle of the year, well after most taxpayers have filed their forms and received refunds, raising the possibility of some attempting to game the system.\n\nTaxpayer subsidies for exchange plans are supposed to be available only to those who don\u2019t have other options, such as a job-based plan or a government-run program like Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI think the bigger threat is to the government than individuals,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consultancy based in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Treasury said it delayed the reporting rules after the business community said it needs more time to compile the information and that the requirements are overwhelming human resources departments.\n\nMany are leaning on outside vendors that have launched products to help with Obamacare compliance. But the vendors have been inundated with requests for assistance, said Katie Mahoney, executive director for health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re heard from many, many companies that the time frame between when the rules were finalized, when the forms were finalized and when the files had to be submitted were extremely onerous and very, very troubling in terms of compliance,\u201d she said.\n\nCompanies have never grappled with this type of reporting before, and by many accounts the process is painstaking. The IRS says part-timers and certain seasonal workers sometimes add up to full-time employees, so companies with roughly 50 employees must compute whether they are subject to the rules.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, they just want to wash their hands of it,\u201d said Aaron Johnson, president of Automatic Payroll Systems in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is helping thousands of clients comply with the rules.\n\nFor companies that must report to the IRS, his company created systems that trigger alarm bells if employees with variable hours approach 30 hours in a given week. It also offered stand-alone software to help firms comply with the health care coverage rules without completely overhauling their workforce systems.\n\n\u201cWe have customers signing up for that service every day across the country,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nThe IRS said its decision to give employers extra time shouldn\u2019t affect most taxpayers because the record doesn\u2019t have to be attached to their returns.\n\nFor the 2015 tax year, with returns due in 2016, filers who might have relied on the forms as proof of coverage, or to establish their eligibility for exchange subsidies, can instead rely on insurance cards, an explanation of benefits, or W-2 and payroll statements, the Treasury said. Filers will not have to amend their returns once they receive the official forms.\n\n\u201cShould the IRS later contact a taxpayer because of discrepancy between the taxpayer\u2019s income tax return and an information return filed with the IRS, the taxpayer can use the documentation to show he or she reasonably relied on the information that was available at the time of the filing of the return,\u201d it said in an agency statement.\n\nThe IRS should be able to catch up with employers that didn\u2019t offer adequate coverage, yet policy analysts said the agency won\u2019t have a critical tool for verifying whether a person owed an individual mandate penalty until refunds have gone out the door.\n\nSimilar to 2014, \u201cit does mean you could have people getting subsidies that weren\u2019t eligible,\u201d Ms. Pearson said.\n\nThe analysts said the IRS can rely on other compliance tools until the 1095 forms are ready, such as credit reporting from Equifax and W-2 forms that provide paper trails of health care coverage.\n\nAlso, the administration has noted that filers who lie on their returns are subject to perjury charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heidi Savage's clients felt like they received an extra Christmas gift last week when the Treasury Department said large employers would have an extra couple of months to complete and file a series of complex tax forms under Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Heidi Savage\u2019s clients felt like they received an extra Christmas gift last week when the Treasury Department said large employers would have an extra couple of months to complete and file a series of complex tax forms under Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare tax forms: Treasury Department gives large employers two-month reprieve", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/3/obamacare-tax-forms-treasury-department-gives-larg/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/03/Treasury.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/03/Treasury.jpg", "description": "Heidi Savage's clients felt like they received an extra Christmas gift last week when the Treasury Department said large employers would have an extra couple of months to complete and file a series of", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare tax forms: Treasury Department gives large employers two-mon"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "Heidi Savage\u2019s clients felt like they received an extra Christmas gift last week when the Treasury Department said large employers would have an extra couple of months to complete and file a series of complex tax forms under Obamacare.\nThe reprieve, which the Treasury Department announced Dec. 28, gives companies until March 31 \u2014 two months longer than anticipated \u2014 to report to their employees, and until June to report that information to the IRS.\nThe Treasury said it delayed the reporting rules after the business community said it needs more time to compile the information and that the requirements are overwhelming human resources departments.\nIt also offered stand-alone software to help firms comply with the health care coverage rules without completely overhauling their workforce systems.\nCompanies have never grappled with this type of reporting before, and by many accounts the process is painstaking."}
