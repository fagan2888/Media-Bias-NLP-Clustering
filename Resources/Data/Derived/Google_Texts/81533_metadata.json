For the past thirty years, the NICU has operated inside the same single room.\u201cYou can hear other alarms going off and it distracts you or it can upset your baby,\u201d Clevenger said. \u201cYou just get like a negative mindset \u2026and all the fear you can have in here.\u201dRight now, all that separates one family from the next are curtians, but in the new building patients and families will have actual rooms and a lot more space.In total, an additional 300,000 square feet of more space will be added to the new ten story $130,000,000 patient tower. The tower will not only house the new NICU, but also a women's and children's hospital, more than 120 private patient rooms and a new neuroscience department.Hospital staff said it's an expansion that's necessary due to the nationwide expansion of healthcare.\u201cNow that we have the Affordable Care Act nationwide, more people are going to be accessing healthcare and so we need to be able to be ready for them and to be able to serve them,\u201d said Michelle Leroux with CoxHealth.That will also require at least 75 additional staff members working in the hospital\u2019s dietary services, environmental services and patient safety departments.\u201cThis hospital is progressive. We're able to foresee things down the road of what our medical needs are for our community,\u201d Leroux said.The hospital plans to have an open house for the public at the end of June. Then officially open the new patient tower in July.For more information about upcoming hiring fairs for CoxHealth\u2019s new patient tower, please click here", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo.-- CoxHealth\u2019s South Medical Center expansion project has been a familiar sight on the south side of town, but should be finished soon.", "author": "Audrey Esther", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo.-- CoxHealth\u2019s South Medical Center expansion project has been a familiar sight on the south side of town, but should be finished soon.", "title": "Update on CoxHealth's Expansion Project, NICU Renovations", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/health-and-medical/update-on-coxhealths-expansion-project-nicu-reno", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2015/03/13/Story_375164_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "article": {"section": "Health and Medical", "tag": "home, news, top stories, health and medical", "published_time": "2015-03-13T23:39:07+0000", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T23:39:07+0000"}, "keywords": "home,news,top stories,health and medical", "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe01\"", "article_summary": "Then officially open the new patient tower in July.For more information about upcoming hiring fairs for CoxHealth\u2019s new patient tower, please click here\nFor the past thirty years, the NICU has operated inside the same single room.\u201cYou can hear other alarms going off and it distracts you or it can upset your baby,\u201d Clevenger said.\nWe're able to foresee things down the road of what our medical needs are for our community,\u201d Leroux said.The hospital plans to have an open house for the public at the end of June.\nSpringfield, Mo.\n\u201cYou just get like a negative mindset \u2026and all the fear you can have in here.\u201dRight now, all that separates one family from the next are curtians, but in the new building patients and families will have actual rooms and a lot more space.In total, an additional 300,000 square feet of more space will be added to the new ten story $130,000,000 patient tower."}
