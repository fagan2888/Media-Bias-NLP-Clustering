ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - A woman died Sunday morning after the vehicle she was traveling in stalled on a North Texas interstate after crashing into a barrier and was hit by a Greyhound bus. More than a dozen people on the bus and the other occupant of the vehicle were injured, authorities said.

The accident happened about 5:30 a.m. on Interstate 30, Arlington Police spokesman Lt. Christopher Cook said.

Greyhound spokeswoman Lanesha Gipson says there were 40 passengers and a driver aboard the bus, which was headed from Dallas to Amarillo. Sixteen people sustained injuries that weren’t life-threatening, Cook said.

It wasn’t clear if the deceased woman was the driver or passenger of the sport utility vehicle. Cook said a man in the vehicle was taken to the hospital with serious injuries.

Cook said that just minutes before the bus hit the vehicle, authorities had gotten a call that a vehicle being driven erratically had hit a concrete barrier and become disabled. He said authorities are trying to determine what caused the erratic driving.

The westbound lanes of Interstate 30 were closed while police investigated and reopened at about 1:30 p.m.

Gipson said another bus picked up the remaining passengers to take them on to Amarillo.
