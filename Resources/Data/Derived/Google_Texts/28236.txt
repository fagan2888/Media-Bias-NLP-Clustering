Mike Huckabee announces presidential run, promises to take U.S. ‘from hope to higher ground’

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee became the sixth GOP presidential candidate to officially enter the race Tuesday.

Huckabee, who delivered remarks on the campus of the University of Arkansas Community College in his hometown of Hope, Ark., told a chanting crowd, “I announce that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.”

He emphasized his commitment to taking America “from hope to higher ground,” touching on the economy, our nation’s veterans, the “monster” of Obamacare, ISIS and other issues deserving of focus.

The 59-year-old politician ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2008, and though he saw success in the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee was ultimately beat by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).

After his campaign launch Tuesday, Huckabee will travel to Iowa to embark on his “Factories, Farms and Freedom” tour, from which he will travel to South Carolina to deliver remarks on economic opportunity Friday, according to USA TODAY.

Huckabee served as governor of Arkansas between 1996 to 2007, years after former President Bill Clinton held the same title.

While not at the head of the GOP pack, Huckabee has strong favorability ratings and is rather popular among conservative Millennials. A Harvard University Institute of Politics poll released last week has Huckabee tied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for third place among Republicans ages 18 to 29 behind Dr. Ben Carson and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.
