Some researchers over at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco have discovered a new blend of meds that might make you compassionate enough to hand over your spare change to a homeless person without flinching.Imaginekind of Utopia. During their study, researchers found that consuming a drug which changes the \"neurochemical balance in the prefrontal cortex of the brain\" will lead to a greater willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors, such as caring about whether resources are divided more equally (Obamacare!).\n\nThe study was published this week in the journal, participants on two separate visits received a pill containing either a placebo or tolcapone, a drug that prolongs the effects of dopamine, a brain chemical that controls your reward and pleasure centers. Participants then played a simple economic game in which they divided money between themselves and an anonymous recipient. After receiving tolcapone, participants divided the money with the strangers in a fairer, more egalitarian way than after receiving the placebo.\u201cWe typically think of fair-mindedness as a stable characteristic, part of one\u2019s personality,\u201d said Ming Hsu, a co-principal investigator and assistant professor at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. \u201cOur study doesn\u2019t reject this notion, but it does show how that trait can be systematically affected by targeting specific neurochemical pathways in the human brain.\u201dNeither the 35 participants, which included 18 women, nor study staff members knew which pills contained the placebo or tolcapone, an FDA-approved drug used to treat people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement and muscle control.Computational modeling showed Hsu and his colleagues that under tolcapone\u2019s influence, game players were more sensitive to and less tolerant of social inequity, the perceived relative economic gap between a study participant and a stranger, UC Berkeley reports \u201cWe have taken an important step toward learning how our aversion to inequity is influenced by our brain chemistry,\u201d said Ignacio S\u00e1ez, a postdoctoral researcher at the Haas School of Business. \u201cStudies in the past decade have shed light on the neural circuits that govern how we behave in social situations.
