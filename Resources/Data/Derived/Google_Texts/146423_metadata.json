The point is a spawning ground for herring, an important forage fish for salmon. In the Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855, the Lummi Nation reserved the right to harvest marine resources here and elsewhere in its usual and accustomed territory \u2013 and under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, treaties are \u201cthe supreme law of the land.\u201d\n\nAs an indigenous nation with a government-to government relationship with the United States, the Lummi Nation\u2019s opposition to the Gateway Pacific Terminal carries some weight. And supporters are stepping up their efforts on behalf of the project as the Army Corps of Engineers readies its decision on whether to deny the permit now, as Lummi has requested, based on alleged negative impacts to treaty fishing rights; or continue a study of the project\u2019s environmental impacts and base the decision on that, as Gateway Pacific\u2019s proponents want.\n\nInformation presented by proponents is somewhat skewed, and that\u2019s not an editorial statement.\n\nIn their announcement of the Crow Nation\u2019s potential 5 percent investment in the Gateway Pacific project \u2013 the Crow Nation sees the export terminal as a portal to Asian markets for coal mined from its lands \u2014 Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Ryan Zinke, both Republicans of Montana, touted the participation of a \u201cbipartisan group\u201d of 16 senators and 17 House members in urging the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the environmental assessment. But all but one in that group, a representative from Texas, are Republicans.\n\nSSA Marine commissioned Elway Research to gauge public support for the export terminal, but downplayed opposition to the project. In an email blast, SSA Marine touted the results of the survey of 502 Washington voters: 61 percent said the environmental assessment should be completed, and 25 percent said Lummi\u2019s request that the environmental assessment be stopped should be denied. However, the poll doesn\u2019t note how many people supported Lummi\u2019s request \u2013 presumably 61 percent, since 14 percent responded \u201cDon't know/Not applicable,\u201d according to the email blast.\n\nIn addition, the touted results didn\u2019t note where poll respondents live; residents on the eastern and western sides of the Cascade mountain range would have different views on the issue because they would be impacted differently.\n\nHere\u2019s the status: Earlier this year, the Lummi Nation asked the Corps of Engineers to deny SSA Marine a permit to build the coal export terminal on the shores of Cherry Point because it believes the impacts to treaty fishing cannot be mitigated. Approval of the permit, Lummi argues, would be a violation of treaty rights.\n\nSSA Marine filed a response to Lummi\u2019s request. The Lummi Nation expects to file a defense of its request by the end of August. One source said the Corps of Engineers could issue a decision on Lummi\u2019s request in October at the earliest.\n\nStrong response\n\nSSA Marine claims its terminal is designed to minimize environmental impacts. A site map shows extensive buffering, enclosed rotary dumpers, on-site stormwater treatment, and covered or enclosed conveyors.\n\nBut opponents worry about the risk from increased rail and shipping traffic. In January 2014, seven cars of a 152-car train derailed near mainland Vancouver, British Columbia, spilling coal into a protected waterway where salmon spawn and an endangered turtle species makes its home.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some history. In 2013, SSA Marine paid $1.6 million in penalties and fees for illegally filling 1.2 acres of wetlands at Cherry Point, destroying another three acres of wetlands, and clearing nine acres of land, in the process degrading a Lummi ancestral village site.\n\nBallew said the United States\u2019 first responsibility is to protect treaty rights. He responded strongly to efforts by Daines, a member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, to ease the permit-approval process through a rider attached to a bill related to Affordable Care Act employer mandates.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you fail to fully appreciate the U.S. government's obligation to protect and preserve our Treaty Fishing Rights,\u201d Ballew wrote to Daines. \u201cThese rights cannot be easily ignored by the federal government. In exchange for relinquishing our aboriginal lands, we negotiated the guarantee of certain rights. Among other things, we retained the right to fish in our usual and accustomed waters. For the Lummi and other tribes in our region, the preservation of Treaty Fishing Rights in our treaties with the United States was, and is, extremely important.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Treaty Fishing Right guarantees both harvest of fish and access to our usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations. The proposed development of the Gateway Pacific Terminal would gravely deny access to our fishing resources.\u201d\n\nBallew wrote that the United States\u2019 trust responsibility to uphold treaty rights requires that the Corps analyze the Gateway Pacific Terminal\u2019s possible impacts on treaty fishing rights. \u201cAs a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, you should be an advocate for honoring treaty rights,\u201d Ballew wrote.\n\n\u201cAny effort to affect the scope or administrative relevance of any Indian treaty rights should be addressed \u2013 if at all \u2013 in open meetings of the Senate and House Indian Affairs committees with full and fair engagement of the Lummi Nation and other affected tribes. If you are so compelled, I urge you to take the more honorable path of pursuing any of your proposed changes to the Corps' regulatory process through standard practice as opposed to \u2018middle-of-the night\u2019 legislative changes.\u201d\n\nBallew wrote to Daines \u2013 and reiterated it to ICTMN \u2013 that the Lummi Nation will fight the project \u201cvigorously by all means necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn times past, our Nation and its leaders did not have the resources and were unable to stop prior efforts to construct commercial terminals in our region. That day is no more. While we may not like it, we are committed to fully utilizing the federal agency review process and the federal courts to address our concerns.\u201d\n\nPrevious use of legislative rider\n\nDaines\u2019 attempted use of a late addition to an unrelated bill to push through a change to environmental policy is not a first.\n\nDuring the budget session at the end of 2014, Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Arizona Republicans, attached a last-minute rider to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015 that transferred around 2,400 acres of the Tonto National Forest \u2013 land considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe \u2013 to Resolution Copper, a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto international mining corporation.\n\nRELATED: Legislation for Rio Tinto Copper Mine on Sacred Land Slips Into Defense Bill\n\nResolution Copper plans a $64 billion mining operation that would take place over 60 years. Opponents say the mining operation will create a two-mile-wide hole and result in toxic tailings, or mining wastes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lummi Nation is ready to fight the proposed Gateway Pacific coal export terminal at Cherry Point \u2013 a sacred place to the tribe.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/24/lummi-chairman-we-will-fight-coal-terminal-all-means-necessary-161503", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cherry_point_washington_-_courtesy_noaa.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Lummi Chairman: We Will Fight Coal Terminal \u2018By All Means Necessary\u2019"}, "abstract": "The Lummi Nation is ready to fight the proposed Gateway Pacific coal export terminal at Cherry Point \u2013 a sacred place to the tribe.", "dc": {"title": "Lummi Chairman: We Will Fight Coal Terminal \u2018By All Means Necessary\u2019"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/24/lummi-chairman-we-will-fight-coal-terminal-all-means-necessary-161503", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Tim Ballew, Lummi Nation, Gateway Pacific Coal Terminal, Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855, Government-to-Government Relationship, Sovereignty, Army Corps of Engineers, Treaty Fishing Rights, Sen.
