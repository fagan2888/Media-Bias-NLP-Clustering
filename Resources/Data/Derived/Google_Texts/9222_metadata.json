And note that some of those Republicans gave paid speeches while running for office.\n\nResponding to a speech inquiry from the press, Clinton recently said she\u2019d release the transcripts \u201cif everybody does it, and that includes the Republicans.\u201d The Times deemed that to be a \u201cterrible answer\u201d and seemed to suggest all other candidates don\u2019t have to disclose their speech transcripts, only Clinton.\n\n\u201cPublic interest in these speeches is legitimate, and it is the public \u2014 not the candidate \u2014 who decides how much disclosure is enough,\u201d the Times instructed, focused only at Clinton.\n\nAnd that\u2019s always been the giveaway on this gotcha pursuit: If the point is to demand more transparency from candidates (and that\u2019s a good thing), then all candidates would be asked to do the same thing. If the point is to hold Clinton to a separate standard that nobody else has to match, then publish editorials demanding she jump through hoops that every other candidate is allowed to walk around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidates can give all the paid speeches they please.
