Since being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, singer-actress Demi Lovato has been vocal about her journey, as well as the importance of mental health care. So it’s fitting Lovato is now the face of the "Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Health" campaign.

"Be Vocal" was launched by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, as well as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, JED, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the National Council for Behavioral Health. The campaign aims to encourage people across America to use their voice to support and lessen the stigma attached to mental health care. Of the many things Lovato has learned is she’s not alone: An estimated 44 million adults are diagnosed with a mental health condition each year.

“It’s not something that anyone should be ashamed of,” Lovato said. “The more people talk about it, the more people can come out and get the help they need.”

Just last year Lovato urged congress to pass a mental health care bill. She, like many advocates, believes it’s time for there to be a comprehensive bill that gets across how much mental health matters. A recent report from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) concluded there’s still a long road ahead before mental health care and medical care achieve true parity. It’s one of the many things Lovato hopes to help achieve with this campaign.
