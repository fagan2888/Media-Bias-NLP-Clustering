First and foremost they are both Republican. Trump\u2019s platform supports those the assemblyman wants to change for Nevadan residents. The main topics are Common Core State Standards and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is also known as Obama Care.\n\nNevada ranks as one of the lowest in the nation for student performance and Republicans attribute this to many things. Common Core is one of the most discussed issues. Jones, as well as many other Republican representatives and candidates, believe that the standards set within the program do nothing to promote increased student success.\n\nRepublicans stand strong against the Affordable Care Act as a violation of the constitution. In Nevada, the Silver State Exchange Act is the name for their ACA program. According to Jones\u2019 website, in 2011, 69 percent of the voters opposed the act in Nov. 2011. Jones empathically states the ACA is not affordable. Additionally, Republicans contend the federal government does not have the right to force its citizenry to become medically insured, it is unconstitutional. This is their stance even though in June 2012 the United States Supreme Court ruled the ACA is constitutionally sound.\n\nThis endorsement is the second Trump received this week. On Jan. 20, 2016, Sarah Palin, a Tea Party Republican, also announced her support for the presidential candidate.\n\nBy Cathy Milne\n\nSources:\n\nBrent Jones: Public Announcement\n\nBrent Jones Website: Issues\n\nCore Standards Website: Development Process\n\nImage Courtesy of Thomas Hawk\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Brent Jones, who is currently running, as the incumbent, for Nevada Assembly District 35, announced today, Jan. 21, 2016, he is endorsing Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump.
