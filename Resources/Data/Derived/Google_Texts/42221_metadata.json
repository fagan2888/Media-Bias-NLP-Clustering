We need farmers to help grow them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high tech, zero carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the clean energy age.\u201d\n\nObama added, \u201cWe can do this. We can make a difference. You can make a difference. And the sooner you do, the better.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, he also announced that a $1 billion competitive fund was being created for communities that were being impacted by severe weather.\n\nAbout 8,000 undergraduates and graduate students were expected to be awarded degrees during Saturday\u2019s ceremony, which was the only graduation President Obama was scheduled to speak at this year.\n\nA number of students said prior to the ceremony they were excited that the president would be delivering the commencement address to the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been my dream to see the president, and having him here at my college graduation is just a great honor,\u201d said student Charles Carpio.\n\nSome said politics didn\u2019t factor into their excitement.\n\n\u201cPeople are like, \u2018oh that\u2019s just Obama, it\u2019s just Obama, you know, Obamacare this, Obamacare that,\u2019 but I don\u2019t really care, \u201canother graduating student said. \u201cThis is the President of the United States.
