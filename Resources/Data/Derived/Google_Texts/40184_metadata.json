Hershey\u2019s cited two products in the lawsuit, both of which use not only the well-branded names but also the designs: Mr. Dankbar, a pun on Mr. Goodbar, and Reefer\u2019s Cups, which mimics Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups.\n\nAn employee of the pot dispenser, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Conscious Care had no comment on the lawsuit and then implied the non-profit carried no responsibility for the products named in the lawsuit. \u201cIt\u2019s not even our product,\u201d she told Raw Story. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we carry. So it\u2019s a vendor, it\u2019s not even us.\u201d She added that the Reefer\u2019s Cups and Mr. Dankbars had sold out months ago.\n\n\u201cThe Hershey Company\u2019s trademarks are iconic and among our company\u2019s most important assets,\u201d Jeff Beckman, a spokesperson for The Hershey Company, told KIRO 7. He noted that his company has filed a similar lawsuit against a company in Colorado, adding, \u201cThese entities have used Hershey\u2019s trademarks, without authorization, to trade on Hershey\u2019s goodwill and reputation, and to draw greater attention to their products; these unauthorized uses of Hershey\u2019s trademarks also make the products more appealing to children.\u201d\n\nOn the day following the Hershey lawsuit, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) highlighted recent research showing that marijuana can be addictive with the risk of addiction higher among younger users (and daily users). The NIH focused on marijuana\u2019s harmful effects in teens, citing the results of a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists theorize that, as the brain is rapidly developing during the teen years, this might explain the increased risks from using cannabis at this stage. In fact, research suggests marijuana impairs critical thinking and memory functions during use and that these deficits persist for days after using. The NIH also noted another recent long-term study also showed that regular marijuana use in the early teen years lowers IQ into adulthood, even if users subsequently stopped smoking marijuana.\n\n\u201cIncreasing efforts should be directed toward delaying the onset of cannabis use by young people, particularly given the recent trend of younger ages of cannabis-use initiation in the United States and evidence that fewer adolescents believe that cannabis use is associated with serious health risk,\u201d wrote the authors of this study.\n\nHershey's, then, may be doing us all a favor by de-identifying pot with candy. Along with the two copycat Hershey products, Conscious Care also retails a number of products that mimic other popular snacks and sweets, including Gummy Bears, Cap\u2019n Crunch, Rice Krispie treats, and Goldfish crackers.\n\nSeattle's Cannabis Kitchen Gold Fish Crackers Courtesy of Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hershey, marijuana, mr. goodbar, reese's, seattle conscious care cooperative, cannabis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Hershey Company filed a federal lawsuit against Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative, a non-profit medical marijuana dispensary, for trademark infringement.", "title": "Hershey Isn't Happy A Pot Shop Sells 'Reefer's Cups'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hershey-sues-seattle-medical-marijuana-dispensary-trademark-infringement-286790", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/mr-dankbar.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Hershey Company filed a federal lawsuit against Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative, a non-profit medical marijuana dispensary, for trademark infringement.", "title": "Hershey Isn't Happy A Pot Shop Sells 'Reefer's Cups'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hershey-sues-seattle-medical-marijuana-dispensary-trademark-infringement-286790", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/mr-dankbar.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/mr-dankbar.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-06-06T11:31:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T11:31:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Hershey Company filed a federal lawsuit against Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative, a non-profit medical marijuana dispensary, for trademark infringement."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafe7\"", "article_summary": "The Hershey Company on Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit against Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative, a non-profit medical marijuana dispensary based in Washington, for trademark infringement.\n\u201cThe Hershey Company\u2019s trademarks are iconic and among our company\u2019s most important assets,\u201d Jeff Beckman, a spokesperson for The Hershey Company, told KIRO 7.\nAlong with the two copycat Hershey products, Conscious Care also retails a number of products that mimic other popular snacks and sweets, including Gummy Bears, Cap\u2019n Crunch, Rice Krispie treats, and Goldfish crackers.\nSeattle's Cannabis Kitchen Gold Fish Crackers Courtesy of Seattle Conscious Care Cooperative\nIn fact, research suggests marijuana impairs critical thinking and memory functions during use and that these deficits persist for days after using."}
