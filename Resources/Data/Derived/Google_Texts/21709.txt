Three people are dead following a crash Friday afternoon in Butler County.

The crash happened around 1:30 p.m. on Highway 54 east of Rosalia. That's near the Greenwood County line.

Lt. C.J. Schreiber said a Ford focus was heading east; the other, a Toyota pickup, was heading west when they collided head-on. The third, a Chevy pickup, was hit by debris from the accident.

Two females and one male in the eastbound vehicle were killed, and a fourth person suffered serious injuries. One person in the westbound vehicle was also seriously hurt.

The Kansas Highway Patrol identified the victims from Wichita as 45-year-old Charla Straws, 35-year-old Caesare Smith and 48-year-old Sonja Roubideaux.

The two injured people were taken to Wichita hospitals for treatment. It's been confirmed that 21-year-old Jacob Berndt of Wichita, occupant of the Ford, was taken to St. Francis. Robert Schindler of Madison, Driver of the Toyota, was taken to Wesley Medical.

There's no word yet on what caused the crash. Highway 54 was closed well into the evening hours.
