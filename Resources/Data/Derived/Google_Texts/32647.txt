FOX NEWS INSIDER - In Monday night’s studio audience special, Sean Hannity explored the political rhetoric being used by Democrats following the battle over ObamaCare and the government shutdown. A recent political ad shows Dems calling Republicans everything from “legislative arsonists” to “hostage-takers.”

Former Congressional candidate Mia Love argued that such dialogue is all about political posturing and has “nothing to do with the future of our children.” She cited that with the government takeover of healthcare and education, her 12-year-old daughter will be looking at an average annual tuition of $150,000. “All of this that’s happening is throwing our kids under the bus and we have got to do what we can to preserve their opportunities.”

Former Miss America Kirsten Haglund said that both Democrats and Republicans are simply appealing to their base. “They’re more concerned with winning the political war and winning public opinion than actual consequences.”

Ari Fleischer argued that the real responsibility lies with the president. “The tone he’s setting has been a divisive one almost from the start. But Republicans have contributed to it as well, Sean. I think it’s incumbent on all to figure out how to get out of it.”
