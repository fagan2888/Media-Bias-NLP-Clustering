Little did she know at the time, she would embark on a career in psychiatry.\n\n\u201cI had the intention of doing something different, but I had always done some counseling of people. In my third year of medical school when you start doing rotations in the different specialties, it turned out I enjoyed psychiatry the most and decided to do that. I enjoy getting to know people, really know, and in a lot of specialties in medicine you really don\u2019t. We get to spend time with people, get to know them and help them.\u201d\n\nDickson worked for the Veterans Administration in New York and transferred to the VA in Las Vegas 12 years ago where she worked for four years before retiring from her position and going into private practice.\n\nDickson heads a professional organization in Nevada with 145 members, a little more than half of the psychiatrists in the state, which if including residents totals about 280.\n\nThe organization works with elected officials to advocate legislation and funding for psychiatric needs in Nevada to improve mental health. It also hosts conferences with speakers coming throughout the U.S. and abroad as part of continuing education programs for its members to help with their management of psychiatric illnesses.\n\nPsychiatrists are physicians who went to medical school and obtained their medical degree. They do a four-year residency after medical school specializing in psychiatry and have the ability to prescribe medicine. By contrast, a psychologist has a doctorate or master\u2019s degree and provides therapy but can\u2019t prescribe medicine.\n\n\u201cWhen I started and finished my training in 1986, we got a lot more training in doing psychotherapy and we were able to do more of it,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cIt has changed where there are time constraints where you have to see a lot of patients in a short period of time so we have less time to spend with our patients. We do focus more on medication management.\u2019\u2019\n\nWith psychotherapy now become the focus of psychologists, the two professions complement each other to take care of patients, Dickson said.\n\nPsychologists tend to defer the treatment of serious mental illnesses like bipolar and schizophrenia and major depression where medications make a significant difference, Dickson said. Other problems, however, such as post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders respond well to psychotherapy, she said.\n\nPsychiatrists focus on diagnosing and treating mental illness from a biological point of view, Dickson says. They\u2019re experts in the workings of the brain and use medications to adjust what\u2019s going on in the brain that might improve the symptoms whether they are people who are bipolar, manic depressive or some other chemical imbalance, she says.\n\n\u201cBecause we are physicians we can also look at whether different kind of medical problems like thyroid disease that might causing what looks like a psychiatric problem but isn\u2019t because a lot of the symptoms overlap,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWe can order blood tests and interpret them in terms of understanding what\u2019s going on. A lot of us work in hospitals doing in-patient psychiatry, which is taking care of the sicker patients with more severe mental illnesses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/chief-professional-organization-derives-satisfaction", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "BUCK WARGO Southern Nevada Business of medicine", "parsely-title": "Chief of professional organization derives satisfaction from helping people", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_PSYCHE-DOCTORS_002.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "For Lesley Dickson and her profession, the job satisfaction comes from getting to know people and help them.
