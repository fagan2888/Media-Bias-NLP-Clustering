One of the beautiful things about Donald Trump as a political speaker is that he's blissfully unburdened by professionalism or tact or any of the other constraints non-billionaire advocates face. This was made abundantly clear during Trump's speech at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) today. Trump jumped from conservative red meat topic to conservative red meat topic, touching on the national debt, Obamacare, Democrats' "weak" leadership, and entitlement reform in a matter of minutes. But his strongest approbation seemed reserved for advocates of immigration reform.

"You either have a country or you don't; you have borders or you don't. If we don’t have a border, what are we — just a nothing?"

Trump went on to talk about how not one of the "11 million that will grow to 30 million" would ever, ever vote for a Republican. He then added offhandedly:

"They're taking your jobs and you better be careful."

Well, okay. Tell us how you really feel, Donald, darling... For a more libertarian solution to immigration reform, check out Ed Krayewski's latest. Trump and his ilk may never be convinced, but incremental, libertarian-minded immigration reform could appeal to both liberals and conservatives more interested in human rights and economic realities than pinning our unemployment problems on those meddling immigrants.

For the record, Trump also thinks Jimmy Carter is dead.
