When you do this the pattern is weaker but basically the same: Real revenue growth 36 percent in the 8 years before Reagan, 26 percent under Reagan, 28 percent in the years following.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast summer the editorial page editor of the Kansas City Star declared that she won\u2019t be running any more op-eds by Stephen Moore, chief economist of the Heritage Foundation. She had cause: Moore had published an article that purported to refute my debunking of claims about the miraculous effects of tax cuts, but all of his numbers were wrong \u2014 they didn\u2019t cover the time period he claimed, there were further inexplicable errors of fact, and all of the errors, surprise, tilted the supposed results in the direction he wanted.\n\nBut while the Kansas City Star may have had enough of Moore, the door is always open at the Washington Post.\n\nAs PGL at Econospeak points out, Moore\u2019s latest contains one outright lie \u2014 and it\u2019s a lie about yours truly. Moore declares that\n\nCritics such as economist Paul Krugman object that rapid growth during the Reagan years was driven more by conventional Keynesian deficit spending than by reductions in tax rates.\n\nNo, I\u2019ve never said that. I\u2019ve written many times that both the 1979-82 slump and the recovery thereafter were driven by monetary policy:\n\nThe architect of America\u2019s great disinflation was Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman. In fact, Mr. Volcker began the process in 1979, when he adopted the tight monetary policy that caused that record unemployment rate. He was also mainly responsible for the recovery that followed: it was his decision to loosen up on the money supply in the summer of 1982 that set the stage for the rebound a few months later.\n\nThe main reason recovery has been slower since the 2008 crisis is that we\u2019ve hit the zero lower bound, preventing the kind of dramatic monetary loosening that took place in 1982, and also that we\u2019ve seen unprecedented fiscal austerity. Oh, and I predicted the slow recovery in advance.\n\nStill, did Moore get any numbers wrong this time? Not exactly \u2014 but he did do his best to convey a false impression. He declares that under Reagan\n\nthe government\u2019s budget numbers show that tax receipts expanded from $517 billion in 1980 to $909 billion in 1988 \u2014 close to a 75 percent change (25 percent after inflation).\n\nI have a suspicion that the Post forced him to include the inflation-adjusted number, rather than let him get away with the gee-whiz nominal number, which is, um, inflated by the relatively high rate of inflation that prevailed even in the later Reagan years. In any case, however, Moore offers no context, leaving the impression that this was an extraordinary achievement.\n\nSo I looked at real federal receipts over a longer period, shown above using a log scale so that the slope of the line represents the rate of growth. If you take the period Reagan was in the White House, 1981:1 to 1989:1, I get an increase of 14.3 percent; I\u2019m not sure why Moore\u2019s number is bigger, but never mind. What you might want to do, however, is compare that performance with the 8 years preceding and the 8 years following. And here\u2019s what we get:\n\n1973:1-1981:1: 30.3%\n\n1981:1-1989:1: 14.3%\n\n1989:1-1997:1: 31.4%\n\nLaffer roolz! Or maybe not.\n\nDoes the WaPo mind being used as a platform for deliberately deceptive innuendo, with some plain old falsehoods thrown in for good measure?", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141227152316, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003420420, "DISPLAYDATE": "December 27, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Lies, Damned Lies, and Reaganolatry ( 20141227 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "There he goes again.", "title": "Lies, Damned Lies, and Reaganolatry", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/lies-damned-lies-and-reaganolatry/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "There he goes again.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 27, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1419711796, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T14:41:32-05:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20141228144132, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141227, "pdate": 20141227, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "There he goes again.", "title": "Lies, Damned Lies, and Reaganolatry", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/lies-damned-lies-and-reaganolatry/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/lies-damned-lies-and-reaganolatry/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Lies, Damned Lies, and Reaganolatry", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "But while the Kansas City Star may have had enough of Moore, the door is always open at the Washington Post.\nAs PGL at Econospeak points out, Moore\u2019s latest contains one outright lie \u2014 and it\u2019s a lie about yours truly.\nHe declares that under Reaganthe government\u2019s budget numbers show that tax receipts expanded from $517 billion in 1980 to $909 billion in 1988 \u2014 close to a 75 percent change (25 percent after inflation).\nIn fact, Mr. Volcker began the process in 1979, when he adopted the tight monetary policy that caused that record unemployment rate.\nIf you take the period Reagan was in the White House, 1981:1 to 1989:1, I get an increase of 14.3 percent; I\u2019m not sure why Moore\u2019s number is bigger, but never mind."}
