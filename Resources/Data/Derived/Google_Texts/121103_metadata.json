Young / The Detroit News, file)Buy Photo\n\nGov. Rick Snyder said Monday he would ask the Republican-controlled Legislature to create a state-run health exchange if a key part of the Affordable Care Act does not survive a legal challenge.\n\nBut U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday she believes the Obama administration and the health care law will survive the challenge before the U.S. Supreme Court and declared health reform a success.\n\nBurwell\u2019s comments follow testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court last week in the case of King v. Burwell, which challenges whether federal tax credits can be paid to Americans in the 34 states \u2014 including Michigan \u2014 with health insurance exchanges run by the federal government. Plaintiffs argue that the law only allows tax credits in the 16 states that run their own health insurance marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that we will prevail in the court case argued last week before the Supreme Court,\u201d Burwell said Monday. \u201cThe law is clear. The text and structure of the Affordable Care Act demonstrate that individuals in every state are eligible for tax credits.\u201d\n\nMichigan is among seven states whose health exchanges are run by a state-federal partnership. Three states have federally supported marketplaces, and 27 have federally facilitated exchanges.\n\nIn an interview that aired Monday on Michigan Public Radio Network stations, Snyder said it will be a \u201chuge issue\u201d if Michigan residents are no longer able to qualify for the incentives. He said U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, is leading discussion of a possible congressional solution if the tax credits are denied.\n\nShort of that, Snyder said he would ask the Republican-controlled Legislature to make Michigan\u2019s a state-run exchange.\n\n\u201cThat raises the issue, should we be looking at a state exchange, and that\u2019s a dialogue I\u2019d have to have with the Legislature,\u201d Snyder told MPR\u2019s Rick Pluta.\n\nThe Legislature previously rejected that approach.\n\nBurwell Monday said nearly 11.7 million Americans signed up or were re-enrolled through the Marketplace through Feb. 22.\n\n\u201cWhile we know that number will change as the year continues, we are pleased with the results to date,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nAccording to Burwell, more than half of those who enrolled through HealthCare.gov were new customers. Of the 4.2 million consumers who were re-enrolled, more than half, or about 2.2 million, came back to the marketplace, updated their information and actively selected a plan.\n\nNearly 7.7 million individuals \u2014 or 87 percent \u2014 who selected a plan through HealthCare.gov qualified for an average tax credit of $263 per month. With that financial assistance, more than half paid $100 or less per month after tax credits, and 8 in 10 had such an option to do that.\n\n\u201cThese numbers show just how important the tax credits are to millions of Americans and to the insurance markets in those states and throughout the marketplace,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nBut an H&R Block analysis of early 2014 federal tax returns has found that some taxpayers are needing to refund part of their tax credit because they under-estimated the amount of money they would make last year. In returns through mid-February, the average amount to be paid back relating to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Advance Premium Tax Credit was $530, according to H&R Block.\n\nkbouffard@detroitnews.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1C01Rt0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
