In fact, according to the state Commission on Aging, a third of the state\u2019s residents are older than 50. An interactive map shows that by 2025, older adults will make up a fifth of every town\u2019s population, and they\u2019re going to need affordable homes.\n\nWhen Leslie Gordon was going through a divorce recently, she looked for a condo in Avon. Location was important, because Avon is where her sons would remain in the family home with their father, and she is co-owner of Be. Yoga on the town\u2019s Main Street.\n\nShe could afford a mortgage, but getting one was difficult because she\u2019d never owned a home on her own, and her business was less than two years old. With that, Gordon, 51, plunged into Connecticut\u2019s pricey rental housing pool.\n\nHow expensive is Connecticut? The state is the eighth-priciest rental market in the nation, according to Out of Reach, an annual report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nConnecticut is home to two of the nation\u2019s most expensive metro rental markets \u2013 Stamford-Norwalk, at number two, and Danbury, at number ten.\n\nThe state\u2019s housing wage, or the amount of money a worker must earn per hour in order to afford a decent, two-bedroom apartment, is a walloping $24.29. That means a minimum-wage employee would need to work 106 hours a week to afford a decent two-bedroom apartment.\n\nThe housing wage for Stamford-Norwalk is even higher: $37.37; in Danbury, it\u2019s $30.44.\n\nJoe Simons, who works to house Danbury residents who are homeless through a five-year-old organization called Off the Streets, has lived in the area for decades, and he hears the frustration of clients looking for affordable housing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Simons said. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond awful. I don\u2019t know how people live who are looking for rental places. You do the math, and it\u2019s so expensive that unless you\u2019ve got a really good job, it\u2019s really hard to afford any place unless you have two incomes.\u201d\n\nSimons said Danbury rentals are expensive \u2013 whether they\u2019re studios or two-bedroom.\n\n\u201cThe supply is very limited, and a lot of landlords are very particular about who they choose for tenants,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA lot of people -- even if they can afford a place -- sometimes will be rejected if they have enough income because they\u2019ll run a credit check, and have evictions in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something we have known and have needed to have planned for,\u201d said Julie Evans Starr, executive director of the Commission on Aging. \u201cWe recognize the need for community readiness on a lot of different levels.\u201d\n\nAnd part of that is making sure people can \u2013 if they choose \u2013 age in place.\n\nBut for that to happen, analysts say planners and developers have to start thinking about housing in a new way.\n\nResearch from the non-profit Partnership for Strong Communities said that 49 percent of Connecticut renters pay more than 30 percent of their household income on housing. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said 30 percent is a good target amount of household income spent on housing. If a household spends more than 30 percent, other necessities \u2013 food and health care among them \u2013 often go wanting.\n\nThe demand for rental properties has been growing over the last seven years \u2013 but the market has not kept up, said David Fink, Partnership policy director. (Roughly 34 percent of Connecticut households \u2013 or 447,000 households -- rent, up from 30 percent in 2007.)\n\nThat\u2019s challenging for individuals and families, but towns with high housing costs \u2013 and limited rental opportunities -- suffer, as well. A small rental market forces an out migration of Boomers looking to downsize, along with younger people (the Millennials) without sufficient capital to stay in expensive towns.\n\nAnd since a town\u2019s budget heavily relies on property taxes, a stagnant housing market can make offering sufficient town services challenging \u2013 which makes a town less attractive to new residents. When a town has too many unsold houses on the market, the grand list \u2013 or the total value of the real estate in town \u2013 drops. That\u2019s happened, said Fink, in 109 of the state\u2019s 169 towns. And in about 40 more, the grand list has stayed flat.\n\nTo make up the deficit, those towns can raise the mill rate, or reduce services, or both, said Fink. The alternative is going to the state and asking for more municipal aid, but in these lean times, that\u2019s not a viable option.\n\n\"This isn't just me not making enough money. ...It's a deeper social issue.\"\n\nLeslie Gordon\n\n\u201cLast I checked, the state is not able to increase that a lot,\u201d said Fink. \u201cA two-bedroom apartment in a high-resource town is either non-existent or it\u2019s there and it will cost you probably what your mortgage payment was. Healthy communities need all sorts of people, and those people need all sorts of housing.\u201d\n\nBack in Avon, Gordon eventually found a one-bedroom condo to rent for $950 a month \u2013 significantly less than the town\u2019s median gross rent of $1,268, according to the Partnership. It\u2019s a short bike ride to her workplace, but she\u2019s considering taking in a roommate once her lease is up, or she may house-sit. Meanwhile, she consoles herself that she\u2019s not alone.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are like me and I didn\u2019t really realize it,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s helped me to feel like this isn\u2019t just an isolated problem that I\u2019ve created myself, somehow. There are a lot of people who are really struggling -- not that that makes me feel better for my struggle, but it makes me feel normal with my struggle, it makes me feel like this isn\u2019t just me making this up. This isn\u2019t just me not making enough money. This isn\u2019t just me failing at whatever I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s a lot deeper than that. It\u2019s a deeper social issue, so I guess I would say, \u2018Chin up.\u2019 Let\u2019s get through this and figure out how to make it better.\u201d\n\nA good place to start, says Fink, is for towns to create a variety of housing for people up and down the economic ladder.\n\n\u201cIf towns can recognize that it\u2019s good for them to create the kinds of housing options that let the people who work in their communities live there, that lifts all boats,\u201d said Fink.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "No one is saying that Connecticut is suffering from a housing crisis, but consider this: The state has far too few rental properties, which means those", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/connecticut-caught-imperfect-storm-aging-population-and-high-rent", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201508/leslie_winter_gordon_housing_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "No one is saying that Connecticut is suffering from a housing crisis, but consider this: The state has far too few rental properties, which means those", "title": "Connecticut Caught in Imperfect Storm of Aging Population and High Rent"}, "story_id": 431868362, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@campbellsl"}, "author": "Susan Campbell", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Connecticut Caught in Imperfect Storm of Aging Population and High Rent"}, "nid": 44883, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "keywords": "The Daily, Connecticut, Fairfield Region, Hartford Region, housing, age, demographics, income", "wordCount": 1521, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "That trend can\u2019t continue because the state isn\u2019t getting any younger.\nWith that, Gordon, 51, plunged into Connecticut\u2019s pricey rental housing pool.\nThat\u2019s challenging for individuals and families, but towns with high housing costs \u2013 and limited rental opportunities -- suffer, as well.\nIn fact, according to the state Commission on Aging, a third of the state\u2019s residents are older than 50.\nThe state is the eighth-priciest rental market in the nation, according to Out of Reach, an annual report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition."}
