Monday night, the group of conservatives opted to keep that momentum going by re-electing Rep. Jim Jordan as chairman.\n\nWidely respected among the caucus, the Ohio Republican ran unopposed and was elected unanimously.\n\nAnother founding member of the caucus, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., said members believe that Jordan \u201chas done a fantastic job getting our group off the ground.\u201d They think the chairman \u201cdeserves the chance to lead for another year,\u201d Amash told The Daily Signal.\n\n>>> What Jordan Wants From a Ryan Speakership\n\nUnder Jordan\u2019s leadership, the upstart organization of Republican lawmakers has achieved significant victories in the House since it formed in January. The caucus of roughly 40 members sparked a speaker scramble, first helping to topple Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, then blocking his groomed replacement, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nDuring this leadership vacuum in October, while serving as chairman of the influential House Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he wouldn\u2019t run without the support of all three major party caucuses.\n\nJordan and a supermajority of the Freedom Caucus announced they would support Ryan, ensuring he had the 218 Republican votes needed to lock down the position of speaker, but only after securing key concessions on reform of House procedure and culture.\n\nComprising habitual agitators for rule changes, the caucus regularly calls for a decentralized approach to governing, one that empowers individual members and committees during the legislative process.\n\nSince his election last month as speaker, and with the prodding of the Freedom Caucus, Ryan has taken steps to change the way the House does business by opening up the legislative process and following what the lawmakers call regular order.\n\nAmash applauded Ryan for \u201cacting in good faith\u201d and honoring his promises. \u201cRyan deserves an opportunity to show us that he will operate differently than John Boehner,\u201d he said.\n\nJordan served as the glue keeping the caucus together, allowing lawmakers to push for reforms, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., said\n\nHuelskamp praised Jordan for proving that the group \u201ccan stick together\u201d and credited his leadership in \u201cchanging the speaker and changing the rules by which we pick committee assignments.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough job,\u201d Huelskamp said. \u201c[Jordan] has done a superb job, but he\u2019s done it in a way that\u2019s pretty low-key.\u201d\n\nThe election for Freedom Caucus chairman doesn\u2019t signal internal disagreement or restructuring. Caucus rules require an annual election, and only its board members are allowed to run for chairman.\n\nAlso Monday night, two of the nine board members, Ron DeSantis, R-Calif., and Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, stepped down. The caucus elected Reps. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., and Steve Pearce, R-S.C., to replace them.\n\nSources familiar with the workings of the caucus said the board serves in an advisory capacity, counseling the chairman and helping to set the group\u2019s agenda.\n\nLabrador will continue as an ex officio board member, while DeSantis stepped down to focus more time on his race for the Senate.\n\nWith Jordan back at the helm, the conservative group is looking to increase its influence over Congress.\n\nA founding member, Mark Meadows, R-S.C., last week announced an early draft of a legislative vision for Congress in 2016, dubbed \u201cContract with America II.\u201d A Meadows aide said the manifesto is still in the works but soon will be up for consideration among caucus members.\n\nFirst reported by Bloomberg News, the agenda outlines several priorities such as repealing Obamacare, reforming Medicare and Social Security, and ending the estate tax.\n\nIf the Freedom Caucus signs off, Jordan likely will push for implementation of the agenda during the first 100 days of 2016.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, declined to comment specifically on the caucus election Monday but said the speaker remains \u201ceager to work with all members of the Republican conference.\u201d\n\n>>> House Conservatives Band Together to Form New Group", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ohio Republican will stay at the helm of the fledgling caucus of conservatives that influenced the election of a new House speaker.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio Republican will stay at the helm of the fledgling caucus of conservatives that influenced the election of a new House speaker.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus Likes Jim Jordan's Style", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Jim-Jordan.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T18:17:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LjNXl2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio Republican will stay at the helm of the fledgling caucus of conservatives that influenced the election of a new House speaker.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus Likes Jim Jordan's Style", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Jim-Jordan.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-11-17T10:39:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T18:17:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, House Conservatives, Paul Ryan, Tim Huelskamp, Justin Amash, Ron DeSantis, Raul Labrador"}, "article_summary": "For months, the House Freedom Caucus has been shaking up Congress.\nIf the Freedom Caucus signs off, Jordan likely will push for implementation of the agenda during the first 100 days of 2016.\n\u201c[Jordan] has done a superb job, but he\u2019s done it in a way that\u2019s pretty low-key.\u201dThe election for Freedom Caucus chairman doesn\u2019t signal internal disagreement or restructuring.\nMonday night, the group of conservatives opted to keep that momentum going by re-electing Rep.
