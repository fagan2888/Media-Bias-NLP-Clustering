The group had insured some 51,000 Kentuckians, the last of whom will be covered by Jan. 31.\n\nMost individual and group plans were terminated Jan. 1 as the cooperative became the sixth nonprofit insurer to cease operations in 2015, joining co-ops in states like New York, Tennessee and Nevada to stop offering health coverage.\n\nKentucky Insurance Commissioner Brian Maynard called the situation facing the cooperative \u201cregrettable\u201d but necessary. Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd set a deadline to file claims for Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cOnce we determined the degree of financial hazard, the decision to move to liquidation was an easy one,\u201d Maynard, whom the judge appointed as liquidator, said in a statement. \u201cTo continue an attempt to rehabilitate the fund would increase the risk of loss, jeopardizing both creditors and policyholders.\u201d\n\nThe department expects the liquidation to take \u201cseveral years,\u201d according to frequently asked questions posted on its website. Liquidators will review all outstanding claims and pay based on Shepherd\u2019s orders once the co-op\u2019s assets have been collected, but some debts may go unresolved.\n\n\u201cWhile every attempt will be made to pay all debts in full, there is a possibility that some will be paid at a reduced rate or not at all,\u201d the department said in the website post.\n\nThe Kentucky Health Cooperative had received $146.5 million in federal loans since its launch in 2014, but it underestimated initial enrollment projections by 80.6 percent and suffered $50.4 million in net revenue losses in its first year, according to a federal audit.\n\nOfficials at the co-op said their losses had shrunk to about $4 million by mid-2015, but they announced plans to close the program after receiving 12.6 percent of its requested federal risk-corridor reimbursement.\n\nThe co-op\u2019s closure became a political topic in last year\u2019s gubernatorial election. While former Gov. Steve Beshear and former Attorney General Jack Conway, the Democratic nominee for governor, argued that the co-op\u2019s decision to close was inconsequential given the number of other insurers offering plans on the state\u2019s health exchange, Gov. Matt Bevin and other Republicans pointed to its demise as evidence of the federal health law\u2019s failures.\n\nHouse passes bill against continuous abuse of vulnerable victims\n\nThe state\u2019s House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill on Friday that would allow prosecutors to charge suspects with a continuous course of conduct against underage or otherwise vulnerable victims.\n\nHouse Bill 109, sent to the Senate on a 91-0 vote, would allow individuals to be charged with a continuous course of conduct in a number of crimes, such as rape, sexual abuse and human trafficking, against vulnerable victims if the offenses occurred at least twice over a specified time frame.\n\nRep. Joni Jenkins, D-Shively, said the bill came after a Kentucky Supreme Court decision last year overturning convictions against a man who abused and sodomized his 6-year-old stepdaughter \u201ctwo to three times a week during the five-month period her mother was deployed in the military.\u201d The high court ultimately ruled that the victim could not link exact acts with dates, she said.\n\n\u201cThe incidents occurred with such frequency and such twisted morality that acts were hard to distinguish,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201c\u2026 Think about a child that on a normal day may not remember that Halloween comes before Christmas. They can remember horrific acts that have been committed to them in some details but may not remember the specific date.\u201d\n\nA similar bill passed out of the Senate Judiciary committee on Thursday in Senate Bill 60. Sen. Whitney Westerfield, R-Hopkinsville, sponsors the legislation.\n\nHis opponent in last year\u2019s attorney general\u2019s race, Attorney General Andy Beshear, testified for HB 109 when it came before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nWesterfield said he was glad to get support from a number of advocates, including Beshear, when speaking with Pure Politics on Thursday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of advocacy groups that see the value in this,\u201d he said.\n\nInterview panel assembled for next KSP commissioner\n\nRep. Robert Benvenuti will chair a seven-member search committee for the next Kentucky State Police Commissioner.\n\nThe panel was announced Friday. Bevin\u2019s transition team has identified highly qualified candidates for the panel to interview, and the committee will present names for the governor\u2019s consideration, according to a news release.\n\nThe committee will include Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Secretary John Tilley, two current KSP officers, two retired KSP troopers and a community representative.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bevin wants to ensure that the law enforcement community has input and buy-in on the selection of its leader,\u201d Tilley said in a statement. \u201cThe committee makeup \u2013 in particular the four state troopers \u2013 will bring a unique and important perspective, drawing on their personal experiences, the experiences of their colleagues and the historical perspective of the agency.\u201d\n\nBenvenuti, R-Lexington, said he was honored to chair the committee and \u201chave the opportunity to support our men and women in uniform in this meaningful way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled that Governor Bevin and Secretary Tilley have asked me to be a part of this very important process,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nKSP Commissioner Rodney Brewer currently leads the agency.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "Weeks before the termination of its final health plan, a Franklin Circuit Court judge placed Kentucky\u2019s failed health cooperative into liquidation on Friday.\n\n\tThe Kentucky Department of Insurance, which put Kentucky Health Cooperative into rehabilitation Oct. 29, had requested that step as the...", "title": "The Chatter: Ky.
