Citizens who delayed their treatments are now able to afford the healthcare costs, eventually helping healthcare spending to move up. A report from PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s (PwC) Health Research Institute has forecasted a modest 6.8% increase in healthcare spending in 2015. Some may call the term \u2018modest\u2019 a misnomer as the forecasted growth is in stark contrast to the five-year contraction in costs the industry witnessed.\n\n\n\nAlong with the improving economy, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (:PPACA) or the Affordable Care Act (:ACA) or \u201cObamacare\u201d has also played significant role. Total health spending will probably trend up as more people can avail the insurance under ACA. The aging society, hospitals acquiring more in-house physicians and costly technologies are among other factors that may drive healthcare spending upward.\n\n\n\nBefore we suggest top-ranked healthcare funds, let\u2019s look at the healthcare spending forecast and the Obamacare effects.\n\n\n\nHealthcare Spending\n\n\n\nHealthcare spending is forecasted to rise 6.8% in 2015, up from a 6.5% increase expected this year. The increase may seem a bit tepid compared to double-digit growth in medical inflation recorded ahead of the economic downturn. However, this reverses the five-year contraction, thanks to economic recovery. Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute and the report\u2019s co-author said: \u201cNow that overall economy has improved and come back significantly, we see for 2015 that health spending is also loosening up\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis is largely due to Americans being in a better position to afford medical costs. \u201cFolks who postponed some services \u2014 some elective, some more serious \u2014 are going ahead and taking care of it,\u201d commented Connolly.\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance Plan\n\n\n\nThe healthcare spending forecast is the difference in cost to treat patients from one year to the next. This analysis tracks the cost increase in employer-based health plan market that has 150 million people under its ambit. The forecast combines the services cost and the amount of services used.\n\n\n\nHowever, the increase in healthcare spending is expected to have \u201clittle effect on employer health spending\u201d. This is because employers usually adjust the plan offerings based on the spending trend. High-deductible plans are already rising and employers may further increase employees\u2019 burden, i.e. the amount they are required to pay before the insurance coverage is effective. \u201cIt probably means some additional cost shifted to individuals,\u201d Connolly said.\n\n\n\nThe net increase is thus projected at around 4.8%.\n\n\n\nThe PwC study also notes that 44% of employers are considering health plans as the only insurance option for employees for the next three years.\n\n\n\nAffordable Care Act or \u201cObamacare\u201d\n\n\n\nTalking of insurance plan, the Obamacare should also up the healthcare spending. \"Obamacare\" that was enacted in Mar 2010 and was taken as a bitter pill is now unveiling the significance for a systematic healthcare reform in the U.S. (Read: Will Obamacare Happen Smoothly?)\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization had stated that healthcare expenditure per person in the United States is the highest in the world.\n\n\n\nDespite the large amount of money spent on health care, millions of Americans lacked health insurance coverage or were underinsured. This was mostly due to a dysfunctional system. To expand coverage, President Obama introduced drastic health care reforms in Mar 2010, which aimed at bringing down the country\u2019s uninsured rate.\n\n\n\nThe multi-year implementation of ACA is finally reflected in positive signs from healthcare providers (in the form of improved earnings), consumers (higher enrolments) and the market (wider coverage at lower healthcare spending). This paves the way for affordable healthcare facilities and expanded coverage for patients with pre-existing health conditions, while also bringing about 32 million uninsured citizens under the coverage umbrella.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the ACA aims to invest in information technology and state-based exchanges to curb any fraud and mishandling of policies, hence offering complete authentic health insurance coverage in the long run.\n\n\n\nAs for the hospitals, the ACA is making the consumers stronger and the hospital industry can no longer cherry-pick their customers. (Read: Obamacare Plays: 3 Hospital Stocks to Buy)\n\n\n\nJason Furman of the Council of Economic Advisers said healthcare spending will most likely jump in coming quarters \u201cas the millions of people who gained health insurance coverage during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment period begin to use their new coverage\u201d. Many Americans got their insurance at the first quarter end; thereby opening up the possibility of higher healthcare spending.\n\n\n\n3 Healthcare Funds to Buy Now\n\n\n\nThe rise in healthcare spending, if true, will increase business for hospitals, diagnostic centers and healthcare related industry.
