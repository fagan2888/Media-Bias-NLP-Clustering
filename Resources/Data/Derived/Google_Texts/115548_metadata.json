The number of people on Medicaid is projected to increase to 78.1 million by 2024, outstripping Medicare, which is expected to have 70.3 million enrolled. [Healthcare ETFs: Specialized Drugs in Greater Demand]\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), a major holding in exchange traded funds such as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLV), announced that in the next four years, it expects to submit over 10 new medicines, which could potentially generate $1 billion in annual revenue each.

[Innovators to Support Healthcare Sector, ETFs\u2019 Growth]\n\n\u201cThe health-care flush threatens a flat year for the sector just as S&P recoups YTD losses.\n\nThis is a remarkable turn in relative performance as HC was 10% points ahead of an all year flattish S&P in mid August. We find this reversal unwarranted and think health care could surge into year-end. If not, it\u2019s set up to be the best performing sector in 2016. Health Care is 14.7x 2016E EPS vs. S&P at 16x. We expect 6% sales growth from HC in 2016, well above nominal GDP and S&P sales growth. HC has margin risks, but also upside potential. We expect 6-9% EPS growth. We doubt the S&P delivers better growth,\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Bianco in a note posted by Chris Dieterich of Barron\u2019s.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans receive healthcare coverage, with the uninsured rate now at a seven-year low, bolstering the outlook for healthcare services and sector-related exchange traded funds.\n\nIn the second quarter, only 11.4% of adults lacked some form of health insurance, a half-percentage point dip from the first quarter, reports Dan Mangan for CNBC.\n\nThe uninsured rate has declined almost 6 percentage points since late 2013, before the the ACA, or Obamacare, took effect. More Americans gaining access to health insurance could bolster the long-term thesis for the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEArca: IHF).\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.
