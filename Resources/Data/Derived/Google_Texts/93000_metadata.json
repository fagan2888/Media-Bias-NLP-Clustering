After the website\u2019s myriad technical difficulties are at long last sorted out, mass cancellations, rising premiums and doc shock will remain as the devastating residual legacy of President Obama\u2019s top legislative \u201caccomplishment.\u201d Every one of those consequences represents a broken White House promise.
