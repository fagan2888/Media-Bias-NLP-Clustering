But they were out the evening of November 4, 2010. So the 10-year-old and his brother Mark walked out of their Kissimmee apartment and headed across the street to the Kangaroo convenience store.\n\nWhile crossing the street to come home, a city bus made a left turn into the crosswalk and hit the two boys. Mark Robinson grabbed a hold of the bike rack on the front, and crawled out from the bus.\n\nBut the back tire crushed Matthew Robinson to death.\n\nSharon Robinson dashed out of her apartment and found her son under the bus tire. In photos, you can see the crushed carton of eggs and bottles of soda next to the green Lynx city bus. Matthew\u2019s shoes poke out from under a yellow tarp.\n\n\u201cI had looked over and I seen a figure,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cI figured it was Matthew. They had put a yellow tarp over him. And when I seen that, I just kinda knew that was that.\u201d\n\nWitnesses said they saw the driver of the bus, 63-year-old Fernando Vega, screaming and pounding his fists on the side of the bus after the accident. It was his eighth accident he had while a driver for Lynx, and his seventh preventable accident.\n\nLynx admitted fault and agreed to a $3.2 million settlement before going to trial. Officials from Lynx declined to be interviewed for this story but have paid the Robinson family $200,000. Under sovereign immunity laws in Florida, that\u2019s the most a government can pay on its own.\n\nLynx wants to pay the remaining $3 million owed to the family; it even has the money set aside in its budget. Families like the Robinson's are awarded multi-million dollar settlements in cases against city or state governments every year. But often the families don\u2019t get the money.\n\nBut before it can do that, the Florida Legislature has to pass what\u2019s known as a claim bill.\n\nEvery case is its own piece of legislation. There are 31 bills in the 2015 Legislative session that starts today.\n\nIn many cases, the governmental body involved either has agreed to a settlement or a jury has awarded damages. But because the process is so difficult, it can take years for anything to happen \u2013 if anything happens at all. Most families abandon the process and settle for the $200,000.\n\nBecause the process is so difficult, and so frequently unsuccessful, oftentimes the cases are the most egregious.\n\nFor example, a severely disabled woman was raped and impregnated while living in a state licensed group home in Orlando. Or the case of a Polk County man who spent seven years in jail because of a police officer\u2019s typo on a report.\n\n\u201cThat whole claims process is a little bit embarrassing,\u201d said Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Sebring, and an emergency room doctor.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that seem inherently unfair?\u201d Pigman said. \u201cIt seems like the kind of process that rewards cronyism and connections. And I\u2019m sure there are many people who don\u2019t have the wherewithal to combat that, to work through that terrible system, but yet they\u2019re very deserving of some compensation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the last time the Legislature passed a claims bill.\n\nEven then, most of the time, families only get a fraction of what they\u2019ve settled for. Historically, the legislature has only paid about one dollar for every $5 in claims. There are nearly $74 million in claims bills built up.\n\nMany times, families hire a lobbyist to shepherd their bill through, said Joseph Little, University of Florida\u2019s law school professor emeritus.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a political process which as you know is not always a pretty process,\u201d Little said. \u201cAnd certainly is not always an equal process in terms of everybody having an equal shot of getting a claims bill passed.\u201d\n\nThis session is Orlando Republican Andy Gardiner\u2019s first term as Senate President. He promises everyone will get a fair hearing.\n\n\u201cI just have always had the position of not saying no to every claims bill,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cThere are some very legitimate (ones). But then I will say there are some that will come forward that members will have a problem with for various reasons.\u201d\n\nGardiner wasn\u2019t familiar with the Lynx case or the Robinson family. So he doesn\u2019t know that four years later, Sharon and Mark Robinson still grapple with Matthew\u2019s death.\n\nSharon Robinson has high blood pressure, anxiety and, severe depression. Mark suffers from pain because his back is out of line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can say what I want to say,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair at all. And they really just need to look at things and change how they do things.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s attorney is cautiously optimistic about the chances for their claim bill to get passed this legislative session.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
