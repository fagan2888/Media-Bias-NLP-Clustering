MINOT, N.D. (AP) - The Minot Park District has named Becky Dewitz as the new director of Roosevelt Park Zoo.

The Minot Daily News reports (http://bit.ly/1qrCkFV ) that Dewitz replaces David Merritt, who retired as zoo director in March after serving for five years.

Zoo officials say Dewitz’s experience and understanding of Roosevelt Park Zoo has provided her insight into the complexity of zoo operations.

Dewitz has been involved at Roosevelt Park Zoo since 2006, when she was hired as the education coordinator. She served in that role until 2011.

Dewitz has remained actively involved with the Minot Zoo Crew, the zoo’s nonprofit support organization. She served as treasurer from 2011-2013 and development director of the Minot Zoo Crew since 2013.

Roosevelt Park Zoo opens for the season on Saturday, April 30.
