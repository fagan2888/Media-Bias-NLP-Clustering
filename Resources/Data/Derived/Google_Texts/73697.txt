Camp Pendleton Marine Cpl. Nicholas James Sell, 21, died Monday morning during a training exercise at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. Sell was killed when the tank in which he was riding caught fire.

The Hi-Desert Star reports that four other Marines were injured in the fire. One of those Marines required hospitalization at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.

Sell grew up in Eagle Point, Oregon, according to a a news release from 1st Marine Division, and joined the Marines in May 2010. He was assigned to the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton.

Sell's cousin Colleen told CBSLA.com:



“Nick was a selfless and loving person. Everyone called him brother. He was always volunteering to help with anything or be there for anyone — USMC, family, or friend-related. He held the titles of Corporal, Eagle Scout, son, brother, uncle, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend — roles that are now void in so many lives.”

Sell leaves behind his parents, Randy and Kathy, and brothers Jeff and Beau Macy.

The military is investigating the cause of the accident.
