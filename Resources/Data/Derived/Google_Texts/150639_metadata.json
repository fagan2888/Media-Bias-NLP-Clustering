It was the Big 2 vs. The Splash Brothers. The stars were ready to perform on the NBA\u2019s grandest stage Friday. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 67 points (James with 44) in the Cavs\u2019 losing effort. League MVP Steph Curry (whose highlight reel this season was ridiculous) and Klay Thompson totaled 47 points for the Warriors.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just their offense. Irving had one of the game\u2019s biggest defensive plays with a huge block of Curry\u2019s layup attempt in the final minute of regulation.\n\nMomentum shifts. Any good storyteller knows that the key to capturing an audience\u2019s attention is holding its emotions. With 13 lead changes and 11 ties, the bout was a nail-biter.\n\nThe game pulled a 12.9 overnight rating, the highest-rated Game 1 ever on ABC, according to Forbes. At its peak, the game garnered a 15.6 rating from 9:30-9:45 p.m. It was a 24-percent increase from last year\u2019s opening game between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe storylines. From LeBron\u2019s legacy hanging in the balance, to Curry looking to cement his own to an NBA Finals, with two first-year head coaches, to the adorable Riley Curry, this series has it all.\n\nThe biggest one for the Cavs right now is Irving\u2019s knee injury. If he comes back and is effective, that\u2019s changes everything. If not, James needs a super-Herculean effort to carry Cleveland to the title.\n\nWell, here\u2019s to a great series. Game 2 on Sunday night can\u2019t come fast enough.\n\nCHEW ON THIS\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s National Doughnut Day. Go celebrate and get a sweet treat. To help, here\u2019s a list of specials around town.\n\n\u2022 Columnist Mark Kiszla writes how Nolan Arenado has become the new face of the Colorado Rockies.\n\n\u2022 Ben Paulsen has some big shoes to fill at first base, after the likes of Andres Galarraga, Todd Helton and Justin Morneau. Baseball reporter Patrick Saunders writes whether he\u2019s the right person to take over.\n\n\u2022 The inaugural class of the World Video Game Hall of Fame was announced Wednesday. The biggest snub? I\u2019ll go with The Legend of Zelda.\n\n\u2022 Happy 39th birthday, Aesop Rock!\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Could the Cavaliers-Warriors NBA Finals be one of the best ever?", "title": "Could the Cavaliers-Warriors NBA Finals be one of the best ever?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/could-the-cavaliers-warriors-nba-finals-be-one-of-the-best-ever/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150605_112956_lebron-james-steph-curry.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150605_112956_lebron-james-steph-curry.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T11:36:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:12:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Lunch Special"}, "article_summary": "LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 67 points (James with 44) in the Cavs\u2019 losing effort.\nIf Game 1 between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors was any indication, this NBA Finals has the makings of being one of the best.\nLeague MVP Steph Curry (whose highlight reel this season was ridiculous) and Klay Thompson totaled 47 points for the Warriors.\nThe game pulled a 12.9 overnight rating, the highest-rated Game 1 ever on ABC, according to Forbes.\nFrom LeBron\u2019s legacy hanging in the balance, to Curry looking to cement his own to an NBA Finals, with two first-year head coaches, to the adorable Riley Curry, this series has it all."}
