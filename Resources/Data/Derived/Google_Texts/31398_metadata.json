Analysts and BDC managers predict more companies could come under pressure, and that those who don\u2019t may initiate voluntary changes before they are forced to do so.\n\n\u201cThe BDC industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence,\u201d said David Golub, president of lender Golub Capital, whose BDC hasn\u2019t been a target for activists.\n\nValuations in the industry have bifurcated, said Mr. Golub, with a few BDCs producing solid results and trading well, and many others trading not as well.\n\nA combination of low valuations and \u201cdisenchanted shareholder bases\u201d present ideal ingredients for activist involvement, said Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. analyst Greg Mason.\n\n\u201cIf stocks are stuck at big discounts for a long time, things can change,\u201d said Mr. Mason. \u201cIf the activists are successful, we may get voluntary changes from others.\u201d\n\nThe bifurcation in the industry, along with the new activism, \u201cwill cause the good players in the industry to grow and the bad players to shrink,\u201d said Mr. Golub. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for the industry.\u201d\n\nWrite to Shasha Dai at shasha.dai@wsj.com; follow her on Twitter: @ShashaDai1", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Business development companies have become some of the latest targets for activist investors.", "title": "Activist Investors Flex Their Muscles With BDCs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/19/activist-investors-flex-their-muscles-with-bdcs/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LJ014_ArmMus_P_20151119135722.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Activist Investors Flex Their Muscles With BDCs", "description": "Business development companies have become some of the latest targets for activist investors.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Shasha Dai", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Business development companies have become some of the latest targets for activist investors.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-11-19T19:10:07-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/19/activist-investors-flex-their-muscles-with-bdcs/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19243", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Business development companies have become some of the latest targets for activist investors.", "title": "Activist Investors Flex Their Muscles With BDCs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/19/activist-investors-flex-their-muscles-with-bdcs/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LJ014_ArmMus_P_20151119135722.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19243", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-19T19:10:45-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Valuations in the industry have bifurcated, said Mr. Golub, with a few BDCs producing solid results and trading well, and many others trading not as well.\n\u201cThe BDC industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence,\u201d said David Golub, president of lender Golub Capital, whose BDC hasn\u2019t been a target for activists.\nRegardless of whether the activists are successful in their campaigns, \u201cthe floodgates have opened\u201d for BDC shareholder activism, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald said in a report this week.\nA combination of low valuations and \u201cdisenchanted shareholder bases\u201d present ideal ingredients for activist involvement, said Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. analyst Greg Mason.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for the industry.\u201dWrite to Shasha Dai at shasha.dai@wsj.com; follow her on Twitter: @ShashaDai1"}
