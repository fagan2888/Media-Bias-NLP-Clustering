Two TV stars were helping young girls in Meridian Sunday.

The Dancing Dolls from Mississippi became nationally known when they were featured on the lifetime show "Bring It." Two of the girls came to the Pat Gray Dance Academy to teach a new dance style called majorette. Cameron's mother Mimi Harris says the girls were excited for this opportunity.

"When I told Cameron that she's going to host the workshop, she said, 'Oh, where, where, where?' We always have to be out of town," she says. "And when I told her we were finally doing one in Mississippi, she was like 'Oh yes, great, great. I'm tired of flying, I'm tired of going everywhere else. I want to do right here in Mississippi.'"

The girls hope to learn the style, so that they can compete in the same competitions that the Dancing Dolls compete in.
