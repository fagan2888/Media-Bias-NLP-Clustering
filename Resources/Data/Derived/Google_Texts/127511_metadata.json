James Egloff drove his family five hours on a frostbitten day to be here. Preacher\u2019s son Ted Cruz, in blue jacket and open-collared shirt, does not disappoint, eviscerating the political establishment, talking guns and religion and prophesying a national \u201cawakening\u201d. The audience, clapping and hollering, loves his firebrand act.\n\nAt the Henry J Sweeney Post of the American Legion, meanwhile, things are not so hot. Jeb Bush, in shirt, tie and suit trousers, works the wood-panelled room with Senator Lindsey Graham in tow. The candidate is unfailingly polite and a little stiff, with agitation brewing beneath the surface. He promises better healthcare for military veterans and a pragmatic strategy for fighting Islamist terrorism.\n\nRelated: Chris Christie urged to 'smack' Trump amid mainstream Republican panic\n\nThe retail politics of the New Hampshire primary, in which contenders for the most powerful office in the world must brave chill winds to shake hands and pose for selfies in unromantic beer halls and school canteens, are impressive in the digital media age. But the contrasting energy in Manchester last week illustrated how the 2016 presidential election has confounded all expectations. A year ago Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton looked like a safe, if dull bet. No one dreamed that, with the Iowa caucuses approaching on 1 February, polls might be suggesting the rather less likely head-to-head of Donald Trump versus Bernie Sanders, a clash not of political dynasties but of popular movements.\n\nTrump, 69, a billionaire celebrity from New York who has never held political office, has dominated the national Republican race although hardline conservative Cruz, 45, another outsider, appears to have the edge in Iowa. Neither has the endorsement of a single sitting governor or senator. Sanders, a 74-year-old socialist senator from Vermont, appears well placed to beat Clinton among Democrats in both Iowa and New Hampshire. While she remains the long-term favourite, the former first lady could be forgiven for suffering stomach-knotting flashbacks to her defeat by Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nThe 162-year-old Republican party of Lincoln and Reagan, and the 188-year-old Democratic party of Roosevelt and Kennedy, are facing simultaneous revolts from their own rank and file that threaten to reshape the American political landscape. Both find themselves assailed by a popular uprising against Washington: Democrats disappointed that their president hasn\u2019t achieved more in seven years, Republicans riled that their control of both houses of Congress has yielded little \u2013 and independents despairing of unprecedented deadlock on Capitol Hill.\n\nSanders told the MSNBC channel last week: \u201cWhat we are doing in this campaign, it just blows my mind every day because I see it clearly, we\u2019re taking on not only Wall Street and the economic establishment, we\u2019re taking on the political establishment.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Republican Presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz experiences retail politics in New Hampshire. Photograph: Rick Friedman/rickfriedman.com/Corbis\n\nAnd Cruz bellowed at the pizza joint: \u201cIf you think Washington is fundamentally broken, that there is a bipartisan corruption of career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow and grow Washington, and we need to take power out of Washington and back to \u2018We the people\u2019, that is what this campaign is all about!\u201d\n\nThe crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire, erupted in whoops and applause. Egloff, who had brought his wife and three children from New Jersey, has donated to a candidate for the first time in his life, giving $1,500 to the Cruz campaign. \u201cI can\u2019t tell the difference between Democrats and Republicans any more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is zero change with either. Republicans are every bit as complicit as liberals. To see Cruz coming along to blow everything up is so exciting. We are sick of the entrenched establishment.\u201d\n\nThere is also a deeper dissatisfaction with the status quo. As a small software business owner, Egloff, 45, complains about high taxes and belongs to a generation that, while hardly destitute, feels constantly stressed and hard done by compared with its predecessors. \u201cI\u2019m being told things are better than they are. I survive and I eat but I\u2019m not getting ahead. It\u2019s not what my father experienced.\u201d\n\nRelated: The white man pathology: inside the fandom of Sanders and Trump\n\nThe United States remains the world\u2019s sole superpower and biggest economy. Politicians constantly tell voters they are living in the greatest nation the earth has ever seen and stress the exceptionalism of the American dream. But this may only help to inflate expectations and sow discontent.\n\nDan Cabanel, 56, a financial sales representative from Concord, New Hampshire, blames Obama\u2019s health reforms for wiping out some of his insurance business. \u201cIf Obama had been a really good president, we wouldn\u2019t have this uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was supposed to be uniter, bringing the country together, but he has been the most polarising leader.\u201d\n\nSuch frustrations found expression in social movements such as Occupy Wall Street on the left and the Tea Party on the right in recent years. Now they are lapping at politicians\u2019 feet. Americans\u2019 approval of Congress averaged just 16% in 2015, according to pollster Gallup.\n\nRich Galen, a Republican strategist and former press secretary to Vice-President Dan Quayle, said: \u201cI do believe there is a confluence of anger at the pillars of American society. Look at what people have confidence in: Congress is down below used car dealers and reporters. We\u2019re in an era when nobody likes anything and the two people most vocal about not liking things are Trump and Sanders. From two different directions, they\u2019ve attracted people who like the way they see the world.\u201d\n\nThey divide along a line seldom acknowledged in US discourse: class. Sanders draws strong support from graduates and students, whereas most of Trump\u2019s followers are on low incomes and did not go to university. One hammers Wall Street, the other demonises immigrants, but both are perceived as authentic and unspun, right down to their oddball hair. They are two sides of the same coin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Sanders\u2019s campaign looks a lot more like Obama\u2019s in 2008 than Clinton\u2019s does,\u2019 said Angus Johnston, a historian of student activism. Photograph: Mary Schwalm/Reuters\n\nNeil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said: \u201cI talk to many people whose first choice is Trump and second choice is Sanders, even though they\u2019re diametrically opposed. People feel Trump is saying what they think, and if you asked supporters of Sanders, one word they would use is \u2018authenticity\u2019. A lot of this is the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. Those were the seeds and now the grass is growing.\u201d\n\nThe ground is fertile because of circumstantial weakness at the top of both parties. Bush, 62, and 68-year-old Clinton are arguably less impressive campaigners than the former presidents who share their surnames. At a recent Democratic debate, Clinton presented herself as a continuity candidate barely distinguishable from Obama \u2013 hardly a cri de c\u0153ur at the best of times. Bush, meanwhile, faces the additional complication of an overcrowded field, with the likes of Chris Christie, John Kasich and Marco Rubio threatening to split the \u201cestablishment\u201d vote.\n\nAngus Johnston, a historian of student activism based at City University of New York, said: \u201cClinton has been wrapping herself in the Obama presidency and presenting herself as the successor but, in a lot of ways, Sanders\u2019s campaign looks a lot more like Obama\u2019s in 2008 than Clinton\u2019s does. I\u2019m seeing in young people\u2019s debates it\u2019s \u2018pragmatic and practical\u2019 versus \u2018let\u2019s shoot for the stars\u2019 because the Obama administration has not been the transformational force they hoped it would be. Sanders is clearly responding to the energy coming off recent campus protests and channeling it in his own way.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump, Johnston continued, \u201cWe see a reaction against the cultural trends of the last few years. He attacks political correctness and the ideology of the left, calling for a ban on Muslims and wall to keep out Mexicans. A lot of this is framed as a willingness to tell the truth. There\u2019s anti-Washington stuff and also more general cultural attacks on intellectuals.\u201d\n\nLike Jeremy Corbyn of the British Labour party, neither man is quite as unelectable as they first appeared to the pundits. Johnston said: \u201cThe further we go into this campaign, the clearer it becomes that Sanders is not really a socialist. He\u2019s a liberal Democrat and, win or lose, he\u2019s in the mainstream of the left wing of the Democratic party.\u201d Trump is \u201ca very gifted speaker\u201d from New York\u2019s Queens, home to various ethnic groups including a large black middle class. \u201cHe\u2019s not just coming from a position of rural whiteness.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Palin endorses Donald Trump: \u2018Our own GOP machine \u2026 they\u2019re attacking their frontrunner.\u2019 Photograph: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters\n\nTwelve major Republican candidates and three significant Democrats are shuttling Iowa and New Hampshire with growing intensity as the day of reckoning nears, knocking on doors and making speeches in modest, no-frills towns in all weathers. Voter Brian Pickowicz, 22, from Franklin, New Hampshire, said: \u201cFor the last 12 years Americans have seen the establishment at work, whether Obama or Bush. They are done with the status quo. The talking points are not working like they used to.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is running one of the best campaigns ever seen. He is doing a great job of using fear and hate speech so people will vote for him. It\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\n\nBut the establishment elders are not taking the parallel rebellions lying down. Clinton, who has husband Bill on her side and remains popular among African Americans and Hispanics, has unleashed a series of attacks on Sanders in the past week. Bush has denounced Trump as \u201ca jerk\u201d and on Friday the National Review magazine published essays by 22 prominent conservative thinkers in opposition to the tycoon\u2019s candidacy. Former governor Sarah Palin, whose stream-of-consciousness endorsement of Trump last week entertained more than it informed, nevertheless hit the mark when she warned: \u201cOur own GOP [Grand Old Party] machine, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape? They\u2019re attacking their own frontrunner!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A supporter waits to hear Bernie Sanders at a campaign stop in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPA\n\nSome predict the Republican party could split in two if Trump prevails. But Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator whose own campaign for the presidency crashed and burned, refuses to panic, insisting the widespread frustration will not last. \u201cIn the Bernie world, big banks are out to get you and the rich guy\u2019s screwing you over,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s world, the illegal immigrants are going to sell your kids drugs and rape your wife, and foreigners are going to take your jobs.\n\n\u201cThis has happened before when people had economic anxiety but it never pans out. We always reject this. It will level out. Polling is just ether right now. When people go into the voting booth and they\u2019re quiet, nobody there but them, New Hampshire particularly and South Carolina are going to take seriously the job of picking the next president. That\u2019s why I think Jeb is very viable.\u201d\n\nGraham added: \u201cThis is a fad that will pass. The anger is real but the solutions make no sense. We can\u2019t have 90% tax rates and, on the Republican side, we can\u2019t insult everybody in the world and become president of the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Outsiders of right and left are channelling frustration with political elites as seeds sown by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street bear fruit in popular movements", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "David Smith", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Outsiders of right and left are channelling frustration with political elites as seeds sown by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street bear fruit in popular movements", "title": "Trump and Sanders lead two-headed insurgency against establishment", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f488c719fe2be3922a9528aee0bfbb96f038f06d/0_0_620_372/master/620.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=fbb7276e8732614f528c0d54d09d8132", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f488c719fe2be3922a9528aee0bfbb96f038f06d/0_0_620_372/master/620.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US elections 2016,US news,Donald Trump,Bernie Sanders,Republicans,Democrats,Ted Cruz,Jeb Bush,Hillary Clinton,New Hampshire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-01-23T13:00:01.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:44:58.000Z", "tag": "US elections 2016,US news,Donald Trump,Bernie Sanders,Republicans,Democrats,Ted Cruz,Jeb Bush,Hillary Clinton,New Hampshire"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f488c719fe2be3922a9528aee0bfbb96f038f06d/0_0_620_372/620.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=40e6f9a1b6ab5cfc6e69fa4ef55cdc12", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US elections 2016,US news,Donald Trump,Bernie Sanders,Republicans,Democrats,Ted Cruz,Jeb Bush,Hillary Clinton,New Hampshire"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re in an era when nobody likes anything and the two people most vocal about not liking things are Trump and Sanders.\nPreacher\u2019s son Ted Cruz, in blue jacket and open-collared shirt, does not disappoint, eviscerating the political establishment, talking guns and religion and prophesying a national \u201cawakening\u201d.\nPhotograph: Cj Gunther/EPASome predict the Republican party could split in two if Trump prevails.\nEgloff, who had brought his wife and three children from New Jersey, has donated to a candidate for the first time in his life, giving $1,500 to the Cruz campaign.\nPeople feel Trump is saying what they think, and if you asked supporters of Sanders, one word they would use is \u2018authenticity\u2019."}
