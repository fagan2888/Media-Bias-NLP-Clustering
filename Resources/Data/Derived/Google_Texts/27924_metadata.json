High demand for the online social video company\u2019s stock helped its IPO price at HK$5.28 per share, the high end of its range of $4.50 to $5.30 per share.\n\nA woman uses a computer in an internet cafe at the center of Shanghai. Reuters\n\nWhat\u2019s to like about Tian Ge? The company\u2019s live social video platforms offer investors access to a population of consumers who are interested in\u2014and interested in spending money on\u2014interacting with each other online. Tian Ge users join massive live video chatrooms to participate in, or simply watch, a range of activities, from musical performances to lectures, karaoke and birthday parties. It\u2019s a bit like a monetized version of Google Hangouts.\n\nTian Ge makes money off of virtual currency it and its distributors sell to users, and which the users spend on virtual gifts, which they grant to each other and chatroom hosts as \u201ctokens of support or appreciation,\u201d according to Tian Ge\u2019s prospectus.\n\nThis rather unusual business model was brought about by trends in Chinese urbanization, in which \u201cmillions of people in China have moved to new environments with fast-paced lifestyles and a lack of established social networks,\u201d and thus seek communities online, the company\u2019s prospectus notes. What Tian Ge calls \u201cthe social impact of a multi-decade single child policy\u201d and high Internet penetration rates have also helped spur the trend. China\u2019s \u201clive social video community industry\u201d has grown from 220 million yuan in 2009 to 3.8 billion yuan in 2013 and is projected to grow to 13.3 billion yuan ($2.14 billion) in 2017, the prospectus states.\n\nAnother Chinese company with a somewhat similar line of business to Tian Ge, YY Inc., has been an investor favorite since listing on Nasdaq at the end of 2012: YY\u2019s stock value has more than quintupled since its IPO and the company is presently valued at more than US$4 billion.\n\nOne potential cloud on Tian Ge\u2019s horizon, however, is China\u2019s ongoing \u201cClean the Web 2014\u201d campaign against pornographic content online, which has hit the stock of internet companies like Sina Corp. While Tiange notes it hasn\u2019t been affected by the campaign so far, it cautions that it \u201ccannot assure you the PRC regulatory authorities will not deem us as facilitating the transmission of pornographic or other illegal information.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It\u2019s hard to beat the mission statement of Hong Kong IPO candidate Tian Ge Interactive Holdings Ltd.", "title": "HK IPO Candidate Tian Ge Seeks To Bring \u201cJoy to the Masses\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/08/hk-ipo-candidate-tian-ge-seeks-to-bring-joy-to-the-masses/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DO959_inter_E_20140708034218.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "HK IPO Candidate Tian Ge Seeks To Bring \u201cJoy to the Masses\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s hard to beat the mission statement of Hong Kong IPO candidate Tian Ge Interactive Holdings Ltd.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ned Levin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "It\u2019s hard to beat the mission statement of Hong Kong IPO candidate Tian Ge Interactive Holdings Ltd.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-08T07:44:40-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/08/hk-ipo-candidate-tian-ge-seeks-to-bring-joy-to-the-masses/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-23722", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "It\u2019s hard to beat the mission statement of Hong Kong IPO candidate Tian Ge Interactive Holdings Ltd.", "title": "HK IPO Candidate Tian Ge Seeks To Bring \u201cJoy to the Masses\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/08/hk-ipo-candidate-tian-ge-seeks-to-bring-joy-to-the-masses/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-23722", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-08T07:44:54-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4cb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur mission is to bring optimism and joy to the masses through live social video interaction,\u201d the company\u2019s prospectus begins.\nHigh demand for the online social video company\u2019s stock helped its IPO price at HK$5.28 per share, the high end of its range of $4.50 to $5.30 per share.\nTian Ge users join massive live video chatrooms to participate in, or simply watch, a range of activities, from musical performances to lectures, karaoke and birthday parties.\nReutersWhat\u2019s to like about Tian Ge?\nWhat Tian Ge calls \u201cthe social impact of a multi-decade single child policy\u201d and high Internet penetration rates have also helped spur the trend."}
