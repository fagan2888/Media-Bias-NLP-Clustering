Obama has vowed to veto it, saying it would \u201csignificantly increase the deficit, reduce the number of Americans with employer-based health insurance coverage, and create incentives for employers to shift their employees to part-time work.\u201d\n\nOne part-time Staples employee told BuzzFeed News that her manager said, \u201cObama is responsible for this\u201d when sharing the new scheduling rules with her. While the Affordable Care Act considers workers as full time at above 30 hours a week, the 25-hour limit at Staples leaves a cushion for unavoidable overtime, allowing the retailer to err on the side of caution, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been working a second job, so I just increased my availability there,\u201d she said, pointing out she\u2019s in a much better position than some of her colleagues, who don\u2019t have that option. Her other job is at another large retail chain, which provided its part-time associates with healthcare benefits prior to the passage of ACA. Business has been unaffected at that chain, she said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think the Affordable Care Act is a good thing, and I think everyone should have healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cI think companies that are deciding they don\u2019t want to pay out benefits, it shows how much they really don\u2019t care about their employees.\u201d\n\nAnother part-time employee who shared her story said she\u2019s a single mother earning just under $10 an hour. She commutes an hour and a half to Staples, and used to finagle more than 35 hours a week, despite being scheduled for 28, with a combination of overtime and skipping meals and breaks. Now, she can\u2019t get more than 20, and says the scheduling is so \u201chaywire,\u201d she has to find another job.\n\nOne part-time employee, a student, said he lost his job at the end of last month as part of broader cutbacks at Staples. Stores have been relegated to four different tiers, as illustrated through a leaked organizational chart posted to Imgur. This employee said his store was a Tier 4, the lowest, which resulted in a number of positions being eliminated. Starting last month, if anyone worked over 25 hours at his store, the associate, general manager, and district manager would all get written up, he said.\n\nChristine Komola, Staples\u2019 chief financial officer, noted in August that the company sought to cut $250 million in costs last year and \u201cat least\u201d $500 million during the next two years.\n\n\u201cSalesforce productivity \u2014 we\u2019ve basically done significant reinvestment in our sales specialists, but that\u2019s been done through challenging our office supply model and kind of redeploying and eliminating where appropriate,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cOur retail store labor has changed pretty dramatically in how we\u2019ve set up those kind of labor pools and tiering of the stores.\u201d\n\nStaples employed 46,361 full-time and 36,647 part-time associates as of Feb. 1, 2014. In 2009, the company said it had 57,291 full-time and 33,834 part-time associates.\n\nThe fifth employee, who has had his hours cut from up to 35 a week last year to 25 this year, emphasized that general managers at stores are being held responsible for associates staying below the threshold, emailing schedules to district managers on a weekly basis, if not more frequently. This employee views Staples\u2019 actions as management \u201cmaking its employees suffer to prove that Obamacare has failed.\u201d\n\nWhile architects of the ACA hoped companies wouldn\u2019t manage their labor forces this way in response to the law, they\u2019re unable to do much about those who do. And in the absence of any recourse, it\u2019s the part-time workers who are suffering.\n\nFiveThirtyEight reported last month that while data illustrating this issue is extremely limited, it appears as if a few hundred thousand workers are seeing fewer hours because of Obamacare. \u201cThat\u2019s small in the context of an economy with 150 million workers,\u201d Ben Casselman wrote. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t a minor issue for those workers. Most of them are among the economy\u2019s most vulnerable: low-wage, part-time workers who likely have few other options.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable for companies to discuss these matters publicly, given the backlash that tends to accompany such behavior. Last year, Staples was highlighted as a high-profile employer cutting hours, after a Change.org petition tied to its new limited-scheduling policies went viral. A spokesman for Staples initially defended the 25-hour a week limit as having been in effect for more than a decade. Once BuzzFeed News showed him December 2013 internal memos on \u201ctalking points\u201d for \u201cimplementing\u201d the policy, which was described as \u201cnew,\u201d he ceased responding.\n\nAlice, the 19-year-old employee, said she\u2019s actually on her father\u2019s insurance plan and wishes she could convince Staples to let her work more hours with the guarantee that she won\u2019t ask them for benefits. With the way things stand now, she wants the full-time worker definition changed to 40 hours a week.\n\n\u201cI would really love it if that bill got passed,\u201d she said, after thinking about it for a moment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people understand it really affects those of us who are stuck in these retail jobs or whatever,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of people who I work with have families and have been in retail for a long time, and I myself am trying to help my family out financially, and we can\u2019t get the hours. Obamacare in theory is a great idea but corporations are so selfish, they\u2019re going to find a loophole and in the process, they\u2019ll hurt us, the little people, before they\u2019ll take a hit themselves. So it\u2019s us that gets stuck with the short end of the stick.\u201d\n\n*Name changed at the request of the source.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3593732, "userid": 683073}, "description": "In 2015, an Affordable Care Act provision requiring large employers to offer health insurance to staff working more than 30 hours a week...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
