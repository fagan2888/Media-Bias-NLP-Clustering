They were selected from 39 applicants, among six IU campuses. Awards ranged from $3,000 to $15,000.\n\nIn addition to the WPLC grant, the family nurse practitioner program, a joint program between IU Kokomo and IU East, received matching funds from IU Kokomo alumna Kathleen Ligocki, who serves both on the council and the IU Foundation board.\n\nAssistant Dean Mary Bourke said the program addresses a critical need for primary health care providers in Indiana, a need that will only grow with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe demand for a primary care nursing workforce is going to grow as more people have access to health care coverage,\u201d she said, adding that Indiana has only 51 primary health clinicians for every 100,00 people, well short of the goal of 100 for every 100,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get ahead of that curve, by educating nurses in our regional who will practice in our region, and fill that void.\u201d\n\nThe grant funds will equip a simulation lab for the nurse practitioner program. It will be set up as a doctor\u2019s office, with all the equipment needed for the clinical portion of the seven-semester program.\n\nShe expects the program to begin in January, with 15 students.\n\nChelsi Day, CAPS director, plans to use her grant funding to start a peer wellness team, which will do outreach for the center, and assist in her preventative mental health programming.\n\nThe four undergraduate students will develop and implement programming under her supervision, to educate students, faculty, and staff about issues including depression, stress, eating disorders, and other topics, and the services available to them on campus.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide resources and touch people on campus before they reach a critical need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going to focus on educating students how to prevent these issues from negatively impacting their student experience, and reach out before they\u2019ve let these issues keep them from going to class, or doing their work. If we can intervene early, it helps us keep these students in school, continuing towards degree completion.\u201d\n\nThe four students selected for the first year team are all psychology majors, she said, and will gain valuable experience as mental health educators, under her supervision. They will have the option of completing the second semester on the team as interns.\n\nThe grant provides start up costs and an online mental health screening assessment the campus community can access anonymously. Those who show signs of potential problems will be directed to CAPS for assistance.\n\nAlisa Hendrix, incoming co-chair of the WPLC, said the council brings women together to connect, learn, and give back to IU.\n\n\u201cOur grant process provides the opportunity to meet this mission by supporting the innovative projects and ideas of students and faculty,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year we have selected the projects that we believe have the greatest potential to positively impact IU, its students and the state of Indiana and in the coming years hope to grow our program so we can extend its impact.\u201d\n\nIndiana University Kokomo serves north central Indiana.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 A new nurse practitioner degree and peer counseling services for students share in more than $100,000 in grants from the Indiana University Women\u2019s Philanthropy Leadership Council (WPLC).\nIU Kokomo\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and the School of Nursing were among 11 recipients of grants totaling $102,000.\nThe grant provides start up costs and an online mental health screening assessment the campus community can access anonymously.\n\u201cOur grant process provides the opportunity to meet this mission by supporting the innovative projects and ideas of students and faculty,\u201d she said.\nIn addition to the WPLC grant, the family nurse practitioner program, a joint program between IU Kokomo and IU East, received matching funds from IU Kokomo alumna Kathleen Ligocki, who serves both on the council and the IU Foundation board."}
