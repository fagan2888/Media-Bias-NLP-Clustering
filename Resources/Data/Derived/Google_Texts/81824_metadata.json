Liftoff from Vandenberg Air Force Base, northwest of Los Angeles, was planned for a 30-second window at 10:42 a.m. PST Sunday, with a backup opportunity on Monday.\n\nAir Force meteorologists predicted 100 percent favorable weather for the launch, NASA said.\n\nAs the current El Nino in the eastern Pacific has strengthened, Jason-3 has been stuck on the ground. Jason-3\u2019s launch was originally scheduled for August 2015 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. However, the launch was postponed after a different Falcon 9 rocket failed during a supply mission to the International Space Station in June. After correcting the problem, a successful launch last month restored Falcon 9s to flight status.\n\nLike its three predecessors, Jason-3 is equipped with radar altimeter to bounce microwave energy off the ocean and a GPS system to identify the satellite\u2019s precise location. Timing of how long it takes the signal to return indicates sea level height, which rises or falls depending on the temperature of the water.\n\nThe data collected can detect the weather-altering El Nino condition and its opposite, La Nina, and are most familiar to the public in images of the Pacific Ocean that use colors to illustrate variations in heat. Other pragmatic uses include measuring global sea level rise, and forecasting the strength of hurricanes, other severe weather and ocean conditions for the shipping industry and in response to oil spills.\n\n\u201cJason allows us to get the big picture in terms of sea-level change in the years to come,\u201d said Laury Miller, Jason-3 program scientist.\n\nJason-3 is a project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, the French space agency Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales, and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. It was built by Thales Alenia of France.\n\nJason-3 will ultimately replace Jason-2, which has been in orbit since mid-2008 and has been tracking the current El Nino that experts say has tied the 1997-98 version as the strongest recorded and is expected to last through the winter before weakening in spring.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "title": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "title": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/16/launch_set_for_us_european_ocean_monitoring_satellite/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ocean-satellite.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "title": "Launch set for US-European ocean-monitoring satellite", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ocean-satellite.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Antczak", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If the launch is successful, the Jason-3 satellite would continue an unbroken record of more than two decades of sea level measurements from orbit.\nTiming of how long it takes the signal to return indicates sea level height, which rises or falls depending on the temperature of the water.\nAs the current El Nino in the eastern Pacific has strengthened, Jason-3 has been stuck on the ground.\nHowever, the launch was postponed after a different Falcon 9 rocket failed during a supply mission to the International Space Station in June.\nJason-3\u2019s launch was originally scheduled for August 2015 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket."}
