LAKEWOOD — A suspicious package sent by U.S. Mail to the Social Security Administration building in Lakewood was not a threat, fire crews determined Thursday afternoon.

Three people were treated as a precaution, but hazmat readings were negative, said Michelle French, a spokeswoman for West Metro Fire.

French did not say why the package was suspicious. The FBI and Federal Protective Service are investigating.

The package was opened in a small room in the building about noon. The building was evacuated as federal and local law enforcement arrived, including hazmat crews. Some 70 people were in the building when the package was opened, French said, many of whom were later quarantined.

Alicia Delgado arrived at the building at 10 a.m. and was quarantined for roughly six hours as officials investigated the package. Driving away from the scene, she expressed frustration and told reporters that officials did not tell her or others what was going on during the quarantine.

Jennifer Brisneno visited the building earlier Thursday and upon returning with a document she had forgotten, she saw the building swamped with law enforcement.

A fire official told her she needed to quarantine herself from her family because of a “serious” situation.
