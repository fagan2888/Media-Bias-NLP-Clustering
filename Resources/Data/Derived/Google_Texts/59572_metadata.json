The group boasts on its website that it advocates for strengthening and enforcing ethics rules for those in public office and \u201ctargeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests.\u201dRepublicans had lambasted CREW as a partisan outfit that does the bidding of Democrats, though the group has made a point over the years of calling out both parties for skirting ethics rules.With Brock as chairman, it\u2019s unclear whether the group will maintain its bipartisan stance.Brock founded Media Matters for America, a liberal group that takes aim at conservative media, and the super-PAC American Bridge, which does opposition research for Democrats. He also created The American Independent Institute to support \u201cjournalism that exposes the nexus of conservative power in Washington.\u201d\u201cWith public confidence in the institutions of government at an all-time-low, the need for a robust accountability campaign on behalf of the public has never been more urgent,\u201d Brock said in a statement. \u201cDemocracy requires honest government.\u201dBrock joined CREW on Aug. 11, though the move was announced late on Wednesday evening.The Huffington Post originally reported that Media Matters would be \u201cabsorbing\u201d or acquiring CREW, but someone with familiar with both organizations, who could not speak publicly, said the groups will remain separate.The two groups \u201cwill share a chairman, but this isn't a Media Matters expansion,\u201d the person said.Meanwhile, Sloan will be \u201c[pursuing] new opportunities,\u201d according to a statement about the transition. She will stay at CREW while the group searches for her replacement.\u201cBy holding those in power accountable for their actions, CREW has served as a critical watchdog and an important voice for ordinary citizens who believe Washington can do better,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cGiven David\u2019s track record of building high-impact sustainable institutions, I am confident that CREW will continue to thrive under this new governance.\u201dBrock praised Sloan\u2019s leadership, saying that the organization has \u201cemerged as an effective voice for the kind of honesty and integrity we deserve in our public officials.\u201d\u201cWe will build on her record of success, expanding the portfolio to scrutinize more activity in states, and political organizations that wield just as much influence over our policies as our politicians do, if not more,\u201d he said.Louis Mayberg \u2014 CREW\u2019s chairman of the board \u2014 will remain a director, while two other members were added: San Francisco-based investor and philanthropist Wayne Jordan and Washington Democratic strategist David Mercer.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "David Brock has become chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.", "description": "David Brock has become chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
