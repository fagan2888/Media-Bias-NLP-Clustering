Michael Brown Sr., the father of the unarmed black teenager shot to death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month, asked Sunday for protests to pause on the day of his son's funeral.

In an interview with St. Louis' Hot 104.1, Brown asked for "respect" on Monday as the family honors their son.

"I would like for no protesting going on,” he said, according to BuzzFeed. “We just want a moment of silence that whole day. Just out of respect for our son.”

Since Brown's death on August 9, crowds have taken to the streets of the St. Louis suburb each night to protest, often with a heavy police presence on hand. The protests have at times taken a violent turn, with police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds.

Brown's funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Monday at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. Reverend Al Sharpton is set to speak at the funeral, and Brown's uncle, Reverend Charles Ewing, will deliver the eulogy.

On Saturday, the Obama administration announced that it would be sending three officials to attend the service.
