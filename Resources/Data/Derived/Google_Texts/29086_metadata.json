He sure was quick.\u201d\n\nIt was Feb. 4, 1966, and Hill and Texas Western had won 15 consecutive games in a 28-1 season they would cap with a seminal national championship just weeks later. The Miners, with a starting lineup composed solely of black players, would defeat the mighty, all-white Kentucky Wildcats 72-65 in the NCAA title game, a historic achievement that was honored Saturday at the Final Four in Houston on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.\n\nThat victory for Texas Western (now the University of Texas at El Paso) inspired the film \u201cGlory Road\u201d and became a watershed moment in the push for racial equality in sports and American society alike.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know it at the time,\u201d President Barack Obama said of the Miners last week, \u201cbut their contribution to civil rights was as important as any other.\u201d\n\nAbout a month before that championship game, though, the Miners were just a team riding a bus to Fort Collins in hopes of keeping an undefeated season alive. All the Rams did was come a buzzer-beating shot away from potentially altering history.\n\n\u201cWe felt like they were a great team,\u201d said Boyd Grant, who was the 33-year-old acting head coach at CSU at the time. \u201cAnd we had a pretty good team too.\u201d\n\nHelp from the hamburger squad\n\nAs a freshman at CSU in 1966, Floyd Kerr certainly was talented enough to play varsity basketball. He just wasn\u2019t allowed to.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1972 that the NCAA permitted freshmen to play on the varsity. So Kerr, on top of being a member of CSU\u2019s \u201cFabulous Frosh\u201d team, had another job as the Rams prepared to play the Miners.\n\n\u201cWhat coaches did in those days is they would have jerseys from the other team,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThey would give them to either the backups or the freshman players. They were called the hamburger squads back then because the varsity would eat us for lunch.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder. CSU\u2019s 1965-66 varsity team featured two future NBA players \u2014 big men Bob Rule and Dale Schlueter \u2014 and dynamic guard Lonnie Wright, who later played for both the Denver Broncos and the ABA\u2019s Denver Rockets.\n\nAfter Grant handed Kerr the jersey of Bobby Joe Hill, the Miners\u2019 jet-quick, 5-foot-11 point guard, Kerr felt transformed, eager for the challenge.\n\n\u201cHe controlled that team,\u201d Kerr, now the athletic director at Morgan State University in Baltimore, said of Hill. \u201cSo that was my job. I played him that whole week. I got to do things I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d be doing in a basketball game.\u201d\n\nWhether it was Hill\u2019s preparation or the capacity crowd at the 10,000-seat arena that had opened only weeks earlier, the Rams came out fighting and trailed just 43-41 at halftime.\n\nOffense was hard to come by in the second half.\n\n\u201cThey were so good defensively,\u201d Grant, now retired in Pocatello, Idaho, said of the Miners. \u201cThey were the kind of team that just took your strengths away from you. Pretty soon, you were wondering what happened to your offense.\u201d\n\nStill, the Rams kept chipping away. A jumper by Rule with 2:25 left gave CSU its first lead, 66-64. After David Lattin tied the score on a dunk with 1:28 remaining, CSU went into stall mode and played for one last shot, a common tactic in the days before college basketball had a shot clock.\n\n\u201cAfter a timeout we came down the court,\u201d Vidakovich said. \u201cOur real good guard from Los Angeles named Dick Fines got the ball and kind of panicked. He took a little bank shot from the right side. He missed the shot, went a little bit early.\u201d\n\nThe miss came with nine seconds left. Hill grabbed the rebound and called a timeout. In the huddle, Grant devised a plan to deny Hill the entry pass.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is we did exactly what we wanted to do,\u201d Grant said, describing how his defense shaded Hill away from the ball. \u201cBut he was smart enough to back cut and get the ball.\u201d\n\nOnce Hill got the ball, the race was on.\n\n\u201cI remember picking him up almost at half court and thinking that if I gave him a little room he couldn\u2019t drive it,\u201d Vidakovich said. \u201cHe just pulled up, popped up and swished right at the buzzer. Game over.\u201d\n\nCSU Rams nearly beat NCAA champs\n\nThe 30-foot dagger was a heartbreaker 50 years ago. But as time has heightened the significance of that season for Texas Western, the Rams involved in that loss at what since the 1990s has been called Moby Arena have come to cherish memories of it.\n\nWho knows what their winning that game could have done? Would another defeat \u2014 Texas Western suffered its only loss of the 1965-66 season to Seattle on March 5 \u2014 have altered the Miners\u2019 path to history? Would it have presented a tougher course through the 22-team NCAA Tournament?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say, of course. But the Rams from 50 years ago are content to enjoy their small part in a historic season.\n\n\u201cThey were intense, quick, good and they played the game right,\u201d Vidakovich said of the Miners. \u201cWe had a lot of respect for them. I think they had a lot of respect for us.\u201d\n\nKerr has another connection to the Texas Western story. His nephew is Schin Kerr, the second-oldest son of his twin brother Lloyd, a fellow former CSU player. Schin played the role of Lattin, who scored 16 points against Kentucky, in \u201cGlory Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s goes back there every year for reunions now,\u201d Floyd Kerr said of Schin. \u201cHe\u2019s become part of their family now.\u201d\n\nKerr is in Houston for the Final Four and the tributes being paid to the Miners. One team member not on hand was Hill, who died in December 2002 at the age of 59.\n\nPerhaps Kerr should have slipped on that No. 14 Texas Western jersey one more time, a member of the hamburger squad paying his respects.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Texas Western visited Colorado State on 1966 historic national title run", "title": "Texas Western visited Colorado State on 1966 historic national title run", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/02/texas-western-visited-colorado-state-on-1966-historic-national-title-run/", "image": {"width": 508, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__BN20160403_CC11_BNSP03BKCHISTORYp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__BN20160403_CC11_BNSP03BKCHISTORYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T19:26:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:45:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "14 Texas Western jersey one more time, a member of the hamburger squad paying his respects.\nI think they had a lot of respect for us.\u201dKerr has another connection to the Texas Western story.\n\u201cWhat coaches did in those days is they would have jerseys from the other team,\u201d Kerr said.\nThat victory for Texas Western (now the University of Texas at El Paso) inspired the film \u201cGlory Road\u201d and became a watershed moment in the push for racial equality in sports and American society alike.\n\u201cHe controlled that team,\u201d Kerr, now the athletic director at Morgan State University in Baltimore, said of Hill."}
