Nationally, however, recent polls show that only slightly more people favor the law than oppose it.\n\nSupport in 2010, when Congress passed the law, started at 52 percent in California and has grown to 62 percent, while over the same period opposition has decreased from 38 percent to 33 percent.\n\nDiCamillo said one of the reasons opposition appears to be melting away is that opponents who once feared that the law would increase the cost of their own or their family\u2019s health insurance now realize that didn\u2019t come to pass. And, he said, publicity surrounding the success stories of a growing number of people now insured in California has shown voters that the \u201claw is actually doing what it was intended to do.\u201d\n\nOakland resident Ruth Thompson, a Democrat who took part in the Field survey, agreed. She said her 24-year-old niece had just graduated from college and was working as a substitute teacher when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Because of the Affordable Care Act she was able to stay on her mother\u2019s health plan and receive lifesaving treatment. Without it, Thompson said, she could have died.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a miracle that the law came out when it did and that she was able to get the treatment she needed,\u201d said Thompson, 61, a site manager for a social services agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayward resident Melissa Sigars said she couldn\u2019t afford health insurance before the Affordable Care Act became law and feared that insurance companies marketing individual plans were trying to scam her.\n\n\u201cThere were too many steps and too much paperwork. It was overwhelming,\u201d said Sigars, 36. \u201cNow, I feel like I know what I\u2019m getting for the money.\u201d\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, said the poll results are \u201creally a testament to the thousands of people across the state saying, \u2018Let\u2019s make this work and not focus on the politics of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe was astounded, for example, to see that 48 percent of the voters under 65 have personally visited the Covered California website, up from 36 percent last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartened and a little bit baffled,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe vast majority of them have employer-based or other coverage. The fact that there is that much interest in health care reform means they may not have a personal need but may have an interest for a family member or friend. It says a lot about California in general.\u201d\n\nSince its debut in October 2013, Covered California has enrolled 1.3 million Californians while Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health program for the poor that was expanded under Obamacare, has enrolled almost 4 million people since January 2014.\n\nThe survey also found voter support is growing for extending Medi-Cal services to the state\u2019s undocumented immigrants. Today, 58 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters favor the idea, while 39 percent are opposed. Last summer, the numbers were 51 percent to 45 percent.\n\nIn addition, two in three of the state\u2019s likely voters say that a candidate\u2019s position on the health law will be very important to their vote for presidential and congressional candidates in next year\u2019s election.\n\nDespite that finding \u2014 and the overwhelming warming to the health care law revealed in this poll \u2014 two California Republicans running for statewide political office say they will try to repeal it or change it if elected.\n\nAssemblyman Rocky Chavez, R-Oceanside, who is running for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer\u2019s U.S. Senate seat in 2016, said people were promised by the Obama administration that they could keep their doctors on their new plans but often found out they couldn\u2019t.\n\nOne of his GOP opponents, Lafayette resident Tom Del Beccaro, a former California Republican Party chairman, said he would try to repeal the law because many people face such high deductibles under the Covered California plans that it discourages them from getting medical care.\n\nDiCamillo thinks Republicans will continue to denounce Obamacare to snag a spot in the primary. If one of them makes it to the general election against a Democrat like Attorney General Kamala Harris, he said, \u201cthey will probably not want to talk about it as much \u2014 they certainly would not be in the majority with the overall electorate.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 1,555 California registered voters was conducted over the phone from June 25 to July 16. While the majority of the interviews were conducted in English, 328 were done in foreign languages and dialects. The overall poll has an error rate of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Less than two years after the nation\u2019s new health care law kicked into gear, more than six in 10 California voters are embracing its reforms, and an overwhelming majority are also tipping their hats to the way it\u2019s been implemented in th", "title": "Obamacare: Poll shows rising support throughout California", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150826/obamacare-poll-shows-rising-support-throughout-california", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare: Poll shows rising support throughout California"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Less than two years after the nation\u2019s new health care law kicked into gear, more than six in 10 California voters are embracing its reforms, and an overwhelming majority are also tipping their hats to the way it\u2019s been implemented in th", "title": "Obamacare: Poll shows rising support throughout California", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150826/obamacare-poll-shows-rising-support-throughout-california", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "article_summary": "Field\u2019s ninth annual health policy survey, funded by the California Wellness Foundation, comes on the heels of other surveys done in California that reflect the positive feelings many residents have about the health law.\nDespite that finding \u2014 and the overwhelming warming to the health care law revealed in this poll \u2014 two California Republicans running for statewide political office say they will try to repeal it or change it if elected.\nFor the first time, he said, the new survey shows majorities of California voters in all major regions of the state, all races and ethnicities, and all age groups back the law.\nThe fact that there is that much interest in health care reform means they may not have a personal need but may have an interest for a family member or friend.\nThe survey also found voter support is growing for extending Medi-Cal services to the state\u2019s undocumented immigrants."}
