(RNN) - Starbucks' signature red holiday coffee cups this year have dropped designs of snowflakes, reindeer, ice skates and trees in favor of a plain look – much to the outrage of Christian evangelists.

The coffee chain usually changes up the season's designs each year, but this year went with a minimalist red cup, with a green-and-white version of the company’s logo.

Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical pastor and a social media and internet personality, posted a rant on Facebook declaring that Starbucks had removed Christ and Christmas from their cups because they hate Jesus

The post has had millions upon millions of views.

He said he "pranked" the store by ordering his coffee and telling the barristas his name was Merry Christmas, which they wrote on his cup. He also wore a T-shirt with an image of Christ on it. He flashed a small pistol he said he carried into the store in defiance of CEO Howard Schultz’ request that customers not bring firearms into the stores even in states that permit open-carry.

The outrage spread over the internet with the help of conservative websites like Breitbart News, who called it part of the “war on Christmas” and said political correctness had gone over the line.

A Starbucks spokesman said the company wanted a design that would be more inclusive.

“This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories,” said Jeffrey Fields, Starbucks’ Vice President of Design and Content.
