Because he\u2019s pandering awfully hard.\n\nThis reminds me of the debate before the 2012 primaries got rolling over whether Romney should repudiate RomneyCare. Lots of righties said yes, definitely. He\u2019s got to get that monkey off his back; otherwise he\u2019ll be vulnerable in facing an ObamaCare-hating electorate. I thought he was right to stand by it for the simple reason that he already had so many flip-flops to his record, another one \u2014 a big one \u2014 could be fatal. It would prove that there\u2019s nothing, up to and including his signature \u201cachievement\u201d as governor, that he wouldn\u2019t abandon to protect his own electability. Better to be a RINO who stands on principle than a guy who\u2019ll always pander, leaving you to wonder if you can trust him when the political tides change.\n\nAre we at that point with Rubio yet?\n\nAsked directly how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brought the same bill to the floor now, he said he would vote no because passing the bill now wouldn\u2019t be productive. \u201cAt this point, bringing the Senate bill back to the floor would be a show vote,\u201d he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt would set us back even further\u2014taking an issue that\u2019s already divided people and actually going to stir the pot and poison the well even further. Why would I support an effort to do that?\u201d\u2026 In his interview with the Journal, the Florida Republican said he still supports immigration reform, and a spokesman made clear that Mr. Rubio doesn\u2019t regret his support for last year\u2019s Senate bill, which also called for enhanced border security and an overhaul to the legal visa system.\n\nThat\u2019s technically not a flip-flop. He\u2019s not saying he\u2019d vote differently if he could travel back in time, he\u2019s saying that circumstances have changed politically such that a solution that might have worked yesterday won\u2019t work now. He\u2019s being nimble and pragmatic, not mealy-mouthed! But c\u2019mon: Of course it\u2019s a flip-flop. The reason he won\u2019t say that he\u2019d do it differently if he had it to do over again is because that would force him to admit an error in judgment, which is not something voters want to see in a would-be president. That\u2019s another reason why Romney ended up standing by RomneyCare: Whether that law was a good idea is debatable, but if he had repudiated it, the fact that he had made a serious error in judgment wouldn\u2019t have been. That\u2019s what Rubio\u2019s going for here, although I don\u2019t know how you escape the conclusion that he made a serious error in judgment anyway. One of the reasons people are so \u201cdivided\u201d about immigration right now is that conservatives, for good reason, are convinced that their own representatives are eager to sell out their concerns \u2014 including certain representatives who ran for Senate as stalwart conservatives themselves in 2010. The main catalyst of that feeling is \u2014 ta da \u2014 Rubio\u2019s Gang of Eight bill. The most generous thing you can say about his participation in the Gang is that he thought it was the best deal possible given Democrats\u2019 ludicrous affinity for illegal immigration and that an even worse policy would end up being enacted if his bill failed. (In fact, he\u2019s made that very argument himself.) But look: The reason that righties are upset with him is that the Gang of Eight bill wouldn\u2019t have worked. It would have granted probationary legal status to illegals before the border was secure. It was a bad bill not because it was \u201cdivisive\u201d or whatever, it was bad because it was bad. Is he not willing to admit that still?\n\nAnyway, he also told the Journal today that he supports ending DACA, although one of his staffers stressed that nothing he\u2019s said recently necessarily means he\u2019d support shutting down the government to stop Obama\u2019s impending amnesty. That\u2019s not surprising, needless to say. Exit question: Can we glean anything about 2016 from his immigration pandering lately? I thought, given the possibility that Rand Paul and Ted Cruz will both run, that Rubio would cede most of the conservative vote to them and run as a more establishment Republican. But now I don\u2019t know. Maybe he senses that conservatives are swinging back towards hawkishness after a flirtation with Paul-style foreign policy over the last two years. If Paul\u2019s destined to have trouble with mainstream righties, Rubio can pick up a bunch of support among them, especially among those who think Cruz might be unelectable for some reason.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Meh.", "title": "Rubio: If I had to vote again on my Gang of Eight immigration bill, I\u2019d vote no", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/28/rubio-if-i-had-to-vote-again-on-my-gang-of-eight-immigration-bill-id-vote-no/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2016, amnesty, conservative, gang of eight, immigration, Marco Rubio, reid,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T00:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T11:23:47+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a35\"", "article_summary": "But look: The reason that righties are upset with him is that the Gang of Eight bill wouldn\u2019t have worked.\nRubio: If I had to vote again on my Gang of Eight immigration bill, I\u2019d vote noposted at 8:41 pm on August 28, 2014 by AllahpunditI hope you guys appreciate how hard he\u2019s been pandering to you lately.\n\u201cAt this point, bringing the Senate bill back to the floor would be a show vote,\u201d he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\nAsked directly how he would vote if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brought the same bill to the floor now, he said he would vote no because passing the bill now wouldn\u2019t be productive.\nIt was a bad bill not because it was \u201cdivisive\u201d or whatever, it was bad because it was bad."}
