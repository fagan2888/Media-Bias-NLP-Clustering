Hospitals can still keep their identity and autonomy by reaching out for resources through affiliations.\n\nTelemedicine is a growing option for rural healthcare facilities to help patients, but regulatory issues can impede that treatment. Drop said the country must embrace telemedicine and make it easier to provide virtual health services, as opposed to making it harder.\n\nAs in many rural facilities in the U.S. recruiting physicians is always a challenge. To handle the task of bringing physicians into the rural healthcare setting, the Fargo division hired a full-time recruiter to specifically find doctors who meet the hospitals' profiles and want the small-town atmosphere, Drop said.\n\nIn upstate New York, legislators are working on laws that will address a growing shortage of primary care doctors in the region, although as of now, legislation makes no provision to require doctors to practice in rural or underserved areas, the Olean Times Herald reported.\n\nEducators and healthcare officials in Idaho, where the number of physicians and nurses is below the national average and the lowest rate of students entering medical school, recently met to discuss options to fill the care gaps in rural communities, according to KLEW TV.\n\nThe goal of rural healthcare organizations is to make hospitals a community resource that provide patients with access to care, he said. \"Whatever it takes, we want to provide the appropriate level of care. If we can accomplish that, we're doing service to all of our little towns,\" Drop told Becker's.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's Drop's interview with Becker's\n\n- read the Times Herald article\n\n- check out the KLEW TV story\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRural hospitals equal in outcomes, ahead in ED care\n\nRural hospitals desperately need healthcare workers\n\nExperts say rural healthcare in crisis\n\nAHA blasts OIG plan to recertify critical access hospitals\n\nSurgical mortality no worse at critical access hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rural hospitals around the country face many challenges, but there are also many opportunities to grow from those challenges, Jeffrey Drop, senior vice president and division exectutive officer for the Fargo, North Dakota division of Catholic Health Initiatives,\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent interview with\u00a0Becker's Hospital Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Rural hospitals around the country face many challenges, but there are also many opportunities to grow from those challenges, Jeffrey Drop, senior vice president and division exectutive officer for the Fargo, North Dakota division of Catholic Health Initiatives,\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent interview with\u00a0Becker's Hospital Review.", "title": "Rural hospitals face physician recruitment, telemedicine challenges", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/rural-hospitals-face-physician-recruitment-telemedicine-challenges/2014-06-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "affiliations,Care Delivery,Catholic Health Initiatives,Health Information Technology,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,physician recruitment,rural hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Telemedicine is a growing option for rural healthcare facilities to help patients, but regulatory issues can impede that treatment.\nThe goal of rural healthcare organizations is to make hospitals a community resource that provide patients with access to care, he said.\nDrop oversees 12 of the 24 critical access hospitals in the system, facing issues like physician recruitment, telemedicine use and providing care to such a large geographic area in North Dakota and Minnesota, according to the article.\nDrop said the country must embrace telemedicine and make it easier to provide virtual health services, as opposed to making it harder.\nTo learn more:- here's Drop's interview with Becker's- read the Times Herald article- check out the KLEW TV storyRelated Articles:Rural hospitals equal in outcomes, ahead in ED careRural hospitals desperately need healthcare workersExperts say rural healthcare in crisisAHA blasts OIG plan to recertify critical access hospitalsSurgical mortality no worse at critical access hospitals"}
