Gov. Brian Sandoval recently gave the Weekly Republican Address.

He cheered Nevada’s improving economy and explained that despite divided government in Nevada, he’s been able to work with people on both sides of the aisle. It was his chance to make a case for himself to a national GOP audience.

Among other things, he said, “It’s no accident that the fastest growing states with the best economies are all led by Republican governors.”

He’s right — if you look at only the top two states for fastest economic growth, according to a report released in June by the Bureau of Economic Analysis: North Dakota and Texas.

He’s wrong — if you look at the top six states for fastest economic growth because numbers 3 through 6 all have Democratic governors: Oregon, Washington, Minnesota and California.

It’s probably best to round things off at the Top 10 states. In that case, five are led by Republican governors and five by Democratic governors.

Sandoval, in other words, is way off base. He also didn’t mention that Nevada ranks 31st on the chart for fastest economic growth.
