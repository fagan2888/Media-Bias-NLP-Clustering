In August, the staffing industry added more than 13,000 jobs, 7.2 percent more than were added in August 2012. Since the recession ended, the country has added nearly a million such jobs.\n\nTemp workers are a great deal for businesses, let\u2019s face it. The companies get skilled workers, many of whom have been laid off from full-time positions in the same industry \u2013 but without long-term obligations or expensive benefits. They can also adjust the size of their workforces quickly to meet the needs of a changing economy without the cost or PR issues associated with layoffs.\n\nRELATED: WALMART INCREASINGLY TURNS TO TEMP WORKERS\n\n\n\nBut for many employees, getting stuck in a temporary job without job security or benefits can be a frustrating experience, to say the least. Three-quarters of staffing employees have some interest in finding a full-time job.\n\nStill, employment experts say temp jobs are a foot in the door for workers, and can often lead to an opportunity to \u201cconvert,\u201d as the industry calls it, to a full-time position.\n\n\u201cWe see people convert all the time,\u201d says Dawn Fay, a district president with Robert Half International. \u201cWe certainly see more of it as the market gets better. A lot of individuals are getting hired into full-time jobs.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a contract worker looking to convert, take these steps to show you\u2019re full-time material.\n\n1. Consider it an interview for a full-time job\n\nYou want to make the best possible first impression with an employer. \u201cTreat the first interview as if you\u2019re interviewing for a full-time position,\u201d says Frank Dadah, general manager of the New York Financial Contract Staffing Division for WinterWyman, a staffing agency. \u201cDo the same research prior to the interview, and ask detailed, thorough questions.\u201d Then, once you\u2019ve landed the temp work, remember that your supervisor is taking note of your work ethic, efficiency, and ability to fit in with the team\u2019s culture.\n\nRELATED: TEMP JOBS: 3 WORKERS SAY WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE\n\n2. Don\u2019t ask for full-time work right away.\n\nIf you work for a staffing agency, it\u2019s fine to tell the agency that your ultimate goal is to find a salaried gig \u2013 but don\u2019t lead with that when you meet your new employer. Companies who think you\u2019re only interested in full-time work may think you\u2019re not going to give your full attention to a project \u2013 or they may worry that as soon as a full-time job comes along you\u2019ll abandon your current role.\n\nInstead, concentrate on performing your work beyond expectations. Come in early, stay late, and if you\u2019ve got down time, ask if there\u2019s anything else you can do, even if the work doesn\u2019t fit into your assigned role. \u201cDon\u2019t go into the job thinking of yourself as a temp,\u201d Dadah says. \u201cGo in with the attitude of a new employee.\u201d After a few weeks, if you\u2019ve developed a rapport with your supervisor, mention you\u2019d love to extend your contract and would be interested in full-time work if anything becomes available.\n\n3. Add value\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked in a similar role in other companies, you\u2019ll likely bring a fresh perspective to a position. When you spot a process or method that could be more efficient or a potential sales opportunity, write down your ideas and present them to your supervisor. If you see a coworker struggling with a project, offer to help \u2013 you\u2019ll be proving to the boss as well to coworkers that you\u2019re integral to the team. \u201cDo anything you can to make sure everyone knows you\u2019re committed to helping the company grow,\u201d says Tom Gimbel, president and chief executive officer of Chicago-based staffing firm LaSalle Network.\n\n4. Network in and out of your department\n\nTry to build relationships as quickly as possible. Go out of your way to be friendly with coworkers both inside and outside your department. Be as visible as possible within the company \u2013 introduce yourself to others rather than waiting for them to introduce themselves to you.\n\nIf you get to know new contacts in meetings or at a company happy hour, follow up with a connection on LinkedIn. Even if the department where you work doesn\u2019t have openings, supervisors from other divisions might have a full-time position (or know of one) that could be a good fit.\n\n5. If you get a job offer, expect to make less.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: When it comes to wages, employers actually pay a premium to contract workers, since they can get specialized skills and usually don\u2019t have to provide benefits or paid time off. \u201cA lot of contract workers are surprised they have to take a big pay cut when they\u2019re hired full-time,\u201d says Steven Raz, co-founder and managing partner of Cornerstone Search Group, an executive search firm in Parsippany, N.J. So be prepared for sticker shock when the salary offer comes along \u2013 but also be sure to calculate the value of health care coverage and other benefits once you go into negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you're a contract worker looking to convert, take these steps to show your employer that you're full-time material.", "title": "How to Make Your Temp Job a Full-Time Gig", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/11/How-Make-Your-Temp-Job-Full-Time-Gig", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/11/How-Make-Your-Temp-Job-Full-Time-Gig", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you're a contract worker looking to convert, take these steps to show your employer that you're full-time material.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A lot of individuals are getting hired into full-time jobs.\u201dIf you\u2019re a contract worker looking to convert, take these steps to show you\u2019re full-time material.\nHesitant to commit to full-time employees, companies have increasingly turned to contract workers to fill job openings.\nThree-quarters of staffing employees have some interest in finding a full-time job.\nTemp workers are a great deal for businesses, let\u2019s face it.\nRELATED: WALMART INCREASINGLY TURNS TO TEMP WORKERSBut for many employees, getting stuck in a temporary job without job security or benefits can be a frustrating experience, to say the least."}
