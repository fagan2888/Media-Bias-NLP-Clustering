Cohen, the official in charge of the federal health insurance marketplace, who repeatedly told Congress before its troubled rollout that it would work well, said on Thursday that he was resigning.\n\nMr. Cohen is the chief architect of federal rules regulating the operations of private health insurance under the new health care law. He said he would leave his post to return to California at the end of this month, when the open enrollment period closes for individuals and families shopping for insurance.\n\nWhen Mr. Cohen addressed a conference of insurance company executives here on Thursday, he was asked about problems that continue to bedevil the new federal marketplace.\n\nOne health plan executive asked why the Obama administration kept extending the deadline for existing health plans to comply with more rigorous insurance standards set by the Affordable Care Act. Federal officials said this week that they would allow the renewal of existing policies for two more years, through 2016, averting a wave of insurance cancellations that could have done political damage to Democrats in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMr. Cohen said the administration provided the reprieve for these policies because \u201cwe wanted to give people as many options as we could to be sure they stay in coverage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere were people who had insurance who felt that the cost of moving into a new plan was going to be prohibitive for them,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cWe are trying to provide a transition. We are making a lot of changes in the market all at once. The last thing we want is for anybody who had health insurance coverage to not have it.\u201d\n\nInsurers at the meeting expressed concerns about President Obama\u2019s decision to let some people renew insurance policies that do not comply with the new law. Insurers worry that healthy people will tend to stick with the older policies and not join the new marketplaces.\n\nMr. Cohen said that, under a new rule issued this week, the administration would spend more than originally estimated to compensate insurers for financial losses they might experience as a result of the president\u2019s transition policy.\n\nHis remarks came as Mr. Obama was making an appeal for Latinos to take advantage of the coverage available through the exchanges until March 31. Mr. Obama assured them that signing up for insurance would not lead to deportation for any relatives in the United States illegally.\n\n\u201cNone of the information that is provided in order for you to obtain health insurance is in any way transferred to immigration services,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a town-hall-style meeting held by Spanish-language news media outlets. Illegal immigrants are generally not eligible for health benefits, but many of their children are United States citizens eligible for subsidized coverage.\n\nAs director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, Mr. Cohen has worked closely with insurers, consumers, health care providers, state insurance regulators and Congress.\n\nIn April of last year, he told Congress that \u201cwe are on schedule and on track\u201d with information technology to run the federal website, HealthCare.gov, starting on Oct. 1. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic and confident at where we are at this point,\u201d he said then. In September, less than two weeks before the start of open enrollment, Mr. Cohen testified that consumers \u201cwill be able to choose a plan and get enrolled in coverage beginning Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nMr. Cohen will be replaced at least temporarily by Dr. Mandy K. Cohen, who is now in charge of consumer assistance efforts at the insurance oversight office in the Health and Human Services Department. (The two officials are not related.)\n\nBefore joining the government, Dr. Cohen was executive director of Doctors for America, an advocacy group that campaigned for passage of the health care law. Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, was a founder of the group, started as Doctors for Obama in the 2008 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said Mr. Cohen was \u201cleaving the Obamacare exchange in complete disarray.\u201d But Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he had \u201cmade the promise of the Affordable Care Act a reality for millions of Americans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140306170122, "twitter": {"description": "Before the troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov, Gary M.
