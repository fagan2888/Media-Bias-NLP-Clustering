In a lightning-delayed NCAA Tournament quarterfinal at Sports Authority Field at Mile High that kept the onlooking Denver Pioneers anxious Saturday afternoon, top-seeded Notre Dame was outscored 5-0 in the third quarter before going on a 6-0 run to defeat Albany (N.Y) 14-10.

The Fighting Irish, who advance to their second consecutive Final Four, blew an 8-4 halftime lead and trailed 9-8 going into the fourth quarter. But they scored six consecutive goals — two by senior midfielder Nick Ossello of Wheat Ridge — to take command 14-9 with 5:45 to play.

Albany freshman Connor Fields had a game-high six goals, including three in the Great Danes’ dominant third quarter. Field’s sixth tally came with 27 seconds remaining, Albany’s only goal in the final 16 minutes.

Notre Dame , an 11-9 loser to Duke in the 2014 national championship, will play the Denver-Ohio State winner in Friday’s Final Four semifinals in Philadelphia. The Irish were led offensively by Sergio Perkovic (four goals, assist) and Conor Doyle (three goals, assist).

The game was stopped for 1 hour, 20 minutes late in the second quarter because of lightning.
