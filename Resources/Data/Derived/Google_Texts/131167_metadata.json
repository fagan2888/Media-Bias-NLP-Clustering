This bill simply makes government think before it acts by answering, \u2018How will this impact America\u2019s working families?' \" Chabot said.\n\nDemocrats warned the measure's provisions would drag out agency rule-making.\n\n\"Under the guise of protecting small businesses from allegedly burdensome regulatory requirements, this bill is just another attempt to prevent regulatory agencies from promulgating regulations that promote and protect the health and safety of Americans,\" said Rep. John Conyers (Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe White House issued a veto threat against the bill, saying it would \"impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.\"\n\nBefore final passage, the House rejected, 172-248, an amendment offered by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee Sheila Jackson-LeePelosi: \u2018We must and we will bring back\u2019 Nigerian schoolgirls Big bucks spent honoring lawmakers Black caucus treads carefully into Apple-FBI fight MORE (D-Texas) that would exempt all regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration related to consumer safety.\n\nThe House has passed versions of the same bill in the last two sessions of Congress.\n\nThursday's vote was for the second bill on the House floor this week to reform the regulatory process.
