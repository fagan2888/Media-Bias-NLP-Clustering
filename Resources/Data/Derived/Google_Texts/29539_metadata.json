SM3 Z.E. electric vehicle sits on display at the first International Electric Vehicle Expo in Seogwipo, Jeju, South Korea, on Sunday, March 16, 2014. Bloomberg News\n\nJEJU, South Korea\u2013On a fine Monday, Uhm Hyung-gil, 65, passed up a visit to the seashore of the scenic island of Jeju to check out an electric-car exhibition at the International Convention Center here to test drive Renault-Samsung Motors\u2019 compact SM3 Z.E.\n\n\u201cI think it was worth my visit here,\u201d said Mr. Uhm, a businessman who lives in Gujwa County, east of Jeju. \u201cThe car is pretty cool. I felt comfortable in it. It was so quiet that I thought the car could hit pedestrians without [their] knowing it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nHe said he now is considering replacing his 18-year-old gasoline-guzzling sedan with a battery-powered vehicle in the coming months.\n\nSouth Korea aims to have all the cars on Jeju be electric by 2030, as the resort island, about half the size of Rhode Island, is within the single-charge range of most battery-powered vehicles. The country, one of the world\u2019s most aggressive in adopting emissions-free policies, has turned to electric cars as concerns grow about the environment and volatile oil prices.\n\nTo achieve its goal, the government is offering generous subsidies and tax breaks for electric-vehicle, or EV, buyers, while planning to impose taxes on vehicles with large amounts of carbon emissions starting next year.\u201dHaving more electric cars on the road across the country is one of the government\u2019s top priorities,\u201d Vice Minister of Environment Jung Young-man said Monday at the government-organized exhibition.\n\nThe show has drawn more than 30,000 visitors since its opening Saturday, said Hur Sujung, an official with the event\u2019s organizer. She said it has been years since an event at the convention center has attracted such a large number of visitors.\n\nThe new policy would help increase the number of small cars and fuel-efficient cars and reduce energy consumption in a nation where two thirds of automobiles are mid- to large-sized sized vehicles, the Environment Ministry said. South Korea heavily depends on imports for its energy needs.\n\nA man gets into a Nissan Motor Co.

Bloomberg News\n\nAttracted by lavish state support, Nissan Motor Co. introduced its best-selling electric car, the Leaf, to South Korea at the exhibition. The Japanese car maker, which has sold more than 100,000 units of the vehicle globally since its launch in 2010, expects to sell the Leaf in Korea from the second half of this year.\n\n\u201cThis event is different from any other events that I\u2019ve been to because Jeju is one hundred percent committed to EV by 2030,\u201d said Billy Hayes, vice president of Nissan\u2019s global electric vehicle business. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to be able to put the Leaf on Korean consumers\u2019 shopping lists.\u201d\n\nOther global automotive manufacturers, including BMW AG, General Motors Co. and Renault SA, also put their latest battery-powered models on display.\n\nTesla Motors Inc., the global leader in luxury EV cars such as the Model S sedan, missed the exhibition, citing a tight schedule, while Hyundai Motor Co., Korea\u2019s largest auto maker, skipped the show because its first electric-vehicle wouldn\u2019t be ready until 2016, organizers said.\n\nA woman test drives a Kia Motors Corp.

Bloomberg News\n\nOn Jeju, drivers can travel along the 180 kilometers of coastal roads. Because electric vehicles, once fully charged, can travel between 100km and 150km and given most people drive less than 100km daily on average, the island is about the right size for the use of EVs, local government officials said.\n\nJeju provides as much as 23 million won ($21,800) in subsidies for a EV purchase this year. The amount is almost double those in other advanced countries. The U.S. and Japan\u2013the world\u2019s top markets for electric-car sales\u2013offer up to $10,000 and $13,300, respectively.\n\nThere are some 300,000 vehicles on the roads in the island, of which 360 are powered by battery. The government said it aims to raise the ratio to 30% by 2020 and turn Jeju into a carbon-free island by 2030, by which time its total number of cars is expected to rise to 370,000.\n\nAcross the country, the government hopes to raise the number of all-electric vehicles on its roads to one million by 2020 from fewer than 2,000 now.\n\nAnalysts, however, say a lack of charging stations, the absence of a unified charge standard and range concerns are stumbling blocks to broad adoption of electric vehicles in South Korea as well as globally, which can\u2019t be resolved in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe switch to zero-emission cars makes a perfect sense, but just don\u2019t expect it to happen quickly,\u201d said Sunwoo Myoung-ho, a Hanyang University professor and the president of the World Electric Vehicle Association. \u201cNevertheless, EV or ultra-low-emissions vehicles are the future.\u201d\n\nDriven by tighter emissions standards in Europe, world-wide production of electric vehicles is expected to soar 67% to more than 403,000 units this year, according to research firm IHS Automotive.\n\nThe huge increase contrasts with the 3.6% rise in global manufacturing of all motor vehicles expected in 2014.\n\nFollow In-Soo Nam on Twitter @namsama_wsj\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nSouth Korea Softens Tone on Abe Comments\n\nKeeping North Korea in Human Rights Spotlight", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "South Korea aims to have all the cars on Jeju be electric by 2030, as the resort island, about half the size of Rhode Island, is within the single-charge range of most battery-powered vehicles.", "title": "Electric Vehicles Spark Growing Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/17/electric-vehicles-spark-growing-interest/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY318_jejuev_P_20140317040442.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Electric Vehicles Spark Growing Interest", "description": "South Korea aims to have all the cars on Jeju be electric by 2030, as the resort island, about half the size of Rhode Island, is within the single-charge range of most battery-powered vehicles.", "article_section": "World", "author": "In-Soo Nam", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Korea Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Korea Real Time", "article.summary": "South Korea aims to have all the cars on Jeju be electric by 2030, as the resort island, about half the size of Rhode Island, is within the single-charge range of most battery-powered vehicles.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-17T07:59:10-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/17/electric-vehicles-spark-growing-interest/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-KRTB-5257", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "South Korea aims to have all the cars on Jeju be electric by 2030, as the resort island, about half the size of Rhode Island, is within the single-charge range of most battery-powered vehicles.", "title": "Electric Vehicles Spark Growing Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/17/electric-vehicles-spark-growing-interest/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY318_jejuev_P_20140317040442.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Korea Real Time", "article.id": "BL-KRTB-5257", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-17T08:38:01-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb736\"", "article_summary": "electric vehicle sits on display at the first International Electric Vehicle Expo in Seogwipo, Jeju, South Korea, on Sunday, March 16, 2014.\nLeaf electric vehicle (EV) for a test drive during the first International Electric Vehicle Expo in Seogwipo, Jeju, South Korea.\nA woman test drives a Kia Motors Corp.
