Researchers handed out surveys to students at the Cal State University campuses of Los Angeles, Fresno and San Jose in September and October last year. The poll was conducted by Cal State University of Los Angeles\u2019s Department of Public Health as part of the Health Insurance Education Project.\n\nResults of the survey also found that 73 percent of the students said they should have insurance because \u201cI will have access to care if I need it.\u201d Also, 19 percent said having insurance was the \u201cresponsible thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe results show that the so-called young invincibles want to comply with the Affordable Care Act but have shied away from signing up for health care for different reasons, said Walter Zelman, chairman of the Cal State L.A. Department of Public Health and director of the project.\n\n\u201cMost students may be in good health, and when compared to older individuals, insurance may not be high on their priority list,\u201d Zelman said in the study. \u201cBut they know they need it. They just have not been able to afford it. This is not about invincibility; it is about affordability,\u201d\n\nA lack of knowledge about where to sign up for health plans may also be why uninsured youth have avoided enrollment, which means more outreach and time are needed to educate young people about the plans. At least 77 percent of those who responded to the survey said they hadn\u2019t heard of Covered California, the state\u2019s health exchange that offers plans at various price ranges. And most didn\u2019t know that if they are low income, they qualify for subsidized coverage, including Medi-Cal, Zelman said.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the of 437,000 students in the California State University system are uninsured, and at least 34 percent of those uninsured are older students age 22 to 25 years old.\n\nZelman said the poll was conducted before Covered California stepped up its marketing efforts toward the young and uninsured.\n\nCovered California officials said last month that about 25 percent of the nearly half million who purchased health plans since enrollment kicked off on Oct. 1 were between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe this may be the first published poll taken of university students on their health insurance status, and the circumstances and views underlying that status,\u201d Zelman said, but acknowledged that the poll does not meet \u201cpeer review\u201d standards, or standards applied by professional polling organizations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uninsured California State University students have avoided signing up for health care coverage because they believe it\u2019s expensive, not because they think they don\u2019t need it, results from a poll released on Monday show.At least 8", "title": "Cal State students say health insurance too expensive", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140203/cal-state-students-say-health-insurance-too-expensive", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Cal State students say health insurance too expensive"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Uninsured California State University students have avoided signing up for health care coverage because they believe it\u2019s expensive, not because they think they don\u2019t need it, results from a poll released on Monday show.At least 8", "title": "Cal State students say health insurance too expensive", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140203/cal-state-students-say-health-insurance-too-expensive", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "article_summary": "The poll was conducted by Cal State University of Los Angeles\u2019s Department of Public Health as part of the Health Insurance Education Project.\nResearchers handed out surveys to students at the Cal State University campuses of Los Angeles, Fresno and San Jose in September and October last year.\nUninsured California State University students have avoided signing up for health care coverage because they believe it\u2019s expensive, not because they think they don\u2019t need it, results from a poll released on Monday show.\nAbout 30 percent of the of 437,000 students in the California State University system are uninsured, and at least 34 percent of those uninsured are older students age 22 to 25 years old.\nAt least 80 percent of the 836 students who responded said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it, while 7percent replied that they did not think they needed it."}
