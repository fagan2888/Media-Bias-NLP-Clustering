The plan was proposed by Gov. John Hickenlooper after the Aurora theater shooting and the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.\n\nBut the plan was delayed for months as the first bidding process was deemed a failure and one company with a revoked contract took the state to court.\n\nThe contract for the hotline was untangled from the court delay of other contracts earlier this year, and a deal with Metro Crisis Services was signed in May.\n\nThe statewide 24-hour hotline, expected to be functional in August, will be the first part of the revamped plan to expand access to help.\n\nThose who take the calls are trained to help stabilize a person in crisis and provide referrals to services, preferably avoiding police or busy emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge benefit for all of Colorado as it will provide one place that people can call to then be routed to crisis services across the state,\u201d said Patrick Fox, deputy director of clinical services for the state\u2019s Office of Behavioral Health.\n\nMetro Crisis Services has been in Denver since 2010 operating a local hotline for mental health crisis, as well as answering calls for the national Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Disaster Distress Helpline.\n\nAlready, Metro Crisis Services has hired and trained six additional clinicians to field the expected increase in call volume. They also hired four regional coordinators, an administrative assistant and an operations director.\n\nWith the expansion, Metro Crisis Services also will introduce peer specialists \u2014 people who have been through a mental health crisis themselves and are in recovery. Six peers and a supervisor have been hired and trained.\n\nCallers will have a choice to speak with a peer specialist, but the licensed clinicians will be the default for anyone who is unsure.\n\nBoth clinicians and peer specialists will be responsible for calling back people after their crisis to check that they did connect with the recommended services.\n\nFor now, twice as many call-takers are working in about 2,400 square feet of space, until they move into a new 5,600-square-foot office in the coming weeks.\n\nPart of the $3 million in the contract is funding the creation of a custom database that will allow clinicians and peer specialists to access resource directory information or evaluation checklists faster, and to help track the use and effectiveness of the hotline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a hotline. This is a service,\u201d said Metro Crisis Services CEO Bev Marquez. \u201cWe want people to know they are thoughtfully being cared for.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mental health crisis hotline ready to go statewide in August", "title": "Mental health crisis hotline ready to go statewide in August", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/mental-health-crisis-hotline-ready-to-go-statewide-in-august/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__20140628_A1_CD28HOTLINEp1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__20140628_A1_CD28HOTLINEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T20:46:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:05:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f59\"", "article_summary": "Metro Crisis Services, a nonprofit local hotline, won a $3 million state contract to expand its call center into the first statewide mental health crisis hotline.\nWith the expansion, Metro Crisis Services also will introduce peer specialists \u2014 people who have been through a mental health crisis themselves and are in recovery.\nIt\u2019s part of a larger, $20 million plan to change the way people going through a mental health crisis can access help.\nMetro Crisis Services has been in Denver since 2010 operating a local hotline for mental health crisis, as well as answering calls for the national Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Disaster Distress Helpline.\nThis is a service,\u201d said Metro Crisis Services CEO Bev Marquez."}
