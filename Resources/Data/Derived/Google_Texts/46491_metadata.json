As a result, small-business owners may be able to shift some of their health care costs, especially as they increase, to their workers.\n\n\u201cRepublicans Successfully Chip Away Another Piece of ObamaCare,\u201d said the headline of a press release from the office of House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cRepealing this provision will give employers more flexibility over the type of health care options they can offer their employees and will expand the use of high-deductible plans paired with Health Savings Accounts,\u201d the press release said. A spokesman for Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, speaking to Associated Press, called it \u201canother in a series of changes to Obamacare that the House has supported to help save Americans from being harmed by the law.\u201d\n\nThe Republican victory is largely symbolic, however. The Obama administration had effectively nullified this provision of the Affordable Care Act more than a year ago through regulation.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provision at issue limited the deductibles in small-group health plans to $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage. Separately, the law also required that small-group plans meet minimum standards for how health care expenses are split between the policyholder and the plan \u2014 what is known as actuarial value. The least-generous plans allowed by the law, known as bronze plans, must cover 60 percent of the expenses incurred by a typical group of enrollees.\n\nBut it turns out to be very difficult to design a bronze individual plan with a deductible of $2,000 (or, for that matter, a family plan with a deductible under $4,000). As a result, in February 2013, the Health and Human Services Department released final regulations that allowed a plan to have a higher deductible \u201cif that plan may not reasonably reach the actuarial value of a given level of coverage\u201d without it.\n\n\u201cThey effectively waived that requirement,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. \u201cThey basically said, this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nMr. Jost said that a conflict between two separate provisions in a major law wasn\u2019t unusual, but that the partisan paralysis in Washington had made it impossible to fix that sort of mistake in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 apparently, that is, until now. \u201cThe administration has been forced to deal with it as best they can,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of things in the statute that the agencies have had to massage.\u201d\n\nKevin Kuhlman, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, said the Health and Human Services\u2019 regulation was at best provisional. The regulation is due to be revisited in 2016, and there was no guarantee, he said, that the regulation blocking the deductible caps would remain. \u201cThis is a significant limiting factor on deductible flexibility in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very few ways to mitigate premium increases because of all the new requirements in the law.\u201d\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, which lobbied for the health care reform law, agreed that that flexibility would afford small-business owners the opportunity to pass on more of the cost of coverage to employees. \u201cIf there\u2019s a higher deductible, there\u2019s usually a lower premium,\u201d he said, \u201cand the small-business owner doesn\u2019t pay the deductible.\u201d But higher deductibles, he said, may discourage lower-income employees from using their insurance to get care.\n\nMr. Pollack said that the deductible caps probably kept some business owners from offering plans with deductibles far beyond the limits, even as he acknowledged that the regulation had basically swept the provision aside. \u201cThis,\u201d he said of the latest action, \u201copens the door. They don\u2019t seem to have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Pollack held out hope that, despite the continuing rhetoric of repeal, Republicans are coming to terms with the health care law and will work with Democrats to correct its flaws. \u201cThey haven\u2019t crossed a Rubicon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey forded a stream. It\u2019s a modest, incremental step.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140410070007, "BN": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 10, 2014", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Small Business,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/It's Official: No Deductible Caps in Small-Business Health Plans ( 20140410 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/its-official-no-deductible-caps-in-small-business-health-plans/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "The legislative fix may allow small-business owners to shift some of their health care costs to their workers.", "card": "summary", "title": "It's Official: No Deductible Caps in Small-Business Health Plans"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "description": "The legislative fix may allow small-business owners to shift some of their health care costs to their workers.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 10, 2014", "article": {"tag": "The Agenda", "published_time": 1397127607, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-04-10T11:00:07-04:00"}, "utime": 20140410110007, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140410, "pdate": 20140410, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Regulation and Deregulation of Industry;Small Business", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "The legislative fix may allow small-business owners to shift some of their health care costs to their workers.", "title": "It's Official: No Deductible Caps in Small-Business Health Plans", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/its-official-no-deductible-caps-in-small-business-health-plans/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/its-official-no-deductible-caps-in-small-business-health-plans/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "It's Official: No Deductible Caps in Small-Business Health Plans", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd060\"", "article_summary": "As a result, small-business owners may be able to shift some of their health care costs, especially as they increase, to their workers.\nThe Affordable Care Act provision at issue limited the deductibles in small-group health plans to $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage.\nTucked inside the so-called Medicare \u201cdoc fix\u201d bill \u2014 must-pass legislation to forestall steep cuts in payments to doctors \u2014 that President Obama recently signed was a separate provision that removed restrictions on deductibles in small-business health plans.\n\u201cRepealing this provision will give employers more flexibility over the type of health care options they can offer their employees and will expand the use of high-deductible plans paired with Health Savings Accounts,\u201d the press release said.\nThe least-generous plans allowed by the law, known as bronze plans, must cover 60 percent of the expenses incurred by a typical group of enrollees."}
