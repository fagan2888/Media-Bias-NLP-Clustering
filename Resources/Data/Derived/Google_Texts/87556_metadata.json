But Fairbanks audio-visual guy Jonathan Huff said he found his eyes wandering to the edges of the stage.\n\nAs he described it, Huff\u2019s mind seldom drifts far from the technical details that make productions possible. That included when he was attending a family reunion with his wife in Myrtle Beach, Florida, and they went to a dinner theatre with a pirate theme.\n\n\u201cI told my wife, \u2018Is it bad that I\u2019m watching the rigging and not the stuff that\u2019s going on over there?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grow the value of production both in town and in the state. I\u2019m always looking at the next way of doing something. Or a different way of doing something that I\u2019m already doing.\u201d\n\nIf you live in Fairbanks, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve seen Huff\u2019s work even if you\u2019ve never met him or noticed his equipment van with the vanity plate \u201cAV\u201d for audio visual parked outside a Fairbanks concert or convention venue.\n\nIn Fairbanks, Huff\u2019s production company \u201cAlaska Universal Productions\u201d did technical work for events this year including the Fairbanks Cirque du Soleil show, the Rodney Atkins concert at Fort Wainwright and the Arctic Energy Summit. He\u2019s done work for television and movie productions like the commercial for the Fairbanks Asylum Haunted House and work on the Hollywood horror movie \u201cUnnatural.\u201d He\u2019s always doing some kind of production work. He estimates there were only one or two days this year that he wasn\u2019t doing something for his business.\n\nEarly start\n\nThere was no audio visual club at Anchorage\u2019s Bartlett High School when Huff was a student. Huff got into technical audio work at his church. As one of the only self-described \u201cAV nerds\u201d at Bartlett he found his skills were needed for a string of plays, stating with a production of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d Huff, who\u2019s now 30, founded his business Alaska Universal Productions when he was still a high school student.\n\nHuff first came to Fairbanks to get an associate degree at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He\u2019s long been at home at the Fairbanks North Star Borough\u2019s Carlson Center. While he worked on an associate degree from UAF, his first job in Fairbanks was as a part-time Zamboni driver and tech guy at the venue.\n\nAfter a stint back in Anchorage working for TV station KTUU, he returned to Fairbanks for another job back at the Carlson Center in 2005. The arena wanted him to help install the large video display over the hockey rink.\n\nHuff was at the Carlson Center again when he was interviewed for this story. He was setting up for the Arctic Energy Summit organizing, a banquet-type setup over the arena\u2019s hockey rink that he\u2019s done many times before.\n\nAmbitions\n\nHuff measures the growth of his business with its growing gear pile. He purchased his first equipment, a set of 12 stand lights, in 2006. At that time he could fit all his gear into his apartment at Sophie Station. His equipment has now grown to the point that he rents a 2,400-square-foot storage unit to house all the lights, speakers, sound boards and other gear.\n\nBut event and film production work is inconsistent. Huff and one part-time employee do the day-to-day work and when big shows come to town they draw on a large pool of temporary employees. With its massive set and flying acrobats, the traveling Cirque du Soleil show in 2014 used a local Fairbanks staff of 60, a particularly large technical support team.\n\nThe most technically complex show Huff has directed audio and visual effects for was the 2014 opening ceremony for the Arctic Winter games. That event, also at the Carlson Center, featured more than 2,600 participants. Huff used more than 100 lights, 25 of them moving, and 50 of them used specifically to illuminate fabric hanging from the rafters. Huff controlled the lights with his $13,000 lighting console, his favorite piece of equipment in his tool box.\n\nHe\u2019d like to do more complex productions in the future, but in general he likes to see more of any kind of show come to the Interior.\n\n\u201cIt keeps people active. It brings great value to town and just keeps people living here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the town gets boring and dries up people are going to move out.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "There was a live sea lion on stage - and ducks, and pyrotechnics.
