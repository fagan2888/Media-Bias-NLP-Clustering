Foreign buyers are moving in. A new wave of contemporary architecture is taking hold. And a growing class of tech executives is helping to fuel the boom,\u201d reported The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Mansion section in 2013. \u201cAs other American cities have been buffeted by an uneven economy, Washington\u2019s property market has been buoyed by two forces specific to the capital city: a surge of federal contractors and a rising tide of government spending. The result: what real-estate agents and developers are calling an unprecedented real-estate surge.\u201d The number of homes selling at over a million dollars\u2014over $5 million\u2014is soaring.\n\nSort of like the Capitol in The Hunger Games.\n\nA rising tide of government spending may be bad for the American economy, but it\u2019s great for the Washington area. Washington is wealthy and getting wealthier, despite the very slow recovery in most of the country. Seven of the ten richest counties in America, including the top three, are in the Washington area. That partly reflects the fact that federal employees make substantially more money than private-sector employees\u2014more than double at last count. And it also reflects the boom in lobbying and contracting as government comes to claim and redistribute more of the wealth produced in all those other metropolitan areas.\n\nMoney spent in Washington, as with most national capitals, is taken from the people who produced it all over America. Washington produces little real value on its own. National defense and courts are essential to our freedom and prosperity, but that\u2019s a small part of what the federal government does these days. Most federal activity involves taking money from some people, giving it to others, and keeping a big chunk as a transaction fee.\n\nEvery business and interest group in society has an office in Washington devoted to getting some of the $4 trillion federal budget for itself: senior citizens, farmers, veterans, teachers, social workers, oil companies, labor unions, the military-industrial complex\u2014you name it. The massive spending increases of the Bush-Obama years have created a lot of well-off people in Washington. Consulting and contracting exploded after 9/11. New regulatory burdens, notably from Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, are generating jobs in the lobbying and regulatory compliance business.\n\nWalk down K Street, the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying industry, and look at the directories in the office buildings. They\u2019re full of lobbyists and associations that are in Washington, for one reason: because, as Willie Sutton said about why he robbed banks, \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\n\nAs President Obama began his first term with a massive \u201cstimulus\u201d bill\u2014called \u201cPorkulus\u201d by Tea Party activists\u2014the Washington Post reported that \u201cmore than 90 organizations hired lobbyists to specifically influence provisions of the massive stimulus bill.\u201d The number of newly lobbying registrations peaked on the day after Obama\u2019s inauguration and continued to grow as the bill worked its way through both houses of Congress.\n\nLobbying didn\u2019t start with the Obama years, of course. President Bush increased annual federal spending by a trillion dollars, so it\u2019s no wonder that more money was spent on lobbying in 2008 than in any previous year. And then even more was spent in 2009.\n\nWhen you lay out a picnic, you get ants. When you hand out more wealth through government, you get lobbyists. The federal budget is the biggest picnic in history.\n\nAs Craig Holman of the Ralph Nader\u2013founded Public Citizen told Marketplace radio after a report on rising lobbying expenditures during the financial crisis, \u201cthe amount spent on lobbying... is related entirely to how much the federal government intervenes in the private economy.\u201d Marketplace\u2019s Ronni Radbill noted then, \u201cIn other words, the more active the government, the more the private sector will spend to have its say... With the White House injecting billions of dollars into the economy [in early 2009], lobbyists say interest groups are paying a lot more attention to Washington than they have in a very long time.\u201d\n\nLobbying never stops. One week in December, the Kaiser Health News reported that \u201cgrowth opportunities from the federal government have increasingly come not from war but from healing.\u201d That is, \u201cbusiness purchases by the Department of Health and Human Services have doubled to $21 billion annually in the past decade.\u201d And who showed up to collect some of the largesse? Well, General Dynamics was having trouble making ends meet with defense contracting, so suddenly it managed to become the largest contractor to Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cFor traditional defense contractors,\u201d wrote Kaiser Health, \u201chealth care isn\u2019t the new oil. It\u2019s the new F-35 fighter.\u201d\n\nOf course, the old F-35, despite a decade or more of running behind schedule and over budget, is still doing pretty well. That same week Congress passed the $1.1 trillion \u201cCromnibus\u201d spending bill, including $479 million for four F-35 fighters from Lockheed that even the Pentagon didn\u2019t want. The Wall Street Journal reported that the bill \u201csparked a lobbying frenzy from individual companies, industries and other special interests\u201d\u2014pretty much the same language you could have read in earlier stories about Porkulus and Obamacare. Every provision in the bill\u2014from the $94 billion in Pentagon contracting to $120 million for the Chicago subway to an Obamacare exemption for Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2014has a lobbyist or several shepherding it through the secretive process.\n\nLiterally as I was writing these paragraphs, I got an email newsletter from \u201ca pioneering public relations firm that integrates sophisticated digital strategies with traditional communications tactics to advance our clients\u2019 public affairs or business agendas\u201d with advice on how to get a member of Congress to visit your business and get him \u201cto support the widget association\u2019s causes, such as asking the lawmaker to support a particular bill, write a letter to a regulatory agency, contact the president or some other ask.\u201d\n\nNot every business goes to Washington seeking a subsidy, of course. Some just seek to be left alone \u2014to be taxed or regulated or mandated less. Either way the lobbyists get paid.\n\nAs government expands, more people and businesses find themselves entangled with it.\n\nIn the past few years I\u2019ve had many occasions to write articles about Washington\u2019s parasite economy sucking in another company\u2014Microsoft, Google, Apple, and so on. It\u2019s always the same story. Entrepreneurs get rich the only way you can in a free market: by producing something other people want. A lot of brilliant people work long hours producing computer software\u2014or any other product\u2014that millions of people choose to use, in the midst of a highly competitive market that offers lots of other options.\n\nThen politicians notice the company\u2019s success\u2014and wealth\u2014and begin circling around it. Competitors try to win in Washington what they couldn\u2019t win in the marketplace. The lobbyists and congressional aides send messages through the media: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to play the D.C. game, that\u2019s clear, and they\u2019ve gotten away with it so far. The problem is, in the long run they won\u2019t be able to.\u201d (A congressional aide re: Microsoft, 1998)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Adapted from The Libertarian Mind: A Manifesto for Freedom", "title": "Washington's Parasite Economy", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/02/09/washingtons-parasite-economy", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14225074846636.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14225074846636.jpg", "description": "Adapted from <em>The Libertarian Mind: A Manifesto for Freedom</em>", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Washington's Parasite Economy"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-02-09T20:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/david-boaz"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "In the past few years I\u2019ve had many occasions to write articles about Washington\u2019s parasite economy sucking in another company\u2014Microsoft, Google, Apple, and so on.\nA rising tide of government spending may be bad for the American economy, but it\u2019s great for the Washington area.\nThat same week Congress passed the $1.1 trillion \u201cCromnibus\u201d spending bill, including $479 million for four F-35 fighters from Lockheed that even the Pentagon didn\u2019t want.\nWalk down K Street, the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying industry, and look at the directories in the office buildings.\n\u201cAs other American cities have been buffeted by an uneven economy, Washington\u2019s property market has been buoyed by two forces specific to the capital city: a surge of federal contractors and a rising tide of government spending."}
