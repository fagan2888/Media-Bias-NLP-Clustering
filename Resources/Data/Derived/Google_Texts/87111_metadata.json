The lawsuit, involving about 600 current and former UMC staffers, stems from allegations that staffers didn\u2019t get paid while working during lunch breaks. In her ruling, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Leen noted that she appointed a special master to investigate on UMC\u2019s compliance with the discovery process only as a \u201clast resort\u201d after months of hearings and efforts to get the hospital to meet its obligations to provide electronically stored information, or ESI.\n\n\u201cUMC is a public hospital. Public funds have been and continue to be expended on the defense of this case,\u201d Leen wrote in her late March ruling. \u201cUMC has paid in excess of $500,000 to the special master fund alone because of its failures to comply with its ESI discovery obligations. There is a strong presumption of public access to judicial files and records. I find the public has a right to know exactly why enormous sums have been spent at public expense.\u201d\n\nThe report of special master Daniel Garrie found that UMC officials repeatedly gave false or misleading statements during the process of providing documents and electronic data required to be turned over to plaintiffs in the case. He also found that the hospital lost or deleted electronic data likely relevant to the case, including text messages and other files.\n\nHis wide-ranging report came after months of work with UMC that focused on a variety of records, including electronic employee time-keeping systems.\n\nUMC attorneys pushed back, arguing the hospital already has turned in more than 60,000 pages of records and criticizing the special master\u2019s report as too opinionated. But they also have acknowledged shortcomings in open court, such as wiping several Blackberries clean of data when technicians who were unaware of the requirement installed new software. When the data was wiped clean, UMC already had been instructed to preserve evidence.\n\nA UMC spokeswoman declined comment, as it\u2019s pending litigation.\n\nIn addition to objecting to the report, UMC attorneys also argued unsuccessfully that exhibits filed with the report should be sealed because they include a \u201cwealth of information\u201d about UMC\u2019s information-technology systems and internal matters, including employee email addresses and job titles. UMC had sought an order seeking to seal records and transcripts filed with the report, though the hospital didn\u2019t seek to seal the underlying report.\n\nThe judge rejected those arguments, finding that the hospital attorneys didn\u2019t provide any specific facts to back up their argument for sealing the records.\n\nThe stakes are high in the case beyond the half-million-dollar expense of the special master. In a transcript of an Oct. 21 court hearing, Robert Freeman, an attorney for UMC, estimated the case as a \u201c$2 million endeavor\u201d so far. Freeman also noted that accepting the special master\u2019s report and recommendation at face value would be financially devastating for UMC.\n\nIn the hearing, Freeman said if the judge were to agree with the special master\u2019s report and rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it would be a \u201cnine-figure verdict.\u201d That\u2019s $100 million or more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the hospital surviving that,\u201d Freeman said in the time.\n\nAt the same hearing, Jon Tostrud, an attorney for the plaintiffs, criticized that comment, calling it a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people we represent are current employees of UMC,\u201d he said, according to the transcript. \u201cTheir paycheck is signed by UMC. They have no interest in seeing UMC become insolvent.\u201d\n\nLeen also wrote that the special master \u201cwas only appointed because the court had lost confidence in UMC\u2019s willingness or ability to comply with its discovery obligations with respect to electronically stored information.\u201d\n\nHer sternly worded order made it clear that the expense of a special master could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cBefore appointing the special master I gave UMC one final opportunity to comply with its ESI discovery obligations, warning UMC that if it did not I would appoint a special master at UMC\u2019s expense, which I stated on the record I believed would be a ridiculous expense for UMC to incur,\u201d Leen said, adding it was the first time she had appointed a special master in 14 years as a federal judge.\n\nContact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-405-9781.
