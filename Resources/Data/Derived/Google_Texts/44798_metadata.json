Our enrollment increased by almost 20 percent \u2013 among the best in the nation. We worked to develop and publicize broker events, but things didn\u2019t go perfectly. They didn\u2019t work the way we wanted them to. We will spend time to review and find ways to make the broker events better.\u2019\u2019\n\nGilbert doesn\u2019t expect wholesale changes in Affordable Care Act \u2013 despite \u201ca lot of quacking going on out there.\u2019\u2019\n\nSaid Gilbert: \u201cTo come up with a plan to replace this would take years to accomplish. A big part of the ACA was the expansion of Medicaid and over 30 states expanded Medicaid \u2013 many with Republican governors like we have in Nevada. You don\u2019t repeal and replace the ACA without having extensive problems.\u2019\u2019\n\nSome 20 million uninsured individuals have gained coverage in the U.S., under the law that began in 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of voters,\u2019\u2019 said Gilbert.\n\nGilbert also said the fact some providers have stopped paying commissions for sales by brokers was a concern and one the exchange expects to address. California has already promised brokers in that state that any provider on the exchange would be obligated to pay commissions for sales during special enrollment periods as well as open enrollment next year. Some, principally Anthem, have stopped paying commissions for sales outside of open enrollment. United Healthcare, in Nevada, has stopped paying commissions outside of open enrollment, as well, this year for policies on the exchange. It continues to pay commissions for policies off the exchange. Only Prominence has continued to pay the brokers commissions for sales on and off the exchange outside of open enrollment.\n\n\u201cThe argument for paying the brokers is that broker commissions were part of the initial cost when the providers set their rates,\u2019\u2019 said Gilbert.\n\nAffordable Healthcare Pros continue to enroll individuals for healthcare, both on and off the exchange.
