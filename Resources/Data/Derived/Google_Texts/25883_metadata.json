LAST YEAR: Played spur linebacker and finished sixth on the team in tackles, with 37 total stops, two sacks, and one fumble recovery.\n\nA rising junior who had played in every game the past two seasons, Diggs was in line to replace the graduated Sherrod Golightly as the starter at USC\u2019s spur linebacker position. But Hoke\u2019s arrival brought the installation of a 4-3 base defense, and a position shuffle among three players which involved Diggs switching from spur to safety.\n\nTo help college football fans get through the dog days of summer before the conference media days begin the preseason football frenzy later this month, The Post and Courier is counting down the 10 most important players for South Carolina and Clemson for 2015. We start with No. 10 and will continue the countdown each day through July 12, at which time we will feature the No. 1 player for each team.\n\nT.J. Gurley was moved to Diggs\u2019 former spur position, and Larenz Bryant \u2014 a backup spur last season \u2014 was getting looks at outside linebacker before his spring practice was cut short by a liver injury suffered in a collision with a teammate. Of all those moves, the most critical might involve Diggs, who brings a degree of veteran\u2019s savvy to an emerging secondary which will be without its leader from last season, departed senior Brison Williams.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Diggs said of the move in spring practice. \u201cYou see things from the back end, with a new set of eyes. I\u2019m used to being so close to the ball. It\u2019s been fun. I\u2019m having a lot of fun. I feel natural back there. It\u2019s a matter of just getting reps and getting more and more comfortable.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s linebacking corps found its footing last season when Skai Moore and Jonathan Walton were paired together late in the season. Gurley, second on the team in tackles last season, moves to a spur position which effectively becomes a nickel back under Hoke\u2019s system. Diggs will be called upon to bolster a secondary now without Williams, who played primarily safety against the spread-offense opponents USC faced with regularity last year.\n\nIt all brings more responsibility for Diggs, who finished last year as USC\u2019s sixth-leading tackler with 37 total stops. He added two sacks, and forced and recovered a fumble on what would have been a third-down conversion in USC territory during the overtime victory at Florida.\n\nDiggs finished last season at around 219 pounds, and was working on dropping weight since he felt he played better carrying less bulk. He was at 215 when he was moved to the safety position, and in spring ball was listed at 210. \u201cIt was easy for me to drop a few more and just go with the flow,\u201d he said then.\n\nDiggs\u2019 work in the spring earned him the most improved safety award from coaches. Replacing Williams won\u2019t be easy, but in a secondary which will feature three sophomores who\u2019ll see extensive playing time \u2014 corners Chris Lammons and Al Harris Jr., and safety D.J. Smith \u2014 a little experience could go a long way.\n\nUSC Top 10\n\nFriday: No. 10 WR Deebo Samuel\n\nSaturday: No. 9 LB Jordan Diggs\n\nSunday: No. 8", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USC Top 10: Position change brings more responsibility for Jordan Diggs, Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Gamecocks,SEC football", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 When Jon Hoke was hired as South Carolina\u2019s new co-defensive coordinator, few players were impacted more than Jordan Diggs.", "title": "USC Top 10: Position change brings more responsibility for Jordan Diggs", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150703/150709730/usc-top-10-position-change-brings-more-responsibility-for-jordan-diggs", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150703/PC20/150709730/AR/0/AR-150709730.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150703/PC20/150709730/AR/0/AR-150709730.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 When Jon Hoke was hired as South Carolina\u2019s new co-defensive coordinator, few players were impacted more than Jordan Diggs.", "title": "USC Top 10: Position change brings more responsibility for Jordan Diggs", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150703/PC20/150709730/AR/0/AR-150709730.jpg?201507031923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150709730}}, "keywords": "USC Top 10: Position change brings more responsibility for Jordan Diggs , Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Gamecocks,SEC football", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T17:03:04Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T19:23:00Z", "author": "David Caraviello"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 When Jon Hoke was hired as South Carolina\u2019s new co-defensive coordinator, few players were impacted more than Jordan Diggs."}, "article_summary": "He was at 215 when he was moved to the safety position, and in spring ball was listed at 210.\nJordan Diggs POSITION: Safety YEAR: Junior HEIGHT/WEIGHT: 6-0/210 HOMETOWN: Fort Myers, Fla.
