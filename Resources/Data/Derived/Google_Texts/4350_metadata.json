In one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the nine-member court will weigh whether for-profit corporations may raise religious objections to a mandate in President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law that their insurance cover contraceptives. It brings to the forefront thorny questions of religious freedom and reproductive rights, along with enduring politicking over the law known as Obamacare, itself broadly upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012.\n\nThe poll asked whether employers should be able to choose what forms of contraceptives their health plans provide based on their religious beliefs. Of those responding, 53 percent disagreed and 35 percent agreed. Of those surveyed, 12 percent said they did not know. The justices will sit at 10 a.m. ET on Monday for the final day of their nine-month annual term.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Hobby Lobby Founder: Company Built On Faith 1:38 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIn Depth\n\n- Reuters", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most Americans oppose allowing employers, based on religious views, exclude some forms of birth control from health insurnance coverage, a new poll says.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eve-ruling-americans-oppose-birth-control-ban-n143796", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "type": "article", "description": "Most Americans oppose allowing employers, based on religious views, exclude some forms of birth control from health insurnance coverage, a new poll says."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Most Americans oppose allowing employers, based on religious views, exclude some forms of birth control from health insurnance coverage, a new poll says.", "title": "On Eve of Ruling, Americans Oppose Birth Control Ban - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-29", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eve-ruling-americans-oppose-birth-control-ban-n143796", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health news,Health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96c7\"", "article_summary": "Play FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Hobby Lobby Founder: Company Built On Faith 1:38 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogIn Depth- Reuters\nA majority of Americans oppose letting employers, based on their religious views, exclude certain contraceptives from workers\u2019 insurance coverage, says a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll ahead of a U.S. Supreme Court decision expected on Monday.\nThe poll asked whether employers should be able to choose what forms of contraceptives their health plans provide based on their religious beliefs.\nIt brings to the forefront thorny questions of religious freedom and reproductive rights, along with enduring politicking over the law known as Obamacare, itself broadly upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012.\nET on Monday for the final day of their nine-month annual term."}
