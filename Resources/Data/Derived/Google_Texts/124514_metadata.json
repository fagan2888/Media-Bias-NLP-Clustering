Ernecoff, clinical research, Investigation and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\nBut in an accompanying opinion piece about the study's findings, lead commentator Tracy A. Balboni, M.D., of the Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who was not involved in the study, questioned the definitions researchers used to denote a religious or spiritual theme.\n\n\"Understanding the definition is critical to interpreting these frequencies and placing them in proper context, particularly because the de facto definition may leave spiritual concepts unidentified,\" they write.\n\nAlthough clinicians may be reluctant to discuss religious and spiritual beliefs with their patients, three recent studies shed light on how faith can impact cancer patients' mental, social and physical well-being, FierceHealthcare reported in August. The studies indicate there is a significant link between religion, spirituality and patient outcomes but variability on how they relate to the different aspects of health.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- read the commentary on the study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow spirituality and religion impact patient outcomes\n\nEnd-of-life care, planning fails patients\n\nDying in America: Healthcare leaders must bolster end-of-life care discussions, efforts\n\n5 important end-of-life topics to discuss with seriously ill patients\n\nHospitals make varied progress on end-of-life care", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although many patients and their families view\u00a0religion or spirituality\u00a0as important near the\u00a0end of life, few surrogate decision-makers and healthcare professionals discuss these considerations during family meetings in intensive care units, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although many patients and their families view\u00a0religion or spirituality\u00a0as important near the\u00a0end of life, few surrogate decision-makers and healthcare professionals discuss these considerations during family meetings in intensive care units, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine.", "title": "Healthcare professionals rarely discuss religion, spirituality in ICU", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/healthcare-professionals-rarely-discuss-religion-spirituality-icu/2015-09-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,end of life; intensive care unit,JAMA Internal Medicine,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Religion And Spirituality", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4104\"", "article_summary": "The studies indicate there is a significant link between religion, spirituality and patient outcomes but variability on how they relate to the different aspects of health.\nAlthough many patients and their families view religion or spirituality as important near the end of life, few surrogate decision-makers and healthcare professionals discuss these considerations during family meetings in intensive care units, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nTo assess how often these conversations take place, researchers analyzed audio-record conversations between 651 surrogate decision-makers who had \"a relatively high degree of religiosity\" and 441 healthcare professionals in 13 intensive care units across the country.\nTo learn more:- read the study abstract- read the commentary on the studyRelated Articles:How spirituality and religion impact patient outcomesEnd-of-life care, planning fails patientsDying in America: Healthcare leaders must bolster end-of-life care discussions, efforts5 important end-of-life topics to discuss with seriously ill patientsHospitals make varied progress on end-of-life care\nAlthough clinicians may be reluctant to discuss religious and spiritual beliefs with their patients, three recent studies shed light on how faith can impact cancer patients' mental, social and physical well-being, FierceHealthcare reported in August."}
