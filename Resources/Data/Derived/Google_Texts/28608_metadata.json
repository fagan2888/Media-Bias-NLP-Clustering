(Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)Buy Photo\n\nIf there's a bright side to President Barack Obama's tenure, according to conservative author and pundit Charles Krauthammer, it's the national debate that his policies have started.\n\nAnd the central question that must be asked of all Americans, across the political spectrum, is this: What's the proper size and scope of a democratic government?\n\nAt stake, after all, is the very nature of the social contract between citizen and state.\n\n\"Obama has done more to damage the Democratic Party than anyone in 50 years,\" Krauthammer said, on domestic as well as foreign affairs.\n\nJust look at the results of the last election. The president had not been on the ballot, but his policies certainly were. And despite the best efforts of Democrats to distance themselves from the White House, the American electorate resoundingly disapproved (Californians being the exception).\n\nKrauthammer spoke Wednesday night at the H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation's Desert Town Hall series at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort & Spa.\n\nHis speech was an hour-long reflection on American politics, complete with wry jokes about Downton Abbey, lactation services funded by Obamacare, and the size of Winston Churchill's \u2014 let's just say \u2014 appendage.\n\nThe man casts a wide net \u2014 which, for anyone who follows his work, should come as no surprise.\n\nIn his early years, Krauthammer was a New Deal-type Democrat who wrote speeches for then-Vice President Walter Mondale. In the mid-1980s, though, after becoming disillusioned with the flock, he joined the opposition and even went on to coin the term \"Reagan Doctrine.\"\n\nIn 1987, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his commentary in the Washington Post, where he still writes. No doubt the crowd in Indian Wells knows him better for his nightly appearances on Fox News.\n\nYou wouldn't have known it Wednesday by listening to his comments about the entitlement state, but Krauthammer has retained certain liberal sympathies over the years. He supports abortion and embryonic stem cell research and higher energy taxes. He opposes capital punishment and believes the debate over evolution is a waste of time.\n\nHe began his professional life as a psychiatrist, but has focused his attention from the beginning on politics, \"the crooked timber of our communal lives,\" he once wrote, upon which all fires burn. Everything else is melted to it \u2014 art, science, poetry, sports, whatever. All the things that matter.\n\nBut it could also be argued that the politicization of everything in our lives \u2014 in other words, the culture war \u2014 is part of the problem.\n\nMaybe so, Krauthammer told The Desert Sun in a separate interview, but the purpose of his work has been to show how politics precipitates the sublime. He went on to quote John Adams, who said, more or less, that his own generation needed to get the politics right before the next could become architects and artists.\n\n\"If you don't,\" Krauthammer said, \"you can ruin everything, even the beautiful non-political things.\"\n\nConsider North and South Korea. Same people, language, same history. But while one encourages enterprise, the other knows only decimation.\n\nThere is, however, an irony in this example. Low voter turnout, which is an increasing problem in the United States, is actually a sign of stability in a democracy.\n\n\"If you live in a society where your life, your livelihood, and everything hangs on politics \u2014 say, totalitarian societies \u2014 you fear that if the wrong people get in office then you're done for.\"\n\nWednesday's was the fourth and last of this year's speaker series appearances, which included science educator Neil deGrasse Tyson, photographer Platon, and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2014 whom Krauthammer felt the urge to address.\n\nAt the end of the day, Krauthammer believes that America, at its core, is a center-right nation and that Obama was merely a meteor, a fluke, a European-type social Democrat who wowed his way into office on the strength of his personality.\n\nKrauthammer went on to explain that Obama's weakest point in the 2012 election was his signature health care plan. And what did Republicans do? They nominated Romney, the man who invented Obamacare.\n\n\"I grossly underestimated the Republican genius for losing unlosable elections,\" Krauthammer said \u2014 a comment that drew hearty laughs.\n\nAll night, he held nothing back. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ruined his presidential chances in 2012 by practically giving Obama a lap dance in public. Another Clinton/Bush presidential election is \"an act of cruelty to the children of the future.\"\n\nIn fact, the teens who turned up for a pre-lecture Q&A were treated to some of his best lines, regardless of partisanship. He told one student that there's only one way to make sure you're not contradicting yourself in this life:\n\n\"Say what you believe and you will not only be consistent,\" he offered. \"You will be doing the country a true service.\"\n\nJesse Marx is the Desert Sun political reporter.
