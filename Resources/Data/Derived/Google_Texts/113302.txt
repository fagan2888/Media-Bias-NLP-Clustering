A family of four escaped a fire early this morning in south Wichita.

It happened in the Riverside Mobile Home Park in the 4500 block of South Hydraulic around 5 a.m.

When crews arrived, they found a mobile home and cars in flames.

Four people were inside the home but were able to get out safely.

"Fortunately they go alerted from the horn honking outside and they were able to make their escape through the back door," said Battalion Chief John Turner Wichita Fire. "The occupant did report that they had heavy fire in the front door, so they weren't able to make it out to the front. Fortunately they had a secondary escape and were able to make out with the children."

The Red Cross is assisting the family. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
