The analysis identified hospitals with comparatively lowest risk- standardized 30-day mortality rates, lowest 30-day readmissions, lowest complications rates in medical and surgical care, lowest in-hospital medical and surgical infections, highest medical and surgical processes of care measures for AMI, HF, PN, and SCIP, and highest patient satisfaction scores.\n\nOnly the 100 hospitals between 100-400 beds with the highest scores made the 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae list. If all U.S. hospitals attained the 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae level, there would be improvement in the more than 400,000 preventable patient deaths and millions of preventable complications that occur each year, according to The SafeCare Group.\n\n\u201cMuch too often, hospital reputation and performance on quality measures are divergent. We believe that a listing of outstanding hospitals in the areas of the Affordable Care Act would promote strong incentives to improve care, treatments, and services,\u201d says Dr. Yisrael Safeek, MD, MBA, Founder and Chairman of The SafeCare Group\u00ae.\n\nAbout Parrish Medical Center\n\nParrish Medical Center (PMC), located at 951 N.
