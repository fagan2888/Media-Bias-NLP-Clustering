After years of embracing Muslim immigrants, Islam has quite literally taken parts of the nation over, and the Swedish government has ceded control to Muslims in some 50 areas of the country. Sweden learned too late that Islam never enters a country to assimilate. It comes to dominate.\n\nIn our country, if we drift further away from Christianity, if we continue to believe that all religions are the same, if we continue to look to the state to solve our problems, there will be an enormous void to fill. And Islam will be quite happy to fill it. Islam has proved it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.\n\nThis is Brian Myers of Caffeinated Thoughts Radio with your Caffeinated Thought of the Day.\n\nRemember you can listen to Caffeinated Thoughts Radio on air at 8:00a and 6:00p on Saturdays on The Truth Network 99.3 FM if you live in the Des Moines/Ames Metro area. You can also listen online live here. Also we are on iTunes!", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/11/caffeinated-thought-day-islam-west/", "article_author_name": "Brian Myers", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1200px-Katarina_kyrka__Stockholms_mosk\u00e9-1024x768.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-11-28T09:00:37+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "christianity, culture, europe, islam, islamic conquest, sharia law, sweden, western culture, caffeinated thoughts radio, cultural issues", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Brian Myers: Islam has proved in Sweden and elsewhere that it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Brian Myers: Islam has proved in Sweden and elsewhere that it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.", "title": "Caffeinated Thought of the Day: Islam and the West | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1200px-Katarina_kyrka__Stockholms_mosk\u00e9-1024x768.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-26T18:55:10-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/11/caffeinated-thought-day-islam-west/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brian Myers: Islam has proved in Sweden and elsewhere that it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.", "creator": "@CaffThoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1200px-Katarina_kyrka__Stockholms_mosk\u00e9.jpg", "title": "Caffeinated Thought of the Day: Islam and the West | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-11-28T03:00:37-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/brian.myers.50", "section": "Caffeinated Thoughts Radio", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T18:55:10-05:00", "tag": "Western Culture"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01ef\"", "article_summary": "This is Brian Myers of Caffeinated Thoughts Radio with your Caffeinated Thought of the Day.\nRemember you can listen to Caffeinated Thoughts Radio on air at 8:00a and 6:00p on Saturdays on The Truth Network 99.3 FM if you live in the Des Moines/Ames Metro area.\nSweden learned too late that Islam never enters a country to assimilate.\nIslam has proved it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.\nAfter years of embracing Muslim immigrants, Islam has quite literally taken parts of the nation over, and the Swedish government has ceded control to Muslims in some 50 areas of the country."}
