Bill O\u2019Reilly thinks it could.\n\nThe Fox News host blasted President Barack Obama\u2019s mock interview recorded two weeks ago with comedian Zach Galifianakis to help promote enrollment by young Americans in health insurance plans mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe interview was a farce, and some believe demeaning,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said on his \u201cTalking Points\u201d program.\n\nBut it also has apparently been effective. A government health care spokeswoman said Tuesday afternoon that 19,000 viewers of the Galifianakis video had clicked through to visit Healthcare.gov.\n\nAlthough O\u2019Reilly noted that the interview, which was posted Tuesday on FunnyOrDie.com, had been recorded before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Crimea, he suggested that Obama\u2019s participation \u201craises some questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a problem with it in general, but I think the timing hurts Mr. Obama,\u201d said O\u2019Reilly, playing the concern troll. \u201cThe economy continues to be problematic, and Putin is clearly testing the president. It looks like Putin believes the president is a lightweight; will a comedy video counter that? Just asking.\u201d\n\nHe thought the video also sent the wrong message to his domestic political enemies, as well.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is dubious, to say the least, and using a comedic website to enroll people is a little bit desperate, don\u2019t you think?\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m all for PR, and if [White House Spokesman Jay] Carney wanted to go on Funny or Die, fine. But the president of the United States? All I can tell you is, Abe Lincoln would not have done it.\u201d\n\nHe urged the president to behave seriously at all times or risk national security.\n\n\u201cWe are a divided nation which \u2018Talking Points\u2019 believes is in decline,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cMr. Obama is quick, has a good sense of humor, and those are assets. But he needs to be aware \u2013 he needs to be aware \u2013 of how his enemies perceive him because I believe the testing of America is just getting started.\u201d\n\nWatch this video clip posted online by NewsAlert31:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/OReilly-rips-Obama-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly rips Obama: Abe Lincoln would never do a \u2018Funny or Die\u2019 video"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5aa9\"", "article_summary": "Could the president sitting down to record a comedy website video harm national security?\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m all for PR, and if [White House Spokesman Jay] Carney wanted to go on Funny or Die, fine.\nA government health care spokeswoman said Tuesday afternoon that 19,000 viewers of the Galifianakis video had clicked through to visit Healthcare.gov.\nIt looks like Putin believes the president is a lightweight; will a comedy video counter that?\nAll I can tell you is, Abe Lincoln would not have done it.\u201dHe urged the president to behave seriously at all times or risk national security."}
