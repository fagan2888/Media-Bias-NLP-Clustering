They ruled that the owners of Hobby Lobby do not have to provide contraceptive coverage for their employees on the grounds that it violates their religious beliefs.\n\nThis ruling allows certain for-profit companies to impose their religious beliefs on their employees. This ruling not only violates women \u2014 it violates families. Having children you cannot afford affects everyone in your family. I see this as another political plot to pick apart benefits under the Affordable Care Act and it opens the door for other companies to follow suit.\n\nI read recently that 1 in 6 people already suffer from hunger. Due to the Supreme Court ruling, how many more children will be born to the 123,000 employees of Hobby Lobby and how many of those will go hungry? Do we really think these employees can afford to pay extra for contraceptives when so many of young families struggle to provide food and shelter for their families?\n\nI don\u2019t know what God the Greens worship but mine says that we are supposed to feed the hungry and care for the sick and elderly. Is Hobby Lobby going to dip into their billions of dollars in profit to help take care of these families?\n\nWhat next? Will gays and lesbians be denied employment or treatment of HIV or AIDS because it violates someone\u2019s religious beliefs?\n\nThese Supreme Court justices no longer rule for the good of the people or upholds the Constitution. They represent big business.\n\nLadies, it is time to fight back and put an end to our rights being taken away. We can win this war without firing a shot. We win it at the ballot box. If candidates don\u2019t support our rights and the rights of the others, we don\u2019t vote for them.\n\nQuite frankly, I will no longer do business with Hobby Lobby. I hope you will join me in this fight. We need to stand up for ourselves.\n\nFor more Kalamazoo Gazette opinion pieces and letters, visit http://www.mlive.com/opinion/kalamazoo/.
