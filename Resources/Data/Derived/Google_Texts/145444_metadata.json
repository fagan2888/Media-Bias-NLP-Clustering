Something about a \u201cCuban embassy\u201d formally \u201copening?\u201d in \u201cWashington, D.C. ?\u201d If I read these things correctly?\n\nNonetheless, the people actually in-the-know about these matters are cutting to the heart of the issue:\n\n\u201cAll Cuban personnel now working in the [U.S] Interests Section [in Havana] work for Cuban State Security,\u201d said high-ranking Cuban intelligence defector Pedro Riera Escalante. \u201cAll housing for [U.S.] officials may have microphones and other devices installed.\u201d\n\n\"Virtually every member of Cuba's U.N mission is an intelligence agent,\" revealed Alcibiades Hidalgo, who defected to the U.S. in 2002 after serving as Raul Castro's Chief of Staff and himself as Cuba's ambassador to the U.N.\n\nSo you can just imagine what\u2019s going on in Cuban Intelligence\u2019s plush new Washington D.C. station, speaking of which:\n\n\u201cIt (the Cuban embassy opening) is going to be a celebration on our part,\u201d gushed Gustavo Machin, deputy director for U.S. affairs at Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry. \u201cMany Americans who have supported the Cuban Revolution will be among the 500 celebrants at the new Embassy.\u201d\n\nDespite the innocuous professional title the mainstream media insists on using for Gustavo Machin, he\u2019s actually a KGB-trained Cuban spy who was burnt and booted from the U.S. back in 2003 shortly before the invasion of Iraq. He was among 14 other Cuban spies suspected of trafficking in U.S. military secrets (more on this shortly.)\n\nThe currently elated Machin was an accomplice of Castro\u2019s master-spy Ana Belen Montes, who today serves a 25 year prison sentence after conviction in 2002 for the deepest and most damaging penetration of the U.S. Defense Department in modern history. Machin was neck deep in the same spying as his accomplice Montes, but enjoyed \u201cdiplomatic immunity,\u201d which saved him from prison or the electric chair.\n\nNow he\u2019ll probably be visiting Washington D.C. often \u201con business.\u201d In fact it was Machin who conducted the recent \u201cnegotiations\u201d with Obama\u2019s team of crackerjack \u201cnegotiators\u201d which led to this \u201cdiplomatic breakthrough\u201d with Cuba. So who can blame him for celebrating?\n\n\u201cFrom Machin\u2019s perspective, it would certainly be a Cuban spy-handler\u2019s dream,\u201d says retired Lieut. Col. Chris Simmons, who helped nab both Montes and Machin along with 14 other Cuban spies and is widely hailed as America\u2019s top Cuba spycatcher. \u201cHundreds of media, politicians, academics and Castro apologists all in one place at the same time. The DI (Cuba\u2019s Directorio de Intelligencia) staff embedded within the Interests Section/Embassy will certainly be working overtime \u2013 I expect they also brought in temporary help within the \u201c30-member delegation of diplomatic, cultural and other leaders\u201d that arrived for the Embassy opening.\u201d\n\nIn brief: they don\u2019t come much more knowledgeable about Cuban spying than retired Lieut. Col. Chris Simmons.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the big deal, Humberto?\u201d some snort. \u201cI mean, come on! Cuba\u2019s a tiny impoverished island! So you think they\u2019re planning to invade us or something? I mean, get real!\u201d Here\u2019s a common reaction among people pathetically ignorant of Castroism (which is to say, most people.) Indeed, on his Fox Business show John Stossell \u201crebutted\u201d me in almost those exact words. You see, The Godfather II didn\u2019t mention Castroite spying. So this ignorance is quite understandable.\n\nOf course Cuba doesn\u2019t plan \u201cto invade the U.S.,\u201d for crying out loud--or probably even to mount terrorist attacks--directly that is. The aforementioned Cuban spy Ana Belen Montes, for instance, was arrested on September 21st 2001. That\u2019s exactly ten days after Al Qaeda demolished the Twin Towers. By then she had been uncovered for a while but, as is customary in such cases, was being monitored to see if her activities would reveal others within her spy network. That monitoring was scheduled to continue for much longer, but her access to U.S. intelligence secrets unrelated to Cuba (mid-east, for instance) demanded she be shut down\u2014and quickly.\n\nInterestingly, just days after the 9-11 terror attack, Castro\u2019s KGB-founded and mentored intelligence mounted a major deception operation attempting to trip-up our investigation into the terrorist culprits, not that most of you ever heard about it from the mainstream media. So here:\n\n\u201cIn the six months after the 9/11 attacks,\u201d ran the Miami Herald investigative report, \u201cup to 20 Cubans walked into U.S. embassies around the world and offered information on terrorism threats. Eventually, all were deemed to be Cuban intelligence agents and collaborators, purveying fabricated information. Two Cuba experts said spies sent by Cuba to the United States were part of a permanent intelligence program to mislead, misinform and identify U.S. spies.\u201d\n\n\"Cuba is intelligence trafficker to the world,\" stresses Chris Simmons. Among many others, the U.S. military secrets stolen by Castro\u2019s spies have been sold to former regimes in Iraq, Panama and Grenada, alerting these dictatorships to U.S. military plans against them and costing untold American lives.\u201d\n\n\"We are going to have diplomatic relations with the United States without having ceded one iota,\" guffawed yet another convicted Cuban spy this week.\n\nThis KGB-trained Cuban spy is also safely and comfortably back in Havana. But Gerardo Hernandez (this Cuban spy\u2019s name) didn\u2019t enjoy diplomatic immunity. Instead, back in 2001 he was convicted by a U.S. jury of espionage along with conspiracy to murder three U.S. citizens and sentenced to two life terms.\n\nBut Hernandez\u2019 KGB-trained colleague Gustavo Machin made Hernandez\u2019 unconditional release (along with that of three of his convicted Cuban spy-colleagues) part of the price Obama had to pay for the privilege of letting Cuba set up an elaborate spy center in Washington D.C. this week.\n\nNo, amigos, the producers and writers of The Pink Panther and Austin Powers brainstorming together could not possibly make this stuff up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Granted, Obama administration spokespersons and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) describe this weeks event differently than does this column title.
