Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\u2022 Closing loopholes on guns.\n\nPresident Obama, bypassing Congress, will announce limited executive actions today intended to tighten federal enforcement of the nation\u2019s gun laws and to expand background checks.\n\nThe changes are particularly meant for online gun merchants, who often avoid conducting background checks despite making high-volume gun sales.\n\n\u2022 Where insurance falls short.\n\nA detailed study out today shows that about 20 percent of Americans under the age of 65 and with health insurance say they have problems paying their medical bills.\n\nThe data reflects the high costs of health care in the U.S., the most expensive place in the world for medical services. Even under the Affordable Care Act, health plans often require hundreds or thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket payments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The new Mideast crisis.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders were hoping to emerge from nuclear talks as a global player, but they again face isolation today after being blamed for allowing last weekend\u2019s attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran.\n\nIn Washington, the administration has an increasingly tense relationship with Saudi Arabia, and it will not publicly condemn the execution of a dissident Shiite cleric who challenged the royal family. The killing by the Sunni-governed country is what enraged Iran, a Shiite power.\n\n\u2022 Iowa forecast: Blizzard of ads.\n\nDonald J. Trump\u2019s first TV ad, set to begin airing today, focuses on themes like banning Muslim immigration. His opponents have their attack ads ready, too, for the sprint to the Iowa caucuses next month.\n\nBernie Sanders takes on Wall Street and big banks in what he\u2019s calling a major policy address today in New York on financial overhauls.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a look at questions that could shape the 2016 race.\n\n\u2022 On Capitol Hill.\n\nThe House opens 2016 with plans to send a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to President Obama\u2019s desk, even if it is unlikely to override his veto.\n\nCongressional Republicans will also try, once again, to ban federal funds for Planned Parenthood with a vote this week.\n\n\u2022 No rush on armed protest in Oregon.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are taking a low-key approach toward the armed group that has taken over a federal wildlife sanctuary in Oregon.\n\nThe government is wary of repeating confrontations that turned violent. No one has been hurt in the standoff, and no one is being held hostage. On social media, some are asking: What if the armed men were Muslim or black?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBUSINESS\n\n\u2022 Global indexes are calmer today after Monday\u2019s rout. Wall Street stocks are higher.\n\nAnd the price of crude oil is stabilizing, with slight gains, after a volatile Monday.\n\n\u2022 Connected cars, virtual reality gadgets and even higher definition TVs are expected to headline at the International CES show in Las Vegas this week.\n\n\u2022 Manhattan apartment prices hit record highs again last year, according to new reports today.\n\nThe average price, bolstered by sales of ultraluxury units, was just short of $2 million, but the median price was also a new high, $1.15 million.\n\n\u2022 General Motors\u2019s board unanimously gave Mary Barra, its chief executive, the additional job of chairwoman after she successfully pulled the company through a damaging recall over ignition switches.\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\n\u2022 Update your periodic tables.\n\nScientists in Japan will soon add to chemistry\u2019s most fundamental catalog. They\u2019ll get to officially name Element 113.\n\nElements 115, 117 and 118 will also receive official names. Teams from Russia and the U.S. discovered those elements.\n\nWhat would you name them? Our science editors are taking your emailed suggestions. Elements can be named after a mythological concept, a mineral, a place or country, a property or a scientist.\n\n\u2022 Raises in the minimum wage.\n\nCalifornia and Massachusetts move to $10 an hour from $9, the highest rate among the 14 states and several cities that increased the minimum wage at the start of 2016. The federal minimum is $7.25.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Jan. 5, 1914, Henry Ford, head of the Ford Motor Company, introduced a minimum wage scale of $5 per day.\n\n\u2022 Fresh read.\n\nIn \u201cThe Past,\u201d a novel released today in the U.S. by Tessa Hadley, three sisters, a brother and their children gather at the English country house where their mother grew up to decide whether they should keep it.\n\n\u2022 Primetime spotlight.\n\nThe two-hour documentary \u201cNetanyahu at War\u201d follows the Israeli prime minister\u2019s political career and chronicles his relationship with the U.S. (9 p.m., Eastern, PBS, but check local listings; streaming at pbs.org/frontline).\n\n\u2022 Coaching carousel.\n\nZinedine Zidane, the French former superstar of soccer, was named Real Madrid\u2019s coach, and Tom Coughlin stepped down after 12 years of coaching the New York Giants.\n\n\u2022 Fashion\u2019s power couple.\n\nTory Burch, chairman and chief executive of the Tory Burch fashion brand, which was valued early last year at $3.25 billion, and Pierre-Yves Roussel, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, are engaged, unofficially uniting two major fashion empires.\n\nBACK STORY\n\nHe came from a lower-middle-class family in Freehold, N.J., and played in Jersey Shore bands before becoming the local kid who made good.\n\nOn this day in 1973, at the age of 23, Bruce Springsteen released his debut solo album: \u201cGreetings From Asbury Park, N.J.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt sold only about 25,000 copies in its first year, and The Times didn\u2019t even bother reviewing it.\n\nBut Rolling Stone did write, months after the album\u2019s release, about the lyrics: \u201cHot damn, what a passel o\u2019 verbiage! He\u2019s got more of them crammed into this album than any other record released this year, but it\u2019s all right because they all fit snug. \u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe magazine proclaimed him \u201ca bold new talent.\u201d The album wasn\u2019t completely a solo effort, though. You can hear many of the musicians, including the saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who would go on to join him in the E Street Band.\n\nThat first Springsteen record, and the 17 studio albums that followed, often refer to his home state, where he is revered.\n\nE Street itself comes from a Belmar, N.J., address that was home to a band member\u2019s mother. The guys sometimes practiced there before taking the name to global fame.\n\nVictoria Shannon contributed reporting.\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated on the web all morning.\n\nWhat would you like to see here?
