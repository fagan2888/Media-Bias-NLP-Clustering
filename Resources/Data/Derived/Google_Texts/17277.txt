Sen. Ted Cruz is leading the GOP field in recent Iowa presidential polls. Cruz brands himself as a courageous conservative. Is he?

Ted Cruz claims that states have the constitutional authority to legalize marijuana. Really? Where in the Constitution resides the authority to ignore the Controlled Substance Act? How is allowing the states to set up fifty regulatory bodies consistent with the conservative principle of smaller government?

Ted Cruz can profit politically from his states’ rights argument because it allows him to personally oppose marijuana legalization, all the while pandering to libertarians and Big Marijuana. Is that courageous?

State-run medical marijuana programs can be expensive. After a $2.8 million start-up cost, Minnesota taxpayers are spending close to $1,000 per patient per year to regulate and dispense a marijuana extract with an unknown safety profile.

As legalization and use of marijuana has increased, the risk perception by adolescents has decreased and the number of children treated for accidental ingestion has increased. If you’re concerned about our fellow citizens’ health and safety, why aren't you supporting Rick Santorum for president? With respect to marijuana legalization, Santorum echos the words of Abraham Lincoln, “the states do not have the right to do wrong.”
