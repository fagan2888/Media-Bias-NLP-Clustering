The biggest of those competitors in the Conejo Valley is UCLA Health System, which has opened offices in Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks over the past two years.\n\nUCLA, Kaiser Permanente and other large organizations have the advantage of economies of scale in billing and other administrative functions, and they have more power than small medical groups or solo practitioners when negotiating with insurance companies. They also benefit from certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. UCLA is a particularly formidable competitor because of the strength of its medical brand.\n\n\u201cOnce ULCA moved in, we knew we needed to do something to really unify ourselves,\u201d said Dr. Susan Mayo, a physician with Arroyo Oaks Medical Group in Thousand Oaks and one of the seven board members and co-founders of Choice Health. \u201cWe recognized our need to have a better voice, to really market the physicians in private practice better, because we don\u2019t have that visibility that you have with a large organization.\u201d\n\nChoice Health is, essentially, a marketing cooperative. Its doctors pool some of their money for advertising, but they remain autonomous in their medical and business practices.\n\nMayo said the 100 or so members each pay $1,000 a year to belong. That pays for a website to help patients find a doctor in the group, and a marketing campaign that launched recently with a spate of print advertisements.\n\n\u201cAlready, just from running one ad, we\u2019ve got a lot of calls to my office,\u201d Mayo said.\n\nDoctors in Choice Health also work together to refer patients to each other. The competition from UCLA and other big organizations has pushed them to offer same-day appointments through a single phone number, just as the large networks do.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that UCLA hires a lot of different physicians, and they have better availability because these physicians are coming in with no patient load,\u201d said Dr. Gilbert Simoni, a gastroenterologist in Thousand Oaks and another Choice Health co-founder and board member. \u201cIf my next appointment is in a week or two and they can provide a same-day appointment, the patient is going to choose the same-day appointment. We\u2019ve smartened up and caught onto that, and now we have a call schedule so we can provide same-day appointments every day.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually not difficult to compete with a large health-care network on price, Mayo said. The big providers can use their leverage to get more out of insurance companies for a procedure, but that raises the price for the patient, if the patient\u2019s copay is set at a certain percentage of the cost of a procedure.\n\nJohnna Hensley of Agoura Hills was a UCLA patient for a while and found the experience frustrating. \u201cThe doctors themselves were great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the rest of the whole UCLA experience. The customer service was not good. \u2026 I had prescriptions to transfer over, and they just wouldn\u2019t do it. I called for weeks and I couldn\u2019t get anyone to call me back.\u201d\n\nDr. Matteo Dinolfo, the medical director for the UCLA Department of Medicine\u2019s community offices, wouldn\u2019t talk specifically about the competition from Choice Health. But he said the new offices in the Conejo Valley have been very successful, as have new offices in Porter Ranch and Santa Clarita. UCLA plans to open in Calabasas later this year.\n\nHensley also wasn\u2019t happy with how often she was sent to another doctor when hers was unavailable, and she said she paid far less out of pocket when she was with a doctor in a small private practice. She and her husband are now back with a small practice.\n\n\u201cPatients choose where to go based on where they think they\u2019re going to get the best care, and we\u2019ve made it fairly simple for them because we work with local hospitals,\u201d Dinolfo said. \u201cThey have UCLA-quality care in a local environment, and I think patients like that.\u201d\n\nConsolidation is everywhere in the industry, and UCLA is just one threat to small practices. Simoni said he\u2019s been in touch with doctors who have started associations similar to Choice Health in the Midwest and on the East Coast.\n\n\u201cMy vision is that at some point they\u2019re going to come together, and we will try to create a national organization,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "conejo valley,thousand oaks,westlake village,health care,doctors,ucla health,choice health associates,pacific coast business times,ucla,east ventura county,top stories,tri-county economy", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "Choice Health Associates is a loose affiliation of physicians in private practice who have teamed up to better compete with big out-of-town providers.", "title": "A prescription for team work: Conejo doctors band together against UCLA incursion", "url": "http://www.pacbiztimes.com/2014/03/21/a-prescription-for-team-work-conejo-doctors-band-together-against-ucla-incursion/", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/www.pacbiztimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/choicehealthWEB.jpg?fit=580%2C384", "height": 384}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.pacbiztimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/choicehealthWEB.jpg?fit=580%2C384&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Choice Health Associates is a loose affiliation of physicians in private practice who have teamed up to better compete with big out-of-town providers.", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T07:00:19-06:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T00:38:03-06:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d29\"", "article_summary": "Simoni said he\u2019s been in touch with doctors who have started associations similar to Choice Health in the Midwest and on the East Coast.\nJohnna Hensley of Agoura Hills was a UCLA patient for a while and found the experience frustrating.\nDoctors in Choice Health also work together to refer patients to each other.\nThe biggest of those competitors in the Conejo Valley is UCLA Health System, which has opened offices in Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks over the past two years.\nThey\u2019re members of Choice Health Associates, a loose affiliation of physicians in private practice who have teamed up to better compete with big out-of-town providers."}
