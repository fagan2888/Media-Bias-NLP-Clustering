But, with great power comes great responsibility. It is inherent to who his character is. But we want to reveal it in different ways and spend much more time focusing on this young high school kid in the MCU dealing with his powers,\" Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said during an interview with Craveonline.\n\nThen there were rumors that the webbed hero would be fighting Captain America. When the two teams were announced, Peter Parker's alter-ego was nowhere to be found.\n\nNow another piece of information has landed - how long has Spider-Man been a hero when he makes his first appearance in the Marvel cinematic universe?\n\nAccording to Heroic Hollywood, it has been \"for a little over a year.\" Moreover he is apparently being treated as an urban legend in this universe which should make for an interesting plot development.\n\nThere have been many rumors that Spider-Man initially joins Iron Man before switching his allegiance to Captain America.\n\nTom Holland will be taking on the role for the very first time and will get his own stand alone picture in 2017. Holland's other projects include \"Locke,\" \"The Impossible,\" \"How I Live Now,\" \"Pilgrimage,\" \"The Lost City of Z\" and \"Backcountry.\"\n\n\"Captain America: Civil War\" hits theaters on May 6, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "There has been a lot of discussion over the library of characters in the hotly anticipated \"Captain America: Civil War.\" However, one character that continually avoids the spotlight is the one everyone wants to know about.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "There has been a lot of discussion over the library of characters in the hotly anticipated \"Captain America: Civil War.\" However, one character that continually avoids the spotlight is the one everyone wants to know about.", "title": "Captain America 3: Civil War Spoilers: Spider-Man A Hero For One Year in Film [Rumor]", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80396/20150919/captain-america-3-civil-war-spoilers-spider-man-hero-one.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/39030/the-amazing-spider-man-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "There has been a lot of discussion over the library of characters in the hotly anticipated \"Captain America: Civil War.\" However, one character that continually avoids the spotlight is the one everyone wants to know about.", "title": "Captain America 3: Civil War Spoilers: Spider-Man A Hero For One Year in Film [Rumor]", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80396/20150919/captain-america-3-civil-war-spoilers-spider-man-hero-one.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/39030/the-amazing-spider-man-2.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80396/20150919/captain-america-3-civil-war-spoilers-spider-man-hero-one.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19"}, "news_keywords": "captain, america, 3, civil, war, spoilers, spider, man, a, hero, for, one, year, in, film, rumor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf59\"", "article_summary": "There has been a lot of discussion over the library of characters in the hotly anticipated \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\"Captain America: Civil War\" hits theaters on May 6, 2016.\nThere have been many rumors that Spider-Man initially joins Iron Man before switching his allegiance to Captain America.\nThen there were rumors that the webbed hero would be fighting Captain America.\nEver since Spider-Man was announced in the new film, everyone has wanted to know how Marvel would resurrect the character after five movies, including a reboot."}
