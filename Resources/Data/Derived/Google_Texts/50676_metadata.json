Like an insurance policy, this man is the handpicked boyfriend or husband replacement you have on standby once \u201cplan A\u201d starts to break down on you. According to a survey conducted by OnePoll.com, an online market research company, half of women who are married or in relationships have a Plan B man on standby who is \u201cready and waiting\u201d because of \u201cunfinished business.\u201d\n\nWhen there\u2019s trouble in paradise, and eventually a break-up, women are left at the starting line again. This means there\u2019s more ladies' night, late-night rom-com marathons, and wine \u2014 lots of wine. However, to avoid playing the field and going through all the bases, women have taken a shortcut to get back to the finish line with a Plan B man. \"The saying that 'the grass isn't always greener' clearly isn't deterring women of today. They understand that anything can happen and are ensuring they have a solid back-up plan should things go sour with their current man,\u201d a spokesman for OnePoll.com told the Daily Mail.\n\nTo analyze women\u2019s relationship contingency plans, the survey of 1,000 women found nearly half of the respondents had a man on deck that they could call out to the plate. However, this man isn\u2019t any rookie; he\u2019s likely to be one of the woman\u2019s all-star friends she\u2019s had around for seven years. More than four in 10 women admitted they had got to know this man while they were with their partner, while almost the same percent said he was \u201con the scene\u201d long before the relationship.\n\nOne in 10 women confessed their Plan B has professed their undying love to them, while two in 10 knew that their Plan B would \u201cdrop everything\u201d for them. These first alternatives were on call for their lady friends for several reasons. A quarter of the ladies blatantly admitted they have strong feelings for their Plan B as they do for their current partner, while 15 percent responded with feeling more for the Plan B man than their significant other, Yahoo reported.\n\n\u201cFor our research to establish that 50 percent of women in relationships have a 'Plan B' is a worrying sign,\u201d said the OnePoll.com spokesman. \u201cThis news may cause a few men in relationships to think twice about not taking the rubbish out or choosing a night down the pub in favor of a cozy night in with his partner. This could spark fear in men across the UK and be great news for women looking for that extra bit of love and care so that their attentions aren't swayed.\u201d\n\nDespite the alarming statistics, men can rest assured their significant other won't call the man on deck to step to the plate. One in three women said they \u201cdoubted\u201d anything would happen with the man in the background, while half had a \u201cnever say never\u201d approach. However, one in six confessed they were \u201cseriously considering\" rekindling their romance with Plan B. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter make it feasible to rekindle with an old flame and remind men any \u201cold friends\u201d can turn up out of the blue.\n\nThese survey results suggest men should make sure they are attentive to their women\u2019s needs, even when the relationship is on the rocks. In a blog post on TheArtofCharm.com, a site dedicated to helping people develop world class social skills, the academy wrote: \u201cKeeping your girlfriend interested is part of keeping your relationship healthy. Make no mistake about it \u2014 the \u201cgame\u201d never ends. It\u2019s always going to go on and you\u2019re always going to have to try and keep the relationship fresh. The good news is that this isn\u2019t a chore. On the contrary, it\u2019s a heck of a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThis is a wake-up call for couples who let their relationships become routine and let the romance die. This is when couples look elsewhere for the fresh and exciting fun they once experienced with each other.\n\nMen, don\u2019t be replaced with a Plan B man. Be your lady\u2019s Plan A and only plan by keeping the romance alive.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "the back-up plan, plan b, three's company, relationships, marriage, spouse, partner, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, cheating, infidelity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you\u2019re in a relationship there\u2019s a 50/50 chance your woman has a \u201cPlan B\u201d man, and this is who it is.", "title": "Heads Up, Dudes, Your Lady Has A 'Plan B' Man", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/back-plan-half-women-relationships-have-plan-b-man-they-can-run-away-305186", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/woman-talking-boyfriend-while-holding-hands-another-man-picnic-sea-shore.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019re in a relationship there\u2019s a 50/50 chance your woman has a \u201cPlan B\u201d man, and this is who it is.", "title": "Heads Up, Dudes, Your Lady Has A 'Plan B' Man", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/back-plan-half-women-relationships-have-plan-b-man-they-can-run-away-305186", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/woman-talking-boyfriend-while-holding-hands-another-man-picnic-sea-shore.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/woman-talking-boyfriend-while-holding-hands-another-man-picnic-sea-shore.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-26T11:48:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T12:12:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you\u2019re in a relationship there\u2019s a 50/50 chance your woman has a \u201cPlan B\u201d man, and this is who it is."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8e5\"", "article_summary": "One in 10 women confessed their Plan B has professed their undying love to them, while two in 10 knew that their Plan B would \u201cdrop everything\u201d for them.\nWhether he\u2019s the one that got away, the office husband, or a gym partner, chances are he is the \u201cPlan B\u201d man you fantasize about running away with.\nHowever, to avoid playing the field and going through all the bases, women have taken a shortcut to get back to the finish line with a Plan B man.\nMen, don\u2019t be replaced with a Plan B man.\nHowever, one in six confessed they were \u201cseriously considering\" rekindling their romance with Plan B."}
