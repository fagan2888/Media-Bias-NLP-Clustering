Travel through the Colorado Rockies is very heavy Monday morning with many skiers headed west on Interstate 70 for the Presidents Day holiday.

Icy road conditions and poor visibility from falling and blowing snow also will slow travel through the mountains, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

A rock slide on I-70 has also slowed traffic through Glenwood Canyon, according to a CDOT news release.

Large boulders fell onto the highway at around 2:39 a.m. Monday. The right lane of I-70 has been closed in each direction as a result. All lanes of the highway from Glenwood Springs to Gypsum was shut down in both directions overnight, according to a CDOT post on Twitter at 10:10 p.m. Alternate routes are U.S. Highway 40 and U.S. Highway 50.

Colorado Department of Transportation officials will likely be “safety metering” at the Eisenhower Tunnel Monday morning and afternoon as ski traffic volumes pick up, according to Ryan Rick with CDOT.

“We know it can be frustrating but metering is a safety procedure,” Rick said.

Safety metering is done when vehicle volumes exceed the capacity of I-70, he said. When backups occur within the tunnel, CDOT stops vehicles from entering, allowing traffic to clear, before releasing more traffic into the tunnel, he said.

With only two lanes, and no pullouts or shoulders, traffic is not allowed to backup into the tunnel since crews would not be able to respond quickly to an emergency.

Last year, around 160,000 vehicles traveled through the Eisenhower tunnel.

Colorado highway information is available at all times on the cotrip.org website or by calling 511.
