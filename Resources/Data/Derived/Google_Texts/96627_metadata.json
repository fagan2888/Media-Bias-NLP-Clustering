It\u2019s just that simple. But even if we can\u2019t move mountains, we can make moves in the right direction.\u201d\n\nRyan has been on a roll since being elected to replace John Boehner. Rank-and-file members, including many in the far-right House Freedom Caucus, have largely endorsed his leadership, especially on the recent $305 billion transportation bill and his ongoing efforts to avoid a government shutdown next week. And so far, he\u2019s done better bridging the gap between Democrats than his predecessor did.\n\nStill, Ryan chided Democrats several times, and may find more resistance going forward.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Flexes His Conservative Muscles in Contrast to Boehner\n\n\u201cFor a long time, the left has thought that if you want to solve a problem, you get a group of highly trained experts to come up with an answer and impose it on the country,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cNowadays, most of us would agree that\u2019s the last thing you should do. The world moves just too fast. Government is always a step behind. So oddly enough, it is the progressives who are stuck in the past.\u201d\n\nHe also said Democrats \u201cmay be good at tactics. But tactics are not solutions.\u201d\n\nThe partisan jabs didn\u2019t go unnoticed, as a spokesperson for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) panned the speech.\n\n\"Speaker Ryan said nothing new today \u2013 only more of the same, tired Republican plans to empower the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of seniors, children and working families. These are the same brazen special interest giveaways that have defined the Ryan budgets for years,\u201d Drew Hammill said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In what was billed as a major address at the Library of Congress, House Speaker Paul R", "title": "Paul Ryan, the GOP's Idea Man, Calls for Bold New Ideas", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Paul-Ryan-GOPs-Idea-Man-Calls-Bold-New-Ideas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Paul-Ryan-GOPs-Idea-Man-Calls-Bold-New-Ideas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In what was billed as a major address at the Library of Congress, House Speaker Paul R", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "These are the same brazen special interest giveaways that have defined the Ryan budgets for years,\u201d Drew Hammill said in a statement.\nStill, Ryan chided Democrats several times, and may find more resistance going forward.\nThe objectives include creating jobs, raising wages and preserving Medicare and Social Security, themes Ryan touched on when he accepted the speaker\u2019s gavel a month ago.\nSo oddly enough, it is the progressives who are stuck in the past.\u201dHe also said Democrats \u201cmay be good at tactics.\nBut tactics are not solutions.\u201dThe partisan jabs didn\u2019t go unnoticed, as a spokesperson for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) panned the speech."}
