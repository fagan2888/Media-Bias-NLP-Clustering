From a White House transcript of his remarks Friday in Purchase, N.Y.:\n\n[Another] reason people are feeling anxious is that if you watch the nightly news, it feels like the world is falling apart. (Laughter.) Now, let me say this: We are living through some extraordinarily challenging times. A lot of it has to do with changes that are taking place in the Middle East in which an old order that had been in place for 50 years, 60 years, 100 years was unsustainable, and was going to break up at some point. And now, what we are seeing is the old order not working, but the new order not being born yet \u2014 and it is a rocky road through that process, and a dangerous time through that process.\n\nSo we\u2019ve seen the barbarity of an organization like ISIL that is building off what happened with al Qaeda and 9/11 \u2014 an extension of that same mentality that doesn\u2019t reflect Islam, but rather just reflects savagery, and extremism, and intolerance. We\u2019ve seen divisions within the Muslim community between the Shia and Sunni. We continue to see an unwillingness to acknowledge the right of Israel to exist and its ability to defend itself. And we have seen, frankly, in this region, economies that don\u2019t work. So you\u2019ve got tons of young people who see no prospect and no hope for the future and are attracted to some of these ideologies.\n\nAll of that makes things pretty frightening. And then, you turn your eyes to Europe and you see the President of Russia making a decision to look backwards instead of forward, and encroaching on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their neighbors, and reasserting the notion that might means right. And I can see why a lot of folks are troubled.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is, is that the world has always been messy. In part, we\u2019re just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through. The good news is that American leadership has never been more necessary, and there\u2019s really no competition out there for the ideas and the values that can create the sort of order that we need in this world.\n\nThat \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d continued its national tour of raising money inside wealthy people\u2019s houses for Democratic causes soon after the president completed his remarks. From New York, he traveled to Newport, R.I., where he pretty much repeated the same speech, doubtlessly FedExing fear to America\u2019s enemies and reassuring its allies that all is normal with this crazy little world.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the plan, you see.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama, speaking at yet another fundraiser with a script that's been recycled more than a Hollywood romantic comedy, had an unlikely culprit for the world's problems.", "title": "Obama: The world seems really messy because of 'social media' -...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 554, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/08/ObamaReddit-554x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/01/obama-world-seems-really-messy-social-media/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "social-media", "published_time": "2014-09-01T09:52:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-01T09:55:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d5f\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve seen divisions within the Muslim community between the Shia and Sunni.\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking at yet another fundraiser with a script that\u2019s been recycled more than a Hollywood romantic comedy, had an unlikely culprit for the world\u2019s problems: social media.\n\u2026And the truth of the matter is, is that the world has always been messy.\nIn part, we\u2019re just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through.\nThat \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d continued its national tour of raising money inside wealthy people\u2019s houses for Democratic causes soon after the president completed his remarks."}
