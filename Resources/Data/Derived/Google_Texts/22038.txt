Most people have forgotten who created the iconic Old West sculptures in Civic Center, but the Denver Art Museum is happy to refresh the cultural memory.

At 5 p.m. June 24, a plaque will be dedicated to Alexander Phimister Proctor, who made the monumental statues “Broncho Buster” and “On the War Trail.”

“We’re so thrilled to provide some history and context to these monuments and tell people about the American artist who sculpted them almost 100 years ago,” said Laura Proctor Ames, the artist’s great-granddaughter, who will be at the ceremony.

Proctor, born in 1860, spent his early years in Denver, where he took his first art lesson. He later studied at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design in New York City, then in Paris.

He became one of North America’s finest sculptors of monuments, according to the Alexander Phimister Proctor Foundation.

After the dedication ceremony, Thomas Brent Smith, director of the Petrie Institute of Western American Art at the Denver Art Museum, will talk about the monumental sculptures in Civic Center.

Smith’s presentation will start at 6 p.m. at the McNichols Civic Center Building.
