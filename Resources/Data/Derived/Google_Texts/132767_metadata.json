She doesn\u2019t say it in so many words but I know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re going on our trip, Mama.\u201d She pauses, chewing her lip. \u201cBut I wish\u2026 I wish we didn\u2019t have to go through security.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I agree, remembering a time when she was barely out of diapers, and a TSA officer tried to wrench her, screaming, from my arms, and make her walk alone through the metal detector.\n\nShe has a faraway look, as if she\u2019s remembering all the times that she has been yelled at in security, many more times than her fairer skinned older brother. Or perhaps she is remembering how often I, her dark-skinned mother, am \u2018randomly\u2019 stopped to have my hands coated with bomb-detection liquid. Random or not, this has never happened to her European father.\n\nBut nine year olds are optimists, or at least this one is, so she soon brightens up. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be awesome if we could just travel by floo network?\u201d\n\nHarry Potter-based travel possibilities \u2013 even ones involving fireplaces and chimneys \u2013 would be fantastic indeed. As far as I\u2019m aware, there is no TSA at Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cOnly think of all the soot,\u201d I say. My heart unclenches a little at her smile. \u201cWhat if instead we travelled by port-key?\u201d\n\nAnd she is off \u2013 imagining if it will be a \u201cmanky old boot\u201d or a tri-wizard tournament cup that magically transports us, TSA-free, to our destination. But as we near the airport, my anxiety is rising. Mothers are supposed to protect their children, after all, we are supposed to make their world a safe and trustworthy place.\n\nKind of like what the TSA thinks it is doing, I guess.\n\nBut the TSA is not our parent, it is a government institution founded on fear, and deeply imperfect systems of screening. We, who speak languages other than English, instinctively keep our voices down in airports, lest we be suspected of plotting terror when we are actually just wondering about the location of the closest Starbucks. Consider that airports now have \u2018behavior detection\u2019 officers whose job it is to \u2018deter\u2019 terrorist activities by targeting, according to an August 2012 New York Times article, \u201cNot only Middle Easterners\u2026 but Hispanics traveling to Miami\u2026 or blacks wearing baseball caps backward.\u201d\n\nThere is something particularly heinous about a \u2018system of protection\u2019 that so blatantly racially profiles. In the case of our multi-skin-toned family, this racial profiling is so obvious as to seem like a joke, splitting us down the middle, right along color lines.\n\nWhen I travel alone, I know it will happen. It has gotten so bad I sometimes think twice before wearing any Indian clothes \u2013 which is unusual for me, since I\u2019m usually wearing some item of Indian clothing. But without doing any actual statistical analysis, I know that I get pulled aside more often \u2013 and for more thorough searching \u2013 when I\u2019m dressed \u2018ethnically\u2019. Because, I guess, terrorists like to wear batik scarves and colorful cotton kurtas? (Or rather, that \u2018difference\u2019 and \u2018terrorism\u2019 have become conflated in this country?)\n\nBut, it\u2019s far more painful when I\u2019m traveling with my family because the colorism of the profiling is so ridiculously obvious.\n\nWe are frequent air travelers \u2013 my husband, children, and I. We are a global family with relatives all over the world. A love of travel is in fact one of the first things that drew my husband and I, both children of immigrants, together. But back in those days, a plane trip was not so different from a flying bus. There were no liquids to throw away before security, no shoes and jackets to take off while trying to keep a baby or toddler from crying.\n\nBut then came 9-11, a day when brown-skinned Americans like me, people of South Asian and Middle Eastern origin (not to mention anyone else who could belong to the all-encompassing category of \u2018potential terrorist\u2019) came to know what our African American brothers and sisters said was the experience of \u2018Driving while Black.\u2019 (or, as in the case of Trayvon Martin, Walking While Black). Random screenings and checks stop feeling so random when they happen each and every time one goes to the airport. That became the reality of \u2018Flying while Brown.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they do it,\u201d says a fair-skinned, blonde-haired haired friend of mine, as I try to tamp down my ire, \u201cThey need to keep us safe. Heck, I\u2019d undress down to my underwear if they wanted me to.\u201d\n\n(Not that she would have to, if she went through the old \u2018virtual strip search\u2019 back-scatter X-ray machines which would do the undressing for you. But we apparently no longer have that kind of scanner, or so they say, in airports)", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a member of a multi-skin-toned family, I've come to regard the TSA with a mixture of fear and loathing", "title": "The perils of flying while brown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As a member of a multi-skin-toned family, I've come to regard the TSA with a mixture of fear and loathing", "title": "The perils of flying while brown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/05/the_perils_of_flying_while_brown_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_123163654.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As a member of a multi-skin-toned family, I've come to regard the TSA with a mixture of fear and loathing", "title": "The perils of flying while brown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_123163654.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "SAYANTANI DASGUPTA", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Air Travel, Racism, The Weeklings, Travel, TSA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Air Travel, Racism, The Weeklings, Travel, TSA, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on The WeeklingsMY NINE YEAR-OLD daughter has developed a fear of the TSA.\nBut back in those days, a plane trip was not so different from a flying bus.\nRandom screenings and checks stop feeling so random when they happen each and every time one goes to the airport.\nOr perhaps she is remembering how often I, her dark-skinned mother, am \u2018randomly\u2019 stopped to have my hands coated with bomb-detection liquid.\nBut the TSA is not our parent, it is a government institution founded on fear, and deeply imperfect systems of screening."}
