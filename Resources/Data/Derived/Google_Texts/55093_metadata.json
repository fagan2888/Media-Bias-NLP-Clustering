The former presidential candidate has spent much of the past year focusing on his extended family.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the year since his White House dream came crashing down, Mitt Romney\u2019s life has unfolded like pages from a family photo album. There are the many pictures posted online of his grandchildren, the shout-outs for his wife\u2019s best-selling cookbook, a trip to Peru, and the purchase of a fifth house.\n\nHe did not form a political action committee, and he did not try to play a major role in the Republican Party. He knew, according to his friends, that the Romney brand of Mr. Fix-it had been undermined by his own words and failed strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as the calendar nears this week\u2019s anniversary of his 2012 defeat, and a difficult year of reflection comes to a close, Romney is intent on re-emerging \u2014 slowly, carefully, in the calculated way of a cautious investor sensing an opportunity \u2014 but re-emerging nonetheless.\n\nIn a Sunday interview with the Globe, Romney made some of his most pointed political remarks since losing the election, accusing President Obama of \u201cdishonesty\u201d in saying during the campaign that Americans could keep their health care plan under what has become known as Obamacare.\n\nThe White House has acknowledged that some people with independent health coverage have received cancellation notices because their plans do not meet certain standards.\n\nAt the same time, Romney implicitly criticized his own party, saying that certain caucuses and state conventions \u2014 which in some cases have led to the nomination of Tea Party supporters \u2014 should be replaced with primaries that attract a wider swath of voters. Romney is hoping to influence the direction of the party by creating what he called a \u201csmall\u201d political action committee that would allow him to raise money for candidates in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI also recognize that having lost a presidential race does not give me the platform to be the spokesman for the party or try and tell people what they ought to do,\u201d Romney said in the interview. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m the guy that lost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one is suggesting that Romney would consider running again for the White House \u2014 two failed presidential bids dashed that dream \u2014 but his former aides hope that the public is considering him in a new light.\n\n\u201cI think there is a national case for buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d said Tom Rath, the New Hampshire political operative who worked closely with Romney in his last campaign.\n\nOver the past year, Romney has at times seemed to be without a defining cause or purpose to guide him beyond spending time with his five sons and their burgeoning families.\n\nIt has been a slow walk back into the spotlight. At first, Romney went into analytical mode, meeting with former campaign aides to put together an internal review of why he lost. They put less blame on personal missteps, such as Romney\u2019s comment that 47 percent of Americans are dependent on government, and more on missed strategic opportunities, such as failures to win over Hispanic voters and get out the Republican vote.\n\n\u201cWhat Mitt is trying to do is lend his voice to what are the best tactics to advance our principles,\u201d Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who was Romney\u2019s running mate, said in an interview. \u201cThe best role for him, that is natural for him, is to be an elder statesman. He serves as a very good unifier; he unifies our party very well.\u201d\n\nRomney has spent much of the past year focusing on his extended family, which has grown this year by four grandchildren. In June, he drove to a car dealership in New Hampshire and traded in his 2005 red Mustang convertible for a 15-passenger Ford Econoline van. He is planning to take some of his grandchildren this summer on a tour to national parks in the American West, just as his father, George, did.\n\n\u201cWhen the campaign was over, I went back to the life I\u2019d known before: I\u2019m involved in business again, and I\u2019m deeply involved in charitable efforts that I care about. . . and of course family,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got 22 grandchildren that I get to enjoy a lot more this year than I did last year.\u201d\n\n\u2018I think we should have the majority of the party\u2019s voters decide who they want as their nominee.\u2019 Mitt Romney, on his eagerness to see the influence of caucuses in the GOP nominating process diminished\n\nHe works in a personal office at Solamere Capital, a private capital firm founded by Romney\u2019s oldest son, Tagg, on Boston\u2019s fashionable Newbury Street. Romney is listed on the firm\u2019s website as \u201cexecutive partner group chairman,\u201d a role in which he offers strategic advice and business connections. He has also provided financing for real estate ventures by several of his sons, who have been investing in apartment buildings, according to a source close to the family. A few weeks after the election, Romney rejoined the Marriott International board of directors.\n\nLeisure time has dominated much of Romney\u2019s schedule. He has gone trout fishing in Alaska, where, after six hours one day last summer, he caught nothing. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of someone going to Alaska and not catching anything,\u201d Romney said with a laugh. \u201cNeither the guides nor any fishermen even got a nibble.\u201d\n\nFamily members often post photos of him on Twitter and Instagram, showing the former presidential candidate with his hair disheveled, making homemade ice cream, reading bedtime stories, or playing Connect Four with his grandchildren.\n\nHe has gone hiking in the California desert, and he has sat in a reclining lawn chair in Palm Springs, a newborn sleeping on his stomach. He has vacationed on Lake Huron in Ontario, and at the family home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.\n\nLast month, he went to remote areas of Peru to help a group called Charity Vision, which administers exams and screens for potential eye problems. One photo shows him, in a blue hospital gown and surgical mask, observing an operation. Another shows him helping a young girl with an eye exam.\n\nRomney said he and his wife, Ann, have also been involved in supporting the Center for Neurologic Disease at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nInstead of moving into one home \u2014 the White House \u2014 the Romneys have used their wealth to give them the option of living in five houses, each near their sons.\n\nAfter local appeals, the California Coastal Commission last month gave the Romneys approval to move forward on plans to tear down his 3,000-square-foot beachfront property in La Jolla and replace it with a home that is more than three times larger. The home will include the infamous four-car garage with an elevator that became fodder for criticism during the 2012 campaign.\n\nThe Romneys have recently purchased property in Holladay, Utah, where they plan to tear down the existing house and build a 5,900-square-foot one. The family has also purchased a home in Park City, Utah, that had been listed for $8.9 million. The Romneys also have a condo in Belmont, Mass., and a vacation home in Wolfeboro, N.H.\n\nRomney\u2019s political engagement has been sporadic. He releases statements or grants interviews when it suits him. In June, he put together a conference in Park City that included bipartisan speakers, modeled after a campaign event a year earlier.\n\nThe relative quiet was broken last week by Obama\u2019s visit to Boston, during which the president said that Romney\u2019s health care law in Massachusetts also got off to a slow start. That event prompted the former governor and his former running mate to speak out forcefully. \u201cPretty much the opposite of what we planned on doing occurred: bitter partisanship, problems getting worse, Obamacare taking effect,\u201d said Ryan, adding that he e-mails and talks regularly with Romney. \u201cThe irony is Mitt and I were going to fix these problems. That was going to be our agenda. The buyer\u2019s remorse, I guess people see that. But no one should be surprised.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to gauge public opinion on Romney \u2014 and whether there\u2019s any \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d \u2014 because there have been no polls detailing opinions on the losing 2012 presidential candidate.\n\nRomney, who was pilloried during the GOP primaries by many Tea Party supporters, said the presidential nominating contest should be altered to diminish the influence of caucuses and encourage states to select candidates through broader primary elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s an effort on the part of some to move toward caucuses or conventions to select nominees, and I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cI think we should reward those states that award delegates to the convention based upon primaries. Primaries are the place where you see whose message is connecting with the largest number of people,\u201d he said.\n\nRomney\u2019s plan would probably limit the strength of the Tea Party, whose activists have proved effective in caucuses, where they can rally their most ardent supporters. Romney said he was less concerned about diminishing the influence of Iowa, which holds strong to its tradition of having a caucus, than with other states moving in that direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that that kind of approach could end up with a minority deciding who the nominee ought to be. And that I think would be a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should have the majority of the party\u2019s voters decide who they want as their nominee.\u201d\n\nRomney said he is most focused with altering the presidential nominating contest, but he would also make his views known in some states that use caucuses and conventions to select Senate nominees. In Utah, for example, longtime Senator Bob Bennett was defeated during a convention by Tea Party-backed Mike Lee.\n\nRomney did not criticize the Tea Party specifically, although he did say the government shutdown strategy was \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTea Party members will continue to have an influence in the thinking of the American people, and certainly in my party,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, is separate from the effort by a few people to move toward a shutdown as a tactic to stop Obamacare. Obviously that didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nWhile Romney is slowly easing back into a public role, many of his days are filled with quieter moments. A few weeks ago, Romney walked off a United flight by himself. He had promised his campaign assistant, Garrett Jackson, that he would attend a University of Mississippi football game with him.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Win or lose, I\u2019m going to come to an Ole Miss game with you. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m president of the United States or not, I\u2019m going to come,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSure enough, he made good on his promise.\u201d\n\nRomney wore an Ole Miss shirt that Jackson had given to him, and they sat in the stands, eating hot dogs and soaking it all in.\n\nThe next morning, as Jackson drove Romney to the airport, his mind turned to their early campaign days together, before the entourage had grown, before the chartered plane, and before the devastating defeat.\n\n\u201cIt was full circle,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was back to the two of us, alone in the car again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.2.379088122", "eomportal-id": 863334, "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the calendar nears the anniversary of his 2012 defeat, and the bitter year of remove and reflection comes to a close, Mitt Romney is intent on reemerging \u2013 slowly, carefully, in the calculated way of a cautious investor sensing an opportunity \u2013 but reemerging nonetheless.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the calendar nears the anniversary of his 2012 defeat, and the bitter year of remove and reflection comes to a close, Mitt Romney is intent on reemerging \u2013 slowly, carefully, in the calculated way of a cautious investor sensing an opportunity \u2013 but reemerging nonetheless.", "title": "A year after defeat, Mitt Romney seeks to reemerge as a public voice - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2013/11/04/year-after-defeat-mitt-romney-seeks-reemerge-public-voice/06CtD7uSjcFQjccl7S86eM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2013/11/04/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/romney-big.jpg", "longitude": "-77.0363658", "state": "DC", "latitude": "38.8951118", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Mitt Romney,Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, Barack  Obama, Paul  Ryan,Conservative Political Action Conference, Republican Party, Marriott International Incorporated, Twitter, California Coastal Commission", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Tue May 24 13:23:24 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Mitt Romney,Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, Barack  Obama, Paul  Ryan,Conservative Political Action Conference, Republican Party, Marriott International Incorporated, Twitter, California Coastal Commission, Senate, University of Mississippi,Marriott International Incorporated|MAR|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "00cd1dfc-4511-11e3-a495-614a41e32c0a"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcf0\"", "article_summary": "and of course family,\u201d Romney said.\nMitt Romney spoke at the 40th annual Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., in March.\nObviously that didn\u2019t work.\u201dWhile Romney is slowly easing back into a public role, many of his days are filled with quieter moments.\nAt first, Romney went into analytical mode, meeting with former campaign aides to put together an internal review of why he lost.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the year since his White House dream came crashing down, Mitt Romney\u2019s life has unfolded like pages from a family photo album."}
