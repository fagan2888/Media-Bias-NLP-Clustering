SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — If the Golden Globes are obvious — celebs, cameras, tuxedoes — the night-before Art of Elysium fundraiser is the ultimate in esoteric.

Where the typical black-tie gala promises drinks, dinner and entertainment, the art charity’s eighth annual Heaven gala aimed to provide an artistic experience curated by performance artist Marina Abramovic.

“It’s Marina’s vision that you are part of the art,” guests were told upon entering the party Saturday, held in an airplane hangar in Santa Monica, California.

It began with a “silent cocktail hour.” Celebrants such as Zach Braff, Usher, Joaquin Phoenix and Johnny Depp, who lounged on a couch behind velvet ropes, were instructed not to speak during the cocktail reception and encouraged to wear silencing headphones provided by attendants. Drinks were to be ordered by pointing at a menu.
