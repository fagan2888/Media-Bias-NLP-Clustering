Indications of how many people actually tried but failed to enroll are mixed. But reaction to the user experience has been consistent: It sucked. Most users faced slow load times and confusing error messaging, and only a small number registered successfully.\n\nFortunately, most of these issues will be fixed shortly as traffic slows and back-end issues are resolved. What will become increasingly important in the coming weeks and months is how effective these sites are at educating and encouraging consumers to sign up by the March 31, 2014, deadline.\n\nWe\u2019re in the midst of an exciting design opportunity. Consumers can buy almost anything online, so why not insurance? It\u2019s not an easy problem and will require a massive shift in the way we think about health insurance. So what\u2019s the key to a successful shift? Creating seamless and accessible user experiences that work for a diverse population.\n\nI took a look at a number of state-run exchange sites to see how their user experiences align with some of the best practices that guide the UX team at Huge.\n\n1. Engage users quickly.\n\nUnlike in most e-commerce experiences, users aren\u2019t quite sure what they\u2019re looking for or need when shopping for health care online. Exchange sites can reduce information overload by minimizing content on the homepage and providing clear calls-to-action (CTAs) to guide users to the most relevant content.\n\n\n\nMaryland Health Connection\n\nMaryland\u2019s site, for example, provides clear, engaging CTAs that get the primary user groups, individuals and small business owners, to the right content, right away.\n\nHawai\u2019i Health Connector\n\nHawaii\u2019s main CTA, meanwhile, encourages users to call a number. It\u2019s only after some digging that users discover they can sign up for insurance online\u2014through an entirely separate site.\n\n2. Set expectations clearly.\n\nWhile many users may be familiar with the process of booking a flight online, few will have any idea what\u2019s involved when purchasing an insurance plan. By exposing all the steps in the process up front, these sites can meet two main user needs at once: 1.) educate users about what\u2019s involved, and 2) keep them motivated to follow through on purchase.\n\nHealthSource RI\n\nRhode Island\u2019s site walks users through the application process, clearly communicating their current step and how much further they have until completion.\n\nVermont\n\nAfter clicking \"Apply\" on Vermont\u2019s site, users are taken to this page. It\u2019s a dead-end: most users will need to register, but that link is hidden. It also doesn\u2019t communicate what the user can expect next.\n\n\n\n3. Prepare for the worst.\n\nLaunch day crashes are all too common. Poorly conceived error handling confuses and frustrates users, potentially deterring them from returning to the site. Plus, it can get expensive\u2014when users can\u2019t navigate a site on their own, they may resort to phoning a call center. Designers should work closely with developers to identify potential problem areas and develop systems and messaging to handle a variety of worst-case scenarios.\n\n\n\nNevada HealthLink\n\nNevada\u2019s site alerts users to a specific issue on the site in an unobtrusive way and provides users with a single, clear instruction. Also, visitors can still browse and learn about the health coverage while other parts of the site are unavailable.\n\nMassachusetts Health Connector\n\n\n\nMassachusetts\u2019s site provides a vague error message that gives users multiple instructions: Keep hitting refresh forever, or check back later. When confronted with zero information, users may not return at all.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "From Huge, 3 Rules For Making Obamacare Exchange Sites Suck Less", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/10/3020018-poster-1280-health.jpg", "description": "Americans recently got their first taste of what it's like to buy health care online through Obamacare.
