Ted Cruz, R-Texas, put his Republican colleagues in quite a pickle by playing hardball on the recent debt ceiling vote, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Sunday.\n\n\u201cI understand where Senator Cruz is coming from,\u201d McCain told CNN. \u201cBut I allege that there was no plan. There was no plan once we had taken the United States on the brink of this financial crisis that we we're approaching.\u201d\n\nCongress passed an extension of the nation\u2019s borrowing authority this week, following weeks of indecision among Republicans about how to approach the issue. GOP leaders offered a number of proposals to extract concessions from Democrats on the debt ceiling vote, but when none of the plans passed muster with the Republican rank-and-file, leaders decided to allow Democrats to shoulder the burden of passing a \u201cclean\u201d bill.\n\nRather than allowing Senate Democrats to pass the bill with their own 55-seat majority, however, Cruz insisted on a 60-vote threshold, forcing a handful of Republicans help move the bill forward. No Senate Republicans ultimately voted to pass the legislation, but Cruz\u2019s maneuver ruffled some feathers among his colleagues who felt he forced them to take an unpopular vote without any clear strategy to pass an alternative bill.\n\nThe Treasury Department has warned that a failure to extend the borrowing authority on time could invite a default on the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nShortly after the bill passed on Wednesday, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., took a swipe at Cruz\u2019s tactics, saying the Texas Republican had no \u201cend game.\u201d\n\nCorker also praised the fortitude of Senate Republican leaders who helped advance the bill, saying they demonstrated \u201ctremendous courage,\u201d especially given the primary fights some of them are facing in 2014.\n\nMcCain echoed that commendation Sunday. \u201cI appreciate our leadership voting the way that they did, even though they face primary oppositions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was enough of us that we move forward and put this issue behind us, and now focus on Obamacare, on the economy, on many other issues, in which we think are winning issues.\u201d\n\nCruz has defended his approach to the debt ceiling vote, saying Republicans should put up or shut up if they\u2019re so opposed to extending the U.S. borrowing authority.\n\n\n\n\u201cI recently had my staff print out a list of three pages of Republican senators \u2014 I might note all the people that are running around the press saying nasty things about me \u2014 saying \u2018We will stand on the debt ceiling and fight for it,\u2019\u201d Cruz told conservative radio host Mark Levin on Thursday. \u201cAnd then a few months later, it\u2019s like they think the American people are just a bunch of rubes, that we don\u2019t remember what they say.\u201d\n\nMcCain and Cruz have clashed in the past, with McCain dubbing Cruz and some of his like-minded colleagues \u201cwacko birds.\u201d He later apologized for the label, but he\u2019s continued to criticize Cruz\u2019s confrontational style and tactics.\n\nMcCain also weighed in on the bloody civil war in Syria, saying the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to defuse the conflict have been an \u201cabysmal failure.\u201d\n\nDespite the disunity of rebel factions seeking to unseat Syrian President Bashar Assad \u2013 and the presence of al Qaeda extremists among them - McCain insisted there are still \u201cviable\u201d opposition groups who deserve stronger U.S. support.\n\n\u201cYes, these foreign fighters, 7,000 of them, foreign fighters are there,\u201d McCain said, but \u201cThere are viable options. There is a viable free Syrian army. There are people, who \u2013 there's groups that have joined together against these extremists.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not believe we are out of options,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are many options if we have the courage to pursue them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
