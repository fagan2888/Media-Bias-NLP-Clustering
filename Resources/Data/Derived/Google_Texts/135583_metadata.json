Jeff Herzberg, the Chief Administrator for the Prairie Lakes Area Education Agency, tweeted:\n\n#saiconf14 @TerryBranstad we must better prepare our students \u2013 agreed How does not pursuing @SmarterBalanced as a state help move us? #lead \u2014 Jeff Herzberg (@herz6kids) August 6, 2014\n\nBranstad spokesperson Jimmy Centers told Caffeinated Thoughts that Branstad and Iowa Department of Education Director Brad Buck in a joint letter to the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium sent on July 29, 2014 said that the state would be withdrawing from the consortium effective immediately and asked that they would no longer list Iowa as a member state.\n\nThey cited the assessment taskforce, established by the Iowa Legislature in 2013, and said that to honor the task force\u2019s work they would not sign a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Smarter Balanced.\n\nIowa joined the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium which was one of two consortia formed to create assessments aligned to the Common Core. States who wanted to be eligible for the Race to the Top, a $4.35 Billion earmark within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, had to join one of the consortia that was being formed and largely funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that by declining to sign that Iowa will no longer be a governing state in the consortium,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe request that Iowa\u2019s withdrawal be effective immediately, and that the consortium no long (sic) list Iowa as a member state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIowa\u2019s goal is to have a state assessment that is the right fit for Iowa. It should reflect our high state academic standards. We want educators, students and parents to have confidence in the state assessment as a measure of complex thinking and problem solving capacity as well as basic skills,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nThe MOU with Smarter Balanced that was originally signed by former Governor Chet Culver, and later affirmed by Branstad makes no mention of an expiration date. Centers told Caffeinated Thoughts that it was his understanding the MOU did need to be renewed. Caffeinated Thoughts has requested the formal request for a renewal by Smarter Balanced from the Iowa Department of Education and will update this article when it is made available.\n\nThe original document states the procedure for for withdrawing from the consortia:\n\nA State requesting an exit from the Consortium must submit in writing their request and reasons for the exit request,\n\nThe written explanation must include the statutory or policy reasons for the exit,\n\nThe written request must be submitted to the Project Management Partners with the same signatures as required for the MOU,\n\nThe Executive Committee will act upon the request within a week of the request, and\n\nUpon approval of the request, the Project Management Partner will then submit a change of membership to the USED for approval.\n\nThe letter lacked the signature of the President of the Iowa State Board of Education Charles C. Edwards, Jr. Former State Board President and current member Rosie Hussey signed the letter requesting Iowa become a governing state in the consortia. Hussey also signed the original MOU. It appears that they strayed from what the original agreement states unless that language is null and void when the MOU expires.\n\nThe Iowa Assessment Task Force at their July 17th meeting voted to continue to explore two assessments \u2013 Smarter Balanced and the Next Generation Iowa Assessments. The vendors, DRC for Smarter Balanced and the Iowa Testing Program for the Next Generation Iowa Assessments will be interviewed at the task force\u2019s September 17th meeting. The ACT Aspire assessment made it to the second round, but was dropped by the task force.\n\nThe task force will make its recommendation by January 1, 2015. According to the Iowa Code the State Legislature will have to approve any change to the assessments that are mandated for Iowa\u2019s public and accredited non-public schools.\n\nWhile Iowa is withdrawing from the consortium, the state\u2019s students could still end up taking the test.\n\nAs of the time of this writing Smarter Balanced still lists Iowa on their website.\n\nYou can read Governor Branstad\u2019s letter here.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/08/iowa-withdraws-common-core-assessment-consortia/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Terry-Branstad-teacher-principal-symposium-1024x681.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-08-07T01:13:54+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "act aspire, brad buck, charles c. edwards, chet culver, common core assessments, common core state standards, drc, iowa assessment task force, iowa department of education, iowa state board of education, iowa testing program, jeff herzberg, jimmy centers, next generation iowa assessments, prairie lakes area education agency, rosie hussey, school administrators of iowa, smarter balanced assessment consortium, smarter balanced assessments, terry branstad, education, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Iowa Gov.
