Just how poorly has the rollout of ObamaCare gone?

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe Thursday, when the perilously liberal Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein said, “The Obama administration isn’t administering the health care itself,” the perilously liberal co-host Mika Brzezinski replied, “Thank god!” (video follows with transcript and commentary):

MICHAEL STEELE: The idea that you couldn't get the website to work? Well, next year you get patients, and what happens then? And that’s the real concern, that's what those numbers are saying. SAM STEIN, HUFFINGTON POST: The Obama administration isn’t administering the health care itself. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST: Thank god!

What’s interesting about this beyond Brzezinski’s candor is that earlier in the program, the entire panel – which included Politico’s Jim VandeHei – were laughing practically out of control when a picture of the new poster child for ObamaCare "Pajama Boy" was shown.

VandeHei even commented that ObamaCare "is one of the most flawed rollouts in the history of mankind."

Unfortunately for MSNBC viewers, this isn't the picture of the Affordable Care Act they'll get on this farce of a so-called "news network" later in the day.

Once shills like Chuck Todd, Andrea Mitchell, Thomas Roberts, Tamron Hall, Ed Schultz, Chris Matthews, Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, and Lawrence O'Donnell take control of the microphones, everything will be just hunky-dory with ObamaCare and all things related to this administration.

Makes you wonder how any of them - and especially their bosses - can sleep at night knowing what a distorted picture of the world they're presenting as "news" each and every day.
