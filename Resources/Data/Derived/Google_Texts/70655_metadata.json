Malone said he and Connelly will make decide after Saturday night\u2019s home game against Washington.\n\n\u201cTim and I have had some general conversations,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say to that is Axel has been terrific. I like guys \u2014 and it\u2019s appropriate for guys on a 10-day contract \u2014 to fit in before you try to stand out. Axel comes in here \u2014 yeah, he knows Joffrey (Lauvergne) for a long time \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t try to be anything he\u2019s not. He knows his role, he works hard.\u201d\n\nThe French native, whom the Nuggets called up from the D-League, has been productive. Going into Saturday, Toupane had averaged 3.8 points in 12 minutes per game. He scored 10 points in the Nuggets\u2019 win over Phoenix on Thursday.\n\n\u201cEverybody did a great job to work with me on the team and make me feel part of the family,\u201d Toupane said. \u201cI had no expectation coming here. I just wanted to, every time the coach called my name, just go all out and give everything I had. I\u2019m just happy to be here and just go hard and give everything I have.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets can sign him to another 10-day contract before having to make a decision on whether to keep him for the balance of the season.\n\nHe said it. Malone, on Wizards point guard John Wall: \u201cJohn Wall is a one-man break. He\u2019s a one-man fast break. The guy is ridiculously fast in the open court.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Axel Toupane awaits future plans for Nuggets", "title": "Axel Toupane awaits future plans for Nuggets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/axel-toupane-awaits-future-plans-for-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T21:52:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T21:52:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Axel Toupane will be on a plane Sunday.\nHe will be either heading to Miami with the Nuggets or returning to his D-League team in Toronto.\nHe knows his role, he works hard.\u201dThe French native, whom the Nuggets called up from the D-League, has been productive.\n\u201cEverybody did a great job to work with me on the team and make me feel part of the family,\u201d Toupane said.\nAxel comes in here \u2014 yeah, he knows Joffrey (Lauvergne) for a long time \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t try to be anything he\u2019s not."}
