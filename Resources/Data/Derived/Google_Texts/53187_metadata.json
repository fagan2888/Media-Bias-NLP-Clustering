Glatz and Budget Director Daniel R. Huntington totals $339.1 million, which is a spending increase of $2.46 million, or 0.73 percent.\n\nMuch of the blame for that lies with the state-mandated programs for preschool education of handicapped children, which are rising nearly $1.5 million, and child care and foster care programs, up $900,000.\n\nThere is partial state reimbursement for some of those costs, so the budget documents offer a \u201cnet appropriations\u201d figure that actually shows a spending decrease of 0.29 percent.\n\nThe county is raising its property tax levy by 1.77 percent, but Huntington said the county\u2019s \u201creal\u201d tax cap was 2.06 percent. He said the county was able to gain more head room under the state-mandated cap by rolling over the $843,000 by which it was under the cap last year.\n\nGlatz said, \u201cI think we got a very good budget that was well constructed by Mr. Huntington. We have to deal with that tax cap that doesn\u2019t give you much flexibility in balancing a budget.\u201d\n\nThat task was made easier by a variety of factors that pushed many of the county\u2019s cost drivers downward.\n\nThe county share of Medicaid, always the largest item in the budget, fell $1.5 million, to $43.66 million.\n\nGlatz said he thinks one of the reasons for that might be Obamacare moving Medicaid recipients into buying policies through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges.\n\nGood stock market results earlier in the year for the state public employee pension fund led State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, the sole trustee of the fund, to decree a decrease in local government contributions. That cut the county\u2019s cost by $1.4 million, to $11.5 million.\n\nSeemingly healthier county employees also helped the budget, as health insurance costs are being reduced by $1.8 million, to $29.2 million. Workers\u2019 comp funding is down $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cFor health insurance, we\u2019re self-insured. We set the rates for 2015, and the expenses were less than the premiums,\u201d Huntington said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that people are not getting sick or injured,\u201d Glatz said. He said the county has been working with its unions on wellness programs that may be paying off.\n\nAll union members will receive their annual \u201cstep increases\u201d in 2016, which the County Legislature restored last year after they had been frozen for four years. That will cost $800,000. The budget includes 2 percent pay raises for all non-union employees.\n\nAlso, $2.7 million has been stashed in the budget to pay for raises that would result if the county is able to reach contract agreements with its unions. At present, only one bargaining unit, the blue-collar American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has a current contract. The other five unions are working under terms of deals that ran out at the end of 2011.\n\nThe county isn\u2019t using its savings to produce a tax cut. Glatz is proposing to spend $7.2 million from the county\u2019s surplus in 2016, but this year the county appropriated $9.9 million from that source, and the 2015 budget gave most taxpayers a small tax increase of less than 1 percent.\n\nThe county had $30 million in fund balance at the start of this year, but has spent about $4 million during the year. Most of that pertained to the county\u2019s unexpected purchase of three buildings in downtown Lockport, two of which the county was leasing for office space. When the out-of-state owner put them up for auction, the county won them, and will no longer have to pay about $1 million per year in rentals, Glatz said.\n\nThe $26 million surplus remaining is better than the $24 million the county had at this time a year ago.\n\nThe county is projecting a 1 percent increase in sales tax revenues. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s conservative,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be above budget this year, but if you look at 2014 versus 2015, it\u2019s flat.\u201d\n\nThe budget director said sales tax revenue \u201cis down all over the state. It\u2019s good that we\u2019re flat, because some counties are down 3 percent or 4 percent.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for sales tax receipts going down may include the fall in the Canadian dollar, which might be keeping some Canadian shoppers from crossing the bridges, and the falling price of gasoline, Huntington speculated.\n\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOCKPORT \u2013 Thanks to significant drops in many of the county\u2019s major cost areas \u2013 most of which were completely outside the county\u2019s control \u2013 Niagara County leaders were able to unveil a proposed 2016 budget Friday that reduces the average property tax rate by 3.7...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "LOCKPORT \u2013 Thanks to significant drops in many of the county\u2019s major cost areas \u2013 most of which were completely outside the county\u2019s control \u2013 Niagara County leaders were able to unveil a proposed 2016 budget Friday that reduces the average property tax rate by 3.7... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Proposed Niagara County budget reduces average tax rate  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/all-niagara-county/proposed-niagara-county-budget-reduces-average-tax-rate-20151113", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "At present, only one bargaining unit, the blue-collar American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has a current contract.\nThe county is raising its property tax levy by 1.77 percent, but Huntington said the county\u2019s \u201creal\u201d tax cap was 2.06 percent.\nThe county share of Medicaid, always the largest item in the budget, fell $1.5 million, to $43.66 million.\nLOCKPORT \u2013 Thanks to significant drops in many of the county\u2019s major cost areas \u2013 most of which were completely outside the county\u2019s control \u2013 Niagara County leaders were able to unveil a proposed 2016 budget Friday that reduces the average property tax rate by 3.7 percent.\nSeemingly healthier county employees also helped the budget, as health insurance costs are being reduced by $1.8 million, to $29.2 million."}
