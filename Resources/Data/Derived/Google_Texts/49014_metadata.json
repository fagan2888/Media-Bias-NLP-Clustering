The legal brawl it unleashed gives a rare glimpse at just how antagonistic the business of health care can become these days.  Last summer, just shy of its 65th birthday, East Texas Medical Center filed a lawsuit in state district court in Smith County alleging that Aetna Health, Cigna Healthcare and, especially, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas have plunged the hospital into financial jeopardy by repeatedly shutting it out of the most common and popular group health insurance networks.  The 502-bed main hospital in Tyler, which serves as the mother ship in a system of rural hospitals and clinics, is the only full-service, nonprofit hospital in all of Texas that has been involuntarily shut out of statewide preferred provider networks, the hospital contends.  Both inside and outside of Texas, health care experts say it is extraordinary for a hospital to resort to legal action to be put in a broad network, but it goes to the heart of how important such a designation has become.  How they going to afford to travel? asks Sam Williams, a 72-year-old Tyler retiree who received a new kidney almost three years ago at ETMC and receives follow-up care from a specialist several times a month.  While he is covered by Medicare, he worries for those in insurance limbo on the waiting lists.  In the Tyler area, Blue Cross and Blue Shield commands 73 percent share of the market, which translates to about one in seven people in the county, hospital executives say.  Desperation drives people and institutions to take drastic actions, says Gerald Kominski, director of the University of California-Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research.  Carroll says ETMC has been trying for years to be included in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield PPO network serving employer-sponsored group plans without success and without ever being told why.  The closest to an explanation came from a Blue Cross and Blue Shield executive who testified the existing network of patient care is fine and had been approved by the Texas Department of Insurance.  In 1992, he said he thought the two sides were close to finalizing an agreement to be included in a newly minted PPO insurance network when an executive at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas walked in and said there would be no deal, Ellis recalls.  ETMC is included in Blue Cross and Blue Shield's health maintenance network offered by some employers and on the federal exchange mandated by the Affordable Care Act.  Last year, not long after the lawsuit was filed, two of the nation's leading credit rating firms, Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings, downgraded ETMC's rating and assigned a negative outlook.  The hospital's marketing department bought billboards around town, printed fliers and took out an ad in the local newspaper announcing the news.  The appellate court sided with the insurer and lifted the injunction, saying the hospital did not prove it was in immediate financial danger.  Hospital officials are hopeful the insurer will cover any treatment as everyone waits for trial.", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-6886833"}, "author.name": "By Jenny Deam", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "TYLER - In this place of tall pines and fried catfish, where the Texas twang rolls sweet and slow, a hometown hospital took a swing at three of the nation's largest insurers.
