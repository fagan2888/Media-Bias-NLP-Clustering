When the U.S. beat England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, an epic upset, only one U.S. newspaper had a man there. And he paid his own way.\n\nWhen the U.S. beat Trinidad and Tobago 1-0 on a Paul Caligiuri goal to qualify for the 1990 World Cup \u2014 the first time the U.S. made it back to the tournament since the miracle in 1950 \u2014 hardly anyone noticed. A young defender at San Diego State did, though. Caligiuri\u2019s goal made it possible for Marcelo Balboa to play in the first of his three World Cups.\n\n\u201cCaligiuri hits that goal, we qualify, you see, \u2018U.S. qualified for the first World Cup in 40 years,\u2019 and it was like the littlest thing,\u201d Balboa recalls. \u201cNow, when we qualify it\u2019s like a party everywhere.\u201d\n\nBalboa, a hard-nosed defender who played for the Rapids from 1996-2001 and made 128 appearances for the U.S. national team, played in the World Cup in 1990, 1994 and 1998. He covered it as a broadcaster in 2006 and 2010, and he will be in Brazil covering this one for Univision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that people care,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cNow you put on a TV and you can watch soccer at any time of the day, from any part of the world, something I never thought would happen when I was alive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s great for America\u2019s growing legion of soccer fans, but it puts more pressure on Team USA.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of pressure, we weren\u2019t expected to qualify for \u201990,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cThe pressure was on ourselves because we wanted to qualify, but nobody else really followed us. Now it\u2019s, \u2018We should qualify.\u2019 The pressure now is, \u2018We should get out of the group,\u2019 and if we don\u2019t, the fans get upset. That passion is here finally. That\u2019s what we want.\u201d\n\nIt figures to be a mighty challenge for the U.S. to advance out of group play to the round of 16 this time. In its \u201cGroup of Death\u201d are Germany (ranked second in the world), Portugal (fourth) and Ghana, which eliminated the U.S. from the past two World Cups.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that they\u2019ve got Germany last,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cWe all know what Ghana\u2019s got. They\u2019re quick, they\u2019re fast, they move the ball around well. I still think, looking at the U.S., how organized they are and how they can play, they have a shot. We\u2019ve got to get over that hill eventually of beating Ghana.\u201d\n\nThere are major questions about Team USA. Will it wilt in Brazil\u2019s oppressive heat and humidity, or will the conditions actually be an advantage for a U.S. team known for superior fitness? Will a back line that has been unsettled come together in front of stalwart goalkeeper Tim Howard? And will coach Jurgen Klinsmann be vindicated or excoriated for leaving Landon Donovan off the team?\n\n\u201cIt surprised me,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cWhen you talk about soccer over the last 10 years in the United States, you talk Landon Donovan. To say Landon\u2019s not one of the best 23 players in the United States is kind of weird. But we\u2019re not there in camp, we don\u2019t know the dynamics of what\u2019s going on in camp, and when you build a team you\u2019ve got to have great dynamics.\n\n\u201cDid Jurgen take it personally that Landon left on a sabbatical right in the middle of World Cup qualifying? That\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nKlinsmann was a striker on the West German team that won the 1990 World Cup, and he coached Germany to a third-place finish in 2006. He took over as U.S. head coach in 2011.\n\nLeaving Donovan off this squad, Klinsmann opened himself to even more criticism by putting 18-year-old Julian Green on the roster. Green, a winger who was born in Florida, moved to Germany at age 2 and plays for the second team of European power Bayern Munich. He has dual citizenship and weighed playing for Germany in the future versus playing for the U.S. now. He chose the U.S., but he never played for the U.S. until a friendly against Mexico on April 2.\n\nHe\u2019s a gifted young player, perhaps even a future superstar. But did Klinsmann leave Donovan at home to give Green seasoning for future World Cups? Is this World Cup about preparing the next generation of U.S. players? Seven of the 23 players on the roster are under 25.\n\n\u201cThere is one young man everybody is waiting to see, and that\u2019s Julian Green,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cEverybody is talking about, was it Julian Green or Landon Donovan? I want to see what this kid\u2019s got. I\u2019m curious to see what he can do at that level.\u201d\n\nEverybody knows who the heavyweight teams are: Spain, Germany, Portugal, Argentina and host Brazil. Everybody knows who the best players figure to be: Lionel Messi (Argentina and FC Barcelona), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal and Real Madrid) and Neymar (Brazil and Barcelona). Neymar, only 22, led Brazil to the Confederations Cup title last year with a victory over Spain in the final and was named the tournament\u2019s outstanding player.\n\nBrazil has the pressure of being favored at home, but that may bring the best out of them.\n\n\u201cThey love pressure,\u201d Balboa said. \u201cWith the Brazilians, you\u2019ve got to perform every game, and you\u2019ve got to make it look good. They\u2019ve got to dance, they\u2019ve got to samba, they\u2019ve got to play. They need to entertain.\n\n\u201cYou can see that smile, alegria (joy) we call it. They\u2019re dancing, playing with confidence. That\u2019s what people want to see. That\u2019s what people expect this World Cup. It\u2019s the happiness, the joy soccer brings to people. That\u2019s what the Brazilians are going to be doing on the street, and that\u2019s what they expect them to do on the field.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "World Cup expectations climb high for U.S. men in last quarter century", "title": "World Cup expectations climb high for U.S. men in last quarter century", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/06/world-cup-expectations-climb-high-for-u-s-men-in-last-quarter-century/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__soccer-balboa-060614p1.jpg", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__soccer-balboa-060614p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-06T16:24:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:25:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e58\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDid Jurgen take it personally that Landon left on a sabbatical right in the middle of World Cup qualifying?\nWhen the U.S. beat England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, an epic upset, only one U.S. newspaper had a man there.\nqualified for the first World Cup in 40 years,\u2019 and it was like the littlest thing,\u201d Balboa recalls.\nCOMMERCE CITY \u2014 On those rare occasions the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team has made history, it has often done so in virtual secrecy.\nIs this World Cup about preparing the next generation of U.S. players?"}
