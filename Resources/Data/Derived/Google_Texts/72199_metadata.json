(WKRN) \u2014 The deadline has come and gone to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period.\n\nThe last day to sign up was on Sunday.\n\nThose who remain uninsured will be fined.\n\nPurchasing health insurance is now the law. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll pay a penalty, and this year those who don\u2019t enroll will have to cough up more cash than last year.\n\nIn 2015, the fine was $325 per person.\n\nIn 2016, the minimum penalty is $695 or 2.5 percent of your taxable income.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay the fee when you file your federal income tax.\n\nAt the Matthew Walker Comprehensive Health Center, employees have been busy for the past several weeks helping Middle Tennesseans sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe first thing people want to know is, can you tell me how much it will cost? We can\u2019t tell you how much it will cost right away because every situation is different,\u201d said Community Outreach Coordinator Julie Morris.\n\nDepending on your situation, purchasing insurance could cost you very little.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people that it helps and when they receive that tax credit, it has brought many down to less than a hundred dollars a month. I\u2019ve even signed up somebody and it came up to $25 a month,\u201d said Morris.\n\nMorris says she\u2019s met with a few people who said they\u2019d rather pay the fine than sign up.\n\n\u201cWe encourage them that if they can afford it, please go ahead and pick an insurance because if you get hit by a bus tomorrow guess what, you have to pay out of pocket and those are expenses that most people can\u2019t afford,\u201d said Morris.\n\nEven though the deadline has passed, it doesn\u2019t mean the federal exchange is closing.\n\nA special enrollment period is offered to people who experience life changes through the year like getting married, having a baby or losing a job..\n\nSo far, 11.6 million people have signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The penalty for not having health insurance is going up this year as purchasing health coverage is now the law.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=523213092", "og": {"site_name": "WKRN.com", "description": "The penalty for not having health insurance is going up this year as purchasing health coverage is now the law.", "title": "Fines going up this year for anyone without health insurance", "url": "http://wkrn.com/2016/02/01/fines-going-up-for-anyone-without-health-coverage-this-year/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/still0201_000033.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The penalty for not having health insurance is going up this year as purchasing health coverage is now the law.", "title": "Fines going up this year for anyone without health insurance", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/still0201_000033.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WKRN", "site": "wkrn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Nashville's News 2", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wkrn", "fb": {"pages": 121386074555790}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkrn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/90919f996ff323fc31b4cb1f4b7e825e?s=16", "application-name": "WKRN.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wkrntv", "published_time": "2016-02-01T21:12:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:03+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "G2WXEm6QW1PkffhJXpGnD-Yn9z2aSfnZHNVXc1bnnRo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: WKRN)NASHVILLE, Tenn.
