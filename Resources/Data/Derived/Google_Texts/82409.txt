WHAT’S NEXT? Yahoo is preparing to discuss the future of its core Internet business and its stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. “Yahoo’s management has faltered in its efforts to turn around its core business and it faces investor pressure to take more dramatic moves, though the people familiar with the plans say no transaction is assured,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “If Yahoo decides to sell its core Internet business, it could put into motion a deal for the Alibaba stake as well as its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan. One possible scenario could see a U.S. media company or private-equity firm team up with a buyer interested in the Alibaba stake, potentially Alibaba itself.”

NEW PLATFORM ALERT: Hillary Clinton is using a new online platform — Quora — to share her views with voters. “The former secretary of state and U.S. senator held forth today on the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare), what could be done to make prescription drugs less expensive and the ramifications of defunding Planned Parenthood,” Re/code reports. “Clinton is the first of the 2016 presidential candidates to use Quora, a popular online forum devoted to ‘democratizing knowledge.’ It’s a place where anyone can pose questions and tap into the broader community for answers.”
