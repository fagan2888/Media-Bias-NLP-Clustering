D.J. Swearinger talks too much. He is too cocky. His confidence doesn’t match his resume. All were among the Broncos’ complaints about the Houston Texans’ loquacious defensive back last week.

When it comes to assessing fines, the NFL doesn’t calculate popularity. Swearinger was not fined for the hit that left Wes Welker concussed last Saturday, an NFL source told the Post. Peyton Manning was docked $8,268 — his first league fine — for taunting Swearinger after completing a touchdown pass.

Texans coach Bill O’Brien and Swearinger both felt the defensive back did not merit additional discipline. He was penalized 15 yards for unnecessary roughness for a shoulder/forearm shiver hit into a ducking Welker after the receiver caught a 9-yard pass in the second quarter.

Welker exited with his third concussion in 10 months, and while he’s jogging and running routes, he has not been cleared to participate in a game. Swearinger’s actions during last week’s joint practices and smashing hit on Welker shoved Manning over the edge.

The next play after Welker’s catch, Manning lofted a touchdown pass to a diving Emmanuel Sanders. Rather than greet Sanders, Manning confronted Swearinger and cursed at him.

“I made a Hall of Famer mad,” Swearinger said.
