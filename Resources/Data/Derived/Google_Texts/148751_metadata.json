More than nine months after it was awarded, the Xerox accord is awaiting approval from Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.\n\nXerox will have as long as 18 months to build the new operating system, which will help New York\u2019s $52 billion Medicaid program shift to a managed-care approach, according to the request for proposals. New York is making the change in the health-care program for the poor to align with the goals of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe new system is expected to be more quickly and easily configurable to state and federal policy changes,\u201d Hammond said. Meanwhile, the state is working with CSC to implement the managed-care expansion, he said.\n\nCarol Meyers, a spokeswoman for Falls Church, Virginia-based CSC, said the state requested a 13-month extension, which the company is willing to do. Hammond declined to comment further.\n\nJeff Baum, a spokesman for Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox, declined to comment. Kate Gurnett, a spokeswoman for DiNapoli, said the office doesn\u2019t discuss contracts under review.\n\nProtests Filed\n\nDiNapoli received the Xerox accord in December after it was approved by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Both CSC, which didn\u2019t bid on the new deal, and Hewlett-Packard Co., which did, have filed protests against the agreement with Xerox. In its protest, CSC said it didn\u2019t believe the new Medicaid program could be implemented in 18 months.\n\nCSC was 33 months late when it finished the current eMedNY system in 2005 and 47 percent over budget, according to a 2010 report by DiNapoli. It\u2019s been cited for losing more than $500 million through fraud, waste and abuse, in audits by the comptroller and the attorney general.\n\nSince 2000, CSC has received almost $1.2 billion on its contract with New York, according to state records. The contract was last extended in February 2014 for about $211 million and expires in February 2016, records show.\n\nLast year, Texas canceled its Medicaid contract with Xerox, citing funds lost to fraud. Xerox was five years late implementing a contract in New Hampshire, and the California state auditor warned of delays there in a report last month.\n\nThe New York contract will be different, in part because the company has already started hiring its team and is working with state officials, Ursula Burns, Xerox\u2019s chief executive officer, told investors in a November conference call.\n\nThe company wants \u201cto make sure that when we sign, when we actually start the project, that we are ahead of the game,\u201d Burns said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Freeman Klopott", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/n-y-seeks-medicaid-contract-extension-with-computer-sciences", "title": "N.Y.
