These inputs will be incorporated into the final plan for the area. In the McCaslin area, the blighting effect on the whole area of the mostly empty Sam's Club building is the major issue. Having a retail tenant occupy that building would have a major positive impact on city revenues. We recently created an urban renewal plan for the property to try and help eliminate this blighting effect. Other parts of the McCaslin plan are still in the process of obtaining input from residents and businesses and we'll develop the plan based on those inputs.\n\nWhat practical steps can Louisville take to balance its continuing growth and small town character?\n\nOur community events are a major part of what makes Louisville unique. I believe these need to be maintained while limiting impact on the surrounding neighborhood as best we can. We need to continue working on open space acquisitions and trail connections to maintain our great access to the outdoors. Fortunately, we have a great group of residents whose outreach to their neighbors and engagement in their community is, in fact, the most important aspect of our small town.\n\nShould the city step in as a host or sponsor for the Louisville Street Faire?\n\nI believe we can work out a public private partnership between the city and the DBA to maintain the Street Faire. These would involve a clear understanding of the sharing of revenues from the Faire and who will be responsible for different aspects of the event.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948281/bob-muckle-louisville-mayor", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28948281:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T17:44:57-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Bob Muckle", "title": "Bob Muckle: Louisville Mayor", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948281/bob-muckle-louisville-mayor", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1009/20151009__11DCXVMUC~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T17:45:05-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T18:42:34-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T17:46:52-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T17:44:57-0600", "sailthru.title": "Bob Muckle: Louisville Mayor", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "Bob Muckle", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948281/bob-muckle-louisville-mayor", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Bob Muckle", "title": "Bob Muckle: Louisville Mayor"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1009/20151009__11DCXVMUC~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Bob MuckleWebsite: www.facebook.com/Bob-Muckle-For-Mayor-295786093771124/timelineAge: 55Family: Wife, Melanie, and daughters Jessie and AlexHow long have you lived in Louisville?\n18 yearsProfessional background: PhysicianPolitical/community experience: Mayor of Louisville for four years, council member Ward 1 for six years and I was on the Open Space Board.\nIn the McCaslin area, the blighting effect on the whole area of the mostly empty Sam's Club building is the major issue.\nOther parts of the McCaslin plan are still in the process of obtaining input from residents and businesses and we'll develop the plan based on those inputs.\nOur community events are a major part of what makes Louisville unique."}
