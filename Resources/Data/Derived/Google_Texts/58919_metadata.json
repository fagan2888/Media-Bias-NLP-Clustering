Without a cloud in the sky on a sunny Sunday afternoon, it nevertheless stormed at Coors Field.\n\nHome runs fell like rain. The San Diego Padres blasted four homers in four innings against Kendrick. The Rockies pitcher allowed six hits through 12 outs \u2014 and 66 percent of them were homers.\n\nThe Padres then breezed by the Rockies for a 10-4 victory, avoiding a series sweep. Colorado was trying to win every game in a series for the first time since July, when the Atlanta Braves were swept in Denver.\n\n\u201cBall was in the air a lot,\u201d said Rockies manager Walt Weiss. \u201cToday wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d\n\nKendrick retook the major-league lead in home runs allowed with 32 this season, passing the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 Rubby De La Rosa and Chicago Cubs\u2019 Dan Haren. But Kendrick has pitched about 50 fewer innings than those two. His ratio is troubling.\n\nIn consecutive road starts, at San Diego and Seattle, Kendrick won twice, allowing five runs in total over 10 innings. It was the first time he won consecutive games since signing a one-year, $5.5 million contract with Colorado in January.\n\nHis return to Coors Field went south. He faced 18 batters on 65 pitches and nine reached base.\n\n\u201cHe got several pitches elevated,\u201d Weiss said.\n\n\u201cBig Game\u201d James Shields countered for San Diego with little trouble. He retired 19-of-21 batters from the first to the seventh inning.\n\nCharlie Blackmon\u2019s leadoff home run in the first inning signaled an incoming home run derby. But the Rockies didn\u2019t follow through. Only Corey Dickerson and Kendrick reached base before the seventh, on walks.\n\nShields reversed a pattern of trouble against the Rockies this season. He entered having pitched 22 innings against Colorado, with a 5.24 ERA and a 1.84 WHIP \u2014 well above his season averages.\n\nBut he was 3-0 against the Rockies in four starts. He\u2019s now 4-0 after striking out eight Sunday in 6 innings. He allowed just two hits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve swung the bats pretty well against him, but not today,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nJustin Morneau\u2019s double in the seventh was the first hit off Shields since Blackmon\u2019s homer. Shields then walked Daniel Descalso and Dustin Garneau, and Morneau scored on a wild pitch. Shields was relieved.\n\nBut between Blackmon\u2019s homer and Morneau\u2019s double, the Padres went wild. They scored in each of the first six innings \u2014 matching a franchise record for the first time since 1990.\n\nSolarte\u2019s first-inning homer scored two runs. Then Matt Kemp and Jedd Gyorko hit solo shots in the third. And Cory Spangenberg homered to lead off the fourth. They homered to right field, left field and center field.\n\nThe Rockies found some life in the seventh as the Padres lost focus. Shields threw two wild pitches and Bud Norris tossed another. Descalso and Garneau added runs after Morneau. But the Rockies still trailed by six.\n\nSan Diego finished with 15 hits off four Colorado pitchers. The Rockies, who struck out six times in the eighth and ninth, had just four hits in the game.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nLooking ahead\n\nPirates\u2019 A.J. Burnett (8-5, 3.15 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-1, 5.00), 6:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nGray is on an innings- limited path that should carry him through to the end of the season. The rookie recently tweaked his delivery to eliminate most of his windup. His preamble is now an abbreviated step and turn \u2014 just a little more action than he uses from the stretch. In his previous start, Gray nearly matched wits with Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. Gray called it \u201cthe biggest stage I have ever been on.\u201d But after entering with a major league- record seven no-decisions to start his career, Gray was tagged with a loss.\n\nTuesday: Pirates\u2019 J.A.
