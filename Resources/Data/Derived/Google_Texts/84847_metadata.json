Referring to administrative officials, she added, \u201cI wonder if it were their child living in the murder capital of the world, whether they would have more sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe Times writes:\n\nThe Central American Minors program also allows the Department of Homeland Security to grant a two-year temporary entry into the United States for children who do not qualify as refugees. Those immigrants must apply to renew their entry status every two years and are not eligible to pursue American citizenship.\n\nObama announced his plan in response to the groundswell of young refugees making the dangerous and often-deadly trek across the U.S. border in massive numbers last year. But as immigration and human rights experts noted at the time, the program\u2019s heartening promises of assisting vulnerable children did nothing to address sluggish bureaucratic roadblocks and ignored the U.S.\u2019s own role in fueling the refugee crisis.\n\nAs Ivy Suriyopas, co-chair of the anti-trafficking group Freedom Network, explained in an op-ed last year:\n\n[A]lthough the number of unaccompanied minors dropped in August, the 4,000 slots allocated for refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean for fiscal year 2015 is grossly insufficient. In June alone, more than 10,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the U.S. border and in the ten months since October 2013, nearly 63,000 children have been identified at the border.\n\nWith so few spots and so many refugees, the Times wrote on Thursday, it\u2019s little wonder the program has failed so completely.\n\n\u201cWe need to fix the program so that it works and so that children have a real opportunity to get protection,\u201d said Kevin Appleby, the director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cThey have to make the program workable. Right now, it\u2019s not workable.\u201d\n\nState Department officials defended the delays, saying it was important to move slowly to avoid making mistakes. And principal deputy assistant secretary of state Simon Henshaw said the department was preparing to interview more than 400 children next month.\n\nBut that means little to children who are stuck in a violent limbo while their applications wait for processing.\n\n\u201cThey have set up an elaborate, bureaucratic, step-by-step system,\u201d said Lim\u00f3n. \u201cThe children are in danger, and they can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s just sad, and, I think, indefensible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "US Program To Save Child Refugees Has Welcomed This Many: Zero", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Nadia Prupis | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "US Program To Save Child Refugees Has Welcomed This Many: Zero", "title": "US Program To Save Child Refugees Has Welcomed This Many: Zero", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/us-program-to-save-child-refugees-has-welcomed-this-many-zero/211081/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Immigration-Overload-_Muha2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-13T15:08:33-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US Program To Save Child Refugees Has Welcomed This Many: Zero", "title": "US Program To Save Child Refugees Has Welcomed This Many: Zero", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Immigration-Overload-_Muha2.jpg", "creator": "@nadiaprupis", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "refugees", "published_time": "2015-11-14T05:00:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T15:08:33-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "With so few spots and so many refugees, the Times wrote on Thursday, it\u2019s little wonder the program has failed so completely.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\u201cReally, it\u2019s pathetic that no child has come through this program,\u201d Lavinia Lim\u00f3n, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants nonprofit, told the Times.\nA year after President Barack Obama launched a program to grant asylum to Central American children fleeing violence or seeking to reunite with family members, the statistics are in: not one child has made it to the U.S. through that initiative.\nThose immigrants must apply to renew their entry status every two years and are not eligible to pursue American citizenship.\nObama announced his plan in response to the groundswell of young refugees making the dangerous and often-deadly trek across the U.S. border in massive numbers last year."}
