What we lack in entertainment value \u2014 it would be hard to beat our southern neighbor, where Representative Mark Sanford recently broke up with the Argentine \u201csoul mate\u201d he\u2019d had an extramarital affair with while he was governor \u2014 we make up for in unpredictability.\n\nWe\u2019re a state that likes to change its mind (Obama 2008, Romney 2012, each time by a squeaker). Nearly two years ago, voters amended the State Constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage. Yet on Monday, joyful gay couples thronged the county register\u2019s office here to get marriage licenses, after a federal judge in Asheville found the ban unconstitutional.\n\nThis year, North Carolina has a dubious distinction: No other state has been flooded so much by outside money for political ads this election cycle. Our first-term Democratic senator, Kay Hagan, is being challenged by Thom Tillis, speaker of the majority-Republican State House. Control of the United States Senate could hang in the balance.\n\nFor those who have turned down the volume or changed the channel, here\u2019s a capsule summary of the TV broadsides: Ominous music. Unflattering black-and-white images of an opponent determined to ruin life in this New South paradise. Cozy conversations in which the candidate quietly admonishes the other side for \u201cdistorting my record.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish they would campaign somewhere else,\u201d Iotha Parker told me recently, as she perused the gift shop at the Levine Museum of the New South here, where a permanent exhibition is called \u201cCotton Fields to Skyscrapers.\u201d Ms. Parker, whom the state honored several years ago for her 49-year teaching career, is registered as an independent. I got the feeling she might vote for the candidate who ran fewer annoying ads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the early 1960s, Thereasea Elder was one of the first black nurses to treat white patients here in Mecklenburg County, providing care in homes festooned with Confederate flags. \u201cThe Republicans are so far away from everybody, except the superrich,\u201d Mrs. Elder, 87, told me. \u201cThey need to read and study their Bible.\u201d\n\nIn uptown Charlotte, what most places would call downtown, I talked with a 29-year-old Mexican immigrant, Alberto Rosales, who recently moved here for a tech consulting job at Wells Fargo. His education at the University of California, Berkeley, \u201cpretty much changed my life,\u201d he told me, explaining that he was a Democrat who agreed with the party\u2019s support for public schools.\n\nCharlotte, the largest city, the \u201cresearch triangle\u201d cities (and college towns) of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, and cities like Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Asheville are turning more blue than red, partly from an infusion of new workers in finance, health care, technology and education. But the state as a whole is more of a tossup.\n\nLast year, Republicans took control of the governor\u2019s mansion and increased their majorities in both chambers of the Legislature, giving them total control of state government in Raleigh for the first time in over a century. The new governor, Pat McCrory, thought to be a moderate when he was Charlotte\u2019s mayor, helped lead a sharp turn to the right. He signed laws that slashed unemployment benefits; opted out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion; toughened voting requirements; made it harder for abortion clinics to operate; and repealed a law that allowed death row inmates to have their sentences converted to life in prison without parole if they could prove racial bias in their cases.\n\nThe resulting backlash \u2014 a series of weekly sit-in protests known as \u201cMoral Mondays\u201d \u2014 has given pause even to Republicans such as Sally Dalton Robinson, whose family has been central to the life of Charlotte and the state. Her husband, Russell, was a founder of one of the state\u2019s largest law firms; his grandfather was the principal author of the state\u2019s 1868 Constitution.\n\n\u201cRuss and I see so much the same way,\u201d said Mrs. Robinson, who is 80. \u201cOur whole voting lives, we\u2019ve been registered Republicans, and we don\u2019t intend to change.\u201d Her husband\u2019s great-grandfather came over to Goldsboro, N.C., from Ireland before the Civil War and was a Republican when that meant opposing secession and slavery, supporting President Abraham Lincoln, and being at dangerous odds with their neighbors, who were overwhelmingly white Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat we feel is that the Republican Party we have voted for and supported most of our married life has really gone off and left us \u2014 that\u2019s sad to us,\u201d Mrs. Robinson said. \u201cA lot of that \u2014 not all \u2014 is social issues. I\u2019m very opposed to what Republicans in this state have done in terms of abortion, making it harder. I\u2019m opposed to putting into the Constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman. I think it\u2019s very detrimental that we\u2019ve cut back on the days that we have for early voting. That makes it harder for folks to get to the polls. I think it\u2019s sad that students can no longer vote on their own college campuses.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI grew up in a city that was very segregated, and I did not question that as a child. When I would get on the bus as an 8-year-old to go to town, the African-Americans were seated at the back and I was seated at the front. I didn\u2019t question it. It\u2019s hard for me to take that in about myself, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina, like Sally Dalton Robinson, has changed. Still, in 2014, it\u2019s a state that is still weighing what it wants to be now and will be in the future. This midterm election could give us, and the rest of the nation, a clue.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141014174949, "twitter": {"description": "Outside spending is pouring into the Senate race in North Carolina.", "title": "It\u2019s Never Boring in North Carolina", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/opinion/its-never-boring-in-north-carolina.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003176022"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/opinion/its-never-boring-in-north-carolina.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003176022", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/opinion/its-never-boring-in-north-carolina.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "It\u2019s Never Boring in North Carolina", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 14, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "North Carolina,Hagan  Kay R,Tillis  Thomas R,Midterm Elections (2014),United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Sanford  Mark,Elections  Senate,Political Advertising,Democratic Party", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Mary C.
