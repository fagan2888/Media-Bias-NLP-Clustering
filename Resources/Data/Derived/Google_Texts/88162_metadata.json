Chris Collins of Clarence and Rep. Tom Reed of Corning said in response to questioning that it was a mistake for House Republicans to tie the funding of government to defunding of Obamacare \u2013 a strategy that they and the GOP leadership had agreed to under pressure from tea party forces.\n\nCollins, in an interview, blamed the failed strategy on Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who goaded several dozen ultra-conservative lawmakers in the House to pursue the shutdown strategy.\n\n\u201cI think Sen. Cruz has done a disservice to the Republican Party,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe is an extremist, and he\u2019s the one that had the rallying cry of repeal Obamacare, defund Obamacare, delay Obamacare.\u201d\n\nReed, on a conference call with reporters on Thursday, dodged a question about who was responsible for the House strategy \u2013 which could have succeeded only if President Obama and the Democratic Senate agreed to gut the health care law, Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment. \u201cIt was a poor strategy,\u201d Reed acknowledged.\n\nThat\u2019s become conventional wisdom in the nation\u2019s capital, given the shape of the final bill that ended the shutdown and averted the default. That bill funds the government at current levels through Jan. 15 and extends the debt ceiling until Feb. 7 while creating a House-Senate conference committee to resolve longer-term budget issues.\n\nThe bill meets none of the demands House Republicans spelled out as the debate evolved. It doesn\u2019t defund or delay Obamacare. It doesn\u2019t even end the health insurance subsidies that lawmakers and their staffs get under Obamacare \u2013 which Reed decried as \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d\n\nDespite those facts, every House Republican from New York except Collins and Reed voted for the bill.\n\nThe local congressmen likened the bipartisan agreement to \u201ckicking the can down the road,\u201d and said they could not support it because it does not include long-term budget reforms.\n\nStill, both of them sharply criticized the strategy that started the shutdown in the first place. \u201cShutting down the government over Obamacare was obviously a mistake,\u201d Collins said. Without the shutdown, \u201cwe would have been talking about the failure of Obamacare in starting up on Oct. 1, proving the point it was not ready for prime time. Instead, the shutdown overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nAs early as mid-September, Collins voiced concern about tying the defunding of Obamacare to the must-pass continuing resolution to fund the government in the new fiscal year that started Oct. 1. Instead, he said at the time, the House would be better off focusing its energies on the Oct. 17 expiration of the debt ceiling.\n\nNevertheless, Collins voted for the GOP legislation that tied the funding of government to the defunding of Obamacare, and a follow-up bill to delay the health reforms for a year.\n\nAsked why, Collins said: \u201cBecause ultimately that was the bill that was put forward to vote on. And you can\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good \u2026. There will be things you don\u2019t like but in this case it was a bill to keep the government open. We needed to keep the government open. There was not another bill.\u201d\n\nCollins blamed that fact on Cruz and his acolytes, who pushed the shutdown showdown over the objections of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other House GOP leaders.\n\n\u201cI think Ted Cruz and that extremist group, which is focused on something that can\u2019t be done as long as this president is in office, has distracted us from moving forward and working on deficit, entitlements, tax reform and immigration reform,\u201d Collins said.\n\nWhile a very small handful of Republicans such as Rep. Pete King, R-Seaford, have been saying such things for weeks, Collins\u2019 comments on Cruz also echo those of frustrated Democrats such as Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo.\n\n\u201cThis is not an indictment of all congressional Republicans,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThe vast majority have been reasonable and have tried to avert this situation. But there is a radical fringe in the conference that is disproportionately influencing this process. And it\u2019s got to stop.\u201d\n\nReed agreed that the shutdown strategy didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cI think the initial strategy of defunding Obamacare that started us down this path, to me, was something that clearly was unachievable, and you\u2019ve seen some folks recognize that,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI question the strategy that was deployed because you\u2019re essentially telling the people that you\u2019re going to do something that you know you cannot do, given the facts at hand.\u201d\n\nAsked why he voted for it in the beginning, Reed said: \u201cI did not agree with that strategy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that soon after the shutdown began, he suggested a compromise to end it: a short-term spending bill that, instead of defunding or delaying Obamacare, instead just ended the provision giving lawmakers and their staffers health insurance subsidies under the law.\n\nMartha Robertson, the Democratic chairman of the Tompkins County Legislature who is challenging Reed in the 2014 election, doesn\u2019t think much of Reed\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cAlthough Congressman Reed tries to pose as a moderate while in New York, his actions tell a different story,\u201d she said. \u201cHis obstructionism in the face of this crisis is reckless and irresponsible, and shows his willingness to put the extreme ideology of the tea party ahead of the U.S. economy and his constituents.\u201d\n\nReed, who attended tea party rallies during his first race for Congress in 2010, steered clear of the tea party label on Wednesday. Instead he stressed that he\u2019s now part of \u201cNo Labels,\u201d a bipartisan coalition aimed at problem-solving rather than opponent-bashing.\n\nYet unlike Collins, Reed refused to blame Cruz and his followers for the shutdown crisis.\n\n\u201cAs to who\u2019s responsible for it, I\u2019ll let the political experts be the deciders of that,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut ultimately, let the people be the deciders of how this all went down.\u201d\n\nReed surely wants to help the people decide. Shortly after the end of his call with reporters, Reed\u2019s campaign sent out a letter to his supporters.\n\n\u201cOur nation faces monumental challenges, and we cannot continue kicking the can down the road,\u201d Reed wrote. \u201cWith the next crisis looming in just three months, I am working tirelessly to craft long-term solutions to our challenges, but I need your help. Will you please donate $25, $100 or $250 to my campaign today so we can end the uncontrolled spending in Washington?\u201d\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Both of Western New York\u2019s Republican congressmen find themselves backpedaling furiously from the tea party strategy they supported that led the nation to a 16-day government shutdown as well as the brink of default.Both Rep.
