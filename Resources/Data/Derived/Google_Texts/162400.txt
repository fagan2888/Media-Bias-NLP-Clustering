New Mexico authorities advise that Interstate 40 is closed indefinitely in the eastern part of that state, between Albuquerque and the Texas line, and are urging eastbound travelers through New Mexico to use Interstate 10 instead.

Because of a severe winter storm in New Mexico over the weekend, drivers traveling east from Arizona should check road conditions via NMRoads.com or New Mexico State Police at www.nmsp.dps.state.nm.us. Many other routes were closed in the eastern part of the state as of Sunday night.

No highways in Arizona are closed as a result of the New Mexico storm.
