Mercy Learning Center hosted its annual “A View of the Harbor” fund-raising event at the Country Club of Fairfield on Oct. 6, during which Lea Sylvestro, a long-time volunteer tutor, and Brenda, a GED graduate, gave a presentation to more than 200 guests.

Each of you here tonight plays an important role in the lives of these women,” Sylvestro said.

“Because of Mercy Learning Center, I now have a GED and am in college starting my own business,” Brenda said. “The impact the center has had on my life is so important to me and my family.”

A live auction with cocktails and hors d’oeuvres followed the presentation.

Mercy Learning Center focuses on educating and empowering low-income, undereducated women from the greater Bridgeport area. Its goal is to raise each woman’s educational functioning level and prepare them to earn a GED or high school diploma, enter college and secure sustainable employment.

Last year, the center served 770 woman and 143 of its children, bringing the 25 year total to 8,000 women served in the Bridgeport community.
