It wasn\u2019t worth it to fly all the way home to North Dakota for the long weekend, so a group of us went to a dorm-mate\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Connecticut. As much as I still appreciate the family for welcoming me into their lovely home and feeding me copious amounts of expensive food, I have to say that the number of times they felt the need to point out my race to the other guests was... uncomfortable. For me, at least. But hey, I guess it was my first Thanksgiving with a bunch of Whites too, so that was pretty neat. (Long Live the Pilgrims! But where are their fancy bonnets?)\n\nAnyway, the point of this anecdote is to share an example of subtly inappropriate language. I was offended for being made a novelty at the Thanksgiving dinner table, but I was also annoyed by the choice of grammar within the offensive jest. You see, instead of choosing to describe me as a human or person who could be further described as American Indian (\"This is Chelsey, and she is Indian\"), I was grouped\u2014human plus race\u2014into one noun or object with an indefinite article (\"This is Chelsey and she is an Indian.\" Sounds different, right?)\n\nFor the full effect, say it with a southern accent and a hint of fear in your voice, as if I\u2019m thrusting a spear toward your face. \u201cAhhhh! Look out! It\u2019s an Indian!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m suggesting that we should be careful about nuances in language when describing or discussing individuals of a certain ethnicity or racial background. It\u2019s relevant now, because in the past few months, the Redskins debate has brought a lot of media attention to Native peoples. And from both pro and anti-Indian voices, I see a lot of people\u2014obviously subconsciously\u2014doing the same thing that the Connecticut hosts did to me. Commenters on social media, bloggers, and even writers from legitimate publications are adding the unnecessary indefinite article and dehumanizing us even further: an Indian. What\u2019s the difference, and why does it matter?\n\nIt\u2019s a subtlety in language that has the power to evoke varying degrees of respect. The indefinite article (a or an) should of course be used freely when referring to objects - like a candy bar, a book, or an orangutan. But it shouldn\u2019t be used in front of an ethnicity, because it creates a demeaning connotation.\n\nFor example:\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cThis is my friend Daniella and she\u2019s a Jew.\u201d Instead I would say, \u201cThis is my friend Daniella, and she is Jewish.\u201d\n\nA tasteful writer wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cI spoke to a Mexican about the event,\u201d they would say, \u201cI spoke to a Mexican man about the event.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, I would say, \u201cThis is my friend Melanie, and she is White,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s a White person\u201d but never \u201cshe\u2019s a White.\u201d (Notice how I did it up there in paragraph one and it sounded disrespectful? Go back and look and tell me you don\u2019t disagree!)\n\nI should acknowledge that there are instances when placing an indefinite article in front of a nationality or other group is fine. For example, \u201cI\u2019m an American.\u201d That, I would say, is appropriate. No negative connotations whatsoever. You might even be able to think of even more exceptions. I can\u2019t right now. That said, I\u2019d just like to reiterate that while being called \u201can Indian\u201d is nothing that I\u2019m particularly outraged by, it is irritating because it\u2019s one of many ways that the public affords slightly less respect to Native peoples than to other races or ethnic groups. We deal with a host problems regarding objectification and misnomers, so if writers would be a little bit more careful, it would be much appreciated.\n\nRemember: I am Indian, but I am not an Indian.\n\nP.S. The other highlight of the weekend was the part when we were all hanging out in the guest house (these Whites and their innumerable properties\u2014they kill me!) and the father asked if I\u2019d like a drink. I said \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He replied, \u201cOh I forgot\u2026 you\u2019re never supposed to give an Indian whiskey!\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything, but I wish I had responded, \u201cAnd you, 65-year-old family man and self-declared, well-respected doctor and businessman, should remember that you are breaking both legal and moral codes by offering alcohol to a vulnerable group of 18-year-old co-eds under your care for the weekend.\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t think to do it.\n\nChelsey Luger is from the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe & Standing Rock Lakota Nation in North Dakota.
