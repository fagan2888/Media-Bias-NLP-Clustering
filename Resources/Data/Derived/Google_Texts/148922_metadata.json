Wellington has a century-old legacy of pioneering research and a reputation as one of the nation\u2019s top hospitals. Still, its financial performance has eroded significantly over the past five years. Its tertiary and quaternary market share has begun to shift to competitors. Anxiety about the future already has caused some key faculty members to accept positions elsewhere and, at all levels of the organization, employees are considering their options.\n\nThe deterioration in Wellington\u2019s financial status and market position recently precipitated a downgrade in its bond rating. Bondholders have become nervous. Investments in new facilities and recruitment have been put on hold. Full integration of Wellington\u2019s information systems remains unfinished. Leaders of the community hospitals, whose employed physicians represent major referral sources, have stopped attending Wellington\u2019s network affiliation meetings, and health insurers have become noticeably inflexible in their negotiations with the academic medical center.\n\nRelated: Kaiser Permanente Starts from Scratch with New Medical School\n\nThere is, of course, no Wellington University Medical Center. Unfortunately, the confluence of a number of forces reshaping the health care landscape could turn fiction into reality for many of America\u2019s academic medical centers. Already they face significant reductions in reimbursement from public and private sources as well as cuts to research and education. These reductions coincide with rising expenses related to increased consumer expectations, advancing technology and the need for qualified staffing.\n\nDifferentiation as Key to Competitive Advantage\n\nToday, rather than representing a besieged sector of health care, academic medical centers as a group continue to outpace community hospitals. They generally have higher margins and better bond ratings. They also continue to dominate the upper strata of U.S. News & World Report\u2019s list of best hospitals and tend to command the highest consumer-preference levels.\n\nDifferentiation is the essence of competitive strategy. It is only through meaningful differences that organizations create value. There are \u201ccore differentiators\u201d inherent to every academic medical center that help to account for their enviable performance. Taken together, these core differentiators generate and fortify a unique and powerful value proposition. Academic medical centers derive considerable benefits from four core differentiators, all of which arise from their unique tripartite mission that combines commitments to teaching, research and patient care:\n\nDepth and breadth of capability. Academic medical centers, because of the depth and breadth of their specialty capabilities as well as their commitments to research, are well-positioned as the preferred resources for complex care.\n\nMichael Treacy and Fred Wiersema in their book, The Discipline of Market Leaders, building on work by Harvard\u2019s Michael Porter, argue that there are essentially three megastrategies for winning in a competitive environment. You can win by offering customers the \u201cbest total solution,\u201d delivering a product at the \u201cbest total cost\u201d or offering what the market views as the \u201cbest product.\u201d The last alternative requires an organization that \u201ccontinually pushes its products into the realm of the unknown, untried or highly desirable \u2026 \u201d and \u201cstrives to provide its market with leading edge products or useful new applications of existing products or services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "McKinsey Health has projected that academic medical center operating margins will fall by 4 to 5 percent by 2019. Growing financial pressures may cause internal conflicts to break out at the interface between research, teaching and patient care as increasingly scarce resources must be allocated and trade-offs made. Some academic medical centers may find themselves compromised by disagreements between leaders of their hospital, medical school and faculty practice plan. And academic medical centers may, because of their high levels of specialization, become even more vulnerable . . .", "csrf-token": "NEoTx5/ugLa6WU8ceLTBeE/Rds0hieBMiOrIz3otviA=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/b/Beckham_190x127.jpg?1459957633", "description": "Success for academic medical centers will require embracing the characteristics that make them unique and the advantages those characteristics can yield.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "How Academic Medical Centers Can Sustain Competitive Advantages"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/b/Beckham_190x127.jpg?1459957633", "type": "Article", "description": "Success for academic medical centers will require embracing the characteristics that make them unique and the advantages those characteristics can yield.&nbsp;", "title": "How Academic Medical Centers Can Sustain Competitive Advantages"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "academic,care,centers,health,hospitals,medical,strategy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, the confluence of a number of forces reshaping the health care landscape could turn fiction into reality for many of America\u2019s academic medical centers.\nDifferentiation as Key to Competitive AdvantageToday, rather than representing a besieged sector of health care, academic medical centers as a group continue to outpace community hospitals.\nThere are \u201ccore differentiators\u201d inherent to every academic medical center that help to account for their enviable performance.\nAcademic medical centers, because of the depth and breadth of their specialty capabilities as well as their commitments to research, are well-positioned as the preferred resources for complex care.\nAcademic medical centers derive considerable benefits from four core differentiators, all of which arise from their unique tripartite mission that combines commitments to teaching, research and patient care:Depth and breadth of capability."}
