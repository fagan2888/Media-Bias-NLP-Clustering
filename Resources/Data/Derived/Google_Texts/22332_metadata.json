Attendance was the second- highest in the stock show\u2019s 109-year history.\n\nThe last day featured the professional rodeo finals along with the cutest rodeo in the West. Young buckaroos were given old-fashioned stick horses and scored on their wild, pretend rides.\n\nZoe left the event with a blue ribbon and a hearty smile. \u201cShe said she was having the best day of her life,\u201d said Matt Clawser, Zoe\u2019s father.\n\nThe Clawser family recently moved to Highlands Ranch from South Carolina. Matt said he brought Zoe to the stock show to give her a taste of life in the West.\n\nShannon Stewart, the 12-year-old Jefferson County Fair and Rodeo Junior Princess of 2015, said celebrating Western life is what the stock show is all about. She was helping out at stock show events in her tiara-adorned cowboy hat. \u201cI just love the whole scene of rodeos,\u201d said Stewart, of Evergreen. \u201cI love horses, I love the events, the people and preserving the Western way of life.\u201d\n\nBack in the Coliseum where the rodeo finals were up and running, the atmosphere was less adorable, but just as friendly.\n\nMike and Madeline Spilman watched in awe as horses bucked and riders held on tight. \u201cWe come for the excitement of it all,\u201d Madeline said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thrill to watch.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stock show closes with second-best attendance in event\u2019s history", "title": "Stock show closes with second-best attendance in event\u2019s history", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/25/stock-show-closes-with-second-best-attendance-in-events-history/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__cd26NWSS_LASTDAY_HR_HHR_9513p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__cd26NWSS_LASTDAY_HR_HHR_9513p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T18:20:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:57:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "National Western Stock Show"}, "article_summary": "Shannon Stewart, the 12-year-old Jefferson County Fair and Rodeo Junior Princess of 2015, said celebrating Western life is what the stock show is all about.\nShe was helping out at stock show events in her tiara-adorned cowboy hat.\nAmong dozens of tiny cowgirls and cowboys at the final day of the National Western Stock Show, 3-year-old Zoe Clawser donned a pink cowboy hat, red boots and clutched a stick horse.\nAttendance was the second- highest in the stock show\u2019s 109-year history.\nMatt said he brought Zoe to the stock show to give her a taste of life in the West."}
