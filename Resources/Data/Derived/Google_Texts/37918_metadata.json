Cruz is more fanatical. Sure, Trump is a bully and bigot, but he doesn\u2019t hew to any sharp ideological line. Cruz is a fierce ideologue: He denies the existence of man-made climate change, rejects same-sex marriage, wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, believes the 2nd amendment guarantees everyone a right to guns. He doesn\u2019t believe in a constitutional divide between church and state, favors the death penalty, rejects immigration reform, demands the repeal of Obamacare, and takes a strict \u201coriginalist\u201d view of the meaning of the Constitution.\n\n2. Cruz is a true believer. Trump has no firm principles except making money, getting attention, and gaining power. But Cruz has spent much of his life embracing radical right economic and political views.\n\n3. Cruz is more disciplined and strategic. Trump is all over the place, often winging it, saying whatever pops into his mind. Cruz hews to a clear script and a carefully crafted strategy. He plays the long game (as he\u2019s shown in Iowa).\n\n4. Cruz is a loner who\u2019s willing to destroy government institutions to get his way. Trump has spent his career using the federal government and making friends with big shots. Not Cruz. He has repeatedly led Republicans toward fiscal cliffs. In the Fall of 2013, his opposition to Obamacare led in a significant way to the shutdown of the federal government.\n\nBoth men would be disasters for America, but Ted Cruz would be the larger disaster.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both men would be disasters for America, but Ted Cruz would be the larger disaster.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Both men would be disasters for America, but Ted Cruz would be the larger disaster.", "title": "Robert Reich: 4 Reasons Ted Cruz is Even More Dangerous than Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/robert-reich-4-reasons-ted-cruz-even-more-dangerous-donald-trump", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/shutterstock_360992708.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Robert Reich: 4 Reasons Ted Cruz is Even More Dangerous than Donald Trump"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T01:14:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "In the Fall of 2013, his opposition to Obamacare led in a significant way to the shutdown of the federal government.\nTrump has spent his career using the federal government and making friends with big shots.\nBoth men would be disasters for America, but Ted Cruz would be the larger disaster.\nBut Cruz has spent much of his life embracing radical right economic and political views.\nSure, Trump is a bully and bigot, but he doesn\u2019t hew to any sharp ideological line."}
