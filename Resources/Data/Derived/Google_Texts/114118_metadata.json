At 3-all in the fourth, with dark clouds moving in and light fading, they were ushered off the court. Djokovic and Murray will resume Saturday at 1 p.m. local time, a little more than 16 hours after they stopped.\n\nThe eventual winner will face a much-more-rested Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\nThe eighth-seeded Wawrinka, who eliminated Roger Federer in the quarterfinals, followed that up by defeating France\u2019s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 6-7 (1), 7-6 (3), 6-4 in Friday\u2019s opening semifinal. Wawrinka succeeded largely on the strength of one statistic: He saved 16 of 17 break points.\n\nThere were a few whistles and jeers directed at Wawrinka after he ended Tsonga\u2019s bid to give France a men\u2019s champion at its own tournament, something that last happened when Yannick Noah won in 1983.\n\n\u201cJo is always a tough player to play,\u201d Wawrinka said, \u201cespecially when he\u2019s playing at home.\u201d\n\nThe first chants of \u201cSon-gah! Son-gah!\u201d accompanied by rhythmic clapping arrived before the first point was played, and they returned over and over at key junctures, as did yells of \u201cAllez, Jo!\u201d and other support for Tsonga that prompted the chair umpire to ask for quiet.\n\nThe temperature topped 90 degrees (32 Celsius) at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the players wrapped towels filled with ice around their necks at changeovers to try to cool off.\n\n\u201cHeat didn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Tsonga said. \u201cMy opponent made my life difficult.\u201d\n\nA year ago, after winning the Australian Open championship, Wawrinka lost in the first round in Paris. Now he\u2019s into his first French Open final and second at a major.\n\nFor Djokovic, so much is at stake this weekend.\n\nFinish off Murray, and he would face Wawrinka with a chance to become only the eighth man in tennis history to own at least one trophy from each of the sport\u2019s four most prestigious tournaments, adding to his five from the Australian Open, two from Wimbledon and one from the U.S. Open.\n\nIt would be Djokovic\u2019s third appearance in the final in Paris.\n\nHe lost in 2012 and 2014 to Rafael Nadal, the nine-time champion whose 39-match Roland Garros winning streak was ended by Djokovic in this year\u2019s quarterfinals.\n\nEntering Friday, Djokovic was 40-2 this season, with 27 victories in a row.\n\nHe looked like that same, dominant player for the first two sets against Murray, a two-time major champion trying to become the first British man to reach the final in Paris since 1937.\n\nBut the Serb\u2019s form began to dip in the third set, while Murray started to play better and better and tried to rile the crowd by motioning for more support. Murray broke Djokovic for the first time to go ahead 6-5 in the third, then served that set out at love \u2014 the first set Djokovic dropped over these two weeks.\n\nAfter that, Djokovic went off the court to visit with a trainer, perhaps for treatment on the groin muscle problem he dealt with earlier in the tournament. Starting in the second set, and continuing into the third, Djokovic did deep knee bends and flexed his hips and upper legs.\n\nThe match was becoming more competitive, and the second game of the fourth set was tremendous. Djokovic held three break points, but failed to convert any. On one, a 34-stroke exchange that was the day\u2019s longest, he put a forehand into the net. A too-long forehand ended a 28-stroke exchange on the game\u2019s last point.\n\nThat was part of a run of nine consecutive points for Murray, who broke Djokovic at love to lead 2-1. But Djokovic is nothing if not a fighter, and when Murray dumped a forehand into the net, another break made it 2-all. Djokovic pumped his right fist and looked up at his guest box, where his wife stood, clapping and yelling.\n\nThey\u2019ll all be back Saturday for more.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Novak Djokovic-Andy Murray French Open semifinals suspended", "title": "Novak Djokovic-Andy Murray French Open semifinals suspended", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-french-open-semifinals-suspended/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_091951_stan-wawrinka.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_091951_stan-wawrinka.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T09:18:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T07:53:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c3e\"", "article_summary": "Djokovic and Murray will resume Saturday at 1 p.m. local time, a little more than 16 hours after they stopped.\nStarting in the second set, and continuing into the third, Djokovic did deep knee bends and flexed his hips and upper legs.\nThe match was becoming more competitive, and the second game of the fourth set was tremendous.\nMurray broke Djokovic for the first time to go ahead 6-5 in the third, then served that set out at love \u2014 the first set Djokovic dropped over these two weeks.\nThat was part of a run of nine consecutive points for Murray, who broke Djokovic at love to lead 2-1."}
