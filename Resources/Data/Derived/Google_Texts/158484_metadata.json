You confide almost everything about your life to them \u2013 and pay them for their expertise in managing your money. Just like doctors and lawyers, your accountant should be someone you trust.\n\nBefore you even hire an accountant, make sure he or she is certified\u2014a CPA. Ask basic but important questions about billing policies, experience level and current licenses. Get a list of recommendations.\n\nRelated: 3 Things You Should Know About Filing a Tax Extension\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very personal relationship,\u201d said Cari Weston, a certified public accountant and a senior taxation manager at the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). \u201cIt\u2019s important that you make a connection with your accountant.\u201d\n\nMuch can go wrong with that connection, of course. So if you\u2019ve noticed any of the following practices, it\u2019s almost certainly time to say goodbye.\n\n1: Your accountant has complaints or lawsuits.\n\nSince your accountant is a licensed CPA you can easily check with your state board of accountancy to see if any complaints or lawsuits have been lodged. You should do that periodically -- not just during the hiring process.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What to Do With That Tax Refund (at Every Age)\n\n2: Your accountant offers to cheat on your taxes for you or for personal gain.\n\nIf he or she starts making improper offers to boost your tax refund or lower your taxable income by inflating or inventing deductions \u2013 you should leave. An accountant\u2019s refusal to sign your return or to give you a copy of your tax return is also very suspect. \u201cIf they\u2019ve lied to you or they\u2019re cheating or suggesting questionable behaviors, it\u2019s time to go,\u201d said Weston. \u201cAny activity that makes you uncomfortable should be a red flag.\u201d\n\n3: Your accountant can\u2019t keep up with your new business ventures.\n\nIf you were on another company\u2019s payroll filing individually, for example, and have now started your own business, your current accountant may no longer be skilled enough to prepare your taxes. Find someone with broader experience and more advanced training.\n\n4: Your accountant isn\u2019t up to date on tax law.\n\nAccountants should constantly keep their knowledge up to date; tax laws change often. Weston recommends asking your accountant what type of ongoing training or recertification she\u2019s recently received.\n\nRelated: The 10 Worst States for Taxes in 2015\n\n5: Your accountant hasn\u2019t entered the digital age.\n\nIf you\u2019re tech savvy but your accountant is still asking you to fax your tax receipts, it\u2019s time to find a professional with at least an email address and a website.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you\u2019re uncomfortable or believe your accountant is doing a lousy job \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate to end the relationship and move on. These are your taxes, after all.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to stick around too long because they feel guilty leaving,\u201d said Weston.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s always a good idea to review on a regular basis whether your accountant should still be your accountant.", "title": "5 Signs It\u2019s Time to Fire Your Accountant", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/5-Signs-It-s-Time-Fire-Your-Accountant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/you-are-fired.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/5-Signs-It-s-Time-Fire-Your-Accountant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/you-are-fired.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s always a good idea to review on a regular basis whether your accountant should still be your accountant.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The bottom line is that if you\u2019re uncomfortable or believe your accountant is doing a lousy job \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate to end the relationship and move on.\nAn accountant\u2019s refusal to sign your return or to give you a copy of your tax return is also very suspect.\nRelated: Here\u2019s What to Do With That Tax Refund (at Every Age)2: Your accountant offers to cheat on your taxes for you or for personal gain.\n\u201cAny activity that makes you uncomfortable should be a red flag.\u201d3: Your accountant can\u2019t keep up with your new business ventures.\nRelated: The 10 Worst States for Taxes in 20155: Your accountant hasn\u2019t entered the digital age."}
