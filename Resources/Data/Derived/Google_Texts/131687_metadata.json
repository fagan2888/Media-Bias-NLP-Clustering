The contrast between the president Americans saw that night on their televisions and the one depicted in the HuffPo report could not have been more striking \u2014 or more representative of the bewildering mix of ecstasy and anguish that\u2019s characterized the last six years.\n\nWhat HuffPo found in its article, which was buried by the immigration news and has gone unnoticed by most, is that the same administration that\u2019s tried to define itself as thoughtful and humane was, behind the scenes, doing everything it could to shield war criminals from justice. Once again, the White House was thwarting a release of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s controversial and much-delayed report on the CIA and torture. And once again, the White House\u2019s worries centered on protecting the CIA \u2014 and its former professional waterboarders \u2014 from public scrutiny and censure.\n\nThe dynamic wasn\u2019t new; the administration had been concocting reasons to block the public release of the committee\u2019s findings for years. What was new, however, was the calendar. After eight long years \u2014 six under President Obama \u2014 the Democrats\u2019 time in control of the Senate was running out. And while the Dems\u2019 commitment to informing America of the horrors perpetrated in its name has never been ironclad, it\u2019s certainly made of stronger stuff than the GOP\u2019s. Sen. Richard Burr, the likely head of the Republican-run Intelligence Committee, is an unabashed critic of the report and supporter of torture. It\u2019s hard to imagine him releasing the Senate\u2019s findings if the committee\u2019s current head, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe White House knows all of this, of course, just as it knows that its lead negotiator, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, has come to be seen by many senators as the de facto Man from Langley. That\u2019s why soon-to-retire Sen. Jay Rockefeller told HuffPo that the administration\u2019s latest complaint \u2014 that giving alleged CIA torturers pseudonyms was not enough, and that entire chunks of the report\u2019s timeline should be redacted \u2014 was the latest proof that the report was \u201cbeing slow-walked to death.\u201d Because the committee\u2019s work \u201cmakes a lot of people who did really bad things look really bad,\u201d Rockefeller said, the White House and the CIA are \u201cdoing everything they can\u201d to see it buried. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the public to know about it,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the same day he announced one of his greatest accomplishments, Obama was cementing one of his greatest mistakes", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Cheney dilemma: How torture and mercy define his presidency", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On the same day he announced one of his greatest accomplishments, Obama was cementing one of his greatest mistakes", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Cheney dilemma: How torture and mercy define his presidency", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/29/barack_obamas_cheney_dilemma_how_torture_and_mercy_define_his_presidency/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/cheney_obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the same day he announced one of his greatest accomplishments, Obama was cementing one of his greatest mistakes", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Cheney dilemma: How torture and mercy define his presidency", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/cheney_obama.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, CIA, Denis McDonough, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Cheney, Editor's Picks, George W.
