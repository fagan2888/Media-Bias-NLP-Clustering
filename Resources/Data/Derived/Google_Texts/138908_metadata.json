Angie\u2019s husband, Joseph O\u2019Day and her midwife, Racha Tahani Lawler, were by her side for the two-day experience.\n\nIn fact, they were both there for both children\u2019s births, as licensed midwife Lawler was Rivera\u2019s midwife for her first baby, too.\n\nThe \u201clicensed\u201d distinction is an important one. Lawler and California\u2019s other 300 or so licensed midwives get their certification from the same agency that oversees doctors: the Medical Board of California. They are neither certified nurse-midwives nor lay midwives. They are required to complete three years at a board-certified midwifery school and pass exams. They are trained to assist women with low-risk, normal births between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn 2012, California\u2019s licensed midwives helped deliver 2,300 babies.\n\nBut these midwives are mired in a Catch-22. They are legally obligated to be supervised by physicians. If a doctor supervises a licensed midwife, however, the doctor runs the risk of losing liability insurance.\n\n\u201cSo for the most part, they\u2019re sort of on their own, and that\u2019s a real shame,\u201d said Folsom-based OB/GYN Dr. Ruth Haskins. Haskins has a unique relationship with licensed midwives, having served on the Medical Board\u2019s Midwifery Advisory Council for eight years. \u201cAnd so these are licensed professionals trying to do the best they can, but they don\u2019t have a shoulder to lean on.\u201d\n\nIf licensed midwives could collaborate with doctors, said Haskins, women could get the intimacy of the home birth they seek and the specialized expertise of obstetric medical care.\n\nThis lack of supervision also creates other problems. Licensed midwives often have difficulty ordering and receiving lab tests for their clients or getting prescriptions filled.\n\nAnd Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid, does not issue reimbursement for licensed midwives\u2019 services, so low-income women don\u2019t really have the option of seeing them.\n\n\u201cIf they are required by law to be supervised, then the supervisor needs to be listed on the application,\u201d said Shannon Smith-Crowley, lobbyist for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the organization representing obstetrician-gynecologists. \u201cSo you see the problem if you can\u2019t get a physician supervisor, then, you know, de facto you can\u2019t be Medi-Cal.\u201d\n\nTo deal with this problem, licensed midwife Lawler offers her services on a sliding scale.\n\nMost of these challenges stem from the liability quandary. But, midwives and lawmakers working with ACOG-sponsored legislation hope a new bill, AB 1308, could change things.\n\n\u201cThe best possible outcome is if we could really build that relationship between our licensed midwives and physicians,\u201d said Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla (D-Concord), who wrote the bill, \u201cwhere we could have a situation where a mother would have her charts, her medical history, all available in preparation for that very slight chance that something, you know, might happen, that she might need that medical intervention.\u201d\n\nIndeed, OB/GYN Ruth Haskins says if women are going to give birth outside the hospital, they should be as safe as possible.\n\n\u201cThe ideal situation is that the liability carriers come on board and recognize that if they cover physicians who are nervy enough and astute enough and kind enough to supervise licensed midwives, it will decrease the overall liability that they will end up having to cover,\u201d she said. \u201cThe highest liability patient is the one who just pops into the hospital and has never been seen by anybody before and you don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nDuring Rivera\u2019s birth, her baby got stuck on what\u2019s called a cervical lip. She refused the solutions Lawler offered, which included manually pushing the cervix over the baby\u2019s head like a turtleneck.\n\nInstead, Rivera started asking to go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cI just felt like, I don\u2019t know, like I was gonna die.... like I was going to pass out or something,\u201d Rivera recalled.\n\n\u201cShe was exhausted,\u201d O\u2019Day added. \u201cYou know, it had been what, 28, 29 hours at that point.\u201d\n\nIn addition to keeping mom and baby safe, licensed midwives like Lawler say their goal is to empower mothers throughout pregnancy and birth. For her, that means letting them make the decisions whenever possible. So, even though Rivera\u2019s and her baby\u2019s vitals were stable, Lawler did eventually call for an ambulance.\n\n\u201cSome people think I just sit in the corner and burn sage and hum in Birkenstocks,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cMy job when they come to me is to create a relationship with them so that they\u2019re OK with me being there and then to keep them safe and to keep their babies safe.\u201d\n\nBut, some doctors simply do not trust out-of-hospital births.\n\n\u201cYou know, people have come in with dead babies,\u201d said OB/GYN Eve Yalom, who treats high-risk pregnancies in Berkeley. \u201cNot just once. More than once. More than a few times.\u201d\n\nYalom said she would not work with licensed midwives, even if the supervision regulation is lifted. However, she is their backup doctor by default because she would not turn someone away in a crisis.\n\n\u201cBut what you really want is to have a healthy mom and a healthy baby,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHospital deliveries are safer for mother and baby.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the official word from ACOG, the OB/GYN group, too -- that the safest place to give birth is in a hospital, which is where nearly all of California\u2019s half million babies are born each year. But ACOG\u2019s own Shannon Smith-Crowley says childbirth can be just as safe for the women who give birth at home.\n\n\u201cAll of the data say the home birth setting can be safe for appropriate women, as safe as a hospital, when the care is integrated,\u201d Smith-Crowley said. \u201cSo that means when the midwife is working with the physician and the rest of the health care delivery system.\u201d\n\nAfter months of negotiation, the ACOG-sponsored bill has been amended to cover many of the issues both midwives and doctors have been struggling over for years.\n\nIf the bill passes, it will remove barriers for midwives trying to get supplies and medications for their clients. It will define normal birth, making it illegal for midwives to manage high risk births such as twins and babies who are positioned with their head up instead of down.\n\nThe biggest change is that it will eliminate the requirement for physician supervision. The bill would require midwives to refer or transfer a clients to a physicians if the woman\u2019s condition \u201cdeviates from normal at any point in the pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum care.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still a major issue that the bill does not resolve: What will liability look like for doctors who decide to work with licensed midwives and their clients? The bill does not give additional protections to physicians who choose this path. If a woman comes in to the hospital late in labor and something goes wrong, it could be seen as the physician\u2019s fault.\n\nIn South Los Angeles, the paramedics stood in the hallway, while Lawler coached Rivera through the end of her labor. The baby boy decided to be born right then and there, on the bed, in the back bedroom at the birth center. Not in the ambulance or at the hospital.\n\nThe baby boy, nicknamed Wolfie, was 7 pounds and 10 ounces and healthy. River and O\u2019Day said they would do it all over again.\n\n\u201cWe already did it twice, right,\u201d O\u2019Day said. \u201cHonestly, I just trusted Racha, \u2018cause you know, I\u2019ve been at two births and she\u2019s been at a lot more than that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde239\"", "article_summary": "Haskins has a unique relationship with licensed midwives, having served on the Medical Board\u2019s Midwifery Advisory Council for eight years.\nIn 2012, California\u2019s licensed midwives helped deliver 2,300 babies.\nMore than a few times.\u201dYalom said she would not work with licensed midwives, even if the supervision regulation is lifted.\nLawler and California\u2019s other 300 or so licensed midwives get their certification from the same agency that oversees doctors: the Medical Board of California.\nLicensed midwives often have difficulty ordering and receiving lab tests for their clients or getting prescriptions filled."}
