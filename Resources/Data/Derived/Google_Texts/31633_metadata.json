Indeed, women can look quite elegant in such attire. As for abayas: Candidly, when I see a woman veiled in black from head to toe, even her face hidden, I wonder how much freedom she enjoys or whether she receives orders she dare not disobey. I believe in liberty, not least for women, Muslim women included. Does that make me an imperialist?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as an historian, Ms. Chrisman-Campbell ought to know that in Iran, after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women were forced to wear what in that country are called chadors. To this day, those who do not are subject to arrest. And in Saudi Arabia in 2002, religious police beat young girls to prevent them from leaving a school \u201cbecause they were not wearing the abaya.\u201d Fifteen schoolgirls perished as a result. Are multiculturalists really prepared to defend such practices?\n\nI also object to the contention that we should view haute couture headscarves and cloaks as signs of Western progress or, worse, as penance for \u201cIslamophobia\u201d and other grievances that are said to spark \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d Such theories, reassuring as they may be to the blame-America-first crowd, do not stand up scrutiny.\n\nDolce & Gabbana is (are?) not alone. Also last week, in The Wall Street\u2019s glossy magazine, there appeared a full-page advertisement for Bottega Veneta, an Italian \u201cluxury goods house.\u201d It shows a somewhat effeminate teenage boy reclining and staring off into the middle distance. He wears flip-flops, his pants are pushed up to reveal slender calves, he sports a burgundy jacket and a lavender knit cap of the sort (if not the color) often worn by devout Muslims.\n\nTo whom is this ad meant to appeal? Is it really about selling clothes? Or is it, too, intended \u201cin some small way to chip away at the marginalization of Islam\u201d? If so, it may be counterproductive since most Islamic leaders probably would not approve of images that use their religion symbols to suggest licentiousness.\n\nSpeaking of what Islamic leaders may or may not approve: The Italian government last week placed plywood boxes over ancient nude sculptures at Rome\u2019s Capitoline Museums. The stated intention was to demonstrate \u201crespect\u201d for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who was taking a European victory lap following the nuclear agreement he concluded with President Obama and the subsequent lifting of sanctions on the Islamic Republic, regarded in elite circles as a rogue state no longer despite its ongoing sponsorship of terrorists and criminals abroad, and egregious human rights violations at home.\n\nSuzanne Maloney, a scholar at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, lamented the \u201calacrity with which Italian leaders jettisoned their values and historical legacy.\u201d She expressed concern that \u201ca Europe that would so readily censor the treasures of its own glorious antiquity, in an obsequious gesture that was apparently unbidden by Tehran, is unlikely to jeopardize any budding business to penalize any Iranian infractions of the agreement, or to put pressure on Iran over any of its other objectionable policies.\u201d\n\nThe Italians found an additional way to bow to Mr. Rouhani religious sensibilities: At an official dinner, they conspicuously served no alcohol. And when the pope met with the Iranian president, the former chose not to raise such sensitive subjects as Iran\u2019s rising death sentences, including for homosexuality, adultery, apostasy and moharebeh, enmity against God.\n\nNow maybe Mr. Rouhani thought: \u201cWhat splendid hosts! The next time the Italian prime minister or the pontiff comes to Tehran I shall break out the Valpolicella to make them feel at home. And I will see to it that no one is hanged or stoned while they\u2019re in town since I understand Europeans frown on such things.\u201d\n\nMore likely, however, he saw weakness; further evidence that Europeans no longer esteem their own cultures or value individual freedom. That could only have invited his contempt.\n\nThe distinguished British journalist Daniel Johnson, in Mosaic magazine last month, observed that in Europe today \u201cIslam is advancing by leaps and bounds. It is not only a matter of mass migration and high birthrates; increasingly it will also be a matter of mass cultural, religious, and political influence. \u201c\n\nHe further noted that \u201cIslamists promote their intolerant, triumphalist, aggressive interpretation of Islam in part by contrasting it with European decadence. Faced with such a choice, is it any surprise that many young Muslims become Islamists and more than a few of them jihadists?\u201d\n\nThe question answers itself \u2014 at least for those not indulging in comforting delusions, among them the notion that Islamism need not be defeated; it just needs to be accessorized with \u201coversized sunglasses, cocktail rings, stilettos, and statement bags.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haute couture headscarves won't counter violent extremism. .05/27/2016 8:10:49AM EST.", "author": "Cliff May", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Haute couture headscarves won't counter violent extremism.", "title": "Cliff May - The Islamist Wears Dolce & Gabbana", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/cliffmay/2016/02/03/the-islamist-wears-dolce--gabbana-n2114132", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/182/37bee14e-b240-46fd-b40a-a1c822587752.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Haute couture headscarves won't counter violent extremism.", "title": "Cliff May - The Islamist Wears Dolce & Gabbana", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/cliffmay/2016/02/03/the-islamist-wears-dolce--gabbana-n2114132", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/182/37bee14e-b240-46fd-b40a-a1c822587752.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Islamist Wears Dolce & Gabbana, Cliff May, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "I believe in liberty, not least for women, Muslim women included.\n\u201cHe further noted that \u201cIslamists promote their intolerant, triumphalist, aggressive interpretation of Islam in part by contrasting it with European decadence.\nDolce & Gabbana is (are?)\nOr is it, too, intended \u201cin some small way to chip away at the marginalization of Islam\u201d?\nThe distinguished British journalist Daniel Johnson, in Mosaic magazine last month, observed that in Europe today \u201cIslam is advancing by leaps and bounds."}
