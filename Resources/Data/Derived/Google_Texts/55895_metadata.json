Landry\u2019s total indicates he raised $725,535 more than Caldwell over the same period.\n\nLandry is poised for a strong showing in the Attorney General\u2019s race this year.\n\nLandry, who also personally donated a sum to his campaign, ended the year well over three times the cash-on-hand as Caldwell. Caldwell goes into the race this year with approximately $300,000 in cash while Landry entered the Election Year with over $1,000,000 (one million dollars) on hand.\n\n\u201cOur message is driving our fundraising,\u201d said Landry. \u201cPeople are looking for an Attorney General who is honest, ethical, and truly conservative. I am a lifelong Republican who believes our party stands for freedom, family values, and job growth.\u201d\n\nCaldwell, a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republican Party for the sole purpose of trying to win elections, endorsed Mary Landrieu last year. He also said Obamacare did not go far enough because the government needed more control.\n\nWhile in Congress, Jeff Landry was named the \u201conly honest man in Washington\u201d by the well-known national Examiner newspaper. Landry was also named one of the top 5 most conservative members of the U.S. House by the respected National Journal publication. Landry became a Republican at the age of 18, when he first registered to vote.\n\nLandry resides with his wife Sharon and their son in Acadiana. He is a practicing attorney, a former Sheriff Deputy, and a former Police Officer. Landry has also been a successful small business owner in the oil and gas industry. He served for more than a decade in the Louisiana National Guard.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "As in, a $700,000 cash-on-hand advantage.
