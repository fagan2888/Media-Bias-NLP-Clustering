(Photo: Dave Boucher / The Tennessean)Buy Photo Story Highlights There's a move to close the Achievement School District because dramatic success hasn't happened.\n\nThat's premature. Attitudes on ASD vary by supporters and opponents' distinct perspectives.\n\nSome view it as siphoning money from public schools, while others see it as necessary reform.\n\nThe Achievement School District was in the news again last month when the Tennessee Black Caucus joined the Democratic Caucus in calling for a moratorium on the conversion of new schools into the ASD.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Shelby County School Board made a similar appeal.\n\nIn both cases, lawmakers and elected officials noted a recent study that found modest gains in math and no significant improvements in reading for ASD schools.\n\nThe Black Caucus\u2019 reluctance to endorse the conversion of more schools to the ASD is not surprising. But the reasons go beyond test scores.\n\nIn an effort to unpack the political controversy surrounding the ASD, my colleagues and I have conducted dozens of interviews with Memphis community leaders, legislators, ASD staff, charter operators, and district officials.\n\nWhat we have learned is that the starkly differing opinions about the ASD are rooted in the experiences of Memphis\u2019 African American community with a century of discrimination, segregation and desegregation, and more recently the departure of six suburban communities from the Shelby County School District.\n\nThese experiences shape the way that many Memphians view the ASD.\n\nFor example, many of our respondents described the diversion of dollars from the district to the ASD as yet another example of the state denying Memphis its fair share of resources. Likewise, the perception that the ASD replaces local teachers with a seemingly disproportionate number of white teachers has stoked fears about job security in the African American community.\n\nOther Memphians are simply offended at the notion that outside organizations think they can somehow \u201cfix\u201d Memphis.\n\nOf course, ASD supporters see the ASD in an entirely different light. To them, the ASD is a bold attempt to shake up a system that has under-performed for too long; to introduce much needed competition; to push resources down to the level of the school; and to prioritize the needs of students over adult interests.\n\nThe language they use to describe the ASD varies \u2014 partner, competitor, change agent, policeman \u2014 but they share an understanding that the ASD seeks to improve learning outcomes and life opportunities among Memphis\u2019 most disadvantaged. They believe it is too early to judge the ASD\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nJoshua Glazer (Photo: Submitted)\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s perspective, there is little doubt that the ASD\u2019s inability to meet its very ambitious student outcome goals has left it vulnerable to criticism.\n\nNo less important, however, is that the divisive politics around the ASD detracts from the region\u2019s capacity to sustain commitment over time, learn from experience, and make incremental improvements to strategy.\n\nSchool reform initiatives everywhere can fail for a variety of reasons, but nothing is more damaging than our national penchant to try something new and then hit the reset button after dramatic results fail to quickly materialize.\n\nHow can Memphis avoid this fate that has undermined reform in so many other cities? The answer is politics.\n\nNot the small type characterized by in-fighting among interest groups, but the nobler variety in which diverse communities come together to accomplish a complex and difficult task.\n\nThis is what political scientist Clarence Stone has called \u201ccivic capacity,\u201d and it is key to sustaining long-term efforts to crack particularly tough problems confronting urban communities.\n\nKey to this is the understanding that no single group commands the clout or resources to sustain a long-term improvement effort on its own.\n\nFor example, while many reformers believe that parents desires should carry the most weight, parents are not the only group with legitimate interests in the school system.\n\nLikewise, while business leaders and philanthropists can marshal funds to support their preferred reform, even the most well resourced effort has little chance of long-term success without the support of teachers and parents.\n\nThe historical interplay of education, civil rights, and race relations makes Memphis a difficult context for sustained collective action.\n\nBut difficult does not mean impossible.\n\nIf the considerable resources invested in Memphis school reform is to lead to meaningful improvements, all sides will need to put aside smaller interests in pursuit of a larger and shared objective.\n\nJoshua Glazer is associate professor of education policy at George Washington University\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1OCawmN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "There's a move to close the Achievement School District because dramatic success hasn't happened.
