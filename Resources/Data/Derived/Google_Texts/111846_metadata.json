Having been together for 35 years, they felt no urgency to tie the knot, but the enthusiasm was contagious.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this day,\u201d said Gibson.\n\nBefore spangly costumes, drums and dancing took over the city, though, some activists took time out for solemn remembrance and warnings about the need for continued vigilance.\n\nEarly on Saturday dozens gathered on a slope of Twin Peaks, a nearby mountain, to assemble a large pink triangle, several hundred feet wide, which is visible for miles. The symbol the Nazis used to identify gay prisoners in concentration camps, it is a reminder of hatred and intolerance. Mayor Edwin Lee and other dignitaries attended the ceremony.\n\nThis year\u2019s Pride theme is Equality Without Exception \u2013 a reference to the use of religious exceptions to discriminate against members of the LGBT community.\n\nSame-sex marriage is now a right throughout the US but some conservative leaders in southern states indicated they would use religious grounds and bureaucratic niggling to resist the supreme court\u2019s ruling. Texas governor Greg Abbott gave state officials tacit approval to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, a candidate for the presidency, did the same.\n\n\u201cOur theme Equality Without Exception is timely,\u201d Gary Virginia, the head of SF Pride, which runs the festival, said in a statement. \u201cQueers and allies alike need to vote and stay vigilant.\u201d\n\nBrian Basinger, one of the parade\u2019s grand marshals, echoed the sentiment, saying the LGBT community needed to remain mobilised.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not that many people,\u201d he said. \u201cGains have to be sustained.\u201d Basinger highlighted the community\u2019s disproportionate number of sick and homeless people in San Francisco. He stressed, however, that the main emotion over the weekend would be joy.\n\nHighlights included Laverne Cox, the star of Netflix\u2019s Orange is the New Black, unveiling her wax figure at Madame Tussauds.\n\nOrganisers said there would be more than 20 stages and venues and nearly almost 300 exhibitors around city hall.\n\nSpeakers were scheduled to include Alicia Garza, who started the #BlackLivesMatter movement, and Kate Kendall, leader of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The rock band Shiny Toy Guns were set to play on the main stage. Rick Welts, the president of the Golden State Warriors, the Oakland-based NBA champions, was to serve as celebrity grand marshal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jayne Rowse, left, and April DeBoer celebrate in Ann Arbor.

Therefore Aut Bar, the top gay bar in Ann Arbor, if not the entire state, hosted an improvised party which had staff making emergency champagne, beer and ice runs as revellers depleted their stock.\n\n\u201cBy Sunday night, we\u2019re going to be selling Rumchata and Galliano,\u201d said Keith Orr, who opened the bar with his partner, Martin Contreras, 20 years ago.\n\nThey were one of 322 couples to marry in Michigan in March 2014, when a district judge temporarily struck down the state\u2019s ban, but on Saturday they still felt overwhelmed by the significance of Friday\u2019s supreme court ruling.\n\n\u201cYesterday was the biggest victory I can recall in my lifetime in terms of a change in the way the government is looking at us,\u201d said Orr. \u201cIt was a historic day, a historic decision. What does it mean to us? It means everything.\u201d\n\nRelated: Same-sex marriage ruling's ripple effect \u2013 historic celebrations of love\n\nOn Friday 10 weddings were held in the bar\u2019s patio, under a traditional arch woven with pink flowers and a small rainbow flag.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the arch was set in front of the entrance to Trillium real estate, which is run by Linda Lombardini and Sandi Smith. Their desks were covered with same-sex wedding toppers, copies of the supreme court ruling and a rainbow-colored bouquet.\n\nAccompanied by their families, they legally wed in New York City in October 2013, after the supreme court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. But until Friday\u2019s ruling it remained unclear if their home state would recognise the marriage certificate.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty phenomenal,\u201d said Smith about the moment the decision was announced.\n\nSmith said the two families dropped everything to celebrate with them anew.\n\n\u201cIt was like a wedding day all over again,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Tens of thousands of revellers prepare for Sunday Pride festivities but reaction of southern states prompts campaigners to vow vigilance", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Tens of thousands of revellers prepare for Sunday Pride festivities but reaction of southern states prompts campaigners to vow vigilance", "title": "San Francisco takes pride in same-sex ruling but caution underlies celebration", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/san-francisco-pride-same-sex-marriage", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db37cb4cfb41269814af4b74def0e2a90d1e4acf/0_184_2764_1659/2764.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=76d7275233055e3c93a846e4f20cafc1", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/27/san-francisco-pride-same-sex-marriage?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/san-francisco-pride-same-sex-marriage", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/27/san-francisco-pride-same-sex-marriage?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@rorycarroll72", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/db37cb4cfb41269814af4b74def0e2a90d1e4acf/0_184_2764_1659/2764.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/27/san-francisco-pride-same-sex-marriage?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Same-sex marriage (US),LGBT rights,US news,US supreme court,US constitution and civil liberties,Law,San Francisco,California,Michigan,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-06-27T21:57:13.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rorycarroll,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T21:57:13.000Z", "tag": "Same-sex marriage (US),LGBT rights,US news,US supreme court,US constitution and civil liberties,Law,San Francisco,California,Michigan,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db37cb4cfb41269814af4b74def0e2a90d1e4acf/0_184_2764_1659/2764.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8e1320b85615b4085985878d6a85f21f", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Same-sex marriage (US),LGBT rights,US news,US supreme court,US constitution and civil liberties,Law,San Francisco,California,Michigan,World news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe152a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGains have to be sustained.\u201d Basinger highlighted the community\u2019s disproportionate number of sick and homeless people in San Francisco.\n\u201cToday our city is filled with joy,\u201d said Joe D\u2019Alessandro, head of the San Francisco Travel Association.\nSan Francisco may have hogged the spotlight, but LGBT communities elsewhere in the US held their own celebrations of the supreme court ruling.\nThe supreme court\u2019s ruling on Friday that same-sex marriage was protected under the constitution invested the jamboree with a sense of history, since San Francisco played a key role in the decades-long campaign for equality.\nTheir desks were covered with same-sex wedding toppers, copies of the supreme court ruling and a rainbow-colored bouquet."}
