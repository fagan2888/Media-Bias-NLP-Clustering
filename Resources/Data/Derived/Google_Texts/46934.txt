I'm not super interested in the latest poll results about whether Obama's approval is up or down a point or two, or whether Obamacare is up or down a point or two. It'll all shake out soon enough. But the Wall Street Journal's latest poll asked about raising the minimum wage, and the results were pretty interesting:

So 63 percent were in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10. That's surprisingly high. Hell, 43 percent even favor raising it to $12.50. I don't imagine that this support is especially deep or passionate, but it's still pretty high. As Damon Silvers of the AFL-CIO says, "If I was a House Republican, I'd be concerned about opposing anything that polled at 63%."

Of course, gun registration polls at better than 63 percent, and so do higher taxes on the rich, just to name a couple of examples. That doesn't seem to have caused very many Republicans to start quaking in their boots. Still, it's encouraging news.
