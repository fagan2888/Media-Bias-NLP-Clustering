To care for them, the Department of Veterans Affairs will spend some $4.2 billion annually from now until 2022.\n\nBut any impact from that medical research would soon be felt in the broader medical community, given that 1.7 million Americans are diagnosed every year with memory loss for annual economic cost of $76 billion. \u201cThe way human memory works is one of the great unsolved mysteries,\u201d Andres Lozano, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto, told Bloomberg. \u201cThis has tremendous value from a basic science aspect. It may have huge implications for patients with disorders affecting memory, including those with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has solicited research proposals from industry and academia on the idea of stimulating the brain to restore memory. Military officials hope to improve upon an existing implant made by Medtronic Inc. for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurological conditions. Specifically, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency wants to develop a small wireless device with \u201cimplantable probes\u201d to stimulate and record brain activity \u2014 but beyond that they\u2019re open to new ideas in the way of device size and implantation procedure.\n\nAlthough alarming to some, such brain implants \u2014 referred to as \u201cprobes\u201d by DARPA \u2014 may help innumerable people stricken by memory loss, including veterans who sustained severe injury in combat such as Thomas Green III. The Army sergeant survived a horrific attack when an improvised explosive device hit his five-ton truck, flipping it 10 times. Afterward, Green was left with a crushed pelvis, fractured back, and a brain injury. Still others in the military sustain similar injuries in car crashes while driving either military or civilian vehicles, necessitating improved methods of treating memory loss.\n\nIn an entirely different approach, Col. Brian Rees, of the Army Medical Reserve Corps, says the practice of Transcendental Meditation, popularized by the Beatles in the late 1960s, may help treat veterans and others for PTSD. Developed in the 1950s by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the regimen requires 15 to 20 minutes of daily practiced centered around a mantra or sound. Although controversial, Transcendental Meditation proponents point to stacks of quality academic papers supporting the effectiveness of the technique for a variety of health benefits.\n\nIn new research published Monday in the Journal of Traumatic Stress, Rees says Transcendental Meditation helped most of the Congolese war refugees recruited for the study. Rees and his colleagues tested the participants during the monthlong course, finding that PTSD symptoms dropped considerably. \u201cAn earlier study found a similar result after 30 days when 90 percent of [meditation] subjects dropped to a non-symptomatic level, but we were surprised to see such a significant reduction with this group after just 10 days,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers used a standard civilian medical diagnostic tool to assess the refugees for severity of PTSD symptoms, on a scale of 17-85 wherein 35 indicates recovery. The participants began the study with an average score of 77.9, which dropped to 48 after just 10 days of Transcendental Meditation. Amazingly, most of the symptoms among the 11 refugees had abated within a month of meditation treatment, as assessment scores fell to an average of 35.3 \u2014 or just about recovered.\n\nRees worked on the study with researchers from the Maharishi University of Management, based in Fairfield, Iowa, including Fred Travis. \u201cWhat makes this study interesting is when we tested them in the 90 days before they began the [meditation] technique, their PTSD scores kept going up,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that period their scores were rising, from 68.5 at the beginning to 77.9 after 90 days. But once they started the [medication] practice, their PTSD scores plummeted.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say the meditation technique helps to induce a \u201cdeep state of restful alertness,\u201d with daily practice settling the central nervous system to minimize negative thoughts, trouble with sleep, and other symptoms of the illness.\n\nSource: Rees B.
