Jon Elswick\n\nAmericans are below average on most measures of health \u2014 from obesity to infant mortality \u2014 when compared with other rich countries, and they're falling behind on lifespan, too, according to the latest survey.\n\n\n\nThe annual survey from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been used for years to show that the U.S. spends far more than any other comparable country on health care, yet gets far less for its money \u2014 and the latest survey is no different. Americans are fatter, die younger and don\u2019t get particularly good treatment for many diseases, with the exception of strokes and cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s become a political debate, with Republican leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner trumpeting the best healthcare system in the world, while the Obama administration counters that the Affordable Care Act is aimed at starting to fix the mess.\n\n\n\nThe OECD survey compares the 34 member countries to one another on a range of measures, from lifespan and spending on drugs to infant mortality. It shows the health of Americans is worsening even as other countries improve things for their citizens.\n\n\u201cWhile life expectancy in the United States used to be one year above the OECD average in 1970, it is now more than one year below the average,\u201d the report reads. The U.S. ranks at 26th in life expectancy out of 34 OECD countries.\n\nAmerica falls below the OECD average, which is 80 years. The U.S. life expectancy for someone born in 2011 is just 78.7 years, right behind Denmark and just above Chile. A Swiss, Japanese or Italian newborn can expect to live to be nearly 83.\n\nThis fits in with another study published in July and focusing on the U.S. alone.\n\nThe report gives several possible reasons for why the United States might be falling behind, including \"the highly fragmented nature of the U.S. health system, with relatively few resources devoted to public health and primary care, and a large share of the population uninsured.\"\n\n\n\nAmericans also eat more, take more legal and illegal drugs and are more likely to die in traffic accidents or be murdered, researchers found.\n\n\u201cAll OECD countries have universal (or quasi-universal) health coverage for a core set of health services and goods, except Mexico and the United States,\u201d the report adds.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act aims to change that \u2014 offering health insurance to the 15 percent of Americans who lack it either through new online health exchanges \u2014 which aren\u2019t working too well right now \u2013 or an expansion of Medicaid, which is spotty.\n\nInfant mortality is a major measure of a country\u2019s health system and the U.S. ranks near the bottom here. The U.S. infant mortality rate is 6.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births, well below the OECD average of 4 deaths per 1,000. In Iceland, just 1.6 babies out of every 1,000 die and in Sweden, Japan, and Finland it\u2019s around 2 per 100,000.\n\nThe U.S. scores poorly in other measures of quality of health care, with the second-highest rates of adults hospitalized for asthma. Americans do well after a stroke, though. Only 4.3 percent of Americans die within a month of a stroke, compared to 10 percent in Britain, 6.7 percent in Germany and nearly 20 percent in Mexico.\n\nThe U.S., Canada, Australia and Iceland all do well against breast cancer compared to other OECD countries, with 90 percent of patients living five years or more.\n\nHeart disease may be the most important measure of health care for rich countries \u2014 it\u2019s the leading cause of death in most, including the United States. Again, the U.S. falls below the OECD average, with heart disease death rates closer to those in Poland and Mexico than in Japan, Korea or France.\n\nAmericans are by far the fattest, with an obesity rate of 36.5 percent in 2011, compared to 32.4 percent in Mexico, 25.4 percent in Canada, 4.3 percent in Switzerland and 2.1 percent in India.\n\nAnd the U.S. is near the head of the pack in diabetes rates. Mexico\u2019s rates soar \u2014 they\u2019re at 15 percent of the population. But nearly 10 percent of Americans have diabetes, just about the same as in Poland and Chile, compared to less than 4 percent in Iceland and just over 4 percent in Sweden.\n\nThe report notes that Americans spend far more on health care than any other OECD country \u2014 $8,508 per capita in 2011, compared to $5,669 in Norway, the next highest-spending country, $4,522 in Canada, $3,405 in Britain and $3,213 in Japan. And we spend more as a country, too \u2014 17.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011, compared to 11.9 percent in the Netherlands, the next-highest country, and 9.3 percent on average for the OECD\n\nAmericans also spend more than average out-of-pocket for health care, just under 3 percent of total household budget, compared to 1.5 percent in Britain, France and the Netherlands.\n\nThere\u2019s a hint of where the U.S .is spending more: Americans get far more pricey magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams than anyone else \u2014 nearly 103 for every 1,000 people, or more than 10 percent of the population got an MRI in 2011. This compares to 55 per average for the OECD as a whole, 49.8 per 1,000 in Canada and just 3.8 per 1,000 in New Zealand.\n\nThe figures are even bigger for CT exams, with nearly 274 per 1,000 Americans getting a CT scan. Only Greece does more: 320 per 1,000, compared to an OECD average of 131 per 1,000.\n\nAmericans spend more on drugs, too \u2014 $985 a year per person on average, compared to $701 in Canada, $531 in Switzerland and $483 on average.\n\nBut Americans don\u2019t seem to have too many doctors The U.S. has fewer doctors per capita than most other countries, only 2.5 per 1,000 people, compared to 6.1 per 1,000 in Greece, 5 per 1,000 in Russia and about 3 or 4 per 1,000 in most European countries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are below average on most measures of health \u2014 from obesity to infant mortality \u2014 when compared with other rich countries, and they're falling behind on lifespan, too, according to the latest survey.The annual survey from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been used for years to show that the U.S.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/were-number-20-us-below-average-most-health-measures-2D11635080", "type": "article", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131121/2d9746111-131121-obesity-1240p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Americans are below average on most measures of health \u2014 from obesity to infant mortality \u2014 when compared with other rich countries, and they're falling behind on lifespan, too, according to the latest survey.The annual survey from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been used for years to show that the U.S."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Americans are below average on most measures of health \u2014 from obesity to infant mortality \u2014 when compared with other rich countries, and they're falling behind on lifespan, too, according to the latest survey.The annual survey from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been used for years to show that the U.S.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131121/2d9746111-131121-obesity-1240p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "We're No. 26!
