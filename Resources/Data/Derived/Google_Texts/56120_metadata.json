Because congressional Democrats howled for our heads, it took three years, four federal investigations and more than $2 million in tax dollars before The Times report was discredited and we were exonerated.\n\nIronically, we were accused of precisely the same pattern of government-media corruption at the heart of Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s new blockbuster, \u201cStonewalled.\u201d Her path-breaking CBS News investigative reports uncovered \u201cphony scandals\u201d from Fast and Furious to Benghazi and Obamacare. All were inconvenient truths that the Obama White House constantly stonewalled \u2014 hence the title and three of her eight chapters. Those revelations alone compare favorably with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the canonical account of Watergate and the crimes of President Nixon.\n\nWith the heart of a lion and a beaver colony\u2019s work ethic, Mrs. Attkisson also possesses the lockjawed determination of a pit bull. She needed that courage in 2012, when a \u201cwell-informed acquaintance\u201d with intelligence connections warned that her Benghazi stories were raising eyebrows. \u201cKeep at it. But you\u2019d better watch out.\u201d Her Deep Throat added, \u201cThe average American would be shocked at the extent to which this administration is conducting surveillance on private citizens.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Mrs. Attkisson\u2019s phones and computers began acting strangely. As she prepared to confront Ambassador Thomas Pickering about his Benghazi report, \u201cSuddenly the data in my computer file begins wiping at hyperspeed before my very eyes. Deleted line by line a split second: it\u2019s gone, gone, gone.\u201d While they might have been remaking the movie \u201cEnemy of the State,\u201d an exhaustive forensics analysis of Mrs. Attkisson\u2019s iMac found evidence of classified documents planted deep in her hard drive; systematic intrusions allowing remote control of her personal files; most damning of all, \u201ca backdoor link to an ISP address for a government computer.\u201d It was slam-dunk confirmation of a deliberately planned government penetration, all predictably denied by Eric Holder Jr.\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nMrs. Attkisson sees those attacks as the covert side of a White House public relations strategy aimed at \u201ccontroversializing potentially damaging stories, reporters and opponents to undermine them\u201d rather than challenging their arguments. When Jonathan Karl of ABC uncovered evidence of another White House cover-up on Benghazi, \u201cI felt sorry for Karl. He doesn\u2019t have a chance against the White House spin machine, its surrogates on the Web and a complicit media on Obama\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nThis is a shocking assertion coming from a veteran CBS News reporter. Yet Mrs. Attkisson never fires more effectively than when taking dead-aim at CBS. Her in-house memo concerning a Benghazi report by \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Scott Pelley states: \u201cTonight\u2019s CBS story is inaccurate, misleading and unfair. It may as well have been written by the White House.\u201d Mr. Pelley\u2019s report also failed to mention that the president\u2019s deputy national security director, Ben Rhodes, is \u201cthe brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.\u201d Brotherly love, gentlemen, or just another cover-up?\n\nEven more damning, CBS concealed a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview of President Obama the day after the Benghazi attacks. The full transcript of that interview clearly indicated that the president consciously avoided using the word \u201cterrorist\u201d \u2014 despite his assertions to the contrary while debating Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t [CBS] have immediately released the operative sound bite after Romney raised (it)? \u2026 We had our hands on original material that no other news outlets had But we hid it I feared that we\u2019d once again mischaracterized facts in advance of a presidential election to hurt a Republican .\u201d The nonreaction from CBS News President David Rhodes: \u201cLook, we [screwed] up.\u201d\n\nThe author documents many other examples of intimate relationships between the Obama White House and media elites. In this three-ring circus, the elephants and clowns constantly change costumes. One post-publication confirmation: White House spokesman Jay Carney\u2019s seamless transition into a CNN \u201canalyst.\u201d Worst of all, \u201cunder a new, popular African-American, Democratic president, few are as eager to point fingers\u201d at possible wrongdoing.\n\nInstead, Mrs. Attkisson suggests that the press has been trivialized into a spin cycle where big media and big business play constant access games, where \u201cAstroTurf\u201d masquerades as genuine grass-roots movements. While serious issues are starving for in-depth media coverage, every governmental agency operates its own PR machine \u2014 all at taxpayer expense.\n\nThe differences between my 2008 experience and what Sharyl Attkisson reveals in this marvelous book: Intelligence has become more intrusive, the media more ideological and the government incomparably more powerful \u2014 and all seem determined to squelch either people or issues that get in their way. Just ask Dinesh D\u2019Souza.\n\nKen Allard, a retired Army colonel, is a military analyst and author on national-security issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Full disclosure first: I was one of those military analysts regularly seen on network television until a 2008 New York Times expose accused us of succumbing to improper influences by the Rumsfeld Pentagon.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Full disclosure first: I was one of those military analysts regularly seen on network television until a 2008 New York Times expose accused us of succumbing to improper influences by the Rumsfeld Pentagon.", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Stonewalled\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/4/book-review-conducting-surveillance-on-private-cit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/114_2014_51db9heujtl-sl500-8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/114_2014_51db9heujtl-sl500-8201.jpg", "description": "Full disclosure first: I was one of those military analysts regularly seen on network television until a 2008 New York Times expose accused us of succumbing to improper influences by the Rumsfeld Pent", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Stonewalled\u2019"}, "Author": "Ken Allard - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Sharyl Attkisson, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf0b\"", "article_summary": "All were inconvenient truths that the Obama White House constantly stonewalled \u2014 hence the title and three of her eight chapters.\nWith the heart of a lion and a beaver colony\u2019s work ethic, Mrs. Attkisson also possesses the lockjawed determination of a pit bull.\nWhen Jonathan Karl of ABC uncovered evidence of another White House cover-up on Benghazi, \u201cI felt sorry for Karl.\nHer in-house memo concerning a Benghazi report by \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Scott Pelley states: \u201cTonight\u2019s CBS story is inaccurate, misleading and unfair.\nAs she prepared to confront Ambassador Thomas Pickering about his Benghazi report, \u201cSuddenly the data in my computer file begins wiping at hyperspeed before my very eyes."}
