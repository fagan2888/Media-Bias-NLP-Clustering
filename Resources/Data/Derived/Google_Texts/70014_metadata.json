For decades, too many working Americans went without the security of health insurance \u2014 and their financial well-being suffered because of it.\n\nWe\u2019ve begun to change that. As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, we\u2019ve covered 17.6 million Americans. Since 2010, the uninsured rate has decreased by 45%. And for the first time, more than 90% of Americans are covered.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t gotten covered yet, or if you care about someone who hasn\u2019t gotten covered yet, now\u2019s your chance. It\u2019s open enrollment season for the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nWhat that means is, with a few clicks on HealthCare.gov, you\u2019ll find private insurance companies competing for your business. You can compare plans and choose the one that\u2019s right for your family. In fact, most Americans will find an option that costs less than $75 a month. Even if you already have insurance through the Marketplace, check it out. Shopping around can save you a lot of money \u2014 last year, consumers who shopped saved almost $400.\n\nTake the story of a man named Phil Viso, who emailed me earlier this year. Phil\u2019s a software developer from my hometown of Chicago. Last winter, he had an idea for a new app and decided to start his own company. And that can be scary when you need to get your own insurance. But Phil logged on to HealthCare.gov, answered a few questions, picked a plan, and even found out he was eligible for a tax credit that saved him money.\n\nHere\u2019s what he wrote: \u2018I\u2019m still sort of in shock about how great the experience of signing up for health care was\u2026I will have a lot to worry about over the course of the year as I try to get my app released, but thankfully, good health care will not be one of those worries.\u2019\n\nAfter he sent me that email, Phil ended up getting a new and better job anyway. But that\u2019s the whole point of health insurance. Peace of mind. And under the Affordable Care Act, if you want to change jobs, go back to school, or chase that new idea, you can do it without worrying about going broke if you get sick. If you\u2019ve got a pre-existing condition \u2014 diabetes or cancer or heartburn or a heart attack \u2014 you can no longer be charged more or denied coverage. You can no longer be charged more just for being a woman. And preventive care like checkups and immunizations now come with no additional out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about is no longer just a law, and it\u2019s certainly not the myths and scare tactics that the cynics have peddled our way for years. This is reality. This is health care in America. And the bottom line is, Americans like it. They\u2019re happy with their plans and their premiums.\n\nSo join them. Give it a shot. Check out HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596 to find a plan that\u2019s right for you or someone you care about.\n\nAnd by the way \u2014 if you live in one of the 20 cities participating in our Healthy Communities Challenge, I want to see how many of your neighbors you can get signed up. I\u2019ll come visit the city that enrolls the highest percentage of folks who aren\u2019t covered right now. That\u2019s a promise.\n\nAfter all, this country is at its best when we look out for each other. And together, we can help more Americans get the security that they and their families deserve.\n\nThanks everybody. Have a great weekend.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama: Affordable Care Act 'Not the Myths And Scare Tactics' 'Cynics Have Peddled'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama: Affordable Care Act 'Not the Myths And Scare Tactics' 'Cynics Have Peddled'", "title": "Obama: Affordable Care Act 'Not the Myths And Scare Tactics' 'Cynics Have Peddled' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Obama-117-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/07/obama-affordable-care-act-not-the-myths-and-scare-tactics-cynics-have-peddled/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: Affordable Care Act 'Not the Myths And Scare Tactics' 'Cynics Have Peddled'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Obama-117-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Obama: Affordable Care Act 'Not the Myths And Scare Tactics' 'Cynics Have Peddled' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act,Breitbart TV, Obama, Obamacare,Affordable Care Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-11-07T07:30:48-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Check out HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596 to find a plan that\u2019s right for you or someone you care about.\nI\u2019ll come visit the city that enrolls the highest percentage of folks who aren\u2019t covered right now.\nFor decades, too many working Americans went without the security of health insurance \u2014 and their financial well-being suffered because of it.\nYou can compare plans and choose the one that\u2019s right for your family.\nIt\u2019s open enrollment season for the Health Insurance Marketplace."}
