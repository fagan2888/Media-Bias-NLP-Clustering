He entered the stage to introduce singer Rita Ora, and once the crowd booed loudly, he stripped down to his boxers and socks.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t feel comfortable unless I\u2019m in my Calvin\u2019s. So, what\u2019s up? Is that cool?\u201d Bieber said to his co-presenter, model Lara Stone.\n\nSome cheered once he removed his blazer, tank top and pants.\n\nNew York Giants\u2019 receiver Victor Cruz was also booed before he introduced breakthrough reggae-pop band MAGIC! The Giants lost to the Detroit Lions on Monday.\n\nThose moments were contrasted by the rump-shaking dance moves of Jennifer Lopez and Nicki Minaj. Lopez performed her new single, \u201cBooty,\u201d in a shimmery silver minidress. She enticed the crowd and earned some of the night\u2019s loudest cheers.\n\nLopez clapped and watched as Minaj performed \u201cAnaconda,\u201d also a crowd favorite. The rapper danced in a denim skirt with a number of background dancers, including shirtless men.\n\nUsher kicked off the two-hour show that aired on CBS, which included fiery performances from Jennifer Hudson, Enrique Iglesias and the Band Perry.\n\nModels walked onstage as some of the performers sang.\n\nKiss closed the special with \u201cRock and Roll All Nite.\u201d Other performers included Duran Duran, Nico & Vinz, Afrojack, Pitbull and Luke Bryan.\n\nNaomi Campbell and Paris Hilton were among the presenters.
