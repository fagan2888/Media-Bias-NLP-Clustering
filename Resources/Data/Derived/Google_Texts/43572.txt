Last week, a tragic shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee claimed the lives of four Marines, while also wounding two other men and a Chattanooga Police officer.

The shooting occurred at the Naval Marine Corps Reserve base near Amnicola Highway which is, according to WCRB TV in Chattanooga, where Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning came by to support the police and military members suffering after the loss of their friends.

The police confirmed the visit by posting a pic of Manning and an officer on Twitter.

Thank you for stopping by and for your support Peyton Manning #chanews pic.twitter.com/UgaLHvrFXR â€” Chattanooga Police (@ChattanoogaPD) July 19, 2015

Manning started his NFL career with the Colts and now lives in Denver. But he is flat-out revered in Tennessee, where he played college football for the Volunteers. (I went to high school in Chattanooga and the level of love for Manning there can't be overstated.) His visit certainly meant a lot.

It's also a classic Manning-type visit too. He showed up, did good for the lives of others and didn't make any noise about it.

We've seen Manning go the extra mile to meet North Pole fans, quietly pay tribute to a young Broncos fan who passed and send a letter to the mother of a Colts fan she lost.

In short, Manning's known for a lot of things -- both good and bad -- he does on the field. But his off-field stuff continues to have an incredible impact on football fans.
