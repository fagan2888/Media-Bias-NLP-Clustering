First, our plan would result in a rate decrease for citizens of Puerto Rico \u2014 not an increase, as Feliciano writes. Second, far from placing PREPA at the mercy of interest rate increases, the bondholder plan results in a marked decrease in debt service costs using a fixed rate.\n\nFeliciano\u2019s contention that the PREPA bondholder plan results in a 15 percent electricity rate increase demonstrates a failure to grasp the facts of our proposal. Ironically, the reality is almost the exact opposite of his claim. As outlined in the version of our plan that we released publicly in late July, our proposal would result in Puerto Rican electricity rates being roughly 15 percent lower than PREPA\u2019s \u201cstatus quo\u201d rate. We used the average August 2014 electricity rate because this was when we started negotiations, so it\u2019s the benchmark we have been using throughout this process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo explain further, consider that there are three primary factors that determine the rate a utility has to charge: Debt service (which our plan addresses), operating expenses and fuel costs.\n\nLet\u2019s start with debt service cost. We are voluntarily offering permanent, material reductions in the cost of debt service, with the average interest rate going from 5.45 percent (which is what it would be under PREPA\u2019s proposal) to 4.11 percent. Our plan also includes more than three years of additional liquidity relief than PREPA\u2019s previous proposal.\n\nIn terms of operating expenses, one way for PREPA to reduce operating expenses is by investing in and upgrading its antiquated and inefficient generation capacity. By accepting a delay in principal repayments, the bondholder plan frees up $2.5 billion for capital investments to improve generation efficiency without the need for external financing. Ultimately, these investments benefit consumers with a more modern and reliable utility.\n\nFuel cost is the third variable. Contrary to Feliciano\u2019s assertions, our plan is not based on using rate increases to pay the debt. The simple fact is that fuel costs are presently far lower than they were when we prepared our original projections (again, based on August of 2014). Using today\u2019s fuel costs coupled with the interest rate and efficiency savings previously mentioned, electric rates for PREPA customers will be even lower than previously projected.\n\nNow, turning to the claim that the bond structure we would propose would mean \u201cPuerto Rico takes the risk of future changes in interest rates.\u201d Simply not true. Our plan assumes fixed interest rates. While these rates vary from bond to bond based on the year of the maturity, they are set at the date of issuance and would not change \u2014 no matter what interest rates do.\n\nThe bottom line is that the bondholders\u2019 plan is good for PREPA, and good for the people of Puerto Rico. We have put a workable solution on the table \u2014 the question now is whether PREPA will agree to a mutually beneficial way forward.\n\nSpencer is a managing director at Houlihan Lokey and is the financial advisor to the PREPA bondholders.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Our plan would result in a rate decrease for citizens of the Puerto Rico \u2014 not an increase.", "description": "Our plan would result in a rate decrease for citizens of the Puerto Rico \u2014 not an increase.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Our plan would result in a rate decrease for citizens of the Puerto Rico \u2014 not an increase.", "title": "Setting the record straight on the plan for PREPA", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/251280-setting-the-record-straight-on-the-plan-for-prepa", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/251280-setting-the-record-straight-on-the-plan-for-prepa", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-17T13:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Stephen Spencer", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-17T13:30:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/251280-setting-the-record-straight-on-the-plan-for-prepa", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Our plan would result in a rate decrease for citizens of the Puerto Rico \u2014 not an increase.", "card": "summary", "title": "Setting the record straight on the plan for PREPA"}, "dcterms.title": "Setting the record straight on the plan for PREPA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2932\"", "article_summary": "Second, far from placing PREPA at the mercy of interest rate increases, the bondholder plan results in a marked decrease in debt service costs using a fixed rate.\nThe bottom line is that the bondholders\u2019 plan is good for PREPA, and good for the people of Puerto Rico.\nFeliciano\u2019s contention that the PREPA bondholder plan results in a 15 percent electricity rate increase demonstrates a failure to grasp the facts of our proposal.\nContrary to Feliciano\u2019s assertions, our plan is not based on using rate increases to pay the debt.\nOur plan assumes fixed interest rates."}
