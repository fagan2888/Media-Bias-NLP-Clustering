Some see them as liberators.\n\n\u201cI hope God supports them and makes them victorious over the oppression of al-Maliki,\u201d said 80-year-old Abu Thaer.\n\nHe spoke at the Khazer checkpoint on the northern frontier of the largely autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq, 65 miles (105 kilometers) from Mosul. Five veiled women and six children were crammed into the back seat of his car.\n\nThey were among tens of thousands of people who fled their homes as Islamic State fighters and other Sunni militants seized much of northern Iraq, including Mosul and Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown of Tikrit.\n\nMany Sunni Arab men and women said they left, not because they feared the insurgents, but because of the risk of retaliatory airstrikes by Iraqi government forces.\n\nTheir return underscores the profound sectarianism cleaving Iraq and the depth of anger that many Sunnis harbor toward al-Maliki\u2019s government, which they accuse of discrimination and harassment and pushing Sunnis to the political margins.\n\n\u201cWe see that they have made Mosul better,\u201d said Abu Mohammed, a 34-year-old taxi driver who ferries returnees back to the city. \u201cThe water is back. The electricity is back. The prices are lower.\u201d\n\nThe anger many Iraqis felt toward al-Maliki\u2019s government only increased after soldiers abandoned Mosul, fleeing before civilians. It\u2019s likely that many Iraqi troops fled because they sensed insurgents would be welcomed by long-resentful Sunnis, and they did not want to risk their lives for a senseless battle.\n\n\u201cThe army was only good at oppressing Sunnis, but it was nothing more,\u201d Abu Thaer said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how many Iraqis sought to return to Mosul. But during a single hour on Friday afternoon, an Associated Press reporter saw an 18-seat bus crammed with men, women and children and their luggage. A taxi driver was making regular trips to the city. And about seven other families were crammed into four vehicles, heading home.\n\nMany of those who fled said relatives who remained in Mosul began urging them to come back, saying the Sunni insurgents had restored power, water and were promising not to harm returning residents.\n\nIn a move that immediately improved their popularity, insurgents also emptied out prisons, said 22-year-old Abu Sulaf. The young man said mostly Shiite forces had harassed and unfairly detained many Sunnis.\n\nIslamic State fighters also removed concrete barricades that snarled traffic through the city and lengthened commutes, often by hours, residents said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "author": "Diaa Hadid", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "title": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/only_days_after_mosul_fell_iraqis_start_returning/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-iraq-returning-to-mosul.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-iraq-returning-to-mosul.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Only days after Mosul fell, Iraqis start returning", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf10\"", "article_summary": "The prices are lower.\u201dThe anger many Iraqis felt toward al-Maliki\u2019s government only increased after soldiers abandoned Mosul, fleeing before civilians.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsKALAK, Iraq (AP) \u2014 Days after Iraq\u2019s second-largest city fell to al-Qaida-inspired fighters, some Iraqis are already returning to Mosul, lured back by insurgents offering cheap gas and food, restoring power and water and removing traffic barricades.\n\u201cWe see that they have made Mosul better,\u201d said Abu Mohammed, a 34-year-old taxi driver who ferries returnees back to the city.\nMany of those who fled said relatives who remained in Mosul began urging them to come back, saying the Sunni insurgents had restored power, water and were promising not to harm returning residents.\nMany people appear excited to return, taking sectarian pride in the extremist Sunni group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."}
