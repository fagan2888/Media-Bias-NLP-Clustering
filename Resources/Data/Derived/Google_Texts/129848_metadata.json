The government provides a substantial tax break for employer-sponsored insurance, and, as a matter of equity and fairness, lawmakers said employers should not provide more generous coverage to a select group of high-paid employees.\n\nBut translating that goal into reality has proved difficult.\n\nOfficials at the Internal Revenue Service said they were wrestling with complicated questions like how to measure the value of employee health benefits, how to define \"highly compensated\" and what exactly constitutes discrimination.\n\nBruce I. Friedland, a spokesman for the I.R.S., said employers would not have to comply until the agency issued regulations or other guidance.\n\nMore from The NYT:\n\nPresident Obama signed the health care law in March 2010. The ban on discriminatory health benefits was supposed to take effect six months later. Administration officials said then that they needed more time to develop rules and that the rules would be issued well before this month, when other major provisions of the law took effect.\n\nA similar ban on discrimination, adopted more than 30 years ago, already applies to employers that serve as their own insurers. The new law extends that policy to employers that buy insurance from commercial carriers like Aetna, Cigna, Humana and WellPoint, or from local Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.\n\nThis could eventually be a boon to workers, the administration says.\n\n\"Under the Affordable Care Act, for the first time, all group health plans will be prohibited from offering coverage only to their highest-paid employees,\" said Erin Donar, a Treasury spokeswoman. \"The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and the Treasury are working on rules that will implement this requirement.\"\n\nThe enforcement delay is another in a series of deadline extensions, transition rules, policy shifts and other steps by the Obama administration to minimize disruption from the new health care law, which is sure to be invoked by both Democrats and Republicans running for office this fall.\n\nIn recent months, the administration has delayed a requirement that larger employers offer coverage to full-time employees and delayed online enrollment in the federal insurance exchange for small businesses. It waived major provisions of the 2010 health law so consumers could renew policies that would otherwise have been canceled or terminated because they did not meet the law's coverage requirements.\n\nIn addition, federal officials announced that people with canceled insurance policies could obtain hardship exemptions sparing them from tax penalties if they went without insurance this year.\n\nOne of the questions facing the I.R.S. is whether an employer violates the law if it offers the same health insurance to all employees but large numbers of low-paid workers turn down the offer and instead obtain coverage from other sources, like a health insurance exchange.\n\nSome health insurance arrangements will almost surely be forbidden, officials said. For example, they said, employers will not be able to provide coverage only to management.\n\nLikewise, the officials said, a company could not provide free coverage to \"highly compensated individuals\" while requiring other employees to pay, for example, 25 percent of the cost. In addition, they said, benefits available to the dependents of highly paid executives must be available on the same terms to dependents of other employees in the health plan.\n\nUnder the 2010 law, an employer that has a fully insured health plan that discriminates in favor of high-paid executives could face a steep penalty: an excise tax of $100 a day for each individual affected negatively.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Tax officials said they would not enforce the rule this year because they had yet to issue regulations for employers to follow.
