Is nothing sacred?\n\n1. Rush Limbaugh: The pope rips America, causing Obama to orgasm! And then Mandela really showed those American blacks how to do civil rights!\n\nThe man who has continually raised the ante on outrageousness brought his A-game this week, starting with comments about Pope Francis and President Obama. \u201cThe pope is ripping capitalism, ripping trickledown economics, ripping America. And Obama is having an orgasm,\u201d Limbaugh spewed. \u201cThe pope has co-opted Obama.\u201d Because what really gets this president\u2019s motor going is \u201cripping this country apart.\u201d (Are you listening, Michelle?) Obama demonstrated his ejaculatory pleasure in criticizing America a few days later when he had the audacity to say that \u201cincreasing inequality is most pronounced in this country.\u201d The nerve!\n\nNelson Mandela\u2019s death provided fodder for the right-wing radio ranter to reach new paroxysms of offensiveness and denounce the civil rights movement in America, which of course helped bring about Obama\u2019s presidency. Here\u2019s his case:\n\n\u201cNelson Mandela actually lived through the indignities, the punishment, the discrimination, the horrors of the South African apartheid system. Came out of it \u2014 you realize when he was inaugurated president, he invited as his special guests the white jailers from his Robben Island prison? He literally did forgive everybody. \u201cNelson Mandela would not qualify as a civil rights leader in this country with that philosophy. They can\u2019t let it go. It\u2019s become too big a business. They will not let it go. Mandela let it go. It\u2019s just \u2014 amazing.\u201d\n\nOf course, Mandela went on to decry the ongoing \u201ccancer of racism\u201d in America and elsewhere. He did not think racism had ended (unlike the RNC, it seems: see item #3 below).\n\n(h/t: mediamatters)\n\n2. Sarah Palin: Thomas Jefferson and I agree. Those meanie atheists are trying to abort Christ from Christmas.\n\nSarah Palin managed to combine those dreaded atheists with abortion, Christ-killing and the dastardly war on Christmas all in one fell swoop in a speech at Liberty University. She was, of course, promoting her new book Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, and the former not full-term Alaska governor is nothing if not good at self-promotion.\n\nShe also revealed a new talent for channeling the founding fathers. She knows exactly what Thomas Jefferson would do if he were alive today: He\u2019d go on Fox News to complain about the war on Christmas. In other words, he\u2019d be Sarah Palin.\n\nThat\u2019s because\u2014and this might come as a surprise to those who have read the part of the constitution about separation of church and state\u2014Jefferson and his buds wrote the constitution specifically for religious people. Nonreligious people, in other words, amoral people, are not capable of understanding the constitution, and they are therefore not able to follow its precepts.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from this marvelous bit of oratory:\n\n\u201cIf you lose that foundation, John Adams was implicitly warning us, then we will not follow our constitution, there will be no reason to follow our constitution because it is a moral and religious people who understand that there is something greater than self, we are to live selflessly, and we are to be held accountable by our creator, so that is what our constitution is based on.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some more rambling after that, but you get the idea.\n\nFrom there, she jumped back to her favorite topic and the one that promotes her book, saying Jefferson would agree with her that \u201cangry atheists armed with an attorney\u201d had set their sights on destroying the religious themes in Christmas celebrations.\n\n\u201cWhy is it they get to claim some offense taken when they see a plastic Jewish family on somebody\u2019s lawn\u2014a nativity scene, that\u2019s basically what it is, right?\u201d\n\nA plastic Jewish family. Is that in the scripture?\n\n(h/t Raw Story)\n\n3. Tin-eared RNC: Racism and sexism have ended.\n\nThe national Republicans deftly demonstrated how they can appeal to both women and blacks this week. They started offering lessons to candidates on how not to say offensive things about women, especially when you are running against one, as Todd \u201clegitimate rape\u201d Akin did. Clearly, a steep learning curve there. Emergency reinforcements may be needed.\n\nOver the weekend, the RNC declared that racism has ended in a tweet marking the anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and celebrating Rosa Parks\u2019 famous act of civil disobedience. \u201cToday we remember Rosa Parks\u2019 bold stand and her role in ending racism,\u201d they said. Hilarious tweets ensued under hashtag #racismendedwhen, with answers like \u201cwhen Mr. Drummond adopted Arnold and Willis,\u201d \u201cwhen Bill Clinton played the sax on Arsenio Hall\u201d and \u201cwhen the Fresh Prince moved to Bel-Air.\u201d\n\nRealizing their mistake after, well, millions of people ridiculed them, the RNC amended the tweet, \u201cclarified it,\u201d by saying Parks fought to end racism. But, let\u2019s face it, they really think racism has ended. We\u2019ve got a black president and the Supreme Court itself ruled there is no need for a Voting Rights Act anymore. That ought to settle it.\n\nDoes anyone still wonder why more than 90 percent of black America votes for anyone but the GOP?\n\n4. Rick Santorum: Obamacare is like apartheid. And I am like Mandela. O\u2019Reilly: Oh, you mean that commie?\n\nWow. Flabbergasting things happen when you combine two idiots on Fox with the death of a great man.\n\nHere\u2019s Santorum on Mandela:\n\n\u201cHe was fighting against some great injustice, and I would make the argument that we have a great injustice going on right now in this country with an ever-increasing size of government that is taking over and controlling people\u2019s lives\u2014and Obamacare is front and center in that.\u201d\n\nApartheid and affordable healthcare. Yes, very similar. And that would, of course, make you Mandela-like in fighting this injustice. Amirite? We\u2019ve seen some questionable analogies before, i.e. Obamacare and Katrina, Obamacare and the Fugitive Slave Act, Obamacare and the Nuremberg Laws, but this one might be the biggest doozy of them all.
