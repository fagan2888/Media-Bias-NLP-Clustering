The survey of 20,000 physicians also shows only 17 percent in solo practice. Eighty-one percent of doctors are at full capacity or even overextended. Forty-six percent grade Obamacare as a D or an F. Just 25 percent give the law an A or a B.\n\nFor those greatly frustrated by the system, Turner said the government is making their lives miserable.\n\n\u201cThe doctors cannot navigate this incredible bureaucracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may see 40 patients during a day, and then they have mountains of paperwork to fill out. If they slip up and say something in carelessness or not understanding the rules and make a mistake, they could be subject to tens of thousands of dollars in fines. They just cannot expose themselves to that kind of jeopardy.\u201d\n\nTurner said there are two groups involved in shrinking the supply of doctors. First, she said experienced doctors are simply retiring rather than jumping through Obamacare\u2019s bureaucratic hoops.\n\n\u201cSome of the more seasoned, experienced, established physicians are just taking down their shingle and saying, \u2018We have had it. We cannot deal with this cookbook medicine. We cannot fight the rules and regulations and legal jeopardy we\u2019re in.'\u201d\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Thirty-nine percent say they are accelerating retirement plans.\n\nThe other trend is doctors merging with hospitals and leaving independent practice.\n\n\u201cA number of physicians who are younger and still have bills to pay and families to support are selling their practices to hospitals, which mean that they basically become employees and have to do what the hospitals say,\u201d Turner said.\n\nThe Physicians Foundation report finds that 53 percent of physicians describe themselves as hospital or medical group employees, up from 38 percent in 2008.\n\nTurner said their logic makes sense.\n\n\u201cThey really are buying the protection of these big hospital chains, which can hire an army of doctors and bureaucrats to try to help them navigate the bureaucracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bureaucratization of American medicine is well underway and that does not bode well for patients.\u201d\n\nShe says it\u2019s bad for patients in two ways, first because of the realities of being a doctor employed by a hospital.\n\n\u201cNow they have to follow these very strict rules and regulations of these big hospital systems in order to treat a patient. If they don\u2019t, they may either not be paid but they also could be penalized,\u201d said Turner, who is also very worried that the notion of playing it safe is stifling innovation and preventing the development of better treatments.\n\n\u201cBoth the doctors who stay in practice, and even more the medical students who apply and are accepted, are people who want to work a 40-hour week,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfectly happy to follow this cookbook medicine standardization and to not rock the boat by trying to do something innovative that might actually teach us something.\u201d\n\nLike the reporting you see here?

She said cancer patients in Canada can wait up to 16 weeks or more for care after receiving a diagnosis, a span she acknowledges can be a \u201cdeath sentence.\u201d\n\nIn addition to losing good doctors, Turner said doctors are often brought in from other countries, and that can prove very challenging for patients as well.\n\n\u201cWhen you drive out the established physicians who are saying they are not willing to practice under these kinds of conditions, you still have to have physicians,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe do have many foreign medical graduates in this country, and patients complain that they have a physician who they really can\u2019t communicate with.\u201d\n\nBut while excoriating the mountain of rules and regulations Washington is piling onto physicians and others in the medical community, Turner said Americans should never doubt how much doctors and nurses want to help people.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the nurses and the doctors that are still taking care of patients, it is so inspiring to see how much they continue to want to practice good medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are devoted to their patients. But they are so stressed in many cases and so frustrated, saying, \u2018I got into this business to take care of patients, not to fill out all this paperwork and bureaucracy.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Mountains of Obamacare-related paperwork and the threats of severe fines for the slightest errors are forcing many doctors to retire and others to shut down their practices and work under the protection of hospitals, and\u00a0all of it spells bad news for patients.
