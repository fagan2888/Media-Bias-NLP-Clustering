The panel still thinks saturated fat should be restricted, noting that overconsumption \u201cmay pose the greatest risk to those over 50 years old.\u201d Saturated fat \u2014 a type of fat that\u2019s solid at room temperature \u2014 is thought to raise the level of \u201cbad,\u201d or LDL, cholesterol in the bloodstream.\n\nSo why the shift away from warnings about cholesterol in food? Criticism of the assumption that cholesterol in the diet results in cholesterol buildup in our arteries has been going on for years, but recent research may finally have gotten more attention.\n\n\u201cThere have been multiple analyses and meta-analyses now looking at intake of dietary cholesterol and the risk of heart disease,\u201d Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., dean of the school of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University, told Time.com. \u201cIn the general population, there\u2019s really not any strong evidence for a link.\u201d\n\nOther experts agree it was time for nutrition policy to catch up to research. Steven Nissen, M.D., chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, told USA Today, \u201cIt\u2019s the right decision. We got the dietary guidelines wrong.\u201d\n\nAs for why it took so long, Gary Taubes, author of \u201cGood Calories, Bad Calories,\u201d a history of the science behind the low-fat diet craze, thinks health authorities have harped on cutting cholesterol in the diet all these years because they wanted to stick with a simpler consumer message than the research indicated.\n\n\u201cSome of the most reliable facts about the diet-heart hypothesis have been consistently ignored by public health authorities because they complicated the message, while the least reliable findings were adopted because they didn\u2019t,\u201d he wrote in an email. It\u2019s easier to tell people to \u201cavoid egg yolks\u201d instead of telling them \u201cthey should worry about cholesterol in their blood, but not in their diet.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that the proposed recommendations are talking about an egg or so a day being OK for healthy people. If you already have heart disease or elevated cholesterol, talk to your health care provider.\n\nPhoto: Valengilda/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The government\u2019s new dietary guidelines, due to be released in the coming months, may contain an about-face on decades of advice not to eat cholesterol-rich food.
