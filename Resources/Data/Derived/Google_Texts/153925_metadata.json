But that may change next year, if the College of St. Joseph\u2019s in Rutland is able to launch the state\u2019s first graduate PA program.\n\nPhysician assistants are midlevel health providers that typically practice medicine alongside a supervising physician.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for physician assistants is expected to increase 38 percent from 2012 to 2022. Experts say that\u2019s due to an aging population, a shortage of primary care doctors and an increase in the number of insured people under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAn abundance of jobs, the relatively short schooling - two years of post graduate training required to become a PA - and annual salaries in the $80,000 to $90,000 range have made it a highly desirable field.\n\nBut there aren\u2019t enough accredited programs to meet demand.\n\nCatherine Gemmiti, a licensed Physician Assistant who has experience launching and directing several PA programs, was hired this fall by the College of St. Joseph\u2019s in Rutland to develop and direct what will be the first graduate PA program in Vermont.\n\nGemmiti says historic buildings in Proctor formally owned by the Omya Corporation will provide spacious classrooms.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge right now to starting any clinical programs,\u201d she says, \u201cis obtaining clinical sites.\u201d\n\nBecause besides labs and classrooms, students also need hands-on training in a variety of health care facilities.\n\nGemmiti she says in the short time she\u2019s been in Rutland she\u2019s been excited by potential opportunities to collaborate with different facilities across the state and region.\n\nShe says the program will need to be accredited, but if all goes well, the first class of 26 students will begin in the summer of 2016.\n\nGemmiti says the college hopes to gradually expand the program to 40 students.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Vermonters interested in pursuing a career as a physician assistant have always had to get their training outside the state.
