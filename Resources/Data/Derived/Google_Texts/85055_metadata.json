But she\u2019ll be without insurance for another couple of months because the plan doesn\u2019t kick in until January.\n\nVideo by Megan Burks\n\nHere\u2019s Matsumoto\u2019s question:\n\n\u201cHer concern is, you know, what happens between October and January if she has another surprise medical emergency?\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: The Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t offer special gap coverage unless you\u2019re low-income.\n\nAll Covered California plans won\u2019t go into effect until Jan. 1. The health reform law doesn\u2019t have provisions to protect people from emergency costs in the interim.\n\nMatsumoto\u2019s friend could try to take out a private policy and cancel it in January, but the new protections for people with pre-existing conditions also don\u2019t go into effect until next year. So the chances she\u2019ll be denied coverage are pretty high, as are the likely premiums, said Linda Keller, the executive vice president of San Diego-based insurance brokerage Intercare.\n\nThere is gap coverage, however, for low-income people who will be newly eligible for Medi-Cal next year. It\u2019s called the Low Income Health Plan and it\u2019s run through the county. Individuals must make less than $1,238 a month to qualify.\n\nThe Orders: Cross your fingers and be careful.\n\nThe choices are limited for Matsumoto\u2019s friend. She can explore the private market to see whether there\u2019s a catastrophic plan that will take her.\n\nUpdate: There may be help through program called the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program. Californians who cannot obtain health insurance because of a pre-existing condition and who are not eligible for Medicare or Cobra may be able to pay for benefits through the state.\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
