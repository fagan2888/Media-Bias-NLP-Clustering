The child's parents in 2008 filed a lawsuit that led to the $4.1 million verdict.\n\nBut the appeals court said a circuit judge, in part, limited the two sides to \"one expert per specialty.\" That judge retired before the case was resolved, and Wednesday's ruling said the child's attorneys called four pathologists to testify about the timing and diagnosis of the disease.\n\nAlso, the ruling pointed to an attorney's misstatement of expert testimony in closing arguments.\n\n\"The unfair use of expert testimony in this case requires a new trial,'' said the ruling, written by Judge Leslie Rothenberg and joined by judges Frank Shepherd and Edwin Scales. \"Dr. Vargas may or may not ultimately be responsible for Monica's injuries, but he is certainly entitled to the fair trial of which he was deprived.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Pointing to the unfair use of expert witnesses, a South Florida appeals court Wednesday ordered a new trial in a medical-malpractice case that led to a $4", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/court-overturns-41m-medical-malpractice-verdict", "image": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/sites/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201302/Stethoscope%20and%20medical%20file.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Pointing to the unfair use of expert witnesses, a South Florida appeals court Wednesday ordered a new trial in a medical-malpractice case that led to a $4", "title": "Court Overturns $4.1M Medical Malpractice Verdict"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 306, "dc": {"title": "Court Overturns $4.1M Medical Malpractice Verdict"}, "nid": 11769, "datePublished": "2015-08-27", "story_id": 435147769, "keywords": "medical malpractice, misdiagnosis", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f27\"", "article_summary": "The case has centered, at least in part, on the cause of the child's kidney problems and whether Vargas misdiagnosed the disease.\nAlso, the ruling pointed to an attorney's misstatement of expert testimony in closing arguments.\nBut the appeals court said a circuit judge, in part, limited the two sides to \"one expert per specialty.\"\nThe court ruled in favor of pediatrician Jose Luis Vargas, who treated the child for six years after she was born in 2000.\n\"The unfair use of expert testimony in this case requires a new trial,'' said the ruling, written by Judge Leslie Rothenberg and joined by judges Frank Shepherd and Edwin Scales."}
