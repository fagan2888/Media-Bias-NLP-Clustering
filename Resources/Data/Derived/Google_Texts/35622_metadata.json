Part two will run in Tuesday\u2019s edition of the Auburn Journal.\n\nCharlene Sanborn loved being a mother to her three boys, and when they were grown she loved being a grandmother to their children. She would drop everything to babysit her grandchildren. In fact, she loved everybody\u2019s children. When her boys were growing up in Placerville, the Sanborn house was the place to crash after school and on the weekends. Later, when she worked as a teacher\u2019s aide, she went home and told her family stories of the cute things the kids had said and done that day.\n\nGrowing up, the Sanborns had a lot of love, but they didn\u2019t have much money, so their mom had gone without health insurance most of her life \u2014 until the Affordable Care Act went into effect in January, 2014, and along with so many other Californians she was able to enroll in Medi-Cal for the first time.\n\nSanborn finally had health insurance, but it wasn\u2019t enough to save her life.\n\nIn October of that year she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer and wouldn\u2019t live another two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Catch-22,\u201d said her son, Todd Pittman, who now lives in Cool. \u201cWithout Obamacare, we would have never even known she was sick.\u201d\n\nSanborn isn\u2019t alone. Even with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, patients are finding they can\u2019t get the help they need.\n\nBecause more people are insured, doctors and emergency rooms are as busy or busier than ever, which means that patients have to wait longer and drive farther to find the care they need, particularly specialty care.\n\nThe poorest patients \u2014 those with Medi-Cal \u2014 have the fewest number of doctors available, and in areas like Auburn that have a high population of elderly patients, the problem is worsened by the amount of care needed per person.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t walk the system all the way out,\u201d said community organizer, Lisa Boch. \u201cMedi-Cal was inundated with (new patients).\u201d\n\nBoch works for Placer People of Faith Together, one of eight groups contracted to sign up Placer County residents for insurance benefits through Medi-Cal and through the Covered California exchange.\n\nAs an example of the flood of newly-insured, in the Auburn zip codes alone close to 5,000 residents enrolled in Medi-Cal between 2012 and 2015, according to Linda Patterson, division director at Placer County Health and Human Services.\n\nThat number doesn\u2019t include those who are newly insured through Covered California.\n\nThe problem is a complex one, with no easy answers.\n\n\u2018Really high hopes\u2019\n\nThe Sanborn family was under the impression that their mom\u2019s health had a good outlook.\n\n\u201cWe were told (the cancer) was totally treatable,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cWe had really high hopes.\u201d\n\nBut Pittman believes his mom was bounced around to different specialists because nobody wanted to accept Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden it was a waiting game about who could take her insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo weeks here, two weeks there, nothing was happening, and the cancer was just growing.\u201d\n\nThe cancer wouldn\u2019t wait.\n\nIn February of 2015, Sanborn finished radiation and chemotherapy. Afterward, she couldn\u2019t afford a more extensive CT scan of her entire body to be sure that she was cancer-free, but Medi-Cal paid for a PET scan of her abdomen, and she looked healthy.\n\nShe thought she was in the clear.\n\nA month later the seizures began.\n\nShe got the CT scan.\n\n\u201cShe had a tumor the size of a mandarin orange on her brain,\u201d Pittman said.\n\nShe needed surgery, but that was another waiting game.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cIt was a nightmare.\u201d\n\nThat summer, when his mom became incoherent, Pittman couldn\u2019t wait another day. On a tip from a friend, he put his mom in a wheelchair and rolled her into an ER where they started the process over again, and she finally had the brain surgery she needed.\n\nHis mom lived another month.\n\nShe died August 3, 2015, at the age of 63.\n\n\u201cEveryone is so glad they have insurance, but the truth is doctors don\u2019t have to take it if they don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nFinances don\u2019t work for some doctors\n\nOfficials say doctors want to take insurance for low-income patients, but doctors can\u2019t afford it.\n\nThe rate that California reimburses doctors for Medi-Cal is one of the lowest in the country, said Dr. Robert Oldham, Placer County public health officer, so there are few doctors, particularly specialists, who can afford to take Medi-Cal patients, so they have to travel as far as Sacramento or the Bay Area for the care they need.\n\n\u201cThey want \u2026 to take care of poor patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pencil out for them.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s guideline is that a single doctor should have no more than 2,000 patients, and that, while there may be longer drive times to see a specialist, a patient should not have to drive more than 10 miles or 30 minutes to see a primary care physician, said Katharine Weir, spokesperson for the state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services.\n\nThe state monitors access for all Medi-Cal enrollees, she said, and hasn\u2019t found widespread access issues.\n\nCurrently, it takes new patients in Placer County about three or four months to get an appointment with a primary care physician, Oldham said.\n\n\u201cThe system is flooded.\u201d\n\nSo many patients, so little time\n\nRemember that old episode of \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory and can\u2019t keep up with the pace of the chocolates heading down the conveyor belt? Now imagine the doctors as Lucy and Ethel, and the patients as the chocolate, each one requiring more time than the doctors have, and you have an idea of how the system is working.\n\nExcept in this scenario, no one is laughing.\n\nOne concern is that 2,000 25-year-olds and 2,000 80-year-olds require an entirely different level of care, said Christine Griger, president of Sutter Medical Group. In places like Auburn where residents have a few more wisdom lines than average, doctors have to spend much more time with each patient, so 2,000 patients may be too many. Doctors can\u2019t keep up with the need.\n\nAnother concern is that primary care physicians are retiring, Griger said, and they\u2019re difficult to replace because medical students don\u2019t want to become primary care doctors anymore. It doesn\u2019t pay as well as the fields of specialty. Plus, being a family doctor is harder work than the specialties, so fewer doctors want to do it, leaving those who need a good old-fashioned check-up, waiting in a long line.\n\nRead Tuesday\u2019s edition of the Auburn Journal for a look into emergency rooms and the challenges for those insured through Covered California.\n\nReach reporter Tricia Caspers at triciar@goldcountrymedia.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, local news, auburn journal,auburn news,national news, state news, crime, accident, breaking news, crime log, local sports,national sports, ski report, sports score, living, arts, entertainment, obituaries, classifieds, auburn photos, auburn videos, multimedia, auburn, health, fitness, dinning guide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local auburn news.
