(Photo: Associated Press )\n\nEven the tired clich\u00e9 about the pot calling the kettle black couldn\u2019t adequately capture the irony when Iowa\u2019s U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley last week accused Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts of fueling partisanship around the judiciary. \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d Grassley admonished Roberts in a speech Tuesday.\n\nPicking a fight with the Republican-appointed chief justice marks a bizarre twist in the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman\u2019s refusal to consider a nominee to fill an opening on the court while President Barack Obama is in office.\n\nGrassley\u2019s remarks were in reference to a speech the chief justice had given shortly before Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Roberts observed that the public wrongly believes that justices see themselves as Republicans or Democrats. Grassley shot back that perception is not because, as Roberts had contended, the confirmation process has been so politicized, but because, \u201cthe justices' decisions are often political and transgress their constitutional role.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Grassley continued, \u201cmany of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the chief justice is part of this problem. They believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones.\u201d\n\nFar be it from me to defend Roberts\u2019 voting record on the court, which included the disastrous 2010 Citizens United decision allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts to influence election outcomes in the name of free speech. Roberts also authored the dissenting opinion in the 2015 court ruling that upheld same-sex marriage rights. He even blasted his fellow justices over it at the time, declaring: \"Today, five lawyers have ordered every state to change their definition of marriage. Just who do we think we are?\"\n\nSince his appointment by President George W. Bush in 2005, Roberts has also voted against the use of race-conscious admission policies to achieve school desegregation; against student free-speech rights when drug use is being advocated; to strike down an animal cruelty law; to require that colleges that receive any federal funding must allow military recruiters on campus, and to uphold the partial birth abortion ban. A liberal he's not.\n\n\u201cAfter four years on the Court,\u201d wrote The New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin of Roberts in 2009, \u201cRoberts\u2019s record is not that of a humble moderate but, rather, that of a doctrinaire conservative.\u201d\n\nBut not according to Grassley, for whom Roberts\u2019 cardinal sin must have been voting to uphold Obama's Affordable Care Act. Grassley last week accused the court of drifting from the \u201cconstitutional text\u201d and ruling on such hot button issues as \u201cfreedom of religion, abortion, affirmative action, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty,\u201d based on individual policy preferences. And he blamed that primarily on justices appointed by Democrats.\n\nIowa Sen.

There are two justices who stick to the constitutional text (emphasis mine) and who vote in a consistently conservative way. One justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and one justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals.\u201d\n\nIt seems that for Grassley, only justices appointed by Republican presidents are capable of being impartial, because they \u201cstick to the constitutional text.\u201d But even then, some can\u2019t be trusted because, like Roberts, they might drift from the conservative viewpoint in some cases. It\u2019s no secret that some justices appointed by Republican presidents have shifted to the middle in their votes over time. Instead of being traitors to the conservative cause, as Grassley seems to see them, maybe they\u2019ve had their eyes opened to a more contemporary-world perspective on social realities. After all, the Constitution was written at a time when many current circumstances were not even contemplated.\n\nDeclaring that \u201ctens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that too many of the justices are imposing their views and not interpreting the law,\u201d Grassley called for a debate on the proper role of a Supreme Court justice, and \u201cwhether our current justices are adhering to their constitutional role.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid fired back at Grassley the following day for having, in Reid's words, the audacity to accuse Roberts of being part of the problem. \u201cl say to the senior senator from Iowa, Justice Roberts isn\u2019t the one who needs healing,\" he declared. By refusing to give a hearing to Obama\u2019s appointee, Judge Merrick Garland, \u201cpurely because he was nominated by a Democratic president,\u201d Nevada's Reid said, \u201cSenator Grassley has sacrificed the historic independence of the judiciary to do the bidding of the Tea Party and the Koch Brothers.\u201d\n\nGrassley\u2019s delay in confirming a ninth justice to the Supreme Court has prevented it from making precedent-setting rulings in tied cases. Reid said \u201cwith only himself to blame,\u201d Grassley is \u201cgrasping for something, anything to get him off the hook.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m tired of Iowa getting a bad name for Grassley's antics, and annoyed that he invokes his constituents to justify his intransigent stance. He denies being partisan but blasts a Republican-appointed justice for moving to the center. What could be a better illustration of partisanship \u2014 except maybe refusing to consider a Democratic president\u2019s appointee?\n\nSo many of us, in Iowa and elsewhere, await the election, wondering how Grassley will get out of the corner he\u2019s painted himself into if a Democrat wins.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1N1sG7q", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senator believes only justices appointed by Republican presidents are capable of being impartial", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Senator believes only justices appointed by Republican presidents are capable of being impartial", "title": "Basu: Irony?
