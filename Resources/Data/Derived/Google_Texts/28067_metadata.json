Revealing a scheme to open the floodgates of amnesty would be disastrous on the eve of the critical midterm elections. But this is the gang that can\u2019t shoot straight.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Friday threw open the door to as many as 100,000 Haitians, who will now move into the United States without a visa.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, rightly and accurately denounced enabling Haitians awaiting a U.S. visa to enter the country and legally apply for work permits as \u201can irresponsible overreach of the executive branch\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Best concealed carry handguns\n\nThat was just the beginning. The immigration agency earlier this month had solicited a printer able to handle a \u201csurge\u201d of 9 million green cards \u201cto support possible future immigration-reform initiative requirements.\u201d\n\nIn an ordinary year, about 1 million green cards are issued, and over the life of this contract the company is expected to produce up to 34 million cards, a figure representing an increase of the population of the United States by 10 percent.\n\nThe cards do not come with automatic voter registration, but that\u2019s obviously what the scheme portends. President Obama\u2019s promised \u201cexecutive actions\u201d to bring about this enormous wave of amnesty constitute a transparent and cynical ploy to expand the Democratic voter base, creating a permanent majority.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nRepublicans running for the House and Senate should demand that Mr. Obama lay his green cards on the table now, before \u2014 and not after \u2014 the Nov. 4 elections. No other campaign issue carries as much of an impact on the future of the nation.\n\nIn economic terms, importing millions of unskilled workers creates competition for the diminishing number of available jobs. Combine a flooded job market with the Democratic proposals for a doubling of the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and millions more American citizens will be without a job.\n\nThose who do have jobs will pay to provide federal freebies, from Obamaphones to Obamacare, to the formerly illegal aliens now with a green card.\n\nAs the recent influx of minor children over the southern border demonstrates, word of amnesty on the way travels fast. Handing green cards to those who cheated the system and entered the country illegally creates an incentive to millions more to follow in their path, collecting as many benefits as possible along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s a disaster in the making \u2014 indeed already here \u2014 for public health and national security, straining the welfare state to its limit.\n\nMost Americans want no part of this.\n\nA Gallup survey finds that 74 percent of Americans want the level of immigration to stay where it is, or reduce it. Mr. Obama has no support for his amnesty scheme except from those who want to transform America into a nation that no one would recognize.\n\nVoters can get to work on stopping the transformation on Nov. 4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House intended to remain silent about its plans for immigration.
