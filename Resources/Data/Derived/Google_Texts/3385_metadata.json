Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is under attack again by a Washington lawmaker, and this time it\u2019s not a Republican.\n\nThe freshman senator has drawn the ire of Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., for saying the Obamacare website is run by \u201cNigerian email scammers.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance Tuesday on the pro-Obama cable network MSNBC, Cartwright suggested the comment is racist and only appeals to \u201cfairly backward people\u201d in the Republican Party.\n\nAfter receiving an eight-minute standing ovation Monday from a crowd in Texas, Cruz joked about the disastrous launch of the Obamacare website.\n\n\u201cYou may have noticed that all the Nigerian email scammers have become a lot less active lately,\u201d Cruz told the audience. \u201cThey all have been hired to run the Obamacare website.\u201d\n\nThe comment plays on notorious email scams designed to trick the gullible into handing over large sums of money. While the scam is not limited to Nigeria, the nation has come to be associated with this fraud.\n\n\u201cI wonder how much off-the-cuff that really was, and how calculated it was to appeal to Sen. Cruz\u2019s base, many of whom believe that the president is from Africa,\u201d U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., said in response to the humorous comment.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of fairly backward people that are a part of the base of people like Sen. Cruz and comments like that are right up their ally,\u201d Cartwright added.\n\nIn the hyper-sensitive era of Obama, the first African-American president, the Democratic Party will have you believe any reference to Africa is off limits to a conservative.\n\nBut as frequently as Democrats are now playing the race card, that alone may be the best indication yet of just how much of a failure the Obamacare launch has been thus far.\n\n[poll id=\u201d128\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "U.S. Sen.
