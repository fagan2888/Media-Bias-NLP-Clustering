Kristin Cavallari was arrested today for driving with an invalid license.

The Hills star, who recently moved to Chicago to live with her quarterback husband Jay Cutler and their little boy Camden, apparently hasn’t gone to the DMV to get an Illinois license just yet.

She was pulled over today for speeding and when she showed the officer her California license they took her to the Evanston (a suburb of Chicago) police headquarters and made her post bail.

So here’s the deal. In Illinois you have 90 days to transfer your license once you move from another state. Cavallari has been in Illinois for longer than 90 days so technically she broke the law.

The Hills star did point out, however, that she still owns property in California and is still considered a resident of that state.

Cavalarri writes on Twitter: “Who knew having a California drivers license in Illinois was a CRIME to be escorted to the police station to post bail?!! What a morning. FYI…I still have an apartment in LA so I’m a resident of California”

Evanston Police Department spokesman Cmdr. Jay Parrott said that he could have taken Cavalarri’s license, if it was a valid Illinois license, to make sure that she paid the $120 speeding ticket. But since her license was from out of state he had to take her into the station for her to post bond.

Kristen Cavalarri said earlier this year that she was enjoying her new mid-western lifestyle in Chicago. Do you think her run in with the Evanston police department has changed her mind?
