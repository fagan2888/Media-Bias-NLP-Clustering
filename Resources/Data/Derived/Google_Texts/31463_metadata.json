(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nMark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, is a member of the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhenever you\u2019re introduced to someone, one of the first questions typically asked is \u201cWhere do you work?\u201d Today, \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d might be more appropriate.\n\nThat\u2019s because the U.S. workforce is increasingly composed of freelancers, independent contractors and the otherwise self-employed. Yet Washington has mostly remained on the sidelines as the U.S. economy, workforce and workplace have undergone perhaps the most dramatic transformations in decades.\n\nSome two dozen people are considering running for president in 2016, and none of them are talking much about these issues. That\u2019s remarkable.\n\nWhether by economic necessity or by choice, as many as one-third of U.S. workers now find themselves piecing together two, three or more on-demand work opportunities to make a living. This is often called the gig economy or the sharing economy.\n\nThis group of workers includes a lot of millennials who began entering the workforce in 2000. It also includes middle-age professionals downsized at mid-career and baby boomers hit with a premature end to what they thought were solid careers. And it includes a lot of folks for whom working multiple jobs is nothing new: It\u2019s just how they\u2019ve always gotten by.\n\nToday, online platforms such as Airbnb, Uber, TaskRabbit and Etsy can provide granularity in matching supply and demand for things many people may never have thought about monetizing before: A spare room. A ride in a family car. Free time.\n\nBut many of the business models in this on-demand economy are built on the premise that workers are independent contractors, not employees. That means companies do not have to pay costs such as health insurance or retirement benefits. They also typically do not pay a share of unemployment or workers\u2019 compensation coverage.\n\nSo these workers, even if they are doing very well, exist on a high wire, with no safety net beneath them. That may work for many of them \u2014 until the day that it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s also the day that taxpayers could be handed the bill, which is why Washington needs to start asking some tough policy questions:\n\nFirst, the biggest challenge may be this change in the employer-employee relationship. Are there other options for providing safety-net benefits to workers who are not connected to a traditional full-time employer? Who should administer them? Should they be opt-in or opt-out?\n\nWe could look to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health-care exchanges as a public-private model or perhaps borrow the idea of the \u201chour bank,\u201d used by the building trades for 60 years, to administer benefits for members who work for a series of contractors. It could be consumer driven in part, too \u2014 perhaps allowing customers to designate a portion of their payments to go to a fund that helps support workers. There are other possible public-private models that deserve a look.\n\nSecond, while litigation is underway about whether on-demand workers are independent contractors or employees, this question is too important to leave to the courts alone. As policymakers, we should begin discussing whether our 20th-century definitions work in a 21st-century economy.\n\nThird, the federal government needs to become much more nimble. We need better data on how many people are part of the gig and sharing economies, and we need to recommit to extending broadband Internet service to underserved and unserved regions. We should also streamline the hodgepodge of federal programs \u2014 currently scattered across dozens of federal agencies \u2014 meant to support innovators and entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd we cannot forget the opportunity costs of this generation\u2019s combined $1.2 trillion in student debt, which is limiting options for young workers.\n\nFinally, the millennial generation already is beginning to fuel a tremendous shift in one of the traditional anchors of America\u2019s economy. Many younger Americans have made it clear they prefer sharing and renting over ownership. This could have a huge impact on traditional tax systems at every level of government, because we currently use the tax code to reward ownership of everything from homes to vehicles to factories.\n\nBarely five years ago, no one had even heard of Uber or Airbnb. And while we don\u2019t know what the disruptive technologies of tomorrow might look like, we know developments such as driverless cars, same-day drone deliveries and 3-D printing appear to be right around the corner. Instead of trying to make the new economy look more like the old, Washington should encourage these innovations and work to create more opportunities and upward economic mobility for everybody.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "mark warner, gig economy, sharing economy, uber, airbnb, taskrabbit, etsy", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Washington needs to address the issues surrounding America\u2019s rapidly changing workforce.", "title": "Asking tough questions about the gig economy", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/asking-tough-questions-about-the-gig-economy/2015/06/18/b43f2d0a-1461-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/10/Local/Images/2X7A56271397133787.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/asking-tough-questions-about-the-gig-economy/2015/06/18/b43f2d0a-1461-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mark warner, gig economy, sharing economy, uber, airbnb, taskrabbit, etsy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b43f2d0a-1461-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Washington needs to address the issues surrounding America\u2019s rapidly changing workforce."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba10\"", "article_summary": "This is often called the gig economy or the sharing economy.\nYet Washington has mostly remained on the sidelines as the U.S. economy, workforce and workplace have undergone perhaps the most dramatic transformations in decades.\nBut many of the business models in this on-demand economy are built on the premise that workers are independent contractors, not employees.\nSecond, while litigation is underway about whether on-demand workers are independent contractors or employees, this question is too important to leave to the courts alone.\nFinally, the millennial generation already is beginning to fuel a tremendous shift in one of the traditional anchors of America\u2019s economy."}
