Black Privilege? By Robert Paul Reyes \"After being arrested Friday for stealing items from a jeweler in a Florida mall, Prolancia Aquila Turner, 26, was pissed.\n\nNot at herself, of course, for hiding earrings valued at $12.50 in the waistband of her pants.\n\nInstead, the crying and angry Turner, 26, was miffed because, as she told police, `Everyone steals from this store. Why are you picking on me?`\"\n\nSmoking Gun\n\n\n\nWhen Prolancia Aquilla Turner was arrested for shoplifting earrings valued at $12.50 she burst out crying.\n\n\n\nWhy did she start bawling, you may be thinking:\n\n\n\nIt suddenly dawned on her that her parents christened her with a ghetto name that sounds like the brand name of a laxative?\n\n\n\nShe was embarrassed to be caught stealing cheap costume jewelry?\n\n\n\nShe felt contrition for stealing from a hardworking small business owner?\n\n\n\nShe had her natural hair tied up in a bun, not a good look for her mug shot?\n\n\n\nShe had an epiphany and she realized she`s destined to be a burden on society for the rest of her life?\n\n\n\nHell No! Everybody shoplifts she reasoned, why pick on me? Homegirl was crying in anger and frustration because the police had the temerity to arrest her for stealing.\n\n\n\nI`m sure her next words to the police officers were: Y`all picking on me cause I is black!\n\n\n\nWe hear a lot about white privilege, but what about black privilege? Too many many blacks think they are entitled to a free Obamaphone, free Obamacare, foodstamps, and subsidized housing. This miserable excuse for a human being even thinks she is entitled to shoplift.\n\n\n\nTurner has a long rap sheet, it`s time to throw this lowlife in prison and throw away the key.\n\n\n\nTurner`s mug shot:\n\n\n\nhttp://thesmokinggun.com/buster/claires/shoplifting-moron-547293\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Robert Paul Reyes on Twitter: http://twitter.com/robertpaulreyes Photo Credit: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Weird News, Op/Ed, shoplifter, robert paul reyes, the sop", "generated": 1464037562, "description": "When Prolancia Aquilla Turner was arrested for shoplifting earring valued at $12.50 she burst out crying."}, "article_summary": "Published: May 21st, 2016 10:10 EST Thief Feels She's Entitled to Steal!\nWe hear a lot about white privilege, but what about black privilege?\nBy Robert Paul Reyes \"After being arrested Friday for stealing items from a jeweler in a Florida mall, Prolancia Aquila Turner, 26, was pissed.\nTurner has a long rap sheet, it`s time to throw this lowlife in prison and throw away the key.\nBlack Privilege?"}
