Navigators are pushing hard to get last-minute enrollees in before the March 31 deadline. So plan to see a lot of events the next three weeks, something like Thursday\u2019s \u201cNav-Lab Enrollment Blowout\u201d at the University of South Florida.\n\nGroups that had been working individually the past six months are teaming up for these \u201clast-ditch\u201d efforts to enroll the uninsured, said Xonjenese Jacobs, a navigator and project coordinator with the Florida Covering Kids & Families program.\n\nThe groups, such as Enroll America, Planned Parenthood and USF\u2019s School of Public Health, are recruiting participants with traditional fliers, word-of-mouth referrals and silly social media efforts like a \u201cHarlem Shake\u201d video featuring USF students and faculty.\n\nThe efforts are working, Jacobs said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite diverse, the people who we have seen coming in. We\u2019ve seen students and staff from USF, community members of all different races, ethnicities as well as ages. It\u2019s just a melting pot, which really is what Tampa is,\u201d Jacobs said at Thursday\u2019s sign up event.\n\nUSF doctoral student Tamina Johnson was among those signing up, despite Thursday\u2019s torrential rain and a tornado warning in Tampa. The 29-year-old wants health insurance, but can't afford it on a graduate student salary. She qualified for a tax break equal to almost $200 a month.\n\n\u201cThis way I don\u2019t have to pay as much because I kind of need money to live on and eat with,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would rather be eating than spending it all on health insurance.\u201d\n\nSign-up will be going strong up and through March 31, said Gerry Skinner, manager of enrollment counselors at Tampa Family Health Centers. She is preparing a March 29 community festival in Tampa, using free food, music and face painting to entice uninsured residents to show up.\n\nJacobs said the federal marketplace website, Healthcare.gov, and the phone line at (800) 318-2596 also will be up for individuals who want to shop and compare plans for themselves and their families.\n\n\u201cThey can continue to call the 24-hour helpline to get information, to make changes, to make updates. It\u2019s just a matter of making sure that you do it in a timely fashion,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got till March 31, but you folks really shouldn\u2019t wait because that\u2019s when everybody gets to rushing.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is the focus of an upcoming broadcast of Florida Matters.
