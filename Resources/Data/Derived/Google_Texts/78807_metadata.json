Mark Begich (D) has worked to show he is independent from President Barack Obama's administration as he battles former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican. The senator has opposed Obama's strategies to combat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and to expand background checks on gun sales. He has also disassociated himself from his party by remaining open to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Republicans, on the other hand, have worked to tie Begich to the president, who is deeply unpopular in the state.\n\nColorado Senate Mark Udall (Kent Nishimura via Getty Images)\n\nSen. Mark Udall (D) and Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) are locked in one of the closest races on this year's Senate map. Democrats have put Gardner on the defensive over his past support for personhood legislation, which would give legal rights to fetuses from the moment of fertilization. Republicans have continuously hit Udall over the Affordable Care Act, his energy policies and national security issues.\n\nArkansas Senate Mark Pryor (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nKansas Senate ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe surprise race of this cycle is in Kansas, where Sen. Pat Roberts (R) may be edged out by independent Greg Orman, who insists he's disenchanted with both parties. Republicans are scrambling to paint Orman as a Democrat in disguise, but Roberts is still experiencing the fallout from a New York Times report that revealed that he doesn't maintain a permanent home in the state.\n\nNew Hampshire Senate ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) is fighting for re-election against former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.). Democrats have done everything they can to ridicule Brown's candidacy, but President Barack Obama's unpopularity in the Granite State, as in other states, may hurt Shaheen on Nov. 4.\n\nLouisiana Senate ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu (D) is a political survivor, having won her last three Senate races by narrow margins. She'll need another miracle if the nonpartisan primary on Nov. 4. goes to a Dec. 6. runoff, as all of the GOP's energy will presumably be focused on putting Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) over the top, especially if control of Congress' upper chamber hinges on this race. Landrieu would need to significantly boost turnout in cities such as New Orleans to eke out a runoff win. Her brother is the mayor of New Orleans, though, so that could help.\n\nNorth Carolina Senate ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSen. Kay Hagan (D) has so far held on against a challenge from North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis (R). Republicans have gone from being gleeful with expectations that they would take the seat to glum, as Democrats have worked to tar Tillis with the actions of the state legislature over which he presided. Republicans have called Hagan ineffectual , while Democrats have consistently highlighted Tillis' record on education spending voting rights and abortion rights\n\nKentucky Senate Win McNamee via Getty Images\n\nOne of the Democratic Party's pickup opportunities is in Kentucky, but that possibility seems to be receding as Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) has been dropping off in the polls against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R). While McConnell's campaign has run ads touting his work on behalf of constituents and accused Grimes of being too close to Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Grimes has distanced herself from others in her party. Though McConnell remains unpopular in the state, Grimes would need heavy turnout to surpass him.\n\nGeorgia Senate ASSOCIATED PRESS", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tuesday is Election Day in America, so here's a roundup of when the polls close in each state.\n\nIf you still haven't figured out where you have to go t...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-11-04 20:55:06 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Tuesday is Election Day in America, so here's a roundup of when the polls close in each state.\n\nIf you still haven't figured out where you have to go t...", "title": "What Time Do The Polls Close?", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/03/what-time-do-polls-close_n_6095244.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2238014/images/o-POLLING-PLACE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tuesday is Election Day in America, so here's a roundup of when the polls close in each state.\n\nIf you still haven't figured out where you have to go t...", "title": "What Time Do The Polls Close?", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2238014/images/o-POLLING-PLACE-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@ashalman", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-03 20:55:06 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6095244", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,elections,elections 2014,what time do polls close,polls,Election Day,Election Day 2014,midterm elections,midterm elections 2014,gotv,get out the vote,vote,vote 2014", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "video,elections,elections 2014,what time do polls close,polls,Election Day,Election Day 2014,midterm elections,midterm elections 2014,gotv,get out the vote,vote,vote 2014", "published_time": "2014-11-03 20:55:06 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-11-03 23:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa98\"", "article_summary": "Though McConnell remains unpopular in the state, Grimes would need heavy turnout to surpass him.\nLouisiana Senate ASSOCIATED PRESSSen.
