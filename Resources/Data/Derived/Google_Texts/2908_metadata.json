Photo: Getty Images\n\nExactly what has happened to the forgotten man of Sydney FC, Nicky Carle?\n\nThe club\u2019s former marquee player looked a certainty to make his return against Brisbane Roar on Friday night, having been listed as available the day before.\n\nAdding weight to the likelihood of it being Carle\u2019s comeback match was the decision to withdraw the club\u2019s current marquee, Alessandro Del Piero, who was suffering from fluid on the hamstring.\n\nGiven Del Piero has been playing in the number 10 all season, it seemed inevitable Carle would take the role in which he has previously played his best football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when the team sheets were distributed, Carle wasn\u2019t even named on the bench. Replacing Del Piero was Alec Urosevski, a 20-year-old winger making his first start for the Sky Blues.\n\nWhen pressed about why Carle was overlooked, Farina said it was a \u201cpurely tactical\u201d decision. \u201cI think our midfield has been performing pretty well and I don\u2019t think Nicky Carle is a left winger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted a bit of pace because we wanted to exploit the holes behind the full-backs and young Alec did ok. It was purely tactical.\u201d\n\nYet the decision to include Urosevski meant Ali Abbas \u2013 the first-choice left-winger all season \u2013 had to play more centrally.\n\nDespite that explanation, Farina maintains Carle has not been discounted from selection in the future. \u201cNicky is back training with the boys, and he\u2019s in the mix,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a good session [on Friday] with other 13 boys [who didn\u2019t play].\u201d\n\nConspiracy theorists will note that Carle has not played since he was suspended by Farina for disobeying tactical orders during the 3-0 defeat against Adelaide United in early February.\n\nWhile that suspension was successfully challenged by the Professional Footballers' Association for breaching of the collective bargaining agreement, Carle hasn\u2019t even been named on the bench since.\n\nHe missed the next two matches with an adductor strain but the former Johnny Warren Medallist has been declared fully fit for the past two games, only to be overlooked both times.\n\nThe coach has maintained there is no lingering tension from his move to suspend Carle \u2013 and has since selected Matt Thompson, the other player suspended at the time.\n\nFarina could also argue the promising form of young duo Terry Antonis and Hagi Gligor have obstructed Carle\u2019s return to the first team.\n\nCarle is contracted to the club for another season, and would, theoretically, make a natural replacement for Del Piero \u2013 but it remains unclear whether Farina, whose own position next season is not assured, wants to keep him.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation into the alleged racial abuse of Abbas during last week\u2019s Sydney derby could be settled this week with the deadline for a submission from the accused Wanderers player, Brendon Santalab, set for Monday night.\n\nIt is understood Santalab is privately maintaining his innocence over what happened, and the striker revealed to Fairfax Media last week that he believed he had been goaded by Abbas in previous matches.\n\nWestern Sydney coach Tony Popovic has indicated that Santalab, who started in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Adelaide at Pirtek Stadium, has remained relatively unaffected by the storm surrounding the incident.\n\n\u201cI haven't seen Brendon all week, I only saw Brendon [on Friday] but he was like everyone else, as expected,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cHe trained well and played [against Adelaide] and gave everything he had.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Soccer", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Exactly what has happened to the forgotten man of Sydney FC, Nicky Carle?", "title": "Nicky Carle goes from marquee to MIA at Sydney FC", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/nicky-carle-goes-from-marquee-to-mia-at-sydney-fc-20140316-hvj9m.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/v/c/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvj9m.png/1394954555633.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/v/c/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvj9m.png/1394954555633.jpg"}, "description": "Exactly what has happened to the forgotten man of Sydney FC, Nicky Carle?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nicky Carle goes from marquee to MIA at Sydney FC"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Exactly what has happened to the forgotten man of Sydney FC, Nicky Carle?"}, "article_summary": "Photo: Getty ImagesExactly what has happened to the forgotten man of Sydney FC, Nicky Carle?\nOn the outer: Nicky Carle hasn't played for Sydney FC since a bust-up with coach Frank Farina.\n\u201cI think our midfield has been performing pretty well and I don\u2019t think Nicky Carle is a left winger,\u201d he said.\nReplacing Del Piero was Alec Urosevski, a 20-year-old winger making his first start for the Sky Blues.\nAdding weight to the likelihood of it being Carle\u2019s comeback match was the decision to withdraw the club\u2019s current marquee, Alessandro Del Piero, who was suffering from fluid on the hamstring."}
