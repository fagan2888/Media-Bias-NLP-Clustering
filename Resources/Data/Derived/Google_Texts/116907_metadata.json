But the need is more pressing than ever, given the current multistate measles outbreak and the re-emergence of other vaccine-preventable diseases among those not completely immunized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited that there\u2019s support and momentum for this new immunization plan,\u201d said Dr. Gina Fleming, medical director for the UC Student Health Insurance Plan. \u201cWe know that these preventive measures are effective.\u201d\n\nThree-year phase-in\n\nThe plan is being phased in over three years. The first phase focuses on building awareness among students about the upcoming requirement, with all fall 2015 incoming UC students receiving notification of the recommended vaccines and the process for making them mandatory. The intent of the plan is to set a baseline for all of UC, but does not prevent individual campuses from setting immunization standards for all students, or implementing the plan more rapidly.\n\nIt was developed based on recommendations from the California Department of Public Health, and in consultation with UC\u2019s student health center directors, vice chancellors for student affairs and the UC system senior vice president for health sciences and services.\n\nIt will require that by 2017 all incoming students show documentation not only for hepatitis B vaccination but also for TB screening and four more vaccines: measles, mumps and rubella; meningococcus; varicella (chicken pox); and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough).\n\n\u201cThe University of California is committed to protecting the health and well-being of our students,\u201d said Mary Knudtson, executive director of the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center and chair of the UC Immunization Policy Committee. \u201cTherefore, all of the UC campuses are implementing procedures to ensure that students are educated about, and receive, vaccinations to prevent potentially dangerous illnesses and undergo screening to identify those who may have infectious tuberculosis.\u201d\n\nStarting in fall 2016, all incoming UC students will be expected to have their required vaccines and enter the data into the university\u2019s electronic medical record platform. But the plan is not to enforce the requirement until the following year. Starting in fall 2017, UC students who do not meet the vaccination requirement will have a hold put on their registration. The rationale for the phased approach is to ensure that the process runs smoothly before potentially impacting students\u2019 ability to register for classes.\n\nAll UC campuses have experienced cases of vaccine-preventable diseases in recent years \u2014 something not unique among college campuses, which have varying vaccination requirements. For example, only about half of states have laws requiring all college students to be vaccinated against measles, according to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that many people receive the recommended vaccines, there are still documented cases of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in California and on the campuses each year amongst those who were not properly immunized,\u201d Knudtson said. \u201cAll students are strongly encouraged to obtain the vaccines recommended by the California Department of Public Health prior to starting classes.\u201d\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nWhile getting such vaccines has long been considered a good public health practice, the cost of vaccines and the difficulty for student health staff to obtain and verify the information have been barriers to implementation.\n\nTwo developments have broken down those barriers, Fleming said. Now that the Affordable Care Act provides insurance coverage for vaccines, the cost of vaccination is less of a problem. Also, a new electronic medical record platform soon will allow UC students to directly enter their vaccination date. Four campuses will be piloting the module for entering vaccination data this fall, and the remaining campuses anticipate being able to use it by fall 2016.\n\nThe issue of immunization has evolved into a hot topic of discussion in California and across the nation in recent weeks after a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland. On Wednesday, state Senators Richard Pan and Ben Allen announced they will introduce legislation that would eliminate the ability for parents of school children to opt out of vaccinating their kids based on a personal belief.\n\nUC\u2019s plan will allow exemptions for medical or religious purposes, Fleming said. In the coming months, officials will discuss how to handle requests for other exemptions and how to validate the vaccination information.\n\n\u201cWe need to be mindful of the population we\u2019re serving,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nUC\u2019s plan might be extended to already enrolled students and additional vaccines could be added later, such as meningococcus B, Fleming said. Vaccines recommended for preventive care include vaccines for hepatitis A, HPV, influenza, polio and pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nOfficials are determining whether additional approvals are needed to adopt the plan, Fleming said, even as they move forward with implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, leadership in student affairs and student health centers are working with other campus departments to inform students about the plan.\n\n\u201cWe will be spending this time educating our students about the importance of getting vaccinated,\u201d said Cindy Wong, director of UCR\u2019s Student Health Center.\n\nArchived under: Inside UCR,\n\nTop of Page", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UCR Today", "description": "February 10, 2015: Currently, the UC system only requires students to be vaccinated against hepatitis B.", "title": "UC Plans to Require Vaccinations for Incoming Students", "url": "https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/27131", "image": "https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/immunization_stock_686-585x387.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Inside UCR"}, "description": "February 10, 2015: Currently, the UC system only requires students to be vaccinated against hepatitis B."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd30f\"", "article_summary": "Starting in fall 2017, UC students who do not meet the vaccination requirement will have a hold put on their registration.\nAlso, a new electronic medical record platform soon will allow UC students to directly enter their vaccination date.\nThe first phase focuses on building awareness among students about the upcoming requirement, with all fall 2015 incoming UC students receiving notification of the recommended vaccines and the process for making them mandatory.\nOfficials are determining whether additional approvals are needed to adopt the plan, Fleming said, even as they move forward with implementation.\nMeanwhile, leadership in student affairs and student health centers are working with other campus departments to inform students about the plan."}
