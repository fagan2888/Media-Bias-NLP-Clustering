Investigators are trying to determine the origin of a fire that burned the garage, two cars parked inside the garage and part of the residence at a house in the 8000 block of Rye Court in Niwot on Saturday evening.

Nobody was injured in the fire, and two people and their pet have been displaced, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

Dispatchers received a 911 call from the home at 5:02 p.m. Saturday.

Officials said the fire appears to have started in the garage and spread into the attic of the home before responding crews put it out.

Emergency crews on scene included the Boulder County Sheriff's Office, American Medical Response paramedics and members of the Mountain View and Boulder Rural fire protection districts.

The investigation will continue today, sheriff's officials said.
