Some employers may be exempt from the mandate based on religious or moral reasons. But Fluke said it was a bad idea to let companies chose what health care services they want to cover.\n\n\"It's a corporation picking and choosing what types of law they want to comply with,\" she said. \"Our belief in this society has always been that we protect the liberty of individuals in their private lives, but that when you cross that line and go into the publics sphere and decide you want to operate as a company, make a profit off the public, you need to abide by public's laws.\"\n\nWatch her comments in the video above, and watch the full conversation below.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Women In The U.S. Senate Women In The U.S. Senate\n\n1 of 44 Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
