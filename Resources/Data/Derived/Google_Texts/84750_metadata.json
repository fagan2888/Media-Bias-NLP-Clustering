This law also violates many other federal statutes and the United States Constitution by attempting to mandate discrimination in government buildings.\u201d\n\nA legal challenge to a similar law in Virginia has already progressed through federal courts there, with a decision from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely soon.\n\nIn that case, a transgender high schooler sued the local school board after it adopted a new policy requiring all students to use either bathrooms aligning with their birth sex or newly-created unisex bathrooms. The student has contended that the policy violated Title IX prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sex and 14th Amendment equal protection provisions.\n\nThe school board argued that because any student can use the unisex bathrooms it is treating all students equally.\n\nIn reality, though, students who identify with their birth sex have two choices: use the bathrooms aligning with that birth sex or use the unisex bathrooms.\n\nTransgender students however have only one choice \u2013 the unisex bathrooms.\n\n\u201cWe expect the ACLU\u2019s and Lambda Legal\u2019s Legal Help Desks will light up with calls from those who suffer discrimination imposed by this law, and we stand ready to help,\u201d Tara Borelli, Senior Attorney with Lambda Legal, said in the release.\n\n\u201dThis law is in direct conflict with protections provided to students under Title IX and could cause the state to lose billions in federal funds. Instead of solving any real problems, the law would create new ones and could lead to intolerable and unfair conditions for transgender students who are entitled, by federal law, to a safe and equitable education.\u201d\n\nOf course, HB 2 wasn\u2019t only about bathrooms and the transgender community.\n\nThe bill also bans all local nondiscrimination ordinances, shuts down recourse to state courts for those with discrimination claims and prohibits local governments from mandating wages higher than those required by the state.\n\nPlenty of fodder for more lawsuits.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The school board argued that because any student can use the unisex bathrooms it is treating all students equally.\nTransgender students however have only one choice \u2013 the unisex bathrooms.\nIn reality, though, students who identify with their birth sex have two choices: use the bathrooms aligning with that birth sex or use the unisex bathrooms.\n\u201cIt aims to override local school board policies, local public accommodations laws, and more.\n\u201dThis law is in direct conflict with protections provided to students under Title IX and could cause the state to lose billions in federal funds."}
