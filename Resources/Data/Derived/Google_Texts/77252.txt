Tulsa's 26th homicide was close on the heels of a shooting death Saturday afternoon. Tulsa police got a "frantic 911 call" from the 500 block of South 55th West Avenue about 2:40 a.m. Sunday, July 13, according to Homicide Sergeant Dave Walker.



"First responders arrived and found a male stabbed inside a vehicle. Life saving efforts were unsuccessful; he is dead at the scene," Walker said.



Police interviewed the woman who made the 911 call and learned more about the 29-year-old victim. They learned the suspect in the stabbing left in an older-model, tan box-style van.



Authorities quickly arrested Terry Hansen, 38. He was booked on a complaint of first-degree murder. Hansen has served time in the Oklahoma Department of Corrections for assault with a deadly weapon, larceny of an auto and other crimes.



"It was determined that the suspect and victim knew each other and a dispute led to the fatal assault," Walker said in a news bulletin later Sunday morning.



Authorities were able to track Hansen and some other people who had been at the murder scene. Walker said the investigation may result in the arrest of other people, and additional charges may be filed.
