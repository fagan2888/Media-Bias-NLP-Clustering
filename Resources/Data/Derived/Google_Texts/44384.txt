Ã— Heavy snow expected on mountains in Hawaii

HONOLULU (AP) _ A blizzard warning is in effect for the summits of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii.

The National Weather Service says up to 8 inches of snow could accumulate above 11,500 feet. The warning is in effect until 6 p.m. Wednesday.

The weather service warns of strong winds, bitter cold, blowing and drifting snow, and lightning. Temperatures in the upper 20s and lower 30s are expected, as are 45 to 65 mph winds with gusts over 90 mph, leading to whiteout conditions.

Travel will be dangerous, and the weather service says to only travel with a winter survival kit.

Snow on the mountains is common, but a blizzard is unusual.
