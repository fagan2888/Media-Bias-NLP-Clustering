Pinkham interned at the Social Security Administration Press Office from June 1 to July 27.\n\nThe Washington Internships for Native Students (WINS) offers students of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian nations the opportunity to build leadership and advocacy skills while living, studying, and interning in Washington, D.C. It was developed in response to the White House Initiative on American Indians and Alaska Natives, and offers qualified students full scholarships funded by American University and sponsoring organizations.\n\nStudents intern with Native advocacy and government agencies in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, health, economic, social service, law, and public policy disciplines. The experiential curriculum is designed to develop the student\u2019s professional skills in self-determined community development and public advocacy.\n\nShanoa, whose Yakama name is \u201cShaleelah\u201d (little girl), has been active with Seattle Clear Sky Native Youth Council since 2009. \u201cShe is a positive role model by tutoring, mentoring, and inspiring the youth to honor their education by graduating from high school and pursuing a higher education,\u201d the council\u2019s newsletter reported.\n\nShanoa is a 2013 University of Washington graduate and until recently was a co-project facilitator for the youth council. She was 2011 Miss Yakama Nation and 2011 Miss Indian Nations. She was a speaker at the youth council\u2019s 2011 Rites of Passage ceremony honoring Native graduates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to stand up for and serve my Native community family,\u201d she told the newsletter. \u201cRemember to honor and respect the hardships of our ancestors, knowing that they are strong and resilient and that we all have that same strength to share with our Native people. The Creator blesses those who sacrifice for the good of others to succeed. I\u2019m so glad SCNYC has given me the opportunity to continue this honor to serve my Native community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shanoa Pinkham is serving a 15-week fall semester Washington Internship for Native Students in Washington, D.C. through American University.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/15/yakama-student-studied-washington-dc-through-wins-156806", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/shanoa-pinkham-canoe-journey.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Yakama Student Studied in Washington, DC through WINS"}, "abstract": "Shanoa Pinkham is serving a 15-week fall semester Washington Internship for Native Students in Washington, D.C. through American University.", "keywords": "WINS, Washington Internship for Native Students, Native American students, Yakama", "dc": {"title": "Yakama Student Studied in Washington, DC through WINS"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/15/yakama-student-studied-washington-dc-through-wins-156806", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-15T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Yakama Student Studied in Washington, DC through WINS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3c3\"", "article_summary": "Shanoa Pinkham served a summer semester Washington Internship for Native Students in Washington, D.C. through American University School of Professional & Extended Studies.\nThe Washington Internships for Native Students (WINS) offers students of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian nations the opportunity to build leadership and advocacy skills while living, studying, and interning in Washington, D.C.\nShanoa, whose Yakama name is \u201cShaleelah\u201d (little girl), has been active with Seattle Clear Sky Native Youth Council since 2009.\nI\u2019m so glad SCNYC has given me the opportunity to continue this honor to serve my Native community.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to stand up for and serve my Native community family,\u201d she told the newsletter."}
