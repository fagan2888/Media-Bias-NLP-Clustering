Lindsey Graham said Sunday his top two priorities as president would be working reducing the nation's \"too many terrorists, too much debt.\"\"If I get to be president, I\u2019m going to focus on putting radical Islam back in a box and nailing it shut,\" Graham said on \"The Cats Roundtable\" on AM 970 in New York. \"I\u2019ve never been more worried about an attack on our homeland than I am right now. Radical Islam is running wild in the Mideast. [President Barack] Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\"Graham said Obama pulled out of Iraq too early, allowing for the growth of the Islamic State (ISIS) there, and that, as president, he would rebuild the military and send some back to help \"degrade and destroy\" ISIS.Graham also talked about the impending Iraq nuclear deal, telling host John Catsimatidis, \"We'd be nuts to give the Iranians more money until they change their behavior. At the end of the day, a nuclear deal with Iran must be air tight because they lie and cheat.\"On the domestic front, Graham warned that the retirement of 80 million Baby Boomers is going to \"wipe out\" Medicare and Social Security.\"We\u2019re going to become Greece if we don\u2019t do something like set some goals where you means-test benefits, extend the age of retirement and flatten out the tax code,\" he said. \"It's going to destroy our economy.\"Obama's policies are converging to hurt job growth, he said, pointing out that Dodd-Frank Act has hurt small businesses' ability to borrow money to expand while talks of a raised minimum wage and higher Obamacare costs also raises fears of higher expenses.\"It's too hard to create a job in this country,\" Graham said. \"The economy is stuck in neutral because the policies of Obama have come together to create \u2026 a wet blanket over job creation.\"Related Stories:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "graham, priorities", "pubdate": "2015-07-05T16:59:21", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "South Carolina Sen.
