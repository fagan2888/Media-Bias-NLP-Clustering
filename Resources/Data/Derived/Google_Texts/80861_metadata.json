That\u2019s right. Food could become the next issue, as college administrators have found themselves under siege by privileged, left wing college students bellowing about racial insensitivity or other fake paradigms of oppression.\n\nRobby Soave, an editor at Reason and columnist for the Daily Beast, wrote about how cultural appropriation has entered the Oberlin cafeteria, where some students are alleging that the kitchen staff is engaging in microaggressions of epic proportions because they can\u2019t prepare an ethnic dish properly. Soave takes this claim to the woodshed:\n\n\u2026 [H]ere\u2019s what one Oberlin student had to say about the dining hall\u2019s sushi bar: \u201cWhen you\u2019re cooking a country\u2019s dish for other people, including ones who have never tried the original dish before, you\u2019re also representing the meaning of the dish as well as its culture,\u201d student Tomoyo Joshi told The Oberlin Review. \u201cSo if people not from that heritage take food, modify it and serve it as \u2018authentic,\u2019 it is appropriative.\u201d Cultural appropriation, readers will recall, allegedly occurs when people borrow the traditions of another ethnic or religious group. Liberal students at a Canadian university, for example, recently shut down a free yoga class for disabled students because yoga has its origins in Hinduism, meaning it doesn\u2019t belong to white people and they shouldn\u2019t practice it. This kind of thinking is actually bafflingly illiberal\u2014who\u2019s to say that culture itself belongs to anyone?\u2014and yet it\u2019s usually left-leaning students waging weirdly nativist campaigns of forced isolation on foreign cuisines and customs. The culinary critics at Oberlin, however, aren\u2019t just mad that the cafeteria has appropriated their culture\u2014they\u2019re mad that it\u2019s been appropriated poorly. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d student Diep Nguyen told The Oberlin Review (the \u201cit,\u201d in question was a Banh Mi sandwich with the wrong bun). \u201cHow could they just throw out something completely different and label it as another country\u2019s traditional food?\u201d For one thing, the Banh Mi sandwich is itself the product of the blurring of cultural boundaries: French and Vietnamese. For another, there\u2019s something deliciously ironic about Oberlin students\u2014some of the most privileged people in the world, as evidenced by the $50,000 they pay annually in tuition\u2014whining about the bun-thickness of meals prepared by lowly paid cafeteria workers. As academic and writer Fredrik de Boer noted on Twitter, \u201cWhen you\u2019re defending the cultural authenticity of GENERAL TSO\u2019S CHICKEN, you\u2019re a living Portlandia sketch.\u201d\n\nYour blood pressure is going through the roof over buns? First of all, as Soave noted, this is a college cafeteria, not Dorsia. They\u2019re not serving up sea urchin ceviche, nor are they serving anything that takes an exorbitant amount of time. Why? They have over 3,000 kids to feed three times a day. The kitchen staff needs to make something good and fast.\n\nAt my alma mater, Dickinson College, there was a wok station that I avoided because it wasn\u2019t very good. I never for a second thought the school\u2019s kitchen staff, or administration, was telling Asian students to go screw themselves. No one ever complained about cultural appropriation in the cafeteria. We had other things to worry about, like assignments for class, writing papers, and studying for exams.\n\nCollege campuses have always been bastions of liberalism. This isn\u2019t a new phenomena, but the direction in which advocacy is facilitated by the left in these arenas has become indiscriminately insane. Food is the new front in the PC wars. Is this a serious narrative? Luckily, Young America\u2019s Foundation released a poll that offers a glimmer of hope, where half of the students polled prefer a smaller government, seven-in-ten reject Black Lives Matter, and a majority aren\u2019t that thrilled with the whole microaggression culture.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Food?
