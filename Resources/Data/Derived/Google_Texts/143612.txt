In a bid to help ailing cardiac patients, especially kids, city based Udyati Trust in association with Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology and Research Institute is organizing a run - 'Run for the Beat' on August 10th at 6.30 am from Shalini grounds, Jayanagar 5th block.

In Jayadeva Institute alone about 5% of every baby is born abnormal, 12-15 children are facing cardiology problems and 8-9 are poor who cannot afford for the treatment. They lack to get the proper treatment because the cost of the heart treatment is exponentially high and beyond their reach.

"The run is aimed at raising funds. The amount will be used for poor children's heart operation. There are various categories for participation like; 10k , 5k ,run with your pet, special run for specially abled and senior citizens' run. We have made the run very affordable to public so that large number people participate for the cause. Physically challenged people will also be participating in the event and all the facilities will be provided and taken care" said Sowmya Shree Rao, member of Udyati Trust.

Making the run unique, all the participants will have an application installed in their mobile phone where by on the spot they will get to know how much distance they have covered.
