The trouble isn\u2019t that medicine has fallen behind; it\u2019s that medical advances don\u2019t reach everyone equally.\n\nLife expectancy, which currently stands at about 78 years in the United States, is just an average \u2014 there are people who die later and others who die earlier. The gap between those early and late deaths is wider in the United States than in most other developed countries.\n\nThat got Shripad Tuljapurkar, a Stanford University biologist, postdoctoral fellow Meredith Trotter, and Duncan Gillespie, a University of Liverpool public health researcher, thinking about what might cause the gap to expand or contract. They published their findings recently in the journal Demography.\n\nRelated: Caregivers for the Elderly Are the New 'Working Moms' \u00bb\n\nFrom Statistics to Social Trends\n\nThe longevity gap in the U.S. \u201cseemed surprising to me given how important health is supposed to be in the U.S., and all the improvements that we keep making that are supposed to make people live longer and have fewer accidents,\u201d Tuljapurkar told Healthline.\n\nWhat makes the U.S. so unequal?\n\nThe researchers observed, first, that extending the lives of elderly people doesn\u2019t just increase the country's average life expectancy. It also increases the gap between early and late deaths, unless doctors also find ways to save more young people.\n\nThe age at which deaths \u201ctip\u201d from closing the gap down to widening it is 65, the official start of old age, the paper calculates.\n\nIt\u2019s a statistical effect, but it points to a real issue in the U.S. healthcare system. We save ever sicker, older people but have trouble improving outcomes for some younger, healthier people.\n\n\u201cThe great good of development has been the consistent improvement of medical technology and care for the elderly, reflected in steadily declining old-age mortality,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cHowever, our results suggest that without comparable progress against young adult mortality, through action on the social determinants, mortality change is unlikely to follow the historical pattern of rising life expectancy and falling lifespan inequality.\u201d\n\nThese younger people may not have access to healthcare, or may be exposed to violent crime. The strongest forces pulling young deaths away from the average are heart disease and homicides. Heart disease is widespread in the U.S., and homicides generally target people far younger than the average age of death.\n\nHeart Disease by the Numbers \u00bb\n\nToo Many Young Deaths Point to Unequal Access to Care\n\nThe biggest problem is lack of access to healthcare, the study suggests. Longevity studies done for the World Health Organization have shown that the U.S.'s average life expectancy of 78 years masks huge differences between poorer and richer counties.\n\nIn some U.S. counties, life expectancy is lower than it is in Honduras or the Philippines.\n\n\u201cAt the lower end of education and income spectrum, people don\u2019t have regular access to healthcare, so they\u2019ll take medications for a while, then they lose coverage and they can\u2019t afford it, so they just quit,\u201d Tuljapurkar said.\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s longevity gap started to grow relative to its neighbor Canada\u2019s in the 1980s, according to the researchers. That\u2019s when Canada launched its national healthcare system to give all its citizens access to care.\n\n\u201cThat seemed to us as the simplest explanation that we could come up with,\u201d Tuljapurkar said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a proof in the scientific sense.\u201d\n\nThe hypothesis will be tested soon enough, as the Affordable Care Act expands access to health insurance in America. If the law survives legal challenges, Tuljapurkar predicted that by 2020, the number of deaths among younger adults in the U.S. will decline.\n\nLearn More: How the Affordable Care Act Works \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Shripad Tuljapurkar, Stanford University, Meredith Trotter, Duncan Gillespie, University of Liverpool, demography, World Health Organization, life expectancy, longevity, health access,", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Life expectancy has steadily climbed for decades.
