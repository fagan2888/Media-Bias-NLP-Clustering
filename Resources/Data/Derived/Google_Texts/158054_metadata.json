Also proposed is a new law to force airlines to share full passenger lists with police and security agencies, and plans to temporarily suspend to passports of UK citizens fighting for ISIS, preventing them from coming home.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to the Sun, talks over the measures were \u201ctense\u201d and going on well into the night last night, ahead of the Prime Minister\u2019s emergency statement in the House of Commons this afternoon.\n\nThe proposals come after the UK\u2019s offical terror threat level was raised last week to severe, meaning that an attack is \u201chighly likely\u201d. Security sources have also said that there is a risk that ISIS sympathisers may perform a \u201cmarauding terrorist firearms attack\u201d (MTFA), which involves opening fire in a crowded place with automatic weapons.\n\nAlthough the Prime Minister is determined to plug any gaps in the UK\u2019s defences, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is under pressure from senior members of his own party block any further clampdown. One former leader, Paddy Ashdown said that is was \u201cthe job of politicians to act but as jealous protectors of our liberties,\u201d while another, Sir Menzies Campbell, said that stripping UK jihadis of their citizenship could \u201cconstitute illegality\u201d.\n\nTight terror controls were scrapped in 2011 after the Deputy Prime Minister demanded that the government abolish Control Orders, replacing them with the less severe \u201cTerrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures\u201d (TPIMs).\n\nSenior Labour MP Hazel Blears said: \u201cNick Clegg should get off his high horse and do something to protect the British people\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UK Government Agrees Forced 'De-Radicalisation' Schools for Returning Jihadis", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "UK Government Agrees Forced 'De-Radicalisation' Schools for Returning Jihadis", "title": "UK Government Agrees Forced 'De-Radicalisation' Schools for Returning Jihadis - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/18/Jihadist-Propaganda-ISIS-Film.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/09/01/uk-government-agrees-forced-de-radicalisation-schools-for-returning-jihadis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UK Government Agrees Forced 'De-Radicalisation' Schools for Returning Jihadis", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/18/Jihadist-Propaganda-ISIS-Film.jpg", "title": "UK Government Agrees Forced 'De-Radicalisation' Schools for Returning Jihadis - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "published_time": "2014-09-01T03:57:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBritain\u2019s governing coalition has agreed that potential Jihadis who return to Britain from abroad should be forced to undergo a de-radicalisation programme when they arrive back in the UK.\nAlthough the Prime Minister is determined to plug any gaps in the UK\u2019s defences, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is under pressure from senior members of his own party block any further clampdown.\nThe proposal is one of a series of measures agreed by the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats who form Britain\u2019s coalition government.\nThe proposals come after the UK\u2019s offical terror threat level was raised last week to severe, meaning that an attack is \u201chighly likely\u201d.\nSenior Labour MP Hazel Blears said: \u201cNick Clegg should get off his high horse and do something to protect the British people\u201d."}
