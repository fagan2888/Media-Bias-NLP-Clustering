When Mauricio did not arrive at the bus stop on time one recent afternoon, a school employee was able to calm her fears by assuring her that the bus was running late but that her son had scanned his card and would be home soon.\n\n\u201cAs a parent you always worry,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI went to Denver Public Schools \u2026 and we didn\u2019t have any system for the buses. I remember being young and getting off at the wrong bus stop and my mom wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nStarting in October, district officials will begin training other campuses to implement the monitoring system. Nicole Portee, DPS\u2019s executive director of transportation, said all of the district\u2019s campuses should be using the student tracking system by the end of January.\n\nA key piece of the program that will also be implemented next month gives parents access to the information about their child through a secure website.\n\n\u201cWe deal with a lot of obstacles on the road, and time is of the essence to everyone,\u201d Portee said. \u201cFor us, our whole premise for doing this is providing parents and schools more accessible information as it relates to students and their whereabouts and safety.\u201d\n\nSchool districts in Boston, North Carolina and Illinois have implemented some form of tracking system on buses carrying students. In Colorado, districts that include Douglas County, Aurora, Adams 12 and St. Vrain Valley Schools have programs that can track when individual students board and exit school buses.\n\n\u201cThe educational responsibility for us starts at that bus stop, and this is a way of knowing who gets on that bus the same way we know who comes to class,\u201d said St. Vrain Superintendent Don Haddad.\n\nDPS received a $98,000 grant from the state\u2019s Regional Air Quality Council to install GPS systems on school buses. The district will pay for the rest of the program, which includes providing badges to students, with money from its general fund.\n\nDavid Singer, who leads University Prep, said the system has been particularly important for parents in northeast Denver, where one bus can carry students from various elementary, middle and high schools and make several stops.\n\n\u201cThe more information parents have about the whereabouts of their kids, the happier they are,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThe fact that our parents can really know where their kids are and have peace of mind about that is a real plus.\u201d\n\nZahira Torres: 303-954-1244, ztorres@denverpost.com or twitter.com/zahiratorresdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Public Schools give children bus cards to increase safety", "title": "Denver Public Schools give children bus cards to increase safety", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/08/denver-public-schools-give-children-bus-cards-to-increase-safety/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130908__20130909_A4_CD09BUSp2.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130908__20130909_A4_CD09BUSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-08T19:07:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:51:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Public Schools, Parenting"}, "article_summary": "The simple swipe of a bus card will soon help give parents peace of mind in Denver Public Schools.\n\u201cI went to Denver Public Schools \u2026 and we didn\u2019t have any system for the buses.\nNext month, DPS will begin issuing electronic cards to about 26,000 children in an effort to strengthen safety measures for those who take a bus to school.\nNicole Portee, DPS\u2019s executive director of transportation, said all of the district\u2019s campuses should be using the student tracking system by the end of January.\n\u201cThe educational responsibility for us starts at that bus stop, and this is a way of knowing who gets on that bus the same way we know who comes to class,\u201d said St. Vrain Superintendent Don Haddad."}
