Come 2015, business owners with 50 or more employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nSome owners of small businesses fear the mandate will be too expensive, effectively halting company growth, and will add many burdensome administrative tasks to their daily duties.\n\nHowever, proponents say millions of employees across the country who previously weren't afforded benefits will now have that option. And it could result in lower premium costs, due to a larger percentage of the population's being covered by health insurance.\n\nStaten Island Chamber of Commerce President Linda Baran says the outcome is impossible to predict.\n\n\"People have a lot of questions. There have been so many changes [to the Affordable Care Act],\" she said. \"There's been so much talk about the Affordable Care Act and how it will help small businesses, but everyone has seen double-digit increases in premiums from one year to the next over the last few years,\" she added.\n\nSaid George Telmany, senior business adviser for the Small Business Development Center: \"It's putting pressure on small-business [owners] to make some decisions they don't quite understand yet. It's also frightening for the small-business community. This stems from the 'We don't know what's coming aspect.'\"\n\nAs it is, many small-business owners fear for their bottom line.\n\n\"The biggest concern among small-business owners is the cost: How will this affect them, dollarwise?\" said John Amodio, second vice chair of Staten Island's SCORE -- a nonprofit association of 13,000-plus business experts who volunteer as mentors. \"The point is, I don't know what this will cost. This creates uncertainty.\" \u0090\n\nIMPACT ON HIRING\u009d \u0090\n\nSottile, who offers health insurance to his managerial and administrative staff, is faced with having to extend benefits to all his 300 security guards.\n\n\"I know a lot of my competitors are now looking for security guards who have current medical plans, and those people will likely win out over a person who doesn't have insurance,\" said Sottile.\n\nHe admitted that his company may have to weigh whether to hire more part-time employees, rather than full-time workers for whom he'll have to provide health insurance.\n\nOther borough merchants say the pending mandate to provide health coverage may inhibit business owners with 40 or more employees from expanding.\n\nDespite the mandate, Jerry Amerosi, owner of Gerald Peter's Goldmine and the Pandora store in the Staten Island Mall, has chosen to open a third store, which puts his total employee base over 50 workers.\n\n\"I want everyone to have health insurance, but if the premiums aren't going to go down, then that's a problem,\" said Amerosi. \"I have to pay $1,200 per month, per person; how will I be able to do that? ... I really think this [Affordable Care Act] is going to hurt everybody. I think the government is overstepping its bounds.\"\n\nSaid Ms. Baran: \"I certainly know businesses will be concerned about going over the 50-employee level. Those businesses need to talk to their attorney, insurance broker and accountant. They really need to look at this holistically and see what kind of impact this will have on them financially.\"\n\nHowever, some small-business owners who already provide health benefits for their employees are hoping the changes will result in lower insurance premiums.\n\nWith about 45 employees, Pleasant Plains-based Scaran has been providing health benefits to its employees for the last 20 years. \"It becomes more of a challenge to provide benefits every year. To make it more affordable, the employees have been forced to go to a higher deductible plan,\" said Tom Scarangello, general manager. \"My hope is that the Affordable Care Act will make health care affordable, and drive the cost of coverage down. ... That's the ultimate dream.\" \u0090\n\nHEALTH CARE OPTIONS\u009d \u0090\n\nThrough the website nystateofhealth.ny.gov, employers and employees alike can learn about the Health Benefit Exchange, which is a virtual marketplace that was designed to help small businesses and individuals enroll in health care plans.\n\n\"The Chamber will be a navigator -- which are community-based organizations throughout the state -- to educate people and small businesses about how to access the Exchange,\" said Ms. Baran. \"Small-business owners will be able to go to this portal and chose insurance and get one bill. It's not yet clear what's going to be offered outside the exchange through brokers.\"\n\nAccording to the website, insurance coverage can be purchased through the Health Benefit Exchange beginning in October and will be effective Jan. 1.\n\n---\n\nFollow @siadvance on Twitter, join us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Insurance mandate's chilly reception\u009d from Staten Island businesses", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Insurance mandate\\u0027s chilly reception\u009d from Staten Island businesses\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/insurance_mandates_chilly_rece.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13348439-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11176647\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-04T15:33:03Z\", \"author\": \"Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@TraceyPorpora1", "site": "@SIAdvance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Small-business owners fret about costs of compliance, though some hold to hope of lower premiums\u009d"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, September 04, 2013, 11:33 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/health04jpg-acea2ed0d213e6c1.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"tporpora\", \"author_nickname\": \"Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"10346524\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Small-business owners fret about costs of compliance, though some hold to hope of lower premiums\u009d", "title": "Insurance mandate's chilly reception\u009d from Staten Island businesses", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/insurance_mandates_chilly_rece.html", "image": "http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13348439-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tracey-Porpora/534339770025055?ref=bookmarks"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, September 04, 2013, 11:30 AM", "article_author": "Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com", "Description": "Small-business owners fret about costs of compliance, though some hold to hope of lower premiums\u009d"}, "article_summary": "\"My hope is that the Affordable Care Act will make health care affordable, and drive the cost of coverage down.\nAnd it could result in lower premium costs, due to a larger percentage of the population's being covered by health insurance.\nCome 2015, business owners with 50 or more employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\"I want everyone to have health insurance, but if the premiums aren't going to go down, then that's a problem,\" said Amerosi.\n\"Many small businesses just can't survive any additional costs.\""}
