But he\u2019ll also have to make sure that none of them gets so overloaded with ideological battles that they can\u2019t get 60 votes. For now, he\u2019s sticking to generalities: The power to write the appropriations bills \u201cgives us an opportunity to examine everything,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBudget: Jeff Sessions\n\nThe Alabama senator would be in charge of one of the most powerful tools Senate Republicans would have: the writing of budget reconciliation legislation, which could allow them to pass sweeping changes to entitlements, the Tax Code and Obamacare with just 51 votes. Sessions and his aides aren\u2019t talking about their plans, but he has been lukewarm about Paul Ryan\u2019s House budgets in the past, so it\u2019s not clear that he\u2019d back entitlement reforms that track closely with Ryan\u2019s ideas.\n\nFinance: Orrin Hatch\n\nHatch is one of the only Republicans to propose a comprehensive alternative to Obamacare, which he would be sure to push as a replacement. But he might not be able to sell it to Senate Republicans, since some think any Obamacare replacement should be a series of smaller bills, rather than one big bill. While he\u2019d be a thorn in President Barack Obama\u2019s side on health care, he could be an ally on trade: He has introduced legislation to give the president trade promotion authority.\n\nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions: Lamar Alexander\n\nHe\u2019d go after the Obama administration over its frequent use of waivers from the No Child Left Behind law and what he considers a maze of federal rules that has effectively created a \u201cnational school board.\u201d His agenda includes a rewrite of No Child Left Behind, private school vouchers and cutting back regulations in higher education. He might push a bill he\u2019s introduced with Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet that would significantly shorten the application for federal financial aid.\n\nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs: Richard Shelby\n\nThe Alabama Republican is willing to roll back some rules under the DoddFrank law and says there\u2019s \u201ca lot of stuff we could do that the Democrats would probably support.\u201d But he\u2019s no friend of big banks: He voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program and for a 2010 measure that would have broken up the country\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nAgriculture: Pat Roberts (likely)\n\nThe succession is less clear because Roberts is the third-ranking Republican, but he\u2019s the most likely chairman because top Republican Thad Cochran would take Appropriations and the No. 2 Republican, Mitch McConnell, would be busy running the Senate. If Roberts gets the chairmanship \u2014 assuming he survives an increasingly tough reelection bid \u2014 he\u2019d be likely to support food stamp cuts: He tried unsuccessfully to cut the program by 4 percent last year, arguing that \u201cwe can and should restore integrity to [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] for those who rely on it while being more responsible to the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nArmed Services: John McCain\n\nObama\u2019s 2008 opponent has made no secret that he wants the chairmanship, telling POLITICO in May that \u201canyone who tries to challenge me should hire someone to start their car.\u201d If he gets it, McCain would be able to hold hearings on the Obama administration\u2019s Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant strategy and press his case for more aggressive military action. He\u2019d also be a thorn in the administration\u2019s side over weapons systems he considers ineffective.\n\nEnvironment and Public Works: James Inhofe\n\nThe Oklahoma Republican would be sure to hold aggressive oversight hearings on the EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas regulations, but that\u2019s just for starters. He says he\u2019d also file challenges against every final EPA rule under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block regulations unless Obama vetoes the measures. He thinks he\u2019d be able to peel away Democrats who will want to distance themselves from Obama in 2016.\n\nCommerce, Science and Transportation: John Thune\n\nThune would likely hold early hearings on a rewrite of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It probably wouldn\u2019t get done next year, but he could start the process by emphasizing deregulation and making it easier for House Republicans to do the same. And it probably would be the end of the road for Obama administration initiatives like an online \u201cPrivacy Bill of Rights.\u201d Thune has said he wants to \u201cpreserve the light-touch regime, first implemented by the Clinton administration, that has been so successful in making us the digital envy of the world.\u201d\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources: Lisa Murkowski\n\nThe Alaska Republican isn\u2019t exactly the fiery, Obama-bashing type, but she\u2019d be at the center of the push to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as efforts to open up more offshore oil and gas exploration. She might also make a new push to advance the energy efficiency bill by Republican Sen. Rob Portman and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nForeign Relations: Bob Corker\n\nCorker has criticized Obama for being an \u201cunreliable ally\u201d and is clearly annoyed at the president for withdrawing his request for congressional authorization to launch military strikes against Syria last year \u2014 after Corker took a political risk by supporting it. He also wants Obama to get tougher with Russia and says he should have given aid to the Syrian rebels sooner. Still, Corker is able to work with Democrats and has a good relationship with the current chairman, Robert Menendez, that could take some of the edge off of future foreign policy debates.\n\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs: Ron Johnson (likely)\n\nThis is another committee for which the direct succession is unclear, but Johnson, currently the third-ranking Republican, believes he\u2019ll get the chairmanship because Tom Coburn is retiring and McCain wants Armed Services. If Johnson heads the committee, he says he would push to modernize regulations and set \u201cachievable goals\u201d on issues like immigration reform. He also says he would avoid \u201cshow trial\u201d hearings and try to set a bipartisan tone in the committee. One big question mark is who would head an important subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. McCain is the top Republican right now, but spokesman Brian Rogers says that while McCain \u201chas found the work on PSI quite fulfilling, he hasn\u2019t yet made any decisions on what to do on that, and likely won\u2019t until after the midterms.\u201d\n\nIntelligence: Richard Burr (in line)\n\nThe North Carolina Republican would have to choose between two possible chairmanships: Intelligence, for which he\u2019s next in line behind retiring Republican Saxby Chambliss, and Veterans\u2019 Affairs, where he\u2019s already at the top of the GOP ranks. Burr tells POLITICO he hasn\u2019t made up his mind what he would do under a GOP majority: \u201cI\u2019ll wait and see if it happens.\u201d As Intelligence chairman, Burr would be likely to take a close look at the ISIL threat, which he says he\u2019s concerned with because intelligence agencies don\u2019t know how\n\nmany of those terrorists might hold U.S. passports. If he doesn\u2019t take the Intelligence chairmanship, James Risch of Idaho would be next in line.\n\nJudiciary: Chuck Grassley\n\nThe Iowa Republican has been dedicated to aggressive oversight for many years, and he\u2019d be sure to use the gavel to go after the Obama administration with multiple investigations \u2014 including, possibly, reviving the probes into the bungled Fast and Furious gunrunning operation. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of something that\u2019s been out there a long time \u2014 Fast and Furious. Let\u2019s get to the bottom of IRS,\u201d he said. He also wants to strengthen protections for government whistleblowers.\n\nSmall Business: James Risch\n\nLike other Republicans, Risch is a critic of the impact of regulations on small businesses, especially Obamacare rules. The Idaho Republican is a sponsor of a bill that would allow small businesses and others to keep providing health coverage through self-insurance plans, a mechanism he says would be undermined by Obamacare. For the most part, though, he sticks to ideological generalities, like promoting his record of voting against Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\nVeterans\u2019 Affairs: Richard Burr (in line)\n\nIf Burr takes the Veterans\u2019 Affairs chairmanship, he\u2019d be a tough critic of the Veterans Administration and an advocate of changing the bureaucratic culture there, following up on the VA reform law he worked on with current Chairman Bernie Sanders. But he\u2019d also have some fences to mend with veterans groups that he accused of not being tough enough on former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki as the agency\u2019s scandal developed. If Burr were to choose the Intelligence chairmanship instead, Johnny Isakson of Georgia would be next in line.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Thad Cochran, Jeff Sessions and Orrin Hatch would oversee the most powerful panels.", "title": "Senate chairmen in a GOP majority", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/2014-elections-republican-senate-committee-chairmen-110941.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/14/140914_gop_senate_chairmen_aps_606.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Chuck Grassley,Bob Corker,Jeff Sessions,James Inhofe,Richard Shelby,Pat Roberts,John McCain,Thad Cochran,Ron Johnson,Jim Risch,John Thune,Lisa Murkowski,Richard Burr,Orrin Hatch,Lamar Alexander", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Thad Cochran, Jeff Sessions and Orrin Hatch would oversee the most powerful panels.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf124\"", "article_summary": "| AP Photos Senate chairmen in a GOP majorityAppropriations: Thad CochranFresh from his narrow win in Mississippi over tea party challenger Chris McDaniel, Cochran will be under pressure to load up the appropriations bills with as many challenges to the Obama administration as possible.\nHe also wants Obama to get tougher with Russia and says he should have given aid to the Syrian rebels sooner.\nIf Burr were to choose the Intelligence chairmanship instead, Johnny Isakson of Georgia would be next in line.\nBut he might not be able to sell it to Senate Republicans, since some think any Obamacare replacement should be a series of smaller bills, rather than one big bill.\nHe thinks he\u2019d be able to peel away Democrats who will want to distance themselves from Obama in 2016."}
