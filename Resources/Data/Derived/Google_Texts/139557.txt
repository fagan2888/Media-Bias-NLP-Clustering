At the risk of feeding into the Obamacare frenzy, there are some videos from the Health Council of Canada that are worth a look for those who want to see how they really practice medicine north of the border — and how they’re trying to make it better.

Sure, these are bound to bring dire warnings from those who vehemently oppose President Obama’s health-care overhaul — we wouldn’t have it any other way — but we offer these as instruction on the trials and tribulations of true socialized medicine, which is quite different from what we’ve had in the U.S. and also quite different from what we’re about to have with Obamacare.

The main difference is in wait times for medical procedures; some talk of waiting nearly a year for an orthopedic procedure, a queue that never would be tolerated in the U.S.

Here, the Health Council, a non-profit organization that monitors Canada’s care system, talks of how that nation is trying to reduce wait times and make the system more responsive to patients.

The most recent video is below. Others are on the Health Council’s page:
