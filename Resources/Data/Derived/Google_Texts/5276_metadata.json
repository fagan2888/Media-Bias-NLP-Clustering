He Danced While Collecting Disability\n\nIn 2013, the city had 1,400 working-age retirees. The city spends almost $12,000 per retiree age pre-65 at a cost of roughly $16.5 million per year, according to WMC Action News 5 in Memphis, which reported this story this week. The city says there is no requirement to track which of these retirees are working other jobs.\n\nFormer head of the Memphis police department, Larry Godwin, is one of those taking advantage of the city\u2019s health insurance largesse. Godwin collects nearly $60,000 a year in health care benefits, though he\u2019s now working as the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security Deputy Commissioner. The mayor says someone would simply have to propose that the city track employed retirees in order for the practice to stop, WMC Action News 5 reported.\n\n\u201cWe think that if they\u2019re on a job where there is coverage, that that\u2019s an option they should pursue,\u201d said Mayor Wharton, a Democrat. \u201cIf you don't have coverage, stay right where you are.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Years of Over $100 Billion in Improper Payments\n\nGodwin\u2019s communications director, when contacted by WMC Action News 5, responded, \u201cWhile currently an employee of the State of Tennessee, Deputy Commissioner Larry Godwin made the choice to take his earned retirement health care benefits from the City of Memphis to ensure that his family would have health care coverage after his service to the State ended. The State requires employees to work for ten years before earning health care retirement benefits, and Commissioner Godwin would not be eligible for those State retirement benefits until 2021, at age 70. He currently does not qualify for either Medicare or Social Security.\u201d\n\nThe full list of Memphis retirees, many of whom are still receiving city health insurance benefits, can be seen here.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In Memphis, city retirees under the age of 65 who are now fully employed somewhere els", "title": "Retired City Workers Bilk Memphis Out of $16.5 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/11/Retired-City-Workers-Bilk-Memphis-Out-165-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07112014_Memphis_Tennessee_James_Blucher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/11/Retired-City-Workers-Bilk-Memphis-Out-165-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07112014_Memphis_Tennessee_James_Blucher.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In Memphis, city retirees under the age of 65 who are now fully employed somewhere els", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9797\"", "article_summary": "In Memphis, city retirees under the age of 65 who are now fully employed somewhere else are still using the Memphis public employee insurance plans, at a tremendous cost to the city \u2013 simply because they can.\nHe currently does not qualify for either Medicare or Social Security.\u201dThe full list of Memphis retirees, many of whom are still receiving city health insurance benefits, can be seen here.\nFormer head of the Memphis police department, Larry Godwin, is one of those taking advantage of the city\u2019s health insurance largesse.\nGodwin collects nearly $60,000 a year in health care benefits, though he\u2019s now working as the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security Deputy Commissioner.\nMany of these pre-age 65 former city workers have opted out of their new companies\u2019 health insurance plans, choosing instead to stay with their far more generous public worker benefits."}
