There is one stick though. Ultimately, the Affordable Care, requires insurers that fail to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health care to refund the difference to consumers.\n\nAlabama joins Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming among states whose rate review is overseen by the feds.\n\nWhen and what will consumers see?\n\nSo when and how will Alabamians know when what their 2015 rates will be?\n\nMackin said \"any adjustments will be communicated via written communication to our members.\"\n\nBCBS of Alabama sent out 87,000 letters in the fall of 2013 for 2014 rates -- the majority, she has said, were notifications of premium increases.\n\nMeanwhile the federal government is working on ways to provide more information about rates and rate hikes to the public, according to the HHS official.\n\nNew regulations going into effect this year will give CMS, which is an agency of HHS, the authority to collect information on all rate filings, not just those of 10 percent or more.\n\nBut what will the public see?\n\nThe dissemination of information to the public is still a work in progress.\n\nHHS said they are currently examining the insurance-provided information to see what might be able to be disclosed and what might be proprietary.\n\n\"This new information is currently working its way through the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) process to determine whether certain parts of the filings are exempt from public disclosure.\n\n\"We are currently working through this process in order to provide the public more information as soon as possible.\"\n\nStay tuned, the official said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable care Act, blue cross and blue shield, news", "title": "Obamacare's next big story? 2015 premium hikes.
