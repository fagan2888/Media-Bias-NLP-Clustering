But at that time, our nation was experiencing an unprecedented economic boom and most of Reagan\u2019s \u201crosy scenarios\u201d were being realized. In contrast, Tuesday night, President Obama laid out a \u201crosy scenario\u201d for the economy that was built on a bed of flagrant inaccuracies.\n\nOne cannot chalk this up to ignorance. Evidence of economic malaise is everywhere. The labor force participation rate is at its lowest since 1978. The unemployment rate has declined at least in part because so many people have given up looking for work that they are no longer counted in official unemployment statistics. Many more have been forced into part-time positions as employers seek to avoid heavy Obamacare costs.\n\nFurthermore, marginal improvements in the economy have been fueled by the domestic oil boom, which Obama has fought tooth and nail. But food stamp utilization is perhaps the most blatant illustration of our still-sclerotic economy.\n\nNow called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(\u201cSNAP\u201d), in 2014, fully 46.5 million Americans were enrolled at a cost of $73.8 billion. For each of President Obama\u2019s six full years in office, food stamp use has been higher than at any time in history\u2014almost double its highest previous rates\u2014and more people have been added to the rolls than during any other presidency.\n\nFood stamp usage declined last year for the first time since Obama was elected, a meager 2 percent. The number of people on food stamps, however, remains over 18 million higher than during President Bush\u2019s highest year, and 19.5 million higher than the previous record set in 1993. (See chart below).\n\nThese indicators are not the sign of an economic recovery; but rather an indication that the American economy has moved into a new normal\u2014one of chronically high unemployment and welfare utilization.\n\nEverything in Obama\u2019s SOTU address promised more of the same. Obama said it was time to \u201cturn the page.\u201d As Dave Greenfield at Front Page Magazine quipped, \u201cWhen everything on the last page looks so bad, then it\u2019s time to turn the page\u2026\u201d\n\nDespite his penchant for prevarication, Obama has his disciples. Like Obama, outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who has set his sights on higher office, has built his reputation on fiction. When former Republican Gov. Bob Ehrlich left office in 2006, Maryland\u2019s state budget stood at $25.8 billion. O\u2019Malley claims he cut the budget to the bone, but in his eight years in office, it grew to $37.3 billion, an increase of 45 percent.\n\nWhile claiming to champion \u201cgreen\u201d environmental policies, O\u2019Malley repeatedly raided trust funds earmarked for Chesapeake Bay cleanup to the tune of at least $135 million since 2009. He doubled Maryland\u2019s infamous \u201cflush tax\u201d to refill the fund, raided it again, and passed the uniformly unpopular \u201crain tax.\u201d He also raided the highway trust fund repeatedly to the tune of $868 million between 2009 and 2011 alone, despite receiving $771 million in stimulus funds for infrastructure projects. When this wasn\u2019t enough, he repaid trust funds by issuing new bonds. Maryland\u2019s current structural budget deficit stands at $1.2 billion.\n\nDespite the fact that Maryland floats on federal dollars more than any other state, between 2004 and 2012, Maryland\u2019s food stamp utilization grew 162 percent\u2013 a rate exceeded by only three other states (See FGA SNAP document). Over 13 percent of Maryland\u2019s population is currently using food stamps. In 2010, the depth of the recession, only 9.7 percent of Marylanders used food stamps. Most of this can likely be credited to Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s sanctuary state policies.\n\nLarry Hogan is the newly-elected governor of Maryland, only the third Republican elected to that position since 1960. Hogan has identified the cost of O\u2019Malley policies. \u201cUnder O\u2019Malley and [Lt. Gov. Anthony] Brown, Maryland has lost 8,000 businesses and unemployment has nearly doubled,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, 26 percent of our manufacturing base, and with it 25,000 jobs, has disappeared. Today, Maryland is dead last in the nation in manufacturing.\u201d In his inaugural address delivered on Wednesday, Hogan said, \u201cTogether, let\u2019s make Maryland a place that we can all be proud of again.\u201d He has his work cut out for him.\n\nThis article was written by contributors of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A potential contender for the 2016 presidential race uses the same rhetoric and has produced similar policy results as President Obama.", "title": "Obama\u2019s 'rosy scenario' and the man that could fill his boots - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/shutterstock_97374827.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/194709/obamas-rosy-scenario-man-fill-boots/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "Budget and Spending,food stamps,Gov.
