In fact, it is not even unusual for foreigners who emigrate to America for whatever reason to hold the country in such contempt that they would go to extreme lengths to make it comport with what their worldview dictates is Utopia. For one man, those extreme lengths included attaining political office to tear apart the government simply because in its current form, it goes contrary to his ideological bent.\n\nRepublicans have been on an anti-government tear since Americans elected an African American as President; not necessarily because they hate the government, but because they cannot control the direction of the country. Oh, it is true there is a relatively large contingent of Republicans who would love nothing more than to see this government reduced to a size they could drown in a bathtub,but they are intelligent enough to keep their machinations limited to starving the government into bankruptcy under the guise of fiscal conservatism. Most Republicans refuse to countenance government they cannot control and it has been the driving force behind their crusade to obstruct governance for nearly six years including shutting it down to achieve their goals.\n\nTed Cruz hates America\u2019s government nearly as much as the illegal immigrant\u2019s son and former-Canadian hates America and its people; of this there is little doubt. In fact, there is very little that Ted Cruz even likes about this country, including the United States Constitution, that he would burn to the ground in a hot second if he were able. Cruz\u2019s vision for America is a nation controlled by an evangelical version of ISIS made up of a supreme council of corporate-Christians; there would be no representatives of the people. In fact, last month Texas Ted said, openly and without hesitation, that following the Constitution and allowing the Senate to operate normally \u201csubverts the will of the people and weakens government accountability.\u201d\n\nIt is highly likely that after evangelical Senator Ted Cruz successfully seized control of the House majority from Speaker John Boehner and directed Republicans to shut down the government last October, he figured shutting down the Senate \u201che continues to oppose\u201d for a couple of months would be an easy task. Last month teabagger Cruz tried to force Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to cancel the Senate because \u201cit weakens accountability and subverts the will of the American people\u201d if their elected representatives dared to work after November 4, Election Day.\n\nCruz circulated a letter among Republican Senators for support to demand that Reid not schedule a legislative session after November 3rd because as Cruz\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cWe continue to oppose it.\u201d Cruz\u2019s draft letter said, \u201cWe should commit to completing the Senate\u2019s business by November 3, 2014,\u201d and \u201call pledge to not convene the Senate on or between November 4, 2014, and January 2, 2015.\u201d Cruz\u2019s letter ignored Republican and Democratic leaders\u2019 prior agreement to pass a stopgap measure to fund the government until December 11, that even the House passed to ensure some business would be finished during the lame duck session.\n\nOne of Cruz\u2019s teabagger cohorts, Senator Mike Lee (TB-UT), agreed that the idea of the Senate using December to act on \u201cstalled legislation\u201d was an abomination and like Cruz, he \u201ccontinues to oppose it.\u201d Since their Republican colleagues panned the \u201cshut down the Senate\u201d ploy, Cruz and Lee changed the demand\u2019s language and threatened to obstruct any Senate business if the lame duck session proceeded against their will. Although their effort to enlist Republican support to close the Senate for two months or obstruct any business officially failed, there is no doubt Republicans will block anything the President supports.\n\nWhen Sen. Mike Lee was the only senator to sign on to his letter, Cruz slightly changed the demand that Reid cancel the Senate for two months and warned him Democrats would face a variety of overwhelming procedural hurdles to make sure nothing was accomplished that did not originate with Ted Cruz. Even after changing the demand for a Senate shutdown to a monumental obstruction threat, most Senate Republicans did not sign on to Cruz\u2019s demand to stop Senate business.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid had already laid out the lame-duck session agenda nearly two months ago and is not about to let important government business go unattended. The agenda includes an omnibus spending bill, a package of tax extenders, the annual Defense Department authorization, and the Marketplace Fairness Act; a bipartisan measure that gives states the right to collect tax from online retailers. Other important business was Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin\u2019s announcement that the Foreign Relations Committee would hold hearings on a resolution authorizing military strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria with an aim of holding a floor vote in December. A hearing and vote Cruz already pledged to obstruct with a variety of procedural hurdles because he was unable to shut down the Senate for two months.\n\nCruz does not want anything passed in the lame duck session, particularly if it includes even a penny of government spending. In fact, he is anxious to fulfill Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge to \u201ceviscerate the federal government, all of it\u201d and Cruz\u2019s first target is Social Security and Medicare. Cruz considers Social Security \u201ca giant Ponzi scheme\u201d and besides raising the retirement age to 70 and slashing retirees\u2019 benefits, he lusts to hand the Trust\u2019s trillions-of-dollars in reserves to Wall Street in a privatization scam.\n\nThis is the second time in less than a year that Ted Cruz has displayed his twisted mindset that if he cannot control the government, he will not allow it to function. In fact, Mitch McConnell has embraced Cruz\u2019s no-governance ideology and threatened to defund the government if Republicans win control of the Senate and President Obama does not join their crusade to decimate Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, food stamps, and Medicaid; among many, many other social programs.\n\nTed Cruz is not unique in his attempt to bring the government to a screeching halt if his agenda is not enacted, because for the past five-and-a-half years Republicans have blocked and obstructed governance as a matter of course. Where Cruz is \u201cspecial,\u201d is that he has no qualms literally shutting the government down and in lieu of that action, actually attempted to shut down the United States Senate for two months. That he claimed allowing the Senate to function according to the U.S. Constitution \u201csubverts the will of the American people\u201d and \u201cweakens government accountability\u201d informs his twisted belief that anything out of his purview is inherently subversive and wrong. It is dangerously close to an evil dictator\u2019s worldview, and yet, it is part-and-parcel of Republican policy since Americans elected an African American man as their President nearly six years ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In fact, there is very little that Ted Cruz even likes about this country, including the United States Constitution, that he would burn to the ground in a hot second if he were able.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In fact, there is very little that Ted Cruz even likes about this country, including the United States Constitution, that he would burn to the ground in a hot second if he were able.", "title": "Ted Cruz Says A Functioning Senate Subverts the Will of The People", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/22/ted-cruz-working-government-subverts-people.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Texas-Ted-Cruz.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-22T13:47:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,Department of Defense,federal government,food stamps,government,Government Shutdown,Harry Reid,ISIS,John Boehner,Lame duck session,Majority Leader,medicare,midterm elections,Mike Lee,mitch mcconnell,Obama,Senate,Senate Shutdown,shutting down the Senate,social security,Ted Cruz,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-10-22T13:47:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T13:47:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Department of Defense, federal government, food stamps, government, Government Shutdown, Harry Reid, ISIS, John Boehner, Lame duck session, Majority Leader, medicare, midterm elections, Mike Lee, mitch mcconnell, Obama, Senate, Senate Shutdown, shutting down the Senate, social security, Ted Cruz"}, "article_summary": "Even after changing the demand for a Senate shutdown to a monumental obstruction threat, most Senate Republicans did not sign on to Cruz\u2019s demand to stop Senate business.\nTed Cruz hates America\u2019s government nearly as much as the illegal immigrant\u2019s son and former-Canadian hates America and its people; of this there is little doubt.\nIn fact, there is very little that Ted Cruz even likes about this country, including the United States Constitution, that he would burn to the ground in a hot second if he were able.\nThis is the second time in less than a year that Ted Cruz has displayed his twisted mindset that if he cannot control the government, he will not allow it to function.\nA hearing and vote Cruz already pledged to obstruct with a variety of procedural hurdles because he was unable to shut down the Senate for two months."}
