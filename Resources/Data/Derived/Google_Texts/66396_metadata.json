Three boys escaped, officials said, but the rest were washed away. Twelve bodies were recovered on Tuesday, some of them miles downstream in Arizona.\n\nThe missing boy was identified on Wednesday as Tyson Lucas Black, 6, and officials said crews, some using sniffer dogs, were going back over the entire flood area, which extends for nearly seven miles (11 km) along the banks of Short Creek.\n\nHildale, home to fewer than 3,000 people, is twinned with Colorado City, across the border in Arizona.\n\nBoth cities are home to the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That sect is not affiliated with the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which renounced polygamy in 1890.\n\n(Reporting by Peg McEntee; Additional reporting and writing by Daniel Wallis in Denver; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Eric Beech)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Rescuers searched for a 6-year-old boy and a hiker missing", "title": "Search for bodies after Utah floods kill at least 18", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/15/least-eight-dead-flash-flood-hits-Utah", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-utah-flood_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/15/least-eight-dead-flash-flood-hits-Utah", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-utah-flood_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Rescuers searched for a 6-year-old boy and a hiker missing", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "More bad weather and the threat of further floods have hampered rescue operations in the park, county officials said.\nSALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Rescuers searched for a 6-year-old boy and a hiker missing on Wednesday after flash floods in southern Utah killed at least 18 people in a national park and a small town on the Arizona border.\nThe search resumed Wednesday with more than 60 park rescue workers, sheriff's deputies and others checking Zion's Clear Creek, Pine Creek and Virgin River areas, officials said.\n(Reporting by Peg McEntee; Additional reporting and writing by Daniel Wallis in Denver; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Eric Beech)\n\"Once weather conditions improve, they will also search Keyhole Canyon and Pine Creek Canyon,\" the park said in a statement, adding that the names of the dead and missing were being withheld until relatives are notified."}
