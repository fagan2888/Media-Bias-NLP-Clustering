Sanders says that under the plan, a typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in healthcare costs.\n\n\"It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee healthcare to all citizens as a right, not a privilege,\" Sanders said in his announcement of the plan.\n\nBut how will a single-payer system affect the country's private insurers--and the impact they have on the economy?\n\nTo find out, FierceHealthPayer analyzed data from America's Health Plans (AHIP) on how insurers contribute to the economy and health coverage in each state. Here's a brief rundown of how AHIP's most recent data plays out nationally:\n\nStates collect $17.4 billion in premium taxes from health plans.\n\nHealth insurers provide a total of 515,234 direct jobs, which is an average of 10,103 per state.\n\nHealth insurers provide 842,105 indirect jobs, which is an average of 16,512 per state.\n\nAn average of 54.69 percent of residents across all 50 states and the District of Columbia are insured through private payers.\n\nThe net savings Sanders expects from his plan will come from \"reduced spending on administrative activities, in both private insurers and providers' offices, reduced spending on monopoly prices for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and a slowdown in the growth of spending because of controls on administrative costs and drug prices,\" University of Massachusetts at Amherst economics professor Gerald Friedman writes in a memo assessing the plan.\n\nThe Sanders campaign also has said that his plan would cost an additional $1.38 trillion per year and would be financed primarily by raising taxes on high-earners, employers and other entities. Yet an analysis out Wednesday from the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget finds that those proposed offsets would cover only 75 percent of the projected cost, adding up to a $3 trillion shortfall over 10 years.\n\nFor its part, the health insurance industry's biggest trade group is, understandably, against eliminating private payers.\n\n\"A competitive market is key to delivering on the promise of consumer choice, value and innovation,\" America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) spokeswoman Courtney Jay wrote in an email to FierceHealthPayer.\n\n\"Health plans are working to deliver that value to consumers every day by offering them a range of coverage choices and improving the way we pay for care. That needs to be the focus moving forward.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's Sanders' announcement\n\n- read the details of his plan\n\n- check out Friedman's memo\n\n- read the Committee for a Responsible Budget analysis\n\n- here's the AHIP data\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBernie Sanders details plan for single-payer healthcare system\n\nClinton vs. Sanders: Battle of the healthcare policies\n\nThe rise and fall of Vermont's single-payer healthcare system", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders closer than ever,\u00a0one of the key differences\u00a0that has emerged between the two Democratic presidential candidates is their healthcare policy positions.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "With the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders closer than ever,\u00a0one of the key differences\u00a0that has emerged between the two Democratic presidential candidates is their healthcare policy positions.", "title": "Bernie Sanders' healthcare plan: The trouble with nixing private insurers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/bernie-sanders-healthcare-plan-trouble-nixing-private-insurers/2016-02-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "America's Health Insurance Plans,Bernie Sanders,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Presidential Election,Private Insurers,single-payer system", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's Sanders' announcement- read the details of his plan- check out Friedman's memo- read the Committee for a Responsible Budget analysis- here's the AHIP dataRelated Articles:Bernie Sanders details plan for single-payer healthcare systemClinton vs. Sanders: Battle of the healthcare policiesThe rise and fall of Vermont's single-payer healthcare system\nHealth insurers provide a total of 515,234 direct jobs, which is an average of 10,103 per state.\nHealth insurers provide 842,105 indirect jobs, which is an average of 16,512 per state.\nBut how will a single-payer system affect the country's private insurers--and the impact they have on the economy?\nHere's a brief rundown of how AHIP's most recent data plays out nationally:States collect $17.4 billion in premium taxes from health plans."}
