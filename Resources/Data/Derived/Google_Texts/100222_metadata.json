Discipline referrals are down at Carver Elementary, too, as well as at other schools across the district.\n\n\u201cIn my 39 years, this has been the smoothest start to a school year,\u201d Assistant Superintendent Diana Ezell said. \u201cI think we can attribute that to the teachers modeling and setting up the expectations.\u201d\n\nThe program was implemented as a part of a discipline action plan the district was required to develop by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights after being cited as being unfair in its administration of discipline to black students.\n\nThe district, in which 65 percent of the students qualify for free-and-reduced price lunches, decided to take a look at how poverty affects disciplinary problems in school, bringing in nationally-acclaimed author and educator Ruby Payne to speak to teachers and administrators.\n\n\u201cWe expect students to come in to school with a certain reality, and when they don\u2019t, we don\u2019t know how to navigate,\u201d Payne said to the district\u2019s teachers at their convocation in July.\n\nBecause its students inevitably come from diverse backgrounds, TPSD developed a set of universal expectations to be taught during those first 20 days.\n\nThen, the district set out to teach them in an effort to create a level playing field for all students and decrease discipline problems.\n\nEach day for those first 20 days of the school year, the district\u2019s students were taught a lesson on a specific behavior ranging from the proper way to get a teacher\u2019s attention to following instructions to accepting \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\nOn the morning announcements every day, the students received a preview of what that day\u2019s behavior lesson would be, setting the stage for teachers to give the lesson at the beginning of class.\n\nThose behavior lessons were woven together with discussions of character traits like respect and responsibility.\n\n\u201cFor many of our students, we are their first teachers,\u201d Ezell said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just students from poverty. School is a different environment, and there are unique routines and procedures that all students have to adjust to.\u201d\n\nSummer Allen, seventh grade science teacher at TMS, said she has been adamant about pointing and acting out correct behaviors to her students.\n\nBut when Allen first heard about the program, she was skeptical that they would respond and unsure the students really needed such specific lessons.\n\nWhat she found, however, is that teachers cannot assume students come into their classrooms knowing how to behave at school.\n\n\u201cIt really has made a difference,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAssumptions can lead to discipline issues.\u201d\n\nCarver first-grade teacher Ragen Lambert said she has tried to make the lessons engaging and interactive by integrating the arts, like skits and performing.\n\nLambert said the students acted out the correct and incorrect behaviors being studied.\n\n\u201cA lot of them use the vocabulary,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThey\u2019re using the vocabulary, and they\u2019re using it right.\u201d\n\nFor example, Lambert said she has students point out to her, \u201cThat\u2019s me being respectful.\u201d\n\nA decline in discipline referrals has been accompanied by the cultivation of a positive school environment and improved teacher-student communication, Carver and TMS teachers agreed.\n\nTMS students have also been setting academic and behavioral goals to work toward, which brings self-reflection into play.\n\nAccording to Knight, character education can complement traditional academic subjects by promoting hard work and producing motivated students.\n\n\u201cI think discussion about the character-ed traits leads to students and teachers forming positive relationships,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOnce those relationships are established, they\u2019ll be more motivated to work hard and work toward those goals.\u201d\n\nEzell said teachers have reported less instruction time wasted and fewer in-class distractions.\n\n\u201cThe focus on the rules and transitions in the class has enabled the students to spend more time on instruction,\u201d Ezell said.\n\nIn the last three years, TPSD\u2019s discipline referral rates have been on the decline, and Ezell said the first 20 days program and focus on character education was the next step in improving that rate.\n\nMoving forward, teachers at both Carver and TMS said they would continue to do lessons similar to those done during the first 20 days of school.\n\nTPSD has also designated a monthly character trait for each month, which will be taught and focused on in the schools as a continuation of the character education program.\n\nemma.crawford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @emcatcrawford", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Emma Crawford Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 In June, Tupelo Schools announced at a School Board retreat it would introduce a new character education plan at the beginning of the school year to take place during the first 20 days of class.
