(And she says it everywhere.) Dave Ramsey says 3-6 months.\n\nWhen I talked to folks locally, I got answers on either side of those. Pam Dumonceau, president and CEO, Consistent Values, Inc., an independent Denver Registered Investment Advisor, was on the long side, saying she recommends an emergency fund of six to 24 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about how long it can take to replace one\u2019s job, one\u2019s income. Often times now, that\u2019s six months to a year,\u201d Dumonceau said.\n\nAmy Fidelis, marketing and education director at mpowered, a financial literacy nonprofit, said that when you\u2019re just starting out, you might as well start with one month.\n\n\u201cYou could do a budget and figure out what your monthly expenses are and start to build toward however many months of expenses you want to be able to cover,\u201d she says. \u201cOr the more gradual way would be to make sure you\u2019ve got a month\u2019s rent or mortgage, and add in your car. Then take whatever you\u2019ve got for one month, and multiply.\u201d\n\nOK, so, somewhere between one month and two years, right?\n\nFine, fine, let\u2019s get a little more concrete. Here\u2019s the premise: If you lost your job, how long would it take to replace your income? It depends a little on your industry. Here\u2019s a rule of thumb I found by Googling, and which I find equal parts hilarious and terrifying:\n\nThe rule of thumb is that it will take one month of job searching for every $10,000 of salary that you were earning; if you were making $30,000 it will take three months, $60,000 six months. It\u2019s hard for most people to imagine a job search taking that long and it may become a challenge to focus on the day to day search. A job search for a salary of over $50,000 will involve meeting about 100 people. You can choose to do that level of work over four or five months, or over eight to 10 months.\n\nReally? Is that a thing people use?\n\nAnyway, apparently most people think they\u2019ll find a job in six months or less. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re calculating for six months.\n\nBut you also have some kind of bad thing happen while you\u2019re searching for a job. Like you need to replace a timing belt. And you\u2019re mad about it, so you try to karate-chop your car, breaking your arm. That\u2019s gonna be maybe $1,000 worth of damage between you and the car, so we\u2019ll add that to whatever your six-month total is.\n\nCALCULATING IT\n\nWhat does your life cost each month? Not everything \u2014 cut out the saving for retirement, the income tax, the fancy cocktails you buy yourself every evening to celebrate surviving another day. Just the essentials, like food, housing and your various insurances.\n\nPro tip: Figuring out your bare-essentials monthly cost of living may make you a little woozy, because it\u2019s probably a lot lower than what you\u2019re actually spending every month. Have a fancy cocktail at the ready when making the calculations, just in case.\n\nNow, multiply your bare-essentials monthly cost of living by six, the number we sort of arbitrarily decided above. And add $2,000 or so for your timing belt and/or broken arm.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got your emergency fund target. Have a cocktail.\n\n(Is this too much in the way of words and not enough in the way of numbers? Here\u2019s an overly sophisticated emergency fund calculator.)\n\nSAVING IT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to put in a plug for automatic savings,\u201d says Fidelis. \u201cThe fastest, easiest way to save.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s talking about an automatic transfer from your paycheck \u2014 or the account where your paycheck goes \u2014 to your savings account. Set it to happen a couple of days after your paycheck gets deposited and you\u2019ll never miss the money, because it won\u2019t have touched your filthy, spendy hands.\n\nDo as much as you can monthly, and soon you\u2019ll be at your target.\n\nWHERE TO SAVE IT\n\nYou need your emergency fund to be liquid \u2014 that is, accessible. This means not investing it in stocks or even less liquid things. So you\u2019ll want to seek out what passes for a high-yield savings account these days. At the time of this writing, if you can find 1 percent APY, you\u2019re lucky.\n\nThere are other options, but most don\u2019t beat that 1 percent number by much, and sacrifice liquidity for it \u2014 not ideal if you\u2019re dealing with a car that won\u2019t be road-ready until you fork over a thousand clams. The options that do beat 1 percent are a little gimmicky and may be most suited to the kind of person who gets a real kick out of playing credit card rewards points games \u2014 in other words, more work than it\u2019s worth to the majority of people.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "emergency fund,saving,sidebar", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Interest", "description": "When people start to take control of their finances, two of the very first steps that people always recommend are paying down debt and setting up an emergency fund.", "title": "Setting up an emergency fund - Personal Interest", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/personalinterest/2014/01/22/setting-up-an-emergency-fund/2609/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/personalinterest/files/2014/01/X00241_9-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "When people start to take control of their finances, one of the very first steps that people always recommend is setting up an emergency fund.", "title": "Setting up an emergency fund - Personal Interest", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/personalinterest/2014/01/22/setting-up-an-emergency-fund/2609/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/personalinterest/files/2014/01/X00241_9.jpg", "creator": "@daveburdick", "site": "@denverbusiness", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "When people start to take control of their finances, one of the very first steps that people always recommend is setting up an emergency fund."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00ec\"", "article_summary": "When people start to take control of their finances, two of the very first steps that people always recommend are paying down debt and setting up an emergency fund.\nWHERE TO SAVE ITYou need your emergency fund to be liquid \u2014 that is, accessible.\nHow to calculate an emergency fund \u2014 and how long it should last \u2014 are somewhat contested subjects.\nNow you\u2019ve got your emergency fund target.\nHere\u2019s an overly sophisticated emergency fund calculator.)"}
