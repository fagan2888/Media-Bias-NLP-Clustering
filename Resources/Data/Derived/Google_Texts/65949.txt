If there was one takeaway from those who attended Friday's event with first lady Michelle Obama and NBA great Shaquille O'Neal, it was the great height difference between the two.

Teaming up to tout physical education at Orr Elementary School in S.E. Washington, D.C., Obama, literally, looked up to Shaq. "I want to start by, of course, thanking Shaq for that very kind introduction, but for also being one of the few people on Earth who can make me feel small," Obama said. "I know I can always wear my heels when Shaq is around, so I appreciate that."

Obama and O'Neal appeared alongside Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Dominique Dawes, Olympic track and field gold medalist Allyson Felix and D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson. The event was an opportunity for students to get physical and also announce that all of D.C.'s public schools would participate in a Let's Move pledge to have students spend 60 minutes per school day doing physical activity. A new grants program was announced too, through Reebok and the Reebok Foundation.

Of course, FLOTUS used the opportunity to also talk healthy eating. "Shaq didn't get to be a big, tall all-star by eating just junk food," she reminded. "He probably, like me, has junk food every now and then, but we had to eat our vegetables and we also had to focus in school."

Later this month, Obama is teaming up with another group of celebrities, too, when her Let's Move hip-hop album drops Sept. 30.
