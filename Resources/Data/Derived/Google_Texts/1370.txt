President Obama will have the opportunity to mingle with his Hollywood friends later this month at the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.

Several celebrities are reported to be attending — including television stars from “Modern Family,” “Black-ish” and “House of Cards” — according to The Wrap.

Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet of “Modern Family” will walk the Washington red carpet, as will Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross of “Black-ish,” Michael Kelly of “House of Cards,” Darby Stanchfield and Bellamy Young of “Scandal” and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of “Game of Thrones.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who directed “Selma,” will also attend the event.

And, it’s not only actors and directors who have been invited to rub elbows with Michelle and Barack. Swimsuit model Chrissy Teigen — famous for her racy 2014 Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition cover — will also be present.

Perhaps Teigen will take her opportunity in Washington to discuss or defend her opinions on gun control.

Other Hollywood figures who will appear at the event include actor and playwright Eric Bogosian and host of “The Nightly Show” on Comedy Central Larry Wilmore. It will be hosted by comedian Cecily Strong of “Saturday Night Live.”

President Obama is also set to deliver a funny speech at the April 25 event, which will take place at the Washington Hilton hotel and be telecast live on C-SPAN and MSNBC.
