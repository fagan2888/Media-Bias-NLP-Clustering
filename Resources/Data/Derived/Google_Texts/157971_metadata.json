Just drilled it. And Loya\u2019s daughter had scurried all the way to second base on her bad knee, waiting while her shrieking teammates arrived in a stampede of glee.\n\nA fellow mother came up to Debbie: \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have happened to a better girl!\u201d\n\nGabby Loya, leukemia survivor, was a hero again.\n\nThink back to the summer before your freshman year. The nerves. The energy. The anticipation. Well, it was in July 2013 when Gabby was diagnosed with APML leukemia, a very rare form of leukemia.\n\nAs the doctor told her, Gabby asked, heartbreakingly, \u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t play this weekend?\u201d\n\nSee, Gabby loves softball. Or as her mother said Friday from the stands at Aurora Sports Park, \u201cShe really lives for the game.\u201d\n\nGabby began chemotherapy three days later, watching her summer softball team on a live feed on an iPad they purchased for their catcher. Intravenous chemotherapy. Her friends were worried about lunch hours; she worried about living.\n\nShe\u2019d go to fall softball practice after chemo sessions at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. She lettered on Wheat Ridge\u2019s varsity softball team in the fall of 2013. The Farmers won it all, but Gabby couldn\u2019t play much. By December, she had lost all her hair. She\u2019d say to Debbie, \u201cMom, no girl wants to go to school bald.\u201d\n\nBut Gabby persevered, smiling all the time, even if it was forced or fake or a sneaky way to trick the devil.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got that big humongous smile, even when she\u2019s at her worst \u2014 it changes your bad mood into a good mood,\u201d Debbie said, while choking up. \u201cShe says, \u2018You know, Mom, sometimes when I\u2019m not feeling so good, smiling just makes me feel better.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThis smile. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLast night we were at Boondocks, as she drove around in the go-karts, she smiles and all you see is teeth,\u201d her coach, Martin Strickett, explained earlier this week. \u201cAnd she shares that with everyone else around her. You can\u2019t be mad when you\u2019re around Gabby. At practice, she was smiling and giggling, and I said, \u2018Can you give everybody else whatever you\u2019re on?\u2019 And she said, \u2018What, Coach, chemo?\u2019 That\u2019s just the kind of kid she is.\u201d\n\nGabby\u2019s leukemia is in remission. But she\u2019s not in the clear just yet. Fear looms like a Texas-Leaguer in shallow center field. She does chemo every day, taking an assortment of pills with side effects of fatigue, nausea, dizziness and sores. Every day. Think about that. Every three months she undergoes a 14-day chemotherapy treatment that\u2019s \u201caggressive,\u201d her mother described. Sometimes, she\u2019ll have to take as many as 28 pills at once. She does bone-marrow aspirate and spinal taps as regularly as history exams.\n\nWe hear these stories a lot \u2014 athletes beating adversity \u2014 and they kind of run together, it\u2019s sad to admit. But Gabby\u2019s story is infectious because of her pure love for sports and her pure love for life.\n\nThis smile. I saw it after the big hit. It sure is wide.\n\n\u201cI just feel like \u2014 life is just great right now,\u201d Gabby said after the walk-off hit. \u201cIt felt amazing \u2014 I love my team. \u2026 (After the hit), your adrenaline rushes, and everything in the world just feels great. Everything is happy \u2014 I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nShe headed home. She had to rest up for the biggest game of her life. And take chemotherapy pills.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Dear Gabby Loya keeps on smiling", "title": "Hochman: Dear Gabby Loya keeps on smiling", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/17/hochman-dear-gabby-loya-keeps-on-smiling/", "image": {"width": 386, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017__20141018_B1_SP18HOCHMANp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017__20141018_B1_SP18HOCHMANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-17T21:30:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:37:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Prep softball"}, "article_summary": "As the doctor told her, Gabby asked, heartbreakingly, \u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t play this weekend?\u201dSee, Gabby loves softball.\nShe lettered on Wheat Ridge\u2019s varsity softball team in the fall of 2013.\nWell, it was in July 2013 when Gabby was diagnosed with APML leukemia, a very rare form of leukemia.\nA fellow mother came up to Debbie: \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have happened to a better girl!\u201dGabby Loya, leukemia survivor, was a hero again.\n\u201cShe says, \u2018You know, Mom, sometimes when I\u2019m not feeling so good, smiling just makes me feel better.\u2019 \u201cThis smile."}
