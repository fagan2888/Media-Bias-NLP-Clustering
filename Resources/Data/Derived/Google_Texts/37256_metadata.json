The plot was dull and derivative, the characters unimaginative and unsexy, and the prose read like it was pounded out on a keyboard by a squad of hallucinogen-addled capuchins who\u2019d read too much Barbara Cartland in middle school.\n\nWhen I saw the movie last week, however, I was surprised to find I adored it. While this could have something to do with the fact that I\u2019d downed three shots of whiskey in a diet Cherry Coke before entering the theater, the two and a half hours of BDSM -lite were some of the best I\u2019ve ever spent in a movie house. Fifty Shades was campy, self-aware, and even sexy (though I suppose any movie featuring two attractive naked people going to town on each other could be considered sexy). In short, I found myself totally in agreement with Slate\u2019s Amanda Hess , who wrote that she left the movie feeling \u201cflushed, tingly, a little out of control,\u201d like she was \u201con a first date with someone I\u2019d secretly crushed on for a long time.\u201d\n\nGiven the enormous popularity of the Fifty Shades franchise (the film itself grossed a record-breaking $81.7 million opening weekend), this sentiment was clearly not limited to Hess and myself. Yet Fifty Shades has garnered an extensive backlash among sex-positive feminists on the Internet, who have attacked the movie at length for its murky consent issues and its inaccurate depiction of BDSM. As Emma Green of The Atlantic writes:\n\nThe most troubling thing about the sex in Fifty Shades isn\u2019t the BDSM itself: It\u2019s the characters\u2019 terrible communication. Throughout the books, Ana isn\u2019t expected to say what she wants from sex\u2014Christian just knows. With but a few swift strokes, he can get her to orgasm\u2014loudly, frequently, in any position and any location\u2014by intuiting what her body wants. Sex itself is portrayed as a comprehensive proxy for the emotions involved in their relationship. Although they do talk about their relationship, Ana\u2019s too afraid of losing Christian to express the depth of her fears about the kind of sex he\u2019s asking her to have.\n\nI agree with Green that the book\u2019s depiction of the relationship between the sexually inexperienced Anastasia Steele and wealthy older billionaire Christian Grey is at best problematic and at worst horrifying when it comes to the issue of consent. But I feel the movie issues something of a corrective to this dynamic, and I have a hard time buying feminist protesters\u2019 arguments that Fifty Shades promotes violence against women, or even that it puts emotionally damaged men with boundary issues like Grey on a pedestal. In fact, I\u2019d argue that as a cultural phenomenon that has brought non-normative sex and female desire to the mainstream, Fifty Shades of Grey has done far more good than harm.\n\nOne of the most common arguments leveled against Fifty Shades of Grey is that Anastasia Steele, the shy, adorkable, Victorian-lit-reading, PG-13-expletive-spouting narratrix, doesn\u2019t have enough agency or sexual experience to fully consent to the contract Christian makes her sign, and is thus only acquiescing to his desires to please him. (My friends and I have a word for women like Anastasia: A \u201cSmee,\u201d so dubbed after Captain Hook\u2019s toadying sidekick, a second fiddle who is defined by their willingness to acquiesce to others\u2019 desires.)\n\nBut while Book Anastasia is Smee-like and eminently slappable, the same doesn\u2019t quite apply to Movie Anastasia, who, as Slate\u2019s Hanna Rosin has pointed out, is far more \u201cself-possessed\u201d and wry than E.L. James\u2019 lame-o characterization would suggest.\n\nIn Dakota Johnson\u2019s deft hands, Ana transforms from a third-rate Austenian waif to fully realized human being. She\u2019s funny, drunk-dialing, and performing impromptu dance breaks to Frank Sinatra songs with gusto; she\u2019s also assertive, striding out to her car the second Christian offers the rapey come-on \u201cYou want to leave but your body tells me something different\u201d and putting her foot down on both vaginal and anal fisting during a contract-negotiation scene.\n\nIn the film version of Fifty Shades, it\u2019s not hard to see why Jamie Dornan\u2019s Christian Grey is with Johnson\u2019s Anastasia Steele, despite their differences in age and class. As Rosin puts it, \u201cshe makes jokes about serial killers and drunk dials while waiting in line for the bathroom; he uses corporate jargon such as \u2018incentivize\u2019 and \u2018harnessing my luck.\u2019 She seems with it, and he seems clueless.\u201d If anything, the one thought that resounded in my head during the movie wasn\u2019t what this moody, sexy billionaire was doing with this virginal college girl, a constant refrain throughout the book, but what she was doing with him.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cDaniel Tosh destroys the Patriots\u2019 legacy in hilarious rant\u201d\n\nIn a lot of ways, Movie Christian reminded me of a better-looking, wealthier version of the type of guy you date in college, who woos you with his good looks and sensitive topless piano-playing abilities, but who you dump a few months later because he\u2019s bad in bed and he screens your texts and he cries whenever his band\u2019s gigs get canceled. Every girl has dated that guy, and every girl knows that he sucks. Who cares if he has a fucking glider?\n\nThe Smee-ness of Movie Christian leads me to the argument that many Fifty Shades detractors have made: that, because Christian is rich and good-looking, it glosses over and romanticizes much of his abusive behavior, including tracking Ana\u2019s cell phone and showing up at her family\u2019s house uninvited. \u201cWould you be happy with a partner who micro-managed your life, dictated what you ate, what contraceptive you used, required you to exercise a certain amount of days a week, and cut you off from your friends and family?\u201d the Independent wrote in an op-ed about Christian as domestic abuser. \u201cAdd some good looks, a six pack and billionaire status and voila: you have Christian Grey.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget all the snarky trend pieces and listicles.
