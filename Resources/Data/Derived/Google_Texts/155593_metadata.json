The lawsuit contends that the law, in effect, originated in the Senate, because senators took an unrelated tax bill passed by the House, gutted it, and substituted the health care language before sending it back to the House for final passage.\n\nThat argument was rejected earlier this year by U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas of Texas. Atlas ruled that the bill met constitutional requirements because raising revenue was not its overarching purpose and the law was therefore not subject to the origination clause. She also noted that the original House bill was indeed a revenue measure and said the Senate had broad authority to amend the bill once it left the House.\n\nGregory Katsas, arguing for congressional opponents of the Affordable Care Act, said Atlas was interpreting that amendment power too broadly. Her ruling, he told the appeals judges, \u201cwould make vast swaths of taxes totally exempt from the origination clause.\u201d\n\nJudge E. Grady Jolly, one of the three judges hearing the appeal, questioned whether the origination clause has any real meaning if the Senate is allowed to completely gut the House measure and substitute a new bill.\n\nBut attorneys supporting the law cited Supreme Court and 5th Circuit precedents that they said support Atlas\u2019 ruling.\n\nAttorney Alisa Klein, arguing for the Justice Department, said no House members argued that the origination clause was being violated when the law was making its way through Congress in 2009 and 2010.\n\nAnd Attorney Elizabeth Wydra, arguing for congressional supporters of the measure, said House members still zealously guard their prerogative to start tax legislation. \u201cThe origination clause continues to be something that is alive and well in the House,\u201d Wydra said.\n\nThe panel gave no indication when it would rule. Sitting with Jolly, who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan, were Judges Carolyn Dineen King, nominated by President Jimmy Carter, and Gregg Costa, an Obama nominee approved by the Senate earlier this year.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in 2012, legal challenges continue.\n\nThe high court last month agreed to review a federal appeals court ruling that upheld IRS regulations allowing health-insurance tax credits under the Affordable Care Act for consumers in all 50 states. Opponents argue that most of the subsidies are illegal.\n\nThe origination clause argument has already been rejected by the District of Columbia appeals court in a 3-0 ruling in July. A different ruling by the 5th Circuit could keep the issue alive and make it ripe for Supreme Court arguments.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
