Eighty-four percent of PCPs reported they were not ready to manage severe mental health cases.\n\nThe U.S. mostly compared unfavorably to the other countries included in the survey. Only 12% of PCPs in Germany and the Netherlands felt unprepared to care for patients with severe mental health issues, or those requiring long term home care.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe U.S. also fell short in communication between PCPs and hospitals, as well as in caring for patients after hours without resorting to the emergency room.\n\nUnder a third of U.S. doctors were notified when a patient was either admitted into an ER or discharged from a hospital. Compare this to the Netherlands, the leading country in this area, where 69% of doctors reported being notified when patients were discharged. While roughly 90% of PCPs in the Netherlands, the UK, and New Zealand have planned for after hours care of patients, only two-fifths of U.S. doctors have done so.\n\nThe U.S. did perform strongly in health IT, with 60% of primary care practices allowing patients to access their records electronically.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. has attempted to incentivize doctors to aim for better patient outcomes rather than a fee-for-service model. This survey demonstrates the U.S. still lags behind developed peers, perhaps suggesting the American healthcare system is still transitioning to meet the new law's requirements.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund : Primary Care Physicians in Ten Countries Report Challenges Caring for Patients with Complex Health Needs\n\nForbes: 1 in 4 Doctors Aren't Coordinating Care Despite Obamacare Demands", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ned Pagliarulo", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/b0/f9/b0f9fff873744dcede9c9e327b0eaa69.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "news_keywords": "Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "category": "News Post", "title": "Survey: Nearly a quarter of US doctors unequipped to coordinate complex care", "pub_date": "dec 08, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-08T13:39:51", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 08, 2015, 01:39 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-11-25T13:39:51", "teaser": "<p>The Commonwealth Fund survey also found the U.S.&nbsp;fell short in communication between PCPs and hospitals as under a third of physicians&nbsp;were notified when a patient was either admitted into an ER&nbsp;or discharged from a hospital.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-12-08", "sailthru.description": "The Commonwealth Fund survey also found the U.S.\u00a0fell short in communication between PCPs and hospitals as under a third of physicians\u00a0were notified when a patient was either admitted into an ER\u00a0or discharged from a hospital.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The Commonwealth Fund survey also found the U.S.\u00a0fell short in communication between PCPs and hospitals as under a third of physicians\u00a0were notified when a patient was either admitted into an ER\u00a0or discharged from a hospital.", "title": "Survey: Nearly a quarter of US doctors unequipped to coordinate complex care", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/survey-nearly-a-quarter-of-us-doctors-unequipped-to-coordinate-complex-car/410457/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_56021537_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/55/1b/551b56ea829e68f69350cb32cb4e1653.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Dive Brief:In a survey of primary care physicians (PCPs) across 10 developed countries, The Commonwealth Fund found 24% of U.S. PCPs were not prepared to coordinate care for patients with complex chronic conditions.\nRecommended ReadingThe Commonwealth Fund : Primary Care Physicians in Ten Countries Report Challenges Caring for Patients with Complex Health NeedsForbes: 1 in 4 Doctors Aren't Coordinating Care Despite Obamacare Demands\nThe U.S. did perform strongly in health IT, with 60% of primary care practices allowing patients to access their records electronically.\nOnly 12% of PCPs in Germany and the Netherlands felt unprepared to care for patients with severe mental health issues, or those requiring long term home care.\nEighty-four percent of PCPs reported they were not ready to manage severe mental health cases."}
