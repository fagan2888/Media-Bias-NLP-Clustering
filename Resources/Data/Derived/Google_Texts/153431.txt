NEW YORK (MainStreet) – It's not too late to find some extra savings in your 2014 tax return.

In fact, while you're checking under the cushions for loose change in 2014, it's actually a good time to make sure cash doesn't fall out of your pockets in the first place. Scott Stavin, a certified public accountant and tax principal at Friedman LLC in New York, notes that finding savings typically requires a little bit of foresight.

“We're preparing people's 2014 tax returns, but we're also setting the foundation for 2015, and that's very important,” he says. “There are things you can do with taxpayers at this stage of the year to get them set up for the rest of the year.”

That can involve something as simple as looking at a client's pay stub year-to-date and seeing if their employer is withholding enough tax money. It could also become as involved as setting yourself up with tax-free municipals bonds, according to enrolled agent and CFP Anthony Criscuolo of Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

With the tax deadline looming, we pressed Stavin and Criscuolo for some last-minute tips for keeping the IRS at bay. The following suggestions should not only keep you covered for this year, but help you prepare for 2015 as well.

Don’t overlook deductions, especially the rare ones

Stavin and Criscuolo agreed that most tax savings left on the table are there because a client forgot to itemize it or didn't know he or she could.

“Very often, it's on the deduction side,” Stavin says. “We're always reminding clients to remember cash charity as well as clothing and household items that they may have contributed. Clients should retain and forward to their accountants the documentations.”
