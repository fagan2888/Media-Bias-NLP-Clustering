Jackson\u2019s operations are supported by a sales tax in Miami-Dade County.\n\nGrady\u2019s profit increased to nearly $30 million through November last year, up from $17 million for the same period in 2013.\n\nSeveral other safety net facilities in states that did not expand Medicaid had profits in 2014, according to financial reports, including:\n\n\u2014 Broward Health, which runs four hospitals, saw $69 million in profit in the 2014 fiscal year that ended June 30, compared to $59 million a year earlier, on about $1 billion in revenue. That included support from local taxpayers.\n\n\u2014 Orlando Health, a six-hospital system in central Florida, saw its profit grow to $161 million in the fiscal year that ended in September, up from $32 million the year before, on about $2 billion in revenue. Its vice president of finance, Paul Goldstein, cited the improving economy, an increase in the number of privately insured patients and the financial performance of recently purchased doctors\u2019 groups.\n\n\u2014 Tampa General posted a $49 million profit last year, up from $31 million the year before, on $1 billion in operating revenue. Its operating margin was 4.5 percent.\n\n\u2014 Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Erlanger Health posted a $20 million profit for the six months that ended Dec. 31, on revenue of $336 million, after factoring in local tax support, compared to losing $1.5 million in the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u2014 Greenville Health System in South Carolina made a $63 million profit in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, down slightly from $80 million the prior year.

Under such agreements, the federal government supplies billions of dollars in special Medicaid dollars to certain states including Florida, Texas and California to support hospitals with large number of Medicaid and uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cWithout those dollars we have an unsound system,\u201d said Tony Carvalho, president of the The Safety Net Hospital Alliance Of Florida.\n\nWhile Miami-based Jackson Health is financially healthy now, Chief Financial Officer Mark Knight worries about the end of that federal waiver funding in June, which contributed $160 million to his budget this year. \u201cWe could not continue to serve and maintain current capacity \u2026 without that money,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2014, Florida safety-net hospitals also benefited from a strong tourist season and lower unemployment rates, Carvalho said.\n\nThe improved economy also helped many safety-net hospitals that are supported through local property and sales taxes, such as Broward Health and Jackson Memorial, said David Gruber, managing director of research at Alvarez & Marsal consulting firm.\n\nA recent report by the firm predicted the nonprofits would face major financial threats as a result of health law funding cuts, particularly in states that do not expand Medicaid. \u201cSafety-net hospitals are now operating in the untenable crosshairs of economic distress and health care reform,\u201d the report said.\n\nGreenville Health has kept in the black partly by finding ways to trim charity care costs, said Chief Financial Officer Terri Newsom.

Even so, only 3 percent of its patients are privately insured. \u201cWe are significantly challenged as we go forward,\u201d Norby said. Parkland Health and Hospital System, which is supported by Dallas County property taxes, managed to finish in the black, but saw its profits decline from $43.4 million in 2013 to $1.4 million in 2014. Meanwhile, safety-net hospitals in Florida fear what will happen after June 30 when $2 billion in federal funding expires under an agreement between the state and the federal government.\u00a0Under such agreements, the federal government supplies billions of dollars in special Medicaid dollars to certain states including Florida, Texas and California to support hospitals with large number of Medicaid and uninsured patients. \u201cWithout those dollars we have an unsound system,\u201d said Tony Carvalho, president of the The Safety Net Hospital Alliance Of Florida. While Miami-based Jackson Health is financially healthy now, Chief Financial Officer Mark Knight worries about the end of that federal waiver funding in June, which contributed $160 million to his budget this year. \u201cWe could not continue to serve and maintain current capacity \u2026 without that money,\u201d he said. In 2014, Florida safety-net hospitals also benefited from a strong tourist season and lower unemployment rates, Carvalho said. The improved economy also helped many safety-net hospitals that are supported through local property and sales taxes,\u00a0such as Broward Health and Jackson Memorial, said David Gruber, managing director of research at Alvarez & Marsal consulting firm. A recent report by the firm predicted the nonprofits would face major financial threats as a result of health law funding cuts, particularly in states that do not expand Medicaid. \u201cSafety-net hospitals are now operating in the untenable crosshairs of economic distress and health care reform,\u201d the report said. Greenville Health has kept in the black partly by finding ways to trim charity care costs, said Chief Financial Officer Terri Newsom. The South Carolina hospital has hired case managers to oversee care to some of the uninsured patients who show\u00a0up regularly at its emergency department.\u00a0 It also launched a program to divert ambulances with patients who do not have medical emergencies to urgent care centers. Though the hospital worked to get people signed up for Obamacare plans, it only saw a 1 percent drop in uninsured numbers last year. Nonetheless, administrators say the health system is in good shape. \u201cWe are in stable health and making the right investments,\u201d Newsom said.
