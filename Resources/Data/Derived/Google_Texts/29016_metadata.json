In an article published today in Science, MIT economist David Autor contends that much of our present inequality stems from disparities in education. This has evolved in two directions: From 1980 to 2012, inflation-adjusted, full-time earnings of college-educated males increased anywhere from 20 percent to 56 percent, depending on whether they also acquired graduate degrees. Conversely, real earnings of high school graduates fell 11 percent, and earnings of high school dropouts fell 22 percent. MIT News talked with Autor about inequality.\n\nQ. You are focused on inequality among the so-called \u201c99 percent,\u201d not between the 1 percent and the 99 percent. Why?\n\nA. There\u2019s a real national debate about the significance and causes of inequality. This public debate is dominated by the discussion of the top 1 percent. And the top 1 percent is important, but focusing on the top 1 percent conveys the message that the game is all rigged, that if you\u2019re not in the elite stratum, there\u2019s nothing to shoot for. And that\u2019s just not the case. The growth of skill differentials among the other 99 percent is arguably even more consequential than the rise of the 1 percent for the welfare of most citizens.\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete way to see it: The earnings gap between the median college-educated two-income family and the median high school-educated two-income family rose by $28,000 between 1979 and 2012. This [shift] \u2014 which excludes the top 1 percent, since we\u2019re focusing on medians \u2014 is four times as large as the redistribution that has taken place from the bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent of households in the same period.\n\nQ. What accounts for inequality among the 99 percent, then?\n\nA. The single most important factor is the rising return on postsecondary education. That explains a lot of the growth and variance, and that is pretty well explained by supply and demand factors. There was a sharp deceleration in production of newly minted college graduates from about 1980 forward, and that led immediately to a growth in the skill premium. After 2005 there\u2019s been an acceleration in production of college graduates, and you see the skill differential start to plateau.\n\nIf you had to give a person a single piece of economic advice, it would not be: Act like Gatsby and try to get into the top 1 percent. It would be: Go get a college education at a decent school.\n\nNow, there are many other factors that are affecting the wage distribution \u2026 de-unionization, the [inflation-adjusted] decline in minimum wage, [the growth of] international trade, which has led to a big decline in manufacturing, and technological change, which drives demand for more-skilled workers. These things all interact.\n\nQ. In the Science article, you write that, \u201cConfronting the cost of college should not obscure the fact that the real lifetime earnings premium to college education has likely never been higher.\u201d What has that premium looked like in the past?\n\nA. We have data going back to 1915 on the skill premium. \u2026 It was high on the eve of the second World War, declined very rapidly during the war, [then] was stable through the 1960s, and came down through the 1970s, partly due to an influx of college graduates [receiving draft deferments] because of the Vietnam War. Then there was this grand acceleration, and it rose more or less continuously, for three decades, and plateaued over the last several years.\n\nPeople say, \u201cAh, the college premium has stopped rising,\u201d and that\u2019s true, but it has plateaued at an incredibly high level. The relative wage differential between college and high school graduates is higher than it\u2019s ever been. Now, college has gotten more expensive, but relative to the lifetime earnings differential, it\u2019s still quite an attractive investment proposition.\n\nRecent estimates find that for men the lifetime present value [after subtracting tuition costs] has risen from $213,000 to $590,000 between 1965 and 2010, and for women it\u2019s risen from $129,000 to $370,000. So it\u2019s risen by a quarter-million dollars. \u2026 The type of counterproductive myth I\u2019m trying to puncture in this article is that it\u2019s all about the 1 percent, if you go to college you\u2019re wasting your money, if you\u2019re not the \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d the game is over. That\u2019s just destructively incorrect.\n\nQ. You contend that inequality is not altogether bad. So how do we assess if it has gone too far?\n\nA. There\u2019s a value to inequality in a market economy. Inequality provides incentives. But you can have too much inequality, or too little. The concern about inequality is where economic dynamism gives way to dynasticism, and inequality becomes self-reinforcing: If you don\u2019t \u201cchoose the right parents,\u201d you\u2019re stuck in the bottom forever. Now, we have metrics of that, and the evidence so far is that U.S. economic mobility has not been high in a very long time, since the early 20th century, but has not declined, as far as we can tell. Another metric is absolute well-being, in terms of earnings and labor force participation, and I think there\u2019s real concern there.\n\nGraphic: Christine Daniloff Full Screen\n\nGraphic: Christine Daniloff Full Screen\n\nQ. What policies can combat inequality?\n\nA. In the long run, the best policies we have involve investing in our citizenry. \u2026 Higher education, and public education, is America\u2019s best idea. Our decision to send our entire public through high school over the first 30 years of the 20th century was probably the single most important factor in U.S. economic predominance for that century. Those investments [include] preschool, good primary and secondary schools, [and] adequate nutrition and health care.\n\nIn the short run, the Earned Income Tax Credit has been a successful policy, but it\u2019s primarily targeted at women with kids. Our biggest problem has been declining labor force participation among men without current dependents, so that could be expanded. We can actually afford to raise the minimum wage. We can stop incarcerating so many people \u2014 that would save us a bunch of money and improve people\u2019s lives over the long run. The Affordable Care Act may have benefits in terms of people\u2019s skills development, if giving people adequate access to health care when they\u2019re young affects their cognitive capacity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In new Science piece, MIT economist aims to move the inequality discussion beyond the \u201c1 percent.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "MIT News", "description": "In new Science piece, MIT economist aims to move the inequality discussion beyond the \u201c1 percent.\u201d", "author": "Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office", "url": "http://news.mit.edu/2014/qa-david-autor-inequality-among-99-percent-0522", "image": "http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/og/public/images/2014/A1only_NewsImage_DavidAutor.jpg", "title": "Q&A: David Autor on inequality among the \u201c99 percent\u201d", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@mit", "id": 15460048}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"page_id": 126533127390327}, "keywords": "Economics, Inequality, Policy, Higher education, Education, teaching, academics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Economics, Inequality, Policy, Higher education, Education, teaching, academics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb66c\"", "article_summary": "You are focused on inequality among the so-called \u201c99 percent,\u201d not between the 1 percent and the 99 percent.\nIn an article published today in Science, MIT economist David Autor contends that much of our present inequality stems from disparities in education.\nConversely, real earnings of high school graduates fell 11 percent, and earnings of high school dropouts fell 22 percent.\nAfter 2005 there\u2019s been an acceleration in production of college graduates, and you see the skill differential start to plateau.\nIt would be: Go get a college education at a decent school."}
