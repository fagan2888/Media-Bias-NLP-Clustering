I\u2019ve spent their layover arbitrarily ranking them.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long week but finally last night the first blood has been spilt on the runway as our contestants sashayed their way down the runways for Miss U.S.A. 2014 preliminaries.\n\nFavored by Vegas 9-1, Miss Alabama USA Jesica Ahlberg showed why she\u2019s smart money.\n\nMiss Arkansas USA Helen Wisner is the most ripped first grade teacher in the country.\n\nMiss California USA and friend of Israel Cassandra Kunze was confident as she posed for the judges.\n\nVegas\u2019 second favorite by 14-1 Miss Massachusetts USA Caroline Lunny was sultry as she shuffled on stage.\n\nDespite being a black belt in taekwondo, Nevada\u2019s Nia Sanchez missed her mark in the swimsuit march.\n\nMiss Ohio USA Madison Gesiotto\u2019s awkward walk on stage showed she has more in common with Mitt Romney than just agreeing on the impact of Obamacare.\n\nMiss Pennsylvania USA Valerie Gatto also fumbled her last step in the evening gown parade.\n\nThat was unlike Miss Texas USA Lauren Guzman\u2019s calm and collected demeanor. The Texas State Guard teaches you how to march.\n\nMiss Wisconsin USA Bishara Dorre looked like she stepped right off the Bradley Center floor and onto the runway.\n\nThe standouts from the prelims:\n\nMiss Florida USA Brittany Oldehof barely missed my top 21. She made me look foolish when she rolled through the swimsuit portion with her pageant walk.\n\nBrittany was dynamic, both in a two-piece and in that nifty tassel dress.\n\n\n\nMiss Illinois USA Lexi Atkins also performed exceptional, using her improv skills to woo the judges.\n\nAfter the evening, the contestant in pole position for Saturday\u2019s contest is Miss Utah USA Angelia Layton.\n\nShe earned first position with her attitude and allure.\n\nExpect her to go as far as her heels can take her.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Our Miss U.S.A. 2014 state representatives landed early last week and have spent their time attending the litany of public events and fulfilling media requests that come with being a contestant.
