Q: Can yoga make you stronger?

A: In general, the few available experiments involving yoga suggest that it leads to measurable but limited and patchy gains in strength.

Consider a 2012 study of premenopausal women who were randomly assigned to yoga or to a control group: The yoga group completed twice-weekly, 60-minute sessions of Ashtanga yoga , while the control group continued their normal activities.

After eight months, the yoga practitioners had developed more powerful legs, but had not increased strength in other muscles or improved their cardiovascular fitness.

In a 2013 study, 12 weeks of Bikram yoga (done rapidly in a heated, saunalike space) enabled a group of young adults to dead-lift more weight on a barbell than they could at the start but did not improve their handgrip strength or any other measures of fitness.

Overall, yoga appears to be too gentle physically to be anyone’s lone exercise.

In one of the most interesting studies, experienced yoga enthusiasts performed their favorite type of yoga for an hour in a metabolic chamber that tracked their caloric usage and heart rate.

The volunteers then sat quietly in the chamber and also walked on a treadmill at a leisurely 2 mph and a brisker 3 mph pace.

The measurements showed that yoga was equivalent to strolling at 2 mph, an intensity that, the authors write, would “not meet recommendations for levels of physical activity for improving or maintaining health or cardiovascular fitness.” So if you downward dog, jog occasionally, and visit the gym to build full-body strength and wellness.
