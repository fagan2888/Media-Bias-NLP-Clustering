Matt Cartwright.\n\nBoth consider Mr. Cartwright a liberal Democrat, but before Matt Connolly or Glenn A. Geissinger get the chance to unseat him, one must win the Republican nomination for the 17th Congressional District seat in the April 26 primary election.\n\nPolitically, both face an uphill battle to election.\n\nThe district has about seven registered Democrats for every four Republicans. Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston and Pottsville are the major cities in the district, which includes parts of Lackawanna, Luzerne, Carbon, Monroe and Northampton counties and all of Schuylkill County.\n\nTwo major Washington-based congressional election forecasting organizations \u2014 the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball \u2014 rate the race as \u201csafe Democrat.\u201d Another, the Cook Political Report, considers the seat \u201csolid Democratic.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Mr. Cartwright remains a heavy favorite to win re-election.\n\nMr. Geissinger, at least, appears to be preparing a real run.\n\nThrough the end of last year, he raised $108,589, which includes $80,000 he loaned his campaign. He has $101,990 left. By comparison, Mr. Connolly, who ran unsuccessfully for the nomination two years ago, raised only $1,400 and has $1,459 left, which includes money left over from his previous campaign.\n\nBoth have a long way to go to match Mr. Cartwright. He raised $440,710 in the current two-year House election cycle and has $650,813 in cash left. First-quarter 2016 campaign finance reports are due Friday.\n\n\u201cI do not feel personally that Mr. Cartwright has properly represented the people of the district,\u201d Mr. Geissinger said. \u201cHis voting record is extremely liberal and this is not an extremely liberal district.\u201d\n\nMr. Geissinger, 50, of Plainfield Twp., chastises Mr. Cartwright for backing President Barack Obama\u2019s national health care reform law, an out-of-control federal Environmental Protection Agency and federal regulations destroying the coal industry.\n\nThe Northampton County councilman and advertising agency owner said he would vote to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that relies on the free market because the reform law is pushing up health insurance rates.\n\nHe would limit EPA\u2019s regulation of bodies of water beyond \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d which means streams that ships can use. The agency\u2019s \u201coverreach\u201d allows for first-time regulation of hundreds of thousands of acres in Pennsylvania, and endangers small farmers, among others, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I have nothing against clean air and clean water. We all want clean air and clean water, but I certainly don\u2019t think that we need to regulate them down to the point where we destroy our economy,\u201d Mr. Geissinger said.\n\nAs an Army veteran, Mr. Geissinger said he never would have voted for the Iran nuclear deal and would have voted to block \u201cunfettered Syrian refugee immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand what the security of the Middle East means from a first-hand perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nHe favors increased military spending to reduce the number of deployments of American soldiers.\n\nHe also favors reducing the corporate net income tax so companies aligning with foreign corporations to avoid American taxes stop doing that.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re parking hundreds of billions, probably trillions of dollars overseas,\u201d he said.\n\nA tile installer as a teenager, Mr. Geissinger said building his advertising business at the outset of the latest recession gives him a better background than Mr. Connolly to be a congressman.\n\n\u201cI understand what it means to lay everything on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand what it means to be a blue-collar guy, I understand what it means to be a white-collar guy. I understand what it means to write on a paycheck on both the front and the back.\u201d\n\nMr. Connolly, 50, of Bethlehem Twp., a home-heating contractor and historic-building preservationist, thinks Mr. Geissinger is too moderate.\n\n\u201cI want the America as it was founded ... to be reinvigorated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to hit the brakes and do a U-turn.\u201d\n\nThat means leaving the federal government with the jobs of national defense and enforcing civil rights and contracts and leaving the rest to the states, Mr. Connolly said.\n\n\u201cThe states should be in charge of a whole lot more than they really are,\u201d he said.\n\nThat means repealing Obamacare and eliminating the federal Department of Education and the EPA, and leaving education and environmental protection to the states, he said.\n\nShifting power to the states will curb the corrupting influence of lobbyists.\n\n\u201cWhen you have top-down management from the federal government, then you are taking away the ability of the states to manage their own destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you took away that top-down federal management, then corruption would be gone because each state would be different. ... Education was never mentioned in the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nHe favors going back to the former system of the federal government backing student higher-education loans instead of having the government loan the money.\n\nTo replace Obamacare, he favors allowing health insurers to compete across state lines and tort reform to protect doctors from frivolous malpractice lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWhy, in Obamacare, wasn\u2019t tort reform part of it if they were really trying to keep the costs down?\u201d he said.\n\nHe called Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals \u201cincredibly inefficient\u201d and favors allowing veterans to seek care in private hospitals to eliminate delays in getting care.\n\n\u201cThey should be able to go to any hospital. Period,\u201d he said.\n\nIn defending himself, Mr. Cartwright said he and his staff studied the Iran nuclear deal for hundreds of hours, many of which he spent poring over classified documents.\n\n\u201cI regard national defense of the United States as my most serious responsibility as a member of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the best path toward preventing a nuclear-armed Iran.\u201d\n\nHe defended his vote against blocking Syrian refugees, saying the required United Nations\u2019 two-year screening process assures terrorists seek entry through other means.\n\n\u201cSo I think being afraid of victims of ISIS from Syria is being overly fearful, and we don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe defended the EPA\u2019s work in ensuring clean air and water and denied federal regulation is killing the coal industry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s destroying the coal industry is the cheap price of natural gas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am not going to apologize to anyone for standing up for the environment. It\u2019s something that I ran on. I also ran on supporting the Affordable Care Act so I\u2019m not embarrassed or apologizing for that either.\u201d\n\nHe said health insurance premiums routinely rose for years, sometimes by 20 to 30 percent a year, and that doesn\u2019t happen any more.\n\n\u201cTo blame health insurance increases on the Affordable Care Act is very, very shortsighted,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said independent online congressional watchdogs such as Lawmakers.org and GovTrack.us consider him a moderate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far from the most liberal of Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nContact the writer: bkrawczeniuk@timesshamrock.com\n\nMatthew Donald Connolly\n\nAge:50\n\nResidence:Bethlehem Twp., Northampton County\n\nEducation:Graduate, Walt Whitman High School, Bethesda, Maryland, 1983; attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, Florida, majoring in aeronautical science for one year; attended University of Maryland, majoring in psychology and architecture for one year.\n\nExperience: Auto mechanic, 1982 to present; race car driver, team owner, mechanic, crew chief, over five different classes, 1989 to 2013; real-estate investor, mid-1990s to present; restorer of historic buildings, 1994 to present; home improvement contractor, 2013-present.\n\nFamily: Single; daughter, Alexis, 15.\n\nGlenn Arlen Geissinger\n\nAge:50\n\nResidence: Plainfield Twp., Northampton County\n\nEducation: Whitehall High School, Whitehall Twp., 1983; bachelor\u2019s degree, accounting, Moravian College, 1988.\n\nExperience:Colonel/platoon leader/paratrooper, Army 82nd Airborne Division, 1988-1992, Fort Bragg, North Carolina.; worked in banking, accounting and selling advertising and insurance for various companies in North Carolina, 1992-1995; salesman, vacation incentives, Northampton County, 1995-1997; media buyer, advertising salesman, eventually president and shareholder of Total Marketing Resources, 1997-2008; owner, Alliance Media Group, an advertising agency, Allentown, 2008-present; at-large member, Northampton County Council, January 2014-present, also chairman of council finance committee; member, board of governors, Lehigh Northampton Airport Authority; Republican state committeeman, 2014-present.\n\nFamily: Wife, the former Julia Winters, a Scranton native; two children, Sarah, 14, Noah, 11.", "article_metadata": {"author": "BY BORYS KRAWCZENIUK", "title": "Two Republicans battle to replace Cartwright", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "BY BORYS KRAWCZENIUK", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2029184"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "Two Republicans battle to replace Cartwright"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI do not feel personally that Mr. Cartwright has properly represented the people of the district,\u201d Mr. Geissinger said.\nBoth have a long way to go to match Mr. Cartwright.\nGlenn Arlen GeissingerAge:50Residence: Plainfield Twp., Northampton CountyEducation: Whitehall High School, Whitehall Twp., 1983; bachelor\u2019s degree, accounting, Moravian College, 1988.\nIn defending himself, Mr. Cartwright said he and his staff studied the Iran nuclear deal for hundreds of hours, many of which he spent poring over classified documents.\nTwo Northampton County residents who consider themselves conservative Republicans hope to pull an upset in November and defeat U.S. Rep.
