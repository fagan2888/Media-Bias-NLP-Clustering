Northstar purchased the 424-unit Cascades at Southern Hills at 1818 E. 71st St. for $12.3 million, and the 256-unit Coventry Park at 8210 E. 63rd Place for $10.1 million, said Kristi Carlson, president of Northstar.

She said officials at the company, which was established in 2004, had ongoing plans to expand into Tulsa.

"We've wanted to get into Tulsa for a long time, and these two properties fit in our portfolio great," Carlson said.

The websites for the two properties indicate the former owner was Greystar, a Charleston, S.C.-based apartment ownership entity.

Carlson said the apartments won't necessarily get any major changes as a result of the sale, but they will continue the previous owners' strategy of remodeling units and installing new appliances as residents turn over.

"Right now we're just getting in there and getting things on our procedures," she said.

Northstar specializes in acquiring older apartment properties, most constructed in the mid-1980s, and keeping them as long-term investments.

"The previous owners had them for a shorter amount of time, but we're long-term owners," Carlson said.

Cascades at Southern Hills was built in 1985, and Coventry Park was built in 1977.

Both properties include a business center, sports court, dog park, bus stop and fitness center. The Cascades at Southern Hills also has a bus stop and access gates.
