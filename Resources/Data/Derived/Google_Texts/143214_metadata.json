The hard thing for her was making it special on a small budget. And it was hard for her to ask for help, but people knew she needed that,\" Cook, now a Longmont resident, said.\n\nFrom the box, Cook and her sisters pulled a Christmas ham along with toys given by a family at the 100-member Foursquare Church they attended.\n\nBut other than the Lord of the Rings board game in that box \u2014 along with a Crissy doll she received later at age 9 \u2014 Cook, now 50, forgot all of the other toys that came her way from family or charity.\n\n\"What I do remember is the feeling of Christmas. It's a feeling you can't put your finger on. It's magical. It's almost surreal,\" she said.\n\nTurns out that toys, however delightful, were but tokens of the real gift \u2014 the goodwill between people moved by holiday spirit, she said.\n\n\"It's the same thing with Toys for Tots (collections). Even though people may not know a family personally, they know there is a need there,\" she said. \"And no matter how big or small, everyone can play a role in making it better for someone else.\"\n\nBeyond your Christmas tree\n\nCook passed along her appreciation of enhancing the holiday experience beyond your Christmas tree to her daughter, Stephanie Odenbach.\n\n\"When kids would come over to play, she would try to give them her toys,\" Cook said. \"She's always been that way.\"\n\nDuring the first week of December, Odenbach picked up a Toys for Tots collection bin sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps to place in the lobby of Production Company Dance Centre, the Longmont business she and her husband co-own at 1401 Ken Pratt Blvd., 1-A.\n\n\"From my own family, from hearing the stories from my mom, if there is any way that we can help out, then we're onboard,\" Odenbach, 29, said. \"... We are in the business of kids, and we want to spread a little holiday cheer.\"\n\nEven during widespread times of hardship, individuals and service groups collected toys \u2014 those fanciful tokens of their support.\n\nThe Longmont Museum and Cultural Center archives include photos of toy drives during the Great Depression. One black-and-white photo from December 1931 depicts Boy Scouts standing with then Fire Chief Vern Campbell by Longmont's fire station then located at Fourth Street and Coffman Avenue. The pile of toys before the them includes scooters, wagons, dollies and cribs.\n\nLove in the building\n\nPerhaps Boy Scouts then delivered toys door to door to families they knew would welcome their gift.\n\nNow, given Longmont's mushrooming population, the largest locally run toy drive \u2014 Kindness for Kids sponsored by LifeBridge Christian Church \u2014 distributes toys via an open house at the Boulder County Fairgrounds on Dec. 20.\n\nLifeBridge and more than 30 local businesses anticipate collecting approximately 3,000 unwrapped toys through Dec. 15. About 400 volunteers will then sort toys in gender and age specific categories and stock three other stations: knitted or crocheted hats, scarves and mittens; Kiwanis Club-made wooden toys; and gently used donated toys, Cindy Kidwell, a former program coordinator and current volunteer, said.\n\n\"The majority of people come in and there's just a sense of hope when they see this massive number of toys,\" she said.\n\nBut Kidwell, who has worked the event for 24 years, added that tables heavy laden with toys absolutely signifies something more precious.\n\n\"I've heard a lot of people talk about how they feel so much love in the building,\" she said. \"May be that is why over the years we've seen needy families get back on their feet and return to volunteer.\"\n\nThat explains why Cook and her family find ways in an busy season to give back, too.\n\n\"Christmas is about love and giving. The toy is just something that projects that,\" she said. \"... Christmas is about pretty lights. It's about decorations. It's about the pine smell, and it's about time shared. If you can't donate a toy, donate some of that.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmontdiningguide/ci_27081752/longmont-woman-finds-that-toys-are-but-tokens", "modificationDate": "2014-12-06T23:08:52-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1205/20141205__07TCCLIF~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "A fuzzy memory of opening a mysterious cardboard box on the kitchen table in late December brings the best of the holidays into focus for Sharon Cook.\n\n\n\nDonations accepted through Dec. 24.\n\n\nVisit http://denver.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27081752:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-06T22:32:01-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmontdiningguide/ci_27081752/longmont-woman-finds-that-toys-are-but-tokens", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1205/20141205__07TCCLIF~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A fuzzy memory of opening a mysterious cardboard box on the kitchen table in late December brings the best of the holidays into focus for Sharon Cook.\n\n\n\nDonations accepted through Dec. 24.\n\n\nVisit http://denver.", "title": "Longmont woman finds that toys are but tokens of the real gift -- good will"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "A fuzzy memory of opening a mysterious cardboard box on the kitchen table in late December brings the best of the holidays into focus for Sharon Cook.\n\n\n\nDonations accepted through Dec. 24.\n\n\nVisit http://denver.", "title": "Longmont woman finds that toys are but tokens of the real gift -- good will", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmontdiningguide/ci_27081752/longmont-woman-finds-that-toys-are-but-tokens", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1205/20141205__07TCCLIF~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-06T22:32:01-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-12-05T22:47:54-0700", "sailthru.title": "Longmont woman finds that toys are but tokens of the real gift -- good will", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Longmont Dining Guide", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1205/20141205__07TCCLIF~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-06T23:10:03-0700"}, "article_summary": "Drop off unwrapped new toys (unwrapped gently used toys also accepted) at: LifeBridge Christian Church 10345 Ute Hwy.\nDrop off new unwrapped toys at these local King Soopers stores: Firestone 6110 Firestone Blvd.\n( Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call )A donation box for the Toys for Tots program is seen Wednesday at Production Company Dance Centre in Longmont.\nLifeBridge and more than 30 local businesses anticipate collecting approximately 3,000 unwrapped toys through Dec. 15.\n287 Longmont 2255 N.
