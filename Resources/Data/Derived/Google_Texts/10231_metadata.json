Previously coverage ended for them at 21 when they left the system.\n\nThe www.coveredtil26.org website is designed for youth to learn about the new requirements and how they can apply.\n\nYouth who are involved in the foster care system tend to have higher health care needs due to child abuse and neglect experienced in early childhood, said Fatima Morales, Children Now policy and outreach associate. \"Generally, their health care needs tend to be higher than their peers.\"\n\nIn Vallejo, Cynthia Grady of New Beginnings, an organization which helps young adults after they \"age out\" of foster care, said the new federal provisions are beneficial.\n\nSome of her clients have asthma, bronchitis, dental and vision issues that they haven't been able to get treated because they no longer qualify for Medi-Cal, Grady said.\n\nTo help spread the word about the new foster care health coverage, New Beginnings is hosting an informational session 4-7 p.m. Saturday, March 22 at 1020 Colusa St. in Vallejo.\n\nYoung adults will be encouraged to hang out, enjoy some food and fun activities while also learn about the health coverage and other resources available to them.\n\nAfter they turn 21, foster care youth will not automatically qualify for the Medi-Cal extension but will need to apply for it, Grady and others said.\n\nSolano County Health and Human Services Director Ann Edwards said the health care extension will cost taxpayers more in Medi-Cal subsidies but it will save money over the long run by helping young adults stay healthy.\n\n\"It's a very good thing for kids in that transition period. It's even hard for kids when they have families and other resources. It's particularly difficult for foster youth who don't have family to fall back on,\" Edwards said.\n\nEdwards said her department will also be doing some outreach to help get the word out to former foster youth who have aged out of the system that they are eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nExact figures on the numbers of young adults who will be impacted by the new requirements were not available.\n\nMorales said California has an estimated 26,000 former foster youth between the ages of 21 and 26 who may qualify for Medi-Cal as a result of the extension of coverage to age 26.\n\nEach year in the state between 2,700 and 5,000 youth are emancipated or \"age out\" of the system when they turned 21, according to Children Now.\n\nFormer foster youth qualify for the Medi-Cal coverage until age 26 if they were in foster care in any state at age 18 or older, are younger than age 26, and live in California now.\n\nFor more details go to http://www.coveredtil26.org/.\n\nContact staff writer Sarah Rohrs at srohrs@timesheraldonline.com or (707) 553-6832.
