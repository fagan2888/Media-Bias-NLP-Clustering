Gala event at CNU honors supporters and volunteers; launches $300,000 matching gift campaign

Yorktown, VA, April 30, 2015-More than 275 supporters, volunteers and community leaders gathered at Christopher Newport University's David Student Union on Saturday, April 25, to celebrate Lackey Clinic's 20th Anniversary of giving quality medical care to low income and uninsured residents of Greater Williamsburg, James City County, York County and upper Newport News.

During the evening's program, Clinic founder Dr. Jim Shaw and volunteer Cris Wineinger announced a special LACKEY 20TH ANNIVERSARY CHALLENGE fund drive initiated by a small group of donors who have agreed to match new contributions received by June 30, 2015, dollar for dollar up to a total of $300,000.

Begun as a small Christian walk-in clinic operating out of a church Sunday school room, Lackey currently provides almost 1,600 patients with medical, dental, mental health and other health services in an expanded 10,000 sq. ft. facility completed in 2013. Its pharmacy annually dispenses prescription drugs with a retail cost of almost $9 million.

Totally funded by charitable foundations, area churches, corporate and individual donors, Lackey currently provides free care for people between ages 18 to 64 who are uninsured and who are not eligible for Medicaid or coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As Lackey Executive Director Carol Sale said, "Most of our patients are working two or three jobs to make ends meet and are ineligible for insurance, but don't qualify for coverage under current Medicaid programs."
