They started vomiting. The labor contractor in charge bypassed local hospitals and brought the crew to his own doctors 50 miles away in the town of Firebaugh. He simply trusted Marcia and Oscar Sablan more.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a lot of other cases,\u201d said Oscar Sablan, an internist, \u201cand so we were familiar with the symptoms and we knew what to do.\u201d\n\nThey had lots of atropine on hand, a drug used to treat poison victims if they go into respiratory or cardiac arrest. The farmworkers stripped and lined up to rinse the pesticides off in the clinic\u2019s shower, built just for this type of incident. But with so many patients, Oscar Sablan had to recruit help.\n\n\u201cThe firemen in town were able to get a kiddie pool and at least wash the people down,\u201d he said.\n\nFirebaugh is surrounded by crops, and the Sablans estimate that 75 percent of their patients work in the fields, like that labor contractor.\n\nMarcia Sablan, who specializes in family medicine, explained, \u201cHe knew he could come here. He knew that we would take care of him, so be brought those 29 people over here.\u201d\n\nPatients have relied on the Sablans and the Sablan Medical Clinic for more than 30 years, since the couple moved to Firebaugh as young physicians in the National Health Service Corps. They say they wanted to practice where they were needed.\n\nThis long-term commitment to a community makes the Sablans an exception. Rural regions of California have long faced a shortage of doctors, and in the San Joaquin Valley, studies show the number of primary care physicians per person is about half the state\u2019s average.\n\nRosie Gomez, a patient of the Sablans, said small towns nearby struggle to hang onto new doctors who come from outside the region.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019ve gained their skills, they leave and they take their skills with them,\u201d she said of these other doctors. \u201cThey\u2019ll practice on you, but they don\u2019t stay.\u201d\n\nBringing new doctors back home\n\nA new program, however, is making strides to attract and retain doctors in the state\u2019s rural communities. Often, these new doctors are coming home to the neighborhoods they grew up in. Called San Joaquin Valley Program in Medical Education, or PRIME, the program selects and trains medical students to practice in the Valley. It\u2019s a collaboration between UC Davis, UC Merced, and UCSF Fresno.\n\nAn hour away from Firebaugh in Fresno, five students medical students gather in a small exam room where a doctor teaches them how to give neurological exams. One of them is Christina Thabet, who grew up in Bakersfield. All of the students either hail from the Valley, or have ties to it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning on the population we want to work with in the future,\u201d Thabet said, during a break in training. \u201cYou can see our families in the eyes of our patients because they grew up here, and kind of had the same challenges that they have in health care that our families had.\u201d\n\nThabit remembers her grandfather, a dairy farmer, having a hard time getting appointments for cardiology and diabetes care. When he did, he had to drive over one hour, one way.\n\nMost days, Thabit is training at a Fresno hospital. Once a week, she travels to a clinic in the rural town of Selma, where she sees patients while being supervised by medical faculty. Thabet said she\u2019s working harder than she ever imagined, but she knows she chose the right program.\n\n\u201cThe clinical experience, the education and the fact that I\u2019m home, I mean, that\u2019s my ideal medical school,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no better fit for me.\u201d\n\nDoctors as integral members of community\n\nBack in Firebaugh, Dr. Marcia, as her patients call her, reviews X-rays with a woman who\u2019s worked in cantaloupe fields for three decades. The patient has chronic laryngitis \u2014 and no insurance. She\u2019ll probably have to wait a long time to get an appointment at a hospital in Fresno, so Dr. Marcia searches through drug company samples for a medication that can ease her symptoms until then.\n\nThe Sablans charge a low sliding fee and negotiate the Medi-Cal labyrinth. It\u2019s all part of a balancing act: making a living while caring for needy patients.\n\nIn another exam room, Dr. Oscar meets with 95-year-old Mareen Williams, who came to Firebaugh from Oklahoma in the 1930s and picked cotton and cut corn. Even though she moved away recently to be closer to family, she returns to the clinic to see Dr. Oscar.\n\n\u201cHe saved my life several times,\u201d Williams said.\n\nShe trusts Sablan with managing her complicated blood condition, and she won\u2019t see another doctor unless he makes the referral. The Sablans\u2019 relationships go beyond the clinic: the doctors make house calls, and know their patients as neighbors.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more like folks,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey come to your house. I used to give a big Easter egg hunt. They came out with their children.\u201d\n\nThe Sablans see health as more than medical care. That\u2019s why, besides putting in long hours at the clinic, Oscar has served on Firebaugh\u2019s school board close to 20 years, and Marcia has been on the city council over 30, working to improve housing, sewage and water systems.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been an overriding thing for me \u2013 the built environment [and] how important that is to people\u2019s health,\u201d she said.\n\nPatient Rosie Gomez said she can\u2019t picture Firebaugh without the Sablans practicing medicine, even though she knows some day it will happen. Both doctors are in their 60s.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re human just like we are,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cThey get older and they\u2019re going to want to retire one day and I can\u2019t blame them. But who replaces them?\u201d\n\nPRIME is working on this. Now in its third year, the program will continue to pick about six students for each new class. Administrators hope PRIME\u2019s success could be a stepping stone towards creating a full medical school in the Valley someday.\n\nThis won\u2019t solve the immediate physician shortage in San Joaquin Valley and other parts of rural California, but as Gomez said, each medical student could have a real impact on a community, like Firebaugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re humble people, but we have medical needs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd honestly, for some of these kids to have their light bulb go on and say, you know what? The Sablans made a difference. I can make a difference here, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patients have relied on the Sablans and the Sablan Medical Clinic for more than 30 years, since the couple moved to Firebaugh as young physicians in the", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Recruiting \\u2013 and Retaining \\u2013 Doctors in California\\u2019s San Joaquin Valley\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/09\\/20\\/recruiting-and-retaining-doctors-in-californias-san-joaquin-valley\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-20 16:37:37\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-09-20 16:38:43\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":15120,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Central Valley\",\"Latino Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/09\\/RS6388_P1030640-scr-e1379719976264.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Patients have relied on the Sablans and the Sablan Medical Clinic for more than 30 years, since the couple moved to Firebaugh as young physicians in the National Health Service Corps.
