With the project\u2019s completion came study upon study analyzing DNA for genetic risk factors for disease, from cancer to STDs. Scientists have adamantly studied DNA with the hope of finding more about how autism, a condition that affects one in 88 kids, develops.\n\nNow, a new project from advocacy group Autism Speaks called MSSNG, and pronounced \u201cmissing,\u201d is pushing to incorporate the DNA sequences of 10,000 families affected by autism into an open source Google Cloud. In doing so, the data would be available to scientists around the world who study autism. \u201cTen-thousand families; that\u2019s at least 40,000 DNA samples, or so,\u201d the project\u2019s director Steve Scherer said in a video. \u201cWe\u2019re embarking on this already, we\u2019ve done roughly 1,000 families. The data that\u2019s starting to come back is exciting; it\u2019s telling us things that we didn\u2019t know earlier. And we think once we get into the tens of thousands of numbers it\u2019s going to really unveil the genetic factors we\u2019ve been searching for for many years.\u201d\n\nPart of the project involves the beautiful images in the video below, which were created by artist and biochemist Linden Gledhill. Believe it or not, those images are of DNA \u2014 the larger molecular structure, not the atomic structure \u2014 mixed with water and placed between two glass slides. As the water evaporates, the DNA crystallizes, and with the help of polarized light and a microscope, the colors you see emerge. By sharing this art, Gledhill hopes he can spread awareness of autism.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colorful, beauty, liquid, dna, crystallizing, raising, awareness, mssng, project, autism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Seeing liquid DNA crystallize is a colorfully beautiful sight.", "title": "The Colorful Beauty Of Liquid DNA Crystallizing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorful-beauty-liquid-dna-crystallizing-raising-awareness-mssng-project-autism-314344", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/14/dna.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seeing liquid DNA crystallize is a colorfully beautiful sight.", "title": "The Colorful Beauty Of Liquid DNA Crystallizing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorful-beauty-liquid-dna-crystallizing-raising-awareness-mssng-project-autism-314344", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/14/dna.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/14/dna.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-14T16:05:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-14T16:20:33-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Seeing liquid DNA crystallize is a colorfully beautiful sight."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddba4\"", "article_summary": "In doing so, the data would be available to scientists around the world who study autism.\nNow, a new project from advocacy group Autism Speaks called MSSNG, and pronounced \u201cmissing,\u201d is pushing to incorporate the DNA sequences of 10,000 families affected by autism into an open source Google Cloud.\nWith the project\u2019s completion came study upon study analyzing DNA for genetic risk factors for disease, from cancer to STDs.\nBy sharing this art, Gledhill hopes he can spread awareness of autism.\nScientists have adamantly studied DNA with the hope of finding more about how autism, a condition that affects one in 88 kids, develops."}
